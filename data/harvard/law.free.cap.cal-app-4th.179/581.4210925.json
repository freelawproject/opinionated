J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARS\">Plaintiff and appellant Robert Davis (Davis) appeals a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining without leave to amend of a demurrer interposed by defendant and appellant Ford Motor Credit Company LLC (Ford) to Davis\u2019s original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Ford also appeals, seeking review of a postjudgment order denying its motion for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">This litigation relates to Ford\u2019s billing practices under a retail installment sales contract. Ford\u2019s practice is to apply a customer\u2019s payment to an earlier missed installment, rather than to the current month\u2019s installment. As a result, the current month\u2019s installment is unpaid, triggering a new late fee for the current month. Davis\u2019s theory is that these successive late fees are prohibited by the Rees-Levering Motor Vehicle Sales and Finance Act (Rees-Levering) (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2981 et seq., 2982, subd. (k)), and are actionable under the unfair competition law (UCL) (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.) (hereafter, section 17200) and under the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1750 et seq., 1770, subd. (a)(14)).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">We conclude the alleged conduct of Ford in charging successive late fees for successive late payments does not violate Civil Code section 2982, subdivision (k)\u2019s prohibition on charging more than one late fee per delinquent installment. For example, if an ontime payment received during the month of April is allocated to March because the March payment was missed, the result of allocating said payment to March is that the April payment was missed, so as to trigger a new late fee for the month of April. Under those circumstances, the consumer has not been charged more than one late fee for the missed March payment. Rather, the first late fee is for the payment missed in March, and the second late fee represents the payment missed in April. Because Davis failed to allege a statutory violation under Rees-Levering, he has failed to allege Ford\u2019s billing practice is <em>unlawful </em>under the UCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">We further conclude Davis cannot allege Ford\u2019s billing practice is an <em>unfair </em>business practice within the meaning of the UCL. Guided by <em>Camacho </em>v. <em>Automobile Club of Southern California </em>(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1394 [48 Cal.Rptr.3d 770] <em>(Camacho), </em>which clarified the definition of \u201cunfair\u201d within the meaning of the UCL, we hold Davis cannot allege an unfair business practice because the alleged injury is one he reasonably could have avoided. (142 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1403, 1406.) Simply stated, Davis could have avoided the imposition of successive late fees for successive months by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>mating his monthly payments timely, or within the 10-day grace period, in accordance with his obligations under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Although Ford was the prevailing party, it cannot recover its attorney fees pursuant to Rees-Levering\u2019s reciprocal attorney fee provision (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2983.4) because the alleged Rees-Levering violation was merely a predicate to the UCL claims, and a prevailing defendant cannot recover attorney fees under the UCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Therefore, the judgment of dismissal, as well as the postjudgment order denying Ford\u2019s motion for attorney fees, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">1. <em>The complaint; pertinent allegations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">On November 8, 2006, Davis, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, filed suit against Ford alleging as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">In February 2004, Davis entered into a retail installment sales contract with Worthington Ford, Inc. (the dealer), for the purchase of a 2002 Ford Taurus for personal and family purposes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The dealer sold and assigned said retail installment sales contract to Ford.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">Under the contract, Davis was required to make periodic installment payments in a specific preset amount for the life of the contract. For each installment that was in default for a period of not less than 10 days, Ford was entitled to assess a delinquency charge in an amount not to exceed 5 percent of the delinquent installment, which amount may be collected only once on any installment, regardless of the period during which it remains in default. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2982, subd. (k).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">Ford \u201capplied certain of [Davis\u2019s] regular on-time installment payments against past due installments to trigger multiple late charges where there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>only one late payment, and has engaged and continues to engage in the same practice with respect to the members of the Class.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Based on these allegations, Davis sought to plead the following six causes of action:</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">(1) Violation of the CLRA, specifically, Civil Code section 1770, subdivision (a)(14), based on Ford\u2019s representation that it is entitled to apply ontime monthly installments against prior outstanding installments so as to trigger multiple late payments and multiple late fees, contrary to the letter and spirit of the retail installment sales contracts which permit only one late fee per late installment payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">(2) Violation of Rees-Levering (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2982, subd. (k)), so as to constitute an unlawful business practice under the UCL. (\u00a7 17200.)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">(3) Violation of the CLRA (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1770, subd. (a)(14)), so as to constitute an unlawful business practice under the UCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">(4) Unlawful and unfair business practice within the meaning of the UCL, in that Ford\u2019s billing practices cause consumer injury by the assessment of late charges far in excess of the amounts actually expended by Ford to collect its accounts; consumers cannot reasonably avoid the injury which flows from Ford\u2019s practice because Ford\u2019s interpretation is not apparent on the face of the contracts and consumers cannot shop around in advance to avoid this undisclosed interpretation; there are no countervailing benefits to consumers or competition from Ford\u2019s practice; Ford\u2019s practice systematically breaches the contracts of plaintiffs and violates the letter and spirit of and has the same effect as a violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act, title 15 United States Code section 45; and Ford\u2019s practice violates the letter and spirit of, and has the same effect as, a violation of Rees-Levering, Civil Code section 2982, subdivision (k).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">(5) Unfair and deceptive business practices within the meaning of the UCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">(6) Money had and received and unjust enrichment based on the unwarranted late charges.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">2. <em>Ford\u2019s demurrer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">Ford demurred to the complaint in its entirety, asserting no cause of action was stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>By way of background, the contract stated in pertinent part: \u201cHow we will apply payments. We may apply each payment to the earned and unpaid part of the Finance Charge, to the unpaid part of the Amount Financed and to other amounts you owe under this contract <em>in any order we choose.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Ford argued, inter alia, Rees-Levering did not prohibit its exercise of its contractual right to allocate payments it receives to the oldest outstanding installment and charging a late fee if, as a result, the current installment is not paid timely. \u201c[Civil Code section 2982, subdivision (k)] bans assessment of multiple charges for a single late installment. It does not dictate how a creditor must allocate a payment received when two or more installments are due and unpaid. It does not prohibit [Ford\u2019s] practice of attributing payments to the oldest outstanding installment. [][] Since [Ford] may allocate a payment to the oldest outstanding installment, its imposition of late fees is also in keeping with [the statute], [Ford] charges only one late fee on any one installment. When multiple installments are due, each new payment is allocated to the oldest installment. If doing so leaves a newer installment unpaid, a late fee is assessed for that installment, but only one fee is assessed for any one installment.\u201d Ford emphasized, \u201c[h]ad the Legislature intended to prohibit [Ford\u2019s] practice, it could and would have done so expressly, as it did in Civil Code section 2954.4 governing late fees on home mortgage loans. Section 2982(k) contains no similar language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Ford further contended its practice did not violate the UCL, and that no claim was stated for violation of the CLRA because its representations were truthful, and further, Civil Code section 1770, subdivision (a)(14) was intended to proscribe presale misrepresentations, such as false advertising, not postsale, postdefault exercises of creditors\u2019 remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">3. <em>Davis\u2019s opposition to the demurrer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">In opposition, Davis asserted, inter alia, <em>\u201c[Ford] is correct that [Civil Code section 2982, subdivision (k)] does not specify how monthly installment payments may be applied </em>and plaintiff does not, as [Ford] argues, claim that section 2982(k) requires any particular allocation of payments between principal and interest. . . . <em>[Ford] can allocate an on-time April payment against a missing March payment, for example, </em>applying the April payment to the outstanding interest from both the March and April payments and the remainder to unpaid principal under section 2982(k). What defendant <em>cannot </em>do is then trigger a second late fee, since the only installment missed was March.\u201d (Some italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>4. <em>Trial court\u2019s ruling.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">On June 26, 2007, the matter was argued and taken under submission. On September 24, 2007, the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, and set forth its rationale in an extensive written ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In essence, the trial court held: Civil Code section 2982, subdivision (k), permits a penalty to be charged for \u201ceach installment in default for a period of not less than 10 days.\u201d In the hypothetical pled in the complaint, when the consumer skips the September payment and makes an ontime installment payment in October, Ford is entitled to apply the October payment to the September delinquency. As a consequence, the September delinquency is satisfied but the installment due for October is late. Thus, Ford is entitled to impose a late charge for the October installment, which installment is in default. In this situation, the consumer is not being charged more than one delinquency charge on a late installment\u2014one late fee is charged for the September installment and the second late fee is charged for the October installment, which installment is late as a consequence of the October payment having been applied to September.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The trial court concluded, \u201cthe Rees-Levering Act does not preclude the conduct alleged in the Complaint. Insofar as the UCL and CLRA causes of action are premised on a violation of the Rees-Levering Act, these causes of action fail as well. Insofar as Plaintiff seeks to characterize [Ford\u2019s] practices alleged in the Complaint as unfair or as unfair trade practices, these claims fail because, although the California Legislature has comprehensively regulated lender practices in the area of automobile installment loans, the Legislature has not seen fit to proscribe the practices alleged in the Complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">On November 5, 2007, the trial court entered a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of Ford\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend. On November 16, 2007, Davis filed notice of appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">5. <em>Subsequent proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">On November 19, 2007, Ford filed a motion for an award of $29,723.50 in attorney fees. Ford sought attorney fees pursuant to Rees-Levering, specifically, Civil Code section 2983.4, which provides for an award of reasonable attorney fees \u201cto the prevailing party in any action on a contract or purchase order subject to the provisions of this chapter regardless of whether the action is instituted by the seller, holder or buyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>In opposition, Davis contended the action was not an \u201caction on a contract or purchase order subject to the [provisions of Rees-Levering].\u201d Rather, the second cause of action, which alleged a violation of Rees-Levering, was merely using that statute as the predicate for a claim under the UCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Davis further argued the attorney fee provision of Rees-Levering does not apply when a plaintiff primarily pleads causes of action under other consumer protection statutes that allow fee awards only to prevailing plaintiffs, and that under the UCL and CLRA only a prevailing party may obtain an award of attorney fees in the absence of litigation abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">On December 18, 2007, the matter came on for hearing. The trial court denied Ford\u2019s motion for attorney fees, stating: \u201cHere, the plaintiff was not seeking to enforce his contract with defendant. Rather, he was seeking a remedy on the basis that the contract violated the law and should be avoided and that he should recover remedies for defendant\u2019s violation of law. [][] So in my judgment the attorneys\u2019 fees provision does not apply . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">On February 7, 2008, Ford filed a timely notice of appeal from the postjudgment order denying its motion for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Davis contends: the second cause of action under the UCL is properly predicated on a violation of Rees-Levering; Ford\u2019s late payment accounting practice violates Rees-Levering and therefore is illegal under the UCL; alternatively, Ford\u2019s practice violates the unfairness prong of the UCL; and Ford\u2019s conduct is independently actionable under the CLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">Ford urges affirmance of the judgment of dismissal and contends the trial court erred in denying its motion for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AUV\">I. DAVIS\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">1. <em>Standard of appellate review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">On review of a demurrer, in addition to the allegations of the complaint, we may consider other relevant matters which are properly the subject of judicial notice and we may treat such matters as having been pleaded. We therefore treat the retail installment sales contract as having been pled in its entirety. <em>(City of Hawthorne ex rel. Wohlner v. H&amp;C Disposal Co. </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1668, 1678 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 312]; <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>v. <em>Superior </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number><em>Court </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 524, 538 [260 Cal.Rptr. 713]; <em>Marina Tenants Assn. v. Deauville Marina Development Co. </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 122, 128, 132 [226 Cal.Rptr. 321].)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">In determining whether a plaintiff has properly stated a claim for relief, \u201cour standard of review is clear: ' \u201cWe treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. [Citation.] We also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.\u201d [Citation.] Further, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context. [Citation.] When a demurrer is sustained, we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. [Citation.] And when it is sustained without leave to amend, we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment: if it can be, the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse; if not, there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm. [Citations.] The burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Zelig </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1126 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 709, 45 P.3d 1171].) Our review is de novo. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">2. <em>The alleged conduct of Ford in charging successive late fees for successive months does not violate Civil Code section 2982, subdivision (k)\u2019s prohibition on charging more than one late fee per delinquent installment; therefore Davis cannot predicate his UCL claim of an unlawful practice on a violation of Rees-Levering.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">a. <em>The result of allocating a current payment to an earlier missed installment is that the current installment is unpaid, triggering a new late fee for the current month; said practice is not barred by Rees-Levering.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The contract provides in pertinent part: \u201cHow we will apply payments. We may apply each payment to the earned and unpaid part of the Finance Charge, to the unpaid part of the Amount Financed and to other amounts you owe under this contract <em>in any order we </em>choose.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Ford\u2019s practice is to attribute a customer\u2019s payments to the oldest outstanding installment. As a result, if a payment is received on time during the current cycle, but the payment is attributed to an earlier missed installment, the current installment becomes past due, triggering a late fee for the current cycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Davis contends this billing practice contravenes Civil Code section 2982, subdivision (k), which states in relevant part: \u201cThe contract may provide that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>for each installment in default for a period of not less than 10 days the buyer shall pay a delinquency charge in an amount not to exceed in the aggregate 5 percent of the delinquent installment, <em>which amount may be collected only once on any installment regardless of the period during which it remains in </em>default.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Davis acknowledges the statute does not specify how monthly installment payments may be applied, and Davis does not contend the statute requires any particular allocation of payments between principal and interest. Davis concedes \u201c[Ford] can allocate an on-time April payment against a missing March payment, for example, applying the April payment to the outstanding interest from both the March and April payments and the remainder to unpaid principal under section 2982(k).\u201d Davis asserts \u201cWhat [Ford] <em>cannot </em>do is then trigger a second late fee, since the only installment missed was March. There have not been any other installments \u2018in default.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Davis\u2019s argument does not withstand scrutiny. If an ontime payment received during the month of April is allocated to March because the March payment was missed, the result of allocating said payment to March is that the April payment was missed, so as to trigger a new late fee for the month of April. Under those circumstances, the consumer has not been charged more than one late fee for the missed March payment. Rather, the first late fee is for the payment missed in March, and the second late fee represents the payment missed in April.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s analysis in this regard and reiterate its ruling as follows: \u201cAs [Ford] points out, however, under the hypothetical pleaded by way of example in the Complaint, the first penalty is for a payment missed in September, and the second penalty is for a payment missed in October. When the consumer makes one payment in October, but does not bring the contract payments current by making up the September missed payment, the Rees-Levering Act does not preclude the automobile finance creditor from applying the October payment to the September delinquency.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">\u201cPlaintiff concedes that the Rees-Levering Act permits the automobile finance creditor to apply the October payment to the September delinquency for purposes of interest calculation. . . . Plaintiff affirms that he \u2018does <em>not </em>challenge the <em>way </em>[Ford] applies payments under section 2982(k).\u2019 ... He does not seek to void the contract provision stating that [Ford] \u2018may apply each payment to the earned and unearned part of the Finance Charge [interest], to the unpaid part of the Amount Financed [principal] and to other amounts you owe under this section in any order we choose.\u2019 . . . Plaintiff does not proffer a convincing argument for construing the statute to permit application of the October payment (in the hypothetical) to satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>September delinquency for purposes of calculation of interest, but not for purposes of calculating penalties.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\">\u201cThe statutory language . . . permits a penalty to be charged for \u2018each installment in default for a period of not less than 10 days . . . .\u2019 (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2982(k).) In the hypothetical, when the consumer makes only one installment payment in October, he has satisfied the September delinquency but is late in making the October payment. [Ford] is permitted to apply the October payment to the September delinquency. Thus a late charge can be imposed for the October installment, which is in default.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">We conclude Davis has failed to allege Ford\u2019s practice of attributing a current payment to an earlier missed installment, so as to trigger a late fee for the current installment, violates Rees-Levering. Therefore, Davis has failed to allege an unlawful practice under the UCL predicated on a violation of Rees-Levering.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The vice which Civil Code section 2982, subdivision (k) eliminates is the practice of \u201cpyramiding\u201d of late charges. \u201cBy limiting the holder to one charge for each overdue installment, no matter how long it is overdue, the practice of pyramiding is eliminated.\u201d (Project, <em>Legislative Regulation of Retail Installment Financing </em>(1960) 7 UCLA L.Rev. 623, 699.) An illustration of the practice of pyramiding of late charges is as follows; \u201cAssume a monthly payment of $10, with a late charge of 5 per cent of the installment a month. In the first month, the failure to pay will result in a late charge of fifty cents. In the second month, a new payment is late, and an additional fifty cents is charged, but the first payment is now overdue an additional month, and a second fifty cents is charged for that. The buyer now owes $1.50 in late charges. While this may not seem unreasonable, if the installment is not paid up by the sixth month, the late charges for the delinquencies will amount to 100 per cent of the installment. Thereafter, the charges continue to increase. If the buyer now resumes his monthly payments of $10, they will be attributed to the delinquency charges and not to the unpaid balance of the obligation. Not only will the buyer never catch up, but he will continue to lose ground because the delinquency charge for each additional month becomes far in excess of the $10 he is paying.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 698.)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Here, Ford\u2019s practice of attributing a payment to a previous missed installment, rather than to the current month, has the effect of leaving the current installment unpaid, so as to trigger a new late fee for the current month. However, irrespective of how long an installment is overdue, the consumer is assessed only a single late charge for each overdue installment, in compliance with Civil Code section 2982, subdivision (k). Simply stated, Davis\u2019s allegations are not within the scope of the harm which the statute sought to address.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>b. <em>Davis\u2019s argument is more appropriately addressed to the Legislature.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">By way of comparison, Civil Code section 2954.4, subdivision (b), relating to mortgages, states in relevant part: \u201cA late charge may not be imposed on any installment which is paid or tendered in full on or before its due date, or within 10 days thereafter, even though an earlier installment or installments, or any late charge thereon, may not have been paid in full when due. <em>For the purposes of determining whether late charges may be imposed, any payment tendered by the borrower shall be applied by the lender to the most recent installment due.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Thus, as the trial court observed, \u201cif the hypothetical set forth in the Complaint is translated to a home loan context, the creditor would be required to apply the payment made in October to the October installment, precluding a late charge in October. It appears, then, that when the Legislature intends the result the Plaintiff seeks here, the Legislature expressly provides for that result. Restrictions that are legislated for other consumer installment loan contexts should not be read into the Rees-Levering Act. Plaintiff argues that Civil Code section 2954.4 was enacted after the ReesLevering Act, and that the Legislature simply was more complete in section 2954.4. But the Rees-Levering Act was amended frequently after enactment of Civil Code section 2954.4, and the Legislature has not seen fit to add to the Act the restriction adopted in the home loan context.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">3. <em>Davis cannot allege an unfair practice under the UCL.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">In a backup argument, Davis contends that even if Rees-Levering (Civ.

A <em>third approach; </em>Camacho\u2019s <em>clarification of the definition of \u201cunfair\u201d in consumer cases.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"><em>Camacho, supra, </em>142 Cal.App.4th 1394, contains an excellent analysis of the issue and we adopt its definition of \u201cunfair\u201d in consumer cases. <em>Camacho </em>states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">\u201cThe question is whether <em>Cel-Tech\u2019s </em>definition of \u2018unfair\u2019 overrules appellate court opinions that use other definitions. We think that it does. Definitions that are too amorphous in the context of anticompetitive practices are not converted into satisfactorily precise tests in consumer cases. This squares with the fact that, in disapproving appellate court opinions defining \u2018unfair\u2019 in \u2018amorphous\u2019 terms, the Supreme Court did not hold that the old definitions were appropriate in consumer cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">\u201cWe do not think, however, that this means that the finding, in a consumer case, that the practice is unfair must be \u2018 \u201ctethered\u201d to specific constitutional, statutory or regulatory provisions,\u2019 as one Court of Appeal has put it. <em>(Gregory v. Albertson\u2019s, Inc., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th at p. 854 . . . .) In other words, we do not think that <em>Cel-Tech\u2019s </em>definition of \u2018unfair\u2019 in cases involving anticompetitive practices applies to consumer cases. [][] There are two reasons for this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">\u201cFirst, \u2018tethering\u2019 a finding of unfairness to \u2018specific constitutional, statutory or regulatory provisions\u2019 does not comport with the broad scope of section 17200. \u2018Tethering\u2019 the concept of unfairness to existing positive law undercuts the principle that a practice is prohibited as \u2018unfair\u2019 or \u2018deceptive,\u2019 even if it is not \u2018unlawful\u2019 or vice versa. <em>(Cel-Tech, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 180.) As our Supreme Court has put it, the courts need to deal with innumerable new schemes that the fertility of man\u2019s invention can contrive <em>(Barquis v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>Merchants Collection Assn. </em>[(1972)] 7 Cal.3d [94,] 112 [101 Cal.Rptr. 745, 496 P.2d 817]); in the context of consumer cases, \u2018tethering\u2019 to positive law undercuts the ability of the courts to deal with new situations, and new abuses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">\u201cSecond, anticompetitive conduct is best defined in terms of the policy and spirit of antitrust laws; the same cannot be said of a business practice that is \u2018unfair\u2019 or \u2018deceptive\u2019 in the terms of section 17200. That is, cases involving anticompetitive conduct move in a far smaller, and more clearly defined, universe than unfair or deceptive business practices. It is therefore possible to \u2018tether\u2019 anticompetitive conduct to the antitrust laws, while the universe of laws and/or regulations that bear on unfair practices is so varied that it is not possible to achieve a consensus which of these laws and regulations might apply to define an unfair practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\"><em>\u201cCel-Tech </em>itself holds the key to the definition of \u2018unfair\u2019 in consumer cases. <em>Cel-Tech </em>holds that \u2018we may turn for guidance to the jurisprudence\u2019 arising under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. <em>(Cel-Tech, supra, 20 </em>Cal.4th at p. 185.) Since 1980, the factors that define unfairness under section 5 are: (1) The consumer injury must be substantial; (2) the injury must not be outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or competition; and (3) it must be an injury that consumers themselves could not reasonably have avoided. <em>(Orkin Exterminating Co. v. F.T.C. </em>(11th Cir. 1988) 849 F.2d 1354, 1364.) These factors have now been codified in title 15 United States Code section 45(n)[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] <em>This definition of \u2018unfair\u2019 is on its face geared to consumers and is for that reason appropriate in consumer cases. </em>It is also suitably broad and is therefore in keeping with the \u2018sweeping\u2019 nature of section 17200. We will refer to this as the \u2018section 5 test.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Camacho, supra, </em>142 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1402-1403, italics added, fns. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">c. <em>Davis cannot allege unfairness under the section 5 test for unfairness in a consumer case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">To reiterate, the factors that define unfairness under the Federal Trade Commission Act section 5 test (section 5 test) are: (1) the consumer injury must be substantial; (2) the injury must not be outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or competition; and (3) it must be an injury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>consumers themselves could not reasonably have avoided. <em>(Camacho, </em>supra, 142 Cal.App.4th at p. 1403.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">In Camacho, with regard to the third prong of the section 5 test, the appellate court held \u201cthe \u2018injury\u2019 in this case is one that [the plaintiff] could have reasonably avoided by complying with the law and obtaining insurance. Thus, even if there is some theory under which [the plaintiff] can claim that he was \u2018injured,\u2019 the fact is that he could have avoided any and all action taken by defendants by obtaining and carrying insurance, as the law requires.\u201d <em>(Camacho, supra, </em>142 Cal.App.4th at p. 1406.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In the instant case, the alleged injury here, namely, the imposition of successive late fees for successive months, reasonably could have been avoided had Davis made his monthly payments timely, or within the 10-day grace period, in accordance with his obligations under the contract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Because Davis reasonably could have avoided the alleged injury, it is unnecessary to address the other elements of the section 5 test. We conclude Davis has not stated, and cannot state, a claim under the unfairness prong of the UCL. (\u00a7 17200.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">4. <em>Davis failed to state cause of action under the CLRA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Finally, Davis contends Ford\u2019s conduct is independently actionable under the CLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">In his first cause of action, Davis sought to allege a violation of the CLRA, specifically, Civil Code section 1770, subdivision (a)(14), based on Ford\u2019s representation it is entitled to apply ontime monthly payments against prior outstanding installments so as to trigger multiple late payments and multiple late fees, contrary to the letter and spirit of the retail installment sales contracts which permit only one late fee per late installment payment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>However, as discussed above, what Ford represented to Davis was correct, not a misrepresentation. Ford was entitled under the retail installment sale contract to allocate payments to the oldest outstanding installment and to assess a late fee on the late installment payments. In doing so, Ford did not violate Civil Code section 2982, subdivision (k), because Ford did not impose more than one late fee on any installment\u2014the successive late fees were imposed for successive late installments.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Accordingly, Ford did not misrepresent any \u201crights, remedies, or obligations.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1770, subd. (a)(14).) We conclude the CLRA claim was not well pled.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">II. FORD\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">\n<em>The complaint sought to allege a violation of the UCL, predicated on a violation of Rees-Levering, as opposed to a claim under Rees-Levering; Ford cannot recover fees because the UCL precludes a fee award to a prevailing defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">a. <em>Overview.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Ford based its motion for attorney fees on Rees-Levering\u2019s attorney fee provision, which states in relevant part: \u201cReasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs shall be awarded to the prevailing party <em>in any action on a contract or purchase order subject to the provisions of this chapter </em>regardless of whether the action is instituted by the seller, holder or buyer.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2983.4, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">The trial court denied the attorney fee motion on the ground Davis was not seeking to enforce the contract, but rather, was \u201cwas seeking a remedy on the basis that the contract violated the law and should be avoided . . . .\u201d We uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling because it is correct in result, irrespective of the trial court\u2019s rationale. <em>(D\u2019Amico v. Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 19 [112 Cal.Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10].)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">Turning to the allegations of the complaint, the second cause of action states in relevant part: \u201c34. As a result of [Ford\u2019s] practice ... of allocating consumers\u2019 on-time monthly installment payments against previous missed payments to trigger multiple late charges, [Ford] ha[s] violated the Rees-Levering Act, Civ. Code \u00a7 2982(k). [][] 35. <em>These acts and business practices, therefore, are unlawful business practices within the meaning of.. . sections 17200 et </em>seq.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">Similarly, in the fourth cause of action, Davis pled Ford\u2019s violation of Rees-Levering was an <em>unfair business practice </em>within the meaning of section 17200 of the UCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Thus, the pleading alleged a violation of Rees-Levering merely as the predicate to the claim Ford engaged in unlawful or unfair business practices within the meaning of the UCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The issue presented is whether these allegations by Davis entitle Ford, as the prevailing defendant, to recover its attorney fees pursuant to Rees-Levering.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">b. <em>General principles; a prevailing defendant in a suit under the UCL cannot recover attorney fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">By way of background, the UCL does not provide for attorney fees, and relief is generally limited to injunctive relief and restitution. <em>(Cel-Tech, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 179.) \u201cIf a plaintiff prevails in an unfair competition law claim, it may seek attorney fees as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. <em>There is no provision for such a right for a successful </em>defendant.\u201d <em>(Walker </em>v. <em>Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1158, 1179 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 79], italics added <em>(Walker))</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Thus, \u201cwhere a plaintiff sues solely under the unfair competition law, fees may not be recovered by a prevailing defendant. But if a plaintiff does not bring suit solely under the unfair competition law, the trial court has discretion to apportion fees to claims not brought pursuant to that law\u2014as long as those claims authorize attorney fees awards.\u201d <em>(Walker, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at p. 1180.)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">c. <em>Rees-Levering\u2019s reciprocal fee provision is inapplicable when an alleged Rees-Levering violation is merely a predicate to a UCL claim; the public policy underlying the UCL must prevail over the reciprocal fee provision of Rees-Levering.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\"><em>Brown v. West Covina Toyota </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 555 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 85] <em>(Brown) </em>involved a similar conflict between two statutory schemes. There, the plaintiffs bought a used car from the defendants pursuant to a written contract. After the plaintiffs found defects in the car and learned it had been in an accident prior to their purchase, they sued the defendants under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (Song-Beverly) (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1790 et seq.), commonly known as the automobile \u201clemon law.\u201d After the trial court directed a verdict in the defendants\u2019 favor, the defendants successfully moved for an award of attorney fees and costs pursuant to Rees-Levering (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2983.4), on the theory that the underlying transaction giving rise to the lawsuit involved the sale of a vehicle under a contract which was subject to the provisions of Rees-Levering. <em>(Brown, supra, </em>26 Cal.App.4th at pp. 557-559.)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>\u201cThe <em>Brown </em>court thus confronted a situation where plaintiffs alleged defendants violated the Song-Beverly Act, in a case in which the vehicle was purchased pursuant to a conditional sales contract subject to the Rees-Levering Act. Because only the Rees-Levering Act permitted a prevailing defendant to recover costs and attorney fees, the court was faced with reconciling the two sets of laws. To resolve the conflict, the court reasoned that to permit a prevailing defendant to invoke the fee-shifting provisions of the Rees-Levering Act in that case \u2018would effectively nullify the one-sided fee-shifting under Song-Beverly whenever a plaintiff sues to enforce a breach of warranty claim under Song-Beverly, but happens to have purchased the automobile under a conditional sale contract.\u2019 <em>(Brown, supra, </em>26 Cal.App.4th at p. 565.) The <em>Brown </em>court then invoked the \u2018 \u201ccardinal rule of statutory construction that statutes relating to the same subject matter are to be read together and reconciled whenever possible to avoid nullification of one statute by another.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] Accordingly, the <em>[Brown] </em>court rejected defendants\u2019 contention the Rees-Levering Act should apply; rather, applying the Song-Beverly Act, the court concluded defendants were not entitled to costs or attorney fees.\u201d <em>(Murillo v. Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 985, 995 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 682, 953 P.2d 858] <em>(Murillo).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Here, as in <em>Brown, </em>although the underlying transaction was subject to the provisions of Rees-Levering, the action was not prosecuted under Rees-Levering. Davis did not sue directly under Rees-Levering\u2014rather, the alleged Rees-Levering violation was merely a predicate to the complaint\u2019s UCL claims. We hold Rees-Levering\u2019s reciprocal fee provision is inapplicable when an alleged Rees-Levering violation is merely a predicate to a UCL claim, in that the public policy underlying the UCL must prevail over the reciprocal fee provision of Rees-Levering. Therefore, Ford was not entitled to recover attorney fees pursuant to Rees-Levering\u2019s attorney fees provision (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2983.4).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The judgment of dismissal, and the postjudgment order denying Ford\u2019s motion for attorney fees, are affirmed.

Davis subsequently appended a copy of the contract to his opposition to Ford\u2019s demurrer and requested judicial notice of the contract. In reviewing the sufficiency of the pleading, we treat the contract as having been pled. (See Discussion, I. Davis\u2019s Appeal, pt. 1, <em>post.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b511-14\"> Civil Code section 2982 states in relevant part at subdivision (k): \u201cThe contract may provide that for each installment in default for a period of not less than 10 days the buyer shall pay a delinquency charge in an amount not to exceed in the aggregate 5 percent of the delinquent installment, <em>which amount may be collected only once on any installment regardless of the period during which it remains in </em>default.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b512-13\"> Davis is not pursuing all these theories on appeal. The Discussion, <em>post, </em>is confined to the contentions raised by Davis in his opening brief on appeal.

So, even if Davis did not know at the outset of his contract that [Ford] would allocate his payments to the oldest outstanding installment, he could have learned that fact by examining his monthly statement the month after he first skipped a payment\u2014and he could thereafter have avoided further late fees by simply paying as agreed.\u201d Davis does not deny that Ford sent him monthly statements indicating the imposition of a late fee and the amount that was due.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b524-12\"> Civil Code section 1770 states in relevant part: \u201c(a) The following unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer are unlawful: [ft| ...
