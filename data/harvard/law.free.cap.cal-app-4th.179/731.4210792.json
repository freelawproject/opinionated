J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFf\">The tragic loss of life in this case illustrates the danger that faces law enforcement officers every day, even during what on the surface appear to be routine encounters.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">Defendant Gregory Fred Zielesch bailed Brendt Volarvich out of jail and asked that, in return, Volarvich kill Doug Shamberger, who had been sleeping with defendant\u2019s wife. Volarvich agreed but needed a \u201cpiece\u201d to carry out the hit. Defendant provided Volarvich with a .357 magnum revolver and $400 to purchase some methamphetamine. The next day, while driving back to defendant\u2019s house, Volarvich was stopped by California Highway Patrol Officer Andrew Stevens for a traffic violation. High on methamphetamine and afraid of being sent back to jail, Volarvich shot and killed Officer Stevens with defendant\u2019s gun when the officer walked up to the driver\u2019s window and greeted Volarvich with a friendly, \u201cHow are you doing today?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">Defendant was convicted of the first degree murder of Officer Stevens, conspiracy to commit the murder of Doug Shamberger, and other offenses and enhancements not relevant to the issues raised on appeal. He was sentenced to state prison for an indeterminate term of 50 years to life (two consecutive terms of 25 years to life), plus a consecutive determinate term of seven years. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">In the published parts of this opinion, we reject defendant\u2019s contentions that his murder conviction must be reversed because the shooting of Officer Stevens was not in furtherance of the conspiracy to kill Shamberger and \u201cwas both unforeseen and unforeseeable,\u201d and that the entire judgment must be reversed because he was denied his right to a fair trial when the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>allowed courtroom spectators to wear buttons displaying a color photograph of Officer Stevens for six days at the start of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">As we will explain, when defendant bargained for the assassin\u2019s services and armed him with a gun and money to buy methamphetamine, defendant knew that the assassin had an unstable personality, with the \u201cmentality\u201d to kill someone other than the intended victim of the assassination. Defendant also knew that the assassin had just been released from jail, was on searchable probation, and would not want to be returned to custody if a law enforcement officer found the assassin in possession of methamphetamine and defendant\u2019s gun. From these facts, jurors reasonably could conclude the coldblooded murder of Officer Stevens was a natural and probable consequence of the conspiracy to kill Shamberger because a reasonable person, knowing what defendant knew, would recognize that if the unstable, methamphetamine using, and armed assassin detained by a law enforcement officer before the assassination was completed, it was likely that he would kill the officer to avoid arrest and complete his mission.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">And it is an insult to the intelligence and integrity of jurors to suggest that, despite the judge\u2019s admonition not to be influenced by buttons worn by some of the courtroom spectators, the jurors would have been so influenced by the buttons that they would be unable to base their verdict solely on evidence presented at trial. Nothing about the buttons was coercive or intimidating, and we have no doubt that the verdicts would have been the same if the trial court had not allowed the spectators to wear the buttons during the first six days of this eight-week trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">In the unpublished parts of our opinion, we reject defendant\u2019s other claims of reversible error. Consequently, we shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">On the afternoon of November 17, 2005, Officer Stevens stopped Volarvich on a road outside of Woodland, California. Stevens approached the vehicle, lowered his head towards the driver\u2019s side window, and greeted Volarvich with a friendly, \u201cHow are you doing today?\u201d Volarvich responded, \u201cPretty good,\u201d then shot Stevens in the face with a Taurus .357 magnum revolver. Death was instantaneous. Stevens collapsed on the side of the road, and Volarvich drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">The events that culminated in the murder of Officer Stevens began three days earlier at a motel in Woodland, where Volarvich and his girlfriend, Rebecca Pina, were staying. After a night of using methamphetamine, they failed to check out of the motel at the scheduled time on November 14. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Woodland police officers, summoned to evict the holdover tenants, discovered marijuana on Pina and brass knuckles and methamphetamine on Volarvich. The officers arrested Volarvich.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Pina, who had been involved in an intimate relationship with defendant, drove Volarvich\u2019s car to defendant\u2019s house and asked for help with bail for Volarvich. Defendant reluctantly agreed and ultimately arranged a deal with a local bail bondsman whereby defendant would cosign for the full amount of the $10,000 bond and pay $300 of the $1,000 bond premium, and Volarvich would pay the remaining $700 after he was released from jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">When Volarvich was released from jail on November 16, defendant and Pina took Volarvich to defendant\u2019s house, where they \u201cgot high\u201d on methamphetamine with Lindsey Montgomery, one of Pina\u2019s friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">That afternoon, Volarvich and Pina gave defendant a ride to the Yolo County courthouse, where defendant attended a custody hearing regarding defendant\u2019s children with his estranged wife, Michelle. Michelle was living with Doug Shamberger, whom defendant \u201chated\u201d and considered to be an \u201casshole.\u201d Defendant suspected that both Michelle and Shamberger had burglarized his house; and Shamberger had threatened defendant several times because Michelle paid periodic visits to defendant. In response to these threats, defendant bought a Taurus .357 magnum to protect himself from Shamberger.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">On the way back to defendant\u2019s house following the custody hearing, defendant told Volarvich that he could \u201ctake care of\u2019 Shamberger as payment for defendant\u2019s having bailed Volarvich out of jail. When Volarvich remarked that he \u201cneeded a piece,\u201d defendant replied he \u201chad that taken care of.\u201d Volarvich asked: \u201c[D]o you want Michelle done?\u201d Defendant said no. Upon arriving at the house, the threesome again got high, and defendant gave Volarvich the .357 magnum Taurus revolver and $400 to pick up some more methamphetamine in Roseville.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">At this point, Volarvich and Pina got into a heated argument. Volarvich called Montgomery, arranged to go to her house, and left defendant\u2019s house alone. He then picked up Montgomery and drove to a hotel in Rocklin. En route, Volarvich told Montgomery that defendant had given him a gun because defendant \u201cwanted [Shamberger] taken out.\u201d After checking into a hotel room,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Volarvich pulled defendant\u2019s gun out of a black bag to show Montgomery and started playing with the revolving chamber. Later that night, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Volarvich and Montgomery went to Wal-Mart, where Volarvich bought a laser sight. Back at the hotel room, Volarvich unsuccessfully attempted to attach the laser sight to the gun with electrical tape. He then tried to Super Glue the laser sight to the gun; this attempt also failed. Because Volarvich was afraid of sleeping past checkout time and being sent back to jail, he and Montgomery stayed up all night.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">After leaving the hotel the morning of November 17, Volarvich and Montgomery went to a friend\u2019s house and smoked methamphetamine. They then drove back to Montgomery\u2019s house in Woodland. As Volarvich drove across the 1-5 causeway, he pulled out the gun and started playing with the revolving chamber, spinning the chamber and loading it with bullets. Afraid she would get in trouble because Volarvich was playing with a gun while they drove down the causeway, Montgomery told him to put the gun down. Volarvich complied, placing it on the driver\u2019s side floorboard. They smoked more methamphetamine when they arrived at Montgomery\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Meanwhile, Pina was still at defendant\u2019s house. Furious that Volarvich had not returned with the methamphetamine he was supposed to buy the night before, defendant hit Pina in the head to rouse her from sleep and yelled that, because of her, Volarvich did not come back and that defendant \u201cwas out $400 plus the money for the bail bondsman.\u201d Unable to connect with Volarvich through his cell phone, Pina called Montgomery, told her that defendant had hit her because Volarvich had not returned, and asked if she had heard from him. Montgomery told Pina that she would \u201ctry to get ahold of him.\u201d At Montgomery\u2019s request, Volarvich called Pina and told her that he was on his way to pick her up.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">When Volarvich left Montgomery\u2019s house, he was \u201cupset\u201d that defendant had hit Pina. Volarvich brought the gun with him because \u201che was worried that it was going to be a setup\u201d and he did not want to go back to jail. According to Montgomery, Volarvich believed that either defendant or the bail bondsman was setting him up because he had taken defendant\u2019s $400 without returning with the methamphetamine and had not met with the bail bondsman the day before to sign the bond paperwork.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Apparently on his way to defendant\u2019s house to pick up Pina, Volarvich used defendant\u2019s .357 magnum revolver to shoot and kill Officer Stevens, after Volarvich was pulled over by Stevens.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">After the shooting, Volarvich called Montgomery, said that he \u201cfucked up,\u201d asked if she could hear sirens, but hung up the phone before explaining further. When Volarvich called Montgomery back, he asked her to pick him up on El Dorado Drive. She agreed, borrowed a friend\u2019s car, and found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>Volarvich standing behind his car holding the license plate. Volarvich and Montgomery then switched cars and drove a short distance to Delta Drive, where they left Volarvich\u2019s car and returned to Montgomery\u2019s house. On the way to the house, Montgomery noticed that the black bag which had contained the gun was missing. When she asked Volarvich what had happened to it, he explained that he \u201chad to get rid of the gun\u201d and buried it near County Road 96 and County Road 24, which is precisely where the gun was found the next day. Montgomery also overheard Volarvich on the phone telling his mother that he had \u201cshot the cop\u201d but \u201cdidn\u2019t know if he was serious or not\u201d and thought that \u201che was just tweaking.\u201d Volarvich then called two friends and secured a ride from Woodland to Roseville. During the drive, Volarvich again said he \u201chad shot a cop,\u201d and added he did so because \u201che didn\u2019t want to go to jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">When defendant told Pina an officer had been shot, she turned on the television and saw the news broadcast about the killing. She asked whether he had given Volarvich his gun. Defendant replied that Volarvich\u2019s \u201cmentality was there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Meanwhile, Montgomery received a call from Volarvich telling her to buy window decals to disguise his car. Acceding to Volarvich\u2019s request, Montgomery bought decals and window tinting from Wal-Mart, returned to Delta Drive to retrieve the car, and reattached the license plate that Volarvich had apparently removed. After receiving another call from Volarvich informing her where to meet him, Montgomery drove Volarvich\u2019s car back to the hotel in Rocklin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There, Volarvich confessed to Montgomery, explaining that when he was pulled over by Officer Stevens, \u201che just turned and shot him.\u201d According to Volarvich, he was \u201cscared\u201d because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to go to jail\u201d and believed that being pulled over was part of a setup orchestrated by the bail bondsman.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Volarvich and Montgomery were arrested at the hotel during the early morning hours of November 18, the same day that defendant was arrested after his house was searched and officers discovered a rifle, methamphetamine, and drug paraphernalia. During questioning, defendant confirmed the antagonistic relationship between himself and Shamberger, and admitted that he had purchased the Taurus .357 magnum revolver in order to protect himself from Shamberger. But he denied asking Volarvich to kill Shamberger and denied giving Volarvich the gun that killed Officer Stevens. According to his version of events, defendant merely showed Volarvich the gun the night before the shooting and discovered that it was missing the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Defendant asserts that his murder conviction must be reversed because the shooting of Officer Stevens was not in furtherance of the conspiracy to kill Shamberger and \u201cwas both unforeseen and unforeseeable.\u201d Defendant is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The law has been settled for more than a century that each member of a conspiracy is criminally responsible for the acts of fellow conspirators committed in furtherance of, and which follow as a natural and probable consequence of, the conspiracy, even though such acts were not intended by the conspirators as a part of their common unlawful design. <em>(People v.

Luparello, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.3d at p. 443).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Properly treating the issue as a question of fact, the trial court instructed the jury with CALCRIM No. 417.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After requesting clarification on' the meaning of certain language in the instruction (\u201cin order to further the conspiracy\u201d and \u201clikely to happen if nothing unusual intervenes\u201d), the jurors informed the trial court that they had reached verdicts on all counts except the murder charge alleged against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The trial court then allowed the parties to present supplemental closing arguments focusing solely on whether the murder of Officer Stevens was committed in furtherance of, and followed as a probable and natural consequence of, the conspiracy. The People argued the murder furthered the goals of the conspiracy because, in order to successfully murder Shamberger, one of the goals of the conspiracy had to be to avoid detection; and the murder was a natural and probable consequence of the conspiracy because \u201ca reasonable person would foresee that there would be police intervention\u201d at some point during the execution of the plot to kill Shamberger, and defendant, with actual knowledge of Volarvich\u2019s \u201cvolatile and unstable\u201d nature, gave him the gun to carry out the murder. Defendant\u2019s attorney argued no conspiracy existed between defendant and Volarvich; being pulled over by an officer on a country road in Woodland constituted an \u201cextremely unusual\u201d event, the intervention of which rendered Officer Steven\u2019s death not a natural and probable consequence of the alleged conspiracy; and Volarvich killed Officer Stevens because \u201che did not want to go to jail,\u201d not because of a conspiracy to kill Shamberger.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>After further deliberation, the jury found defendant guilty of both the conspiracy and murder charges, implicitly finding the murder of Officer Stevens was committed in furtherance of, and followed as a natural and probable consequence of, the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">As he did in the trial court, defendant claims the murder of Officer Stevens \u201cwas both unforeseen and unforeseeable.\u201d We conclude the jury\u2019s contrary finding is supported by substantial evidence. The object of the conspiracy between defendant and Volarvich was to end the life of defendant\u2019s nemesis with the .357 magnum revolver supplied by defendant for that purpose. Defendant knew Volarvich had a proclivity for using methamphetamine, having used the drug with Volarvich the night before he gave him the gun to carry out the hit, and having given Volarvich $400 to purchase more methamphetamine. Defendant admitted knowing Volarvich had an unstable personality; after receiving news of Officer Stevens\u2019s murder, defendant told Pina that Volarvich\u2019s \u201cmentality was there.\u201d Defendant also had reason to know that Volarvich, who was on searchable probation, would be taken into custody if a law enforcement officer detained him and found the gun. From these facts, the jury could find that a natural and probable consequence, i.e., a reasonably foreseeable \u201cpossible consequence\u201d of defendant\u2019s conspiracy with assassin Volarvich to murder Shamberger <em>(People v. Medina, supra, </em>46 Cal.4th at p. 920) was that, if Volarvich was detained by a law enforcement officer before completing the job, Volarvich would kill the officer to avoid arrest and complete his mission to assassinate Shamberger.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Indeed, given defendant\u2019s knowledge of Volarvich\u2019s unstable mental state, use of methamphetamine, and desire not to return to jail, we conclude the prospect that defendant\u2019s arming Volarvich with defendant\u2019s .357 magnum revolver to assassinate Shamberger would lead to the shooting of a law enforcement officer is just as foreseeable as was the murder that the California Supreme Court recently held to be the natural and probable consequence of a \u201cfailed assault\u201d by gang members who had been disrespected by a rival gang member. <em>(People v. Medina, supra, </em>46 Cal.4th at pp. 923-925.)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Defendant\u2019s argument that the murder of Officer Stevens with defendant\u2019s gun was not \u201cin furtherance of the charged conspiracy\u201d does not benefit him for two reasons. First, a natural and probable consequence of a conspiracy need not be an act in furtherance of the conspiracy; it simply must be a \u201c \u2018reasonably foreseeable consequence of the [intended crime] aided and abetted.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Medina, supra, </em>46 Cal.4th at p. 920.) Second, although Volarvich was not on his way to carry out the assassination of Shamberger when Volarvich was pulled over by Officer Stevens, and although there is evidence that Volarvich was upset with defendant for hitting Pina, the jury was not required to conclude that the conspiracy to murder Shamberger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>had reached an end. Volarvich still \u201cowed\u201d defendant for bailing him out of jail and for the $400 given to him the previous day to purchase methamphetamine, and Volarvich still possessed the gun given to him by defendant to assassinate Shamberger. Thus, the jury could reasonably have concluded that the conspiracy to murder Shamberger persisted despite Volarvich\u2019s anger at defendant, and that the hit would be carried out whenever the opportunity presented itself. The jury could also have concluded, quite reasonably, that a simultaneous goal of the conspiracy to assassinate Shamberger was to avoid detection and forcibly resist arrest. <em>(People v. Durham </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 171, 185 [74 Cal.Rptr. 262, 449 P.2d 198]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lapierre </em>(1928) 205 Cal. 470, 471 [271 P. 500].) In fact, when Volarvich was pulled over by Officer Stevens, he correctly concluded that, unless he took drastic action with the gun given to him by defendant, Volarvich was going back to jail. Thus, the jury could reasonably have found that, because Volarvich would not have been able to complete his assignment from a jail cell, avoiding arrest at any cost furthered the murderous goal of the conspiracy by giving Volarvich more time to find the target.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Defendant points out \u201cthere appear to be no cases like this one,\u201d and posits the reason for the dearth of appellate decisions dealing with this factual scenario is \u201cthis case is far outside the scope of Kauffman and Pinkerton.\u201d (See <em>Kauffman, supra, </em>152 Cal. 331; <em>Pinkerton, supra, </em>328 U.S. 640 [90 L.Ed. 1489].) We are not persuaded. While it may be possible to imagine scenarios in which the conduct of an assassin is so outrageous and unpredictable that it falls outside the scope of a conspiracy to commit murder, one who bargains for an assassin\u2019s services, and then arms the assassin with a gun, takes the assassin as he finds him. If the hired killer is an unstable methamphetamine user who, before the assassination is completed, finds it necessary to kill a law enforcement officer to avoid being sent back to jail, the conspirator who hired and armed the assassin is guilty not only of conspiracy to murder the intended target, but also the murder of the peace officer. It would be a rare case indeed where a murder is an unforeseeable result of a conspiracy to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">II-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">We also reject defendant\u2019s claim that his right to a fair trial was infringed because, for a period at the start of trial, the judge allowed courtroom spectators to wear buttons displaying a photograph of Officer Stevens.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">On the first day of trial, Wednesday, February 13, 2008, Volarvich\u2019s counsel brought to the court\u2019s attention that \u201csome folks in the audience are wearing buttons, which fairly bear the image of Officer Stevens.\u201d Understanding their desire to \u201cexpress their sympathy for Officer Stevens and his family,\u201d counsel voiced concern that the buttons \u201cmay have some undue influence on the jurors.\u201d Thus, counsel asked the court to \u201cdirect folks, if they are going to be members of the audience, to please remove those buttons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The following day, Thursday, February 14, 2008, outside the jury\u2019s presence, the trial judge described the button: \u201cIt is about two to two-and-a-quarter inches in diameter. It is a color photograph of Officer Stevens. I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s in uniform or not. It is from chest level up showing primarily his face with the American flag in the background. And then it says Officer Andrew Stevens.\u201d The judge then allowed counsel to address the issue. Citing the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Musladin </em>(2006) 549 U.S. 70 [166 L.Ed.2d 482, 127 S.Ct. 649], Volarvich\u2019s attorney said \u201cit is an open question whether or not a spectator as opposed to state conduct in the courtroom can violate the right to a fair trial,\u201d but argued the fact that \u201cthese badges have been passed out by the Highway Patrol\u201d satisfied any state action requirement. After Volarvich\u2019s counsel offered to submit evidence regarding the California Highway Patrol\u2019s involvement in distributing the buttons, the judge said that he was not concerned about whether a state actor distributed the buttons. This was so because the judge rejected the notion that \u201cif state action isn\u2019t involved in wearing buttons or having placards or anything of that nature, then the Court has no authority and/or responsibility to control what happens in the courtroom.\u201d Rather, the judge explained, his \u201cresponsibility and the responsibility of all the security staff is to make sure that we maintain the kind of decorum in the courtroom that we should have for a case of this gravity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Accordingly, the judge framed the issue as \u201cwhether or not the communication from members of the audience is in any sense coercive or intimidating so that it might affect the decisions that the jury has to make in this case.\u201d In this regard, the judge observed that the buttons did not relate \u201covertly to the subject matter of this trial\u201d and served only as \u201ca memorial or an expression of sympathy\u201d for Officer Stevens and his family. The judge also noted that such an expression of sympathy was not inconsistent with the defense of either Volarvich or defendant as both defense attorneys, in opening statements, described the death of Officer Stevens as \u201ctragic or sad,\u201d and neither suggested that the death was not a \u201chomicide of some sort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Thus, the judge \u201cdecided [to] follow a suggestion that was made [in <em>People </em>v. <em>Houston </em>(2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 279 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 818]]\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>instruct the jurors as follows: \u201cI want to make sure that you realize that nothing that the audience says or does\u2014in fact, nothing that anybody does who\u2019s not a sworn witness can be used as evidence in this case, so realize that that badge is no more evidence than anything else that you might see on the street or anywhere else. I\u2019ve already told you that you can only use the testimony and evidence that\u2019s admitted here in court, and that does not include any communication that you might get from the badges themselves; but there\u2019s a second issue that could conceivably arise by seeing the badges, [f] You might feel sympathetic or even empathetic in reaction to seeing Officer Stevens\u2019s photograph. Remember that your responsibility when you deliberate in this case is to make your decisions without any [e]ffect from sympathy or passion or prejudice. Those decisions have to be impartial, objective decisions, so I want to make sure that you\u2019re sensitized to the fact that sympathy can\u2019t play any part in decisions that you ultimately have to make in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The judge also set a deadline after which the buttons would no longer be worn \u201cso that there won\u2019t be any ongoing [ejffect on the jurors.\u201d Outside the presence of the jury, the judge informed the audience that, beginning Tuesday, February 26, 2008, the buttons would no longer be allowed into the courtroom. Prior to the court-imposed deadline, the jury was exposed to the buttons bearing Officer Stevens\u2019s likeness on the first six days of an eight-week trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Defendant contends the trial court\u2019s \u201cfailure to stop the wearing of the buttons when first requested by the defense was error\u201d that deprived him of his right to \u201ca trial before an impartial jury untainted by an inflammatory courtroom atmosphere.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">\u201cThe right to a fair trial is a fundamental liberty secured by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Estelle v. Williams </em>(1976) 425 U.S. 501, 503 [48 L.Ed.2d 126, 130, 96 S.Ct. 1691]; see <em>People v. Taylor </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 488, 494 [183 Cal.Rptr. 64, 645 P.2d 115].) Because the presumption that a defendant is innocent until proved guilty is a \u201cbasic component of a fair trial under our system of criminal justice,\u201d \u201ccourts must be alert to factors that may undermine the fairness of the fact-finding process\u201d and \u201cmust carefully guard against dilution of the principle that guilt is to be established by probative evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Estelle v. Williams, supra, </em>425 U.S. at p. 503 [48 L.Ed.2d at p. 130].)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>\u201cSome courtroom practices are so inimical to the presumption of innocence that they violate defendants\u2019 due process rights. Compelling a defendant to appear at trial in prison garb is impermissible because the constant reminder of the defendant\u2019s incarcerated status may affect jurors\u2019 perception of him or her as a wrongdoer. [Citations.] Unnecessary shackling or gagging of a defendant during trial is improper for the same reason. [Citations.] The deployment of excessive numbers of security personnel in a courtroom also can undermine the presumption of innocence. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Olvera </em>(9th Cir. 1994) 30 F.3d 1195, 1196; see <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Flynn </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 560, 567-568 [89 L.Ed.2d 525, 533-534, 106 S.Ct. 1340]; <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>425 U.S. at p. 504 [48 L.Ed.2d at p. 130].)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">On the other hand, allowing some courtroom spectators to wear commemorative buttons depicting the likeness of a fallen officer is not unduly suggestive of guilt. Defendant\u2019s claim to the contrary is an insult to the intelligence, integrity, and resolve of jurors. Here, there is no reason to believe that the jurors, when faced with the image of a fallen officer, would be unable or unwilling to base their verdict solely on the evidence presented during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Moreover, jurors were instructed by the court to disregard the buttons, to not allow sympathy for Officer Stevens to play a role in their decision regarding the guilt or innocence of either defendant, and to base their verdict solely on evidence presented during the trial. We presume that the jury followed this admonition. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Houston, supra, </em>130 Cal.App.4th at p. 312 [nearly identical admonition held to cure any inherent prejudice presented by nearly identical buttons worn by audience members].) In addition, the court barred the wearing of the buttons during the last five weeks of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Consequently, we conclude the wearing of the buttons presented no \u201cprobability of deleterious effects\u201d on the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>(Estelle </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>425 U.S. at p. 504 [48 L.Ed.2d at p. 130].) Simply stated, we find beyond a reasonable doubt that the verdicts would have been the same even if the court had precluded spectators from wearing the buttons at the beginning of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">VI, VII<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Nicholson, J., and Robie, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">On December 3, 2009, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.
