The commissioner pointed out that the dominating feature of the trade-mark cannot 'be a descriptive word, so that purchasers would look to the prefixes \u201cSo-\u201d and \u201cNu\u201d as indicating origin of the respective goods. Prom that decision, this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Appellee\u2019s mark appears in two lines, the first syllable and the hyphen appearing abov? the word \u201cGrape,\u201d which is disclaimed. The mark of appellant is a compound word \u201cNuGrape\u201d in a kind of heavy script, underscored with a line which bears the legend \u201cA Flavor You Can\u2019t Forget\u201d. The legend was disclaimed.</p>\n<p id=\"A_DZ\">There is no question that the goods possess the same descriptive properties and that the word \u201cGrape\u201d as applied to the goods is descriptive. It is established law that a descriptive word cannot constitute the dominant part of a mark. American Brewing Company, Inc., v. Delatour Beverage Corporation, etc., 100 F.2d 253, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents, 778. Clearly the word \u201cGrape\u201d by itself cannot indicate origin in any particular source. The prefixes \u201cSo-\u201d and \u201cNu\u201d, while unlike in sound, meaning, if g.ny, and appearance, as was held by the commissioner, we think, considering both. marks as a whole, are confusingly similar and therefore their concurrent use is likely to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
