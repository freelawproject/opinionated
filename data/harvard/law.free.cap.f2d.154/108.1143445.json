Cheney California Lumber Co., 66 S.Ct. 553, 554, stated of the following cease and desist order\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">\u201c \u2018(b) In any other manner interfering with, restraining, or coercing its employees in the exercise of the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in concerted activities, for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, as guaranteed in Section 7 of the Act.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">\u201cThe court found warrant for its excision of this provision in [National] Labor Relations Board v. Express Pub. Co., supra (312 U.S. 426, 433, 61 S.Ct. 693, 85 L.Ed. 930). That case, however, recognized that it was within the power of the Board to make an order precisely like 1 (b). It merely held that whether such an inclusive provision as 1 (b) is justified in a particular case depends upon the circumstances of the particular case before the Board. See 312 U.S. at pages 433, 437, 438, 61 S.Ct. at pages 698, 700, 701, 85 L.Ed. 930.\u201d U.S, Sup.Ct.Bulletin, Volume 6, February 25, 1946, p. 681, at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">In the instant case it is our opinion that the Board properly overruled the respondents\u2019 exceptions to the trial examiner\u2019s recommendations that such orders should be made and that the evidence supports the finding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-15\">\u201cThe unfair labor practices committed by the respondents with respect to the employees of the canvas companies were in fact executed as an integral part of a coordinated scheme or plan designed by the institutional respondents as a means of assisting all employers of Southern California in interfering with, restraining, and coercing their employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed to such employees under the Act. Such coordinated plan, if again applied, will inevitably bring about a further concerted violation of the Act, similar in kind to the unfair labor practices found. Since the institutional respondents have publicly and persistently invited all employers of Southern California to enlist their services in introducing such plan among their employees, it is reasonable to assume, and we find, that the institutional respondents are fully equipped for, and ready to proceed with, the commission of similar unfair labor practices with respect to the employees of other employers, unless ordered to refrain from so doing,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-16\">and that the finding warrants our decree enforcing the above orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-17\">It is ordered that the words beginning on page 1 of our decree \u201cthat the order of said National Labor Relations Board herein be modified by striking out sentences (2) and (3) of paragraph a. of section 3 of the order\u201d be stricken therefrom and that the above cease and desist orders (2) and (3) be inserted in the decree on page 5 thereof after the paragraph beginning first thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-18\">DENMAN and BONE, Circuit Judges, concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
