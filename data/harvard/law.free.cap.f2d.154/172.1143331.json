They read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-24\"><em>\u201c2. </em>A method of reproducing the visual effect of a decorative material having a light-dispersing surface, which comprises the steps of roughening one surface of a thin sheet of transparent material to give it the light-reflecting characteristics of the surface of the original material, printing a color reproduction of the original material on the other surface of the sheet, and securing the printed surface of the sheet to a carrier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-25\">\u201c11. A reproduction of a decorative material, consisting of a fibrous carrier and a thin sheet of transparent material adherent to one surface of the carrier and having an inner smooth surface bearing a reproduction of the design and color of the original decorative material and an outer surface roughened to reproduce the surface characteristics of the original decorative material, the thinness of the sheet being of the order of magnitude of the resolving power of the eye so that the roughened outer surface of the sheet does not blur the design on the inner surface of the sheet.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-26\">The reference is: Winter, 1,474,698, November 20, 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-27\">Appellants state in their application that by their method they produce inexpensive reproductions of decorative materials, such, for example, as floor coverings, upholstery, wall coverings, hangings, etc.; that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>accomplish their purpose by printing a colored reproduction of the original material on one side of a thin sheet of transparent-material, such as cellulose acetate, and reproducing the surface characteristics of the original material on the other side of the sheet; that the surface characteristics of the material are reproduced by rough-, ening the surface \u201cto such extent as is necessary to give it the same dispersive effect in reflecting light as the surface of the original material\u201d; and that \u201cSuch roughening has the effect of making the sheet translucent rather than transparent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">According to appellants\u2019 specification, the sheet of transparent material is mounted \u201con any convenient carrier, such as a piece of fabric, with its printed side against the carrier, so that its roughened side is exposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Appellants further state in their application that \u2014 \u201cThe success of the method depends upon making the thickness of the sheet between its printed surface and its roughened surface of the same order as the finest lines or dots of the design. <em>It is best to make the thickness of the order </em>of magnitude of the resolving power of the human eye, which is between 1/100 and 1/1000 of an inch. Under these circumstances, the roughening of the surface of one side of the sheet does not prevent the eye from clearly seeing the design through the sheet.\u201d (Italics not qu'oted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Appellants also state in their application, however, that, although the \u201cdecorative material may accurately reproduce the appearance of some known decorative material, it is not essential that it should do so,\u201d and that, in accordance with their invention,</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\u201ca decorative material accurately reproducing the appearance of old, grained, wood paneling having a satin-like surface is made as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\"><em>\u201cA </em>sheet or transparent material, such as cellulose acetate, <em>about 3/1000 of cm inch in thickness </em>is roughened on one surface so as to give it the appearance of ground glass.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">The patent to Winter relates to artistic pictures, and, according to the patentee, \u201ccomprises a light reflecting or mirror-like reflector used as a backing for a picture printed on celluloid foil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">As in appellants\u2019 method, the patentee\u2019s picture is printed on the polished side of transparent material, such as a celluloid film, which is mounted on a reflector sheet, for example, a glass mirror, polished sheet metal, sheet silver, silver paper, mirror foil, or a metallic foil, such as tin foil, the exposed or opposite side of the foil is roughened or matted, as the patentee states, \u201cin any manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">The patentee further states that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">\u201cSuch a combination produces pictures of a new and peculiar effect. The color tones are soft and diffused and the effect is very pleasing.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b227-16\">\u201cVery beautiful, soft nuances and shades are obtained with colored half-tone prints, the colors fully retaining their luminous power and transparency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-17\">After stating that the reference disclosed a decorative article comprising a carrier, a celluloid film, a polished surface and a printed colored picture thereon, the printed side being in contact with the carrier or backing sheet and the outer surface being roughened or matted, and that the article disclosed in the reference was similar \u201cin organization to the article produced by applicant,\" the Primary Examiner held that it was \u201cpatentably immaterial whether the roughened surface or the printed matter is a reproduction of an original decorative material,\u201d and that the claims here on appeal were of substantially the same scope and were substantially met by the disclosure in the Winter patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-18\">The Board of Appeals concurred in the views expressed by the Primary Examiner, stating that, -although counsel for appellants argued that the patentee Winter was not attempting to reproduce the visual effect of any decorative material and does not disclose how it could be done, it was of opinion that it was \u201cpatentably immaterial what kind of design or picture applicant places on the smooth side of the transparent sheet. The cooperative action of the opposite matt surface is the same, and is taught by Winter. A patent can not be granted for each known kind of ornamentation one might wish to substitute for the printing,\u201d or picture in the patentee\u2019s disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-19\">In affirming the examiner\u2019s decision rejecting the claims on appeal, the board called attention to the fact that the celluloid film in the reference patent was a thin sheet of material.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-20\">It is conceded here by counsel for appellants that the sheet of celluloid film disclosed in the Winter patent is thin. Counsel argue, however, that the resem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Manee existing between the Winter disclosure and appellants\u2019 decorative material is purely accidental; that the patentee had no conception of \u201creproducing the visual appearance of a material by copying the two elements of the visual appearance separately and placing them within the resolving power of the eye,\u201d that is, on a sheet of transparent material having a thickness of from 1/100 to 1/1000 of an inch, as called for by appealed claim 11; that the teaching of the patent to Winter would produce a picture, the design of which would be blurred; that the patentee had for his purpose the softening of colors making them blend \u201cinstead of having clear lines of demarcation\u201d ; that because the patentee states that his combination produces pictures of a new and peculiar effect, and that the color tones are soft and diffused, his combination could not produce the exact appearance of appellants\u2019 decorative material ; and that the patentee does not disclose the \u201cthinness of the sheet being of the order of magnitude of the resolving power of the eye so that the roughened outer surface of the sheet does not blur the design on the inner surface of the sheet,\u201d as called for by quoted claim 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">As hereinbefore noted, appellants state in their application that it is \u201cbest to make the thickness of the order of magnitude of the resolving power of the human eye, which is between 1/J100 and 1/1000 of an inch,\u201d and that, although the \u201cnew decorative material may accurately reproduce the appearance of some known decorative material, it is not essential that it should do so.\u201d Furthermore, appellants state in their application that in carrying out their method they use a sheet of transparent material <em>of about 3/1000 of an inch in thickness, </em>and that by the use of such transparent material they <em>reproduce the surface characteristics of the original material. </em>It is obvious, therefore, that in appellants\u2019 method they may use a transparent material ranging from 1/100 to 3/1000 of an inch in thickness. Accordingly, the use of a material ranging in thickness from 1/100 to 1/1000 of an inch, which, appellants state in their application, is in the order of magnitude of the resolving power of the human eye, is not critical. Furthermore, there is nothing in the patent to Winter, as we view it, which can properly be understood as indicating that the design of the picture is blurred or that the thinness of the celluloid film used by the patentee is not of the order of that disclosed in appellants\u2019 application and claimed in claim 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">We concur, therefore, in the views expressed by the tribunals of the Patent <em>Office, </em>that the claims on appeal are not patentable in view of the disclosure in the patent to Winter.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the .Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
