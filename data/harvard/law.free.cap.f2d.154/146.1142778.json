The absence of actual confusion, however, is not a controlling factor in an opposition proceeding for the reason that the statute prohibits the registration of a mark that is \u201clikely\u201d to cause confusion. See also Celanese Corporation of America v. E. I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Company, 154 F.2d 143, 33 C.C.P.A., Patents-.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-26\">Although appellee does not now deal directly with the purchasing public, trade practices in this respect may change and there is no restriction in appellee\u2019s registration of the mark that prohibits such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>development in the normal extension of its business. Moreover, the fact that the merchandise is sold to a discriminating class of purchasers, if established, would not of itself be controlling here if the contested marks so nearly resemble one another as to be confusingly similar. See Schering &amp; Glatz, Inc. v. Sharp &amp; Dohme, Inc., 146 F.2d 1019, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">As hereinbefore noted,' the contested marks are \u201cCordura\u201d and \u201cCeldura.\u201d Both words are employed in the marks with capital letters and are coined words neither of which is recorded in any dictionary reference. \u201cCordura\u201d has been used by appellee as a registered trade-mark in the sale of its goods since July 23, 1935. Some seven years after appellee had thus introduced the use of its mark, appellant applied for the registration of its mark \u201cCeldura\u201d as appropriated to merchandise of the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Appellant contends that the two marks differ greatly in their sound; and \u201cAlthough both marks begin with the letter \u2018C\u2019 the difference in sound between the soft \u2018Cel\u2019 of the appellant\u2019s mark and the hard \u2018Cor\u2019 of the appellee\u2019s mark is so great that it outweighs by far the similarity in the terminal portions of the marks.\u201d According to appellant\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">\u201c* * * This portion of the marks is merely descriptive or suggestive of the nature of the goods, indicating that the yarns and fabrics possess the property of durability. This portion of .the marks, \u2018Dura,\u2019 is, therefore, in the public domain and should not be given the same weight as the remaining portions of the marks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The statute provides that a term which is merely descriptive shall not be registered for the reason that any one in the same line of business may not be deprived of the right to use such word or words ,in describing the goods which he offers for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">A word applied as a mark to one article may be merely descriptive of it and registration would be accordingly prohibited, But the same word appropriated as a mark to another article may be merely suggestive, that is, purely fanciful and arbitrary, and its registration would be accordingly authorized and protected. See In re One Minute Washer Company, 95 F.2d 517, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">A term Which is merely descriptive of the article to which the mark is appropriated cannot at the same time be regarded as merely suggestive of it within the meaning of the law. The term \u201cDura\u201d may be suggestive of durability but appellant has cited no reference in support of its contention that the term is merely descriptive and in the public domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">In the contested words, each has the identical first letter and the identical last two syllables. In fact, the only difference in the orthography of the words is to be found in the two letters preceding the terminal portion of the respective marks, \u201cDura.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">That both marks considered as a whole .are similar in meaning and appearance cannot be doubted. When spoken as written they sound very much alike. Similarity of sound alone, under such circumstances, is sufficient to cause the marks to be regarded as confusingly similar when applied to merchandise of the same descriptive properties. Skol Company, Inc. v. Olson, 151 F.2d 200, 33 C.C.P.A., Patents-.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-14\">In the briefs of counsel each side in support of its position presents an extensive list of words involved in previous trademark decisions in which the applicant\u2019s mark with but few exceptions was applied either to identical merchandise or to merchandise of the same descriptive properties. In appellant\u2019s tabulated list, the court authorized the registration of the applicant\u2019s mark, while in the list presented by appellee, registration of the mark was prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-15\">It has been frequently stated, in effect, that \u201cPrior decisions, except as to statements of~ law, have but little bearing on the issues presented in trade-mark opposition cases, because of differences in facts.\u201d See Lactona, Incorporated v. Lever Brothers Company, 144 F.2d 891, 893, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 704; International Vitamin Corporation v. Winthrop Chemical Co., Inc., 147 F.2d 1016, 1017, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 899. In the case last cited, the court made the following observation which is particularly pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-16\">\u201cMany cases have been cited by both parties, but as we have often held in trademark litigation such as comes to this court, each case must of necessity be decided on its own facts, and precedents are of very little help in deciding such cases. In re Dutch Maid Ice Cream Company, 95 F.2d 262, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1009.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-17\">The contested marks in the case at bar so nearly resemble one another as to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>likely to cause confusion in the mind of the public when concurrently used by the parties on merchandise of the same descriptive properties. It is unnecessary therefore to consider other incidental points which were discussed and properly decided by the Commissioner of Patents, and his decision in this case is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b203-5\">GARRETT, Presiding Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aiq\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">I am in entire agreement with the reasoning and conclusion in this case, but in view of the reasons given for my dissent in Celanese Corporation of America v. E. I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Company, 154 F.2d 143, 33 C.C.P.A., Patents,-, I deem it proper to direct specific attention to the fact that in this case \u201cDuPont\u201d is no part of appellee\u2019s registered mark here involved.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
