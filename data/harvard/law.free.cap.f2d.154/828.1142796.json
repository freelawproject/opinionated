The general exceptions to all the requirements recommended by the trial examiner and to those of the Board\u2019s order do not satisfy the provision of Section 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(e). This requires objection before the Board to the specific portion of its order complaint of to give the circuit court of appeals power to consider it. National Labor Relations Board v. Cheney California Lumber Company, 66 S.Ct. 553; Marshall Field &amp; Co. v.
