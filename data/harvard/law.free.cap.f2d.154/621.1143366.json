Section 596, on which plaintiff\u2019s claim is primarily based, reads as follows : \u201cTime for payment; double wages recoverable. The master or owner of any vessel making <em>coasting voyages </em>shall pay to every seaman his wages within two days after the termination of the agreement under which he was shipped, or at the time such seaman is discharged, whichever first happens; and in case of vessels making foreign voyages, or from a port on the Atlantic to a port on the Pacific, or vice versa, within twenty-four hours after the cargo has been discharged, or within four days after the seaman has been discharged, whichever first happens; and in all cases the seaman shall be entitled to be paid at the time of his discharge on account of wages a sum equal to one-third part of the balance due h:m. <em>Every master or owner who refuses </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number><em>or neglects to make payment in the manner hereinbefore mentioned without sufficient cause shall pay to the seaman a sum equal to two days\u2019 pay for each and- \u00e9very dkay during which payment is delayed beyond the respective periods, which sum shall be recoverable as wages in any claim made before the </em>Court;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> * * The question here is whether the statute applies to a vessel in the \u201clake-going\u201d trade, and this can best be answered by an examination of the derivation and development of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">In 1872, Congress passed the Shipping Commissioners\u2019 Act, 17 Stat. at L. 262, which in section 12 provided for written agreements with seamen. The ships to which it applied were those bound foreign and ships of over 75 tons bound between Atlantic and Pacific ports. A proviso limited this to exclude both \u201ccoast-wise\u201d and \u201clake-going\u201d ships which touched at foreign ports. Section 35 penalized masters of ships covered by section 12 who did not promptly pay the wages due at the end of a voyage or at discharge. On June 9, 1874, Congress amended this whole act by providing that it should not apply to vessels engaged in the coastwise trade, except that between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or to the lake-going trade touching at foreign ports or otherwise,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or to the trade between the United States and the British North American possessions, 18 Stat. at L. 64. The Act of June 9, was passed several days before the adoption of the Revised Statutes which incorporated the provisions of the Shipping Commissioners\u2019 Act, but the amendatory act does not appear therein. However, it survives the adoption of the Revised Statutes by virtue of R.S. \u00a7 5601 which provides that all statutes enacted after December 1, 1873, the effective date of the revision, and prior to June 22, 1874, were to have full effect as if passed after the date of adoption.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, R.S. \u00a7 4529, which embodied section 35 of the Shipping Commissioners\u2019 Act and applies in terms to voyages between Atlantic and Pacific ports and foreign voyages, was expressly limited by the amendatory act of June 9, now 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 544.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">So things stood till 1898, when Congress amended R.S. \u00a7 4529 by interpolating a provision for \u201ccoasting voyages\u201d before the provisions for voyages between Atlantic and Pacific ports and foreign voyages. That langauge has never been changed and is now found in 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The question, then, is whether the amendment of 1898 had any effect on, the provisions of the amendatory act, now 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 544, as far as the \u201clake-going\u201d trade is concerned. It seems quite clear that it did not. A country\u2019s \u201ccoast\u201d ordinarily means those of its borders washed by the sea,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and our shores on the Great Lakes do not come within this definition. It is obvious that Congress meant to distinguish between \u201ccoastwise\u201d and \u201clake-going\u201d trade; the distinction appears in the proviso to section 12 of the\u2019 Act of 1872, and again in the amendatory act of 1874. Appellant maintains that Congress intended to abandon this distinction when it used the word \u201ccoasting\u201d in the 1898 amendment instead of \u201ccoastwise,\u201d which was used in the previous enactments. However, none of the cases construing the Shipping Commissioners\u2019 Act appears to make any differentiation in the meaning of the two words, and we are not aware that any exists. Certainly it is highly'doubtful that Congress would have chosen so equivocal and uncertain a way of eliminating the reiterated distinction between \u201ccoast-wise\u201d and \u201clake-going\u201d trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">2. Appellant maintains that, even conceding that he has no rights under section 596, he can collect the double-wage penalty under section 597. That section deals with payments of seamen during a voyage and applies in terms to \u201cever} seaman on a vessel of the United States.\u201d It provides, further, that \u201cwhen the voyagt is ended every such seaman shall be entitled to the remainder of.the wages which shall be then due him, <em>as provided in thi </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>preceding section.\u201d </em><footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant maintains that since there are no provisions limiting the applicability of section 597 (with certain exceptions not here pertinent), and since this section is not one of those enumerated in section 544, it operates to bestow the benefits of section 596 on all seamen, whether or not they come within the language of that section. The adoption of this line of reasoning would lead us to a most curious result.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Section 597 had its origin in section 6 of the Act of July 20, 1790, 1 Stat. at L. 133, which applied to foreign-bound vessels and those vessels bound from a port in one state to a port in any other than an adjoining state. The first part of section 6 dealt with payment at ports, the second with payment on discharge. The latter was largely incorporated into section 35 of the Shipping Commissioners\u2019 Act, but that Act made no provision for payment at ports.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Tn the 1874 revision, section 6 of the Act of 1790 appeared as R.S. \u00a7 4530, i.e. \u00a7 597 of 46 U.S.C.A. It dealt with payment at ports and made no reference to section 4529. It was not until 1898 that the reference to the preceding section, then section 4529, was inserted. It should be noted that the amendment to section 4530 was part of the same bill as that which made section 4529 applicable to the \u201ccoasting\u201d trade, and not, as we have pointed out above, to the \u201clake-going\u201d trade. We are asked to find that at the same time that Congress made this limited enlargement in the scope of section 4529 it impliedly nullified all the previous limitations on the application of that section. We do not believe that this was what Congress intended to do when it added the words \u201cas provided in section 4529 of the Revised Statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">A careful reading of section 596 (formerly section 4529) negates any such intention on the part of Congress. The imposition of the penalty of double wages results from the master\u2019s neglect or refusal to make payments \u201cin the manner herein-before mentioned * * * \u201d i.e., when due as prescribed by the first part of section 596, which refers only to the time of payment of seamen employed on coastwise and foreign bound vessels. Unless the seaman can show that his wages are \u201cdue him as provided in the preceding section [section 596],\u201d we do not see how he can assert any claim to the double-wage penalty. We agree with the trial judge that if there is no right to double wages under section 596, there can be none under section 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b676-10\"> Emphasis added.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b676-11\"> To the effect that the exception as to vessels plying between the Atlantic and Pacific coast does not include \u201clake-going\u201d trade, which is mentioned immediately thereafter, see United States v.
