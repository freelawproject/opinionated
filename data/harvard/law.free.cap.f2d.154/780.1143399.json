It does not follow that, merely because each side moves for a summary judgment, there is no issue of material fact. For, although a defendant may, on his own motion, assert that, accepting his legal theory, the facts are undisputed, he may be able and should always be allowed to show that, if plaintiff\u2019s legal theory be adopted, a genuine dispute as to a material fact exists.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As judgment here was ,on plaintiff\u2019s motion, we must therefore decide whether, adopting its legal theory, there was no such dispute. We are satisfied there was none.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-17\"> 2. We take it as admitted that the company was not legally obligated to pay the bonuses, that the employees knew the payments were not contractual, and that the company would have discontinued them \u201cif and when the company finances indicated an unhealthy condition.\u201d But the undenied, crucial fact here is that in fact they were regularly paid. Although the employees knew they could not legally compel the company to make those payments, no one can doubt that the employees assumed that, in the -normal course of events, the employees would receive them. That seems to us to be enough to constitute them part of \u201cthe regular rate at which\u201d the men were employed. Walling v. Harnischfeger Corp., 325 U.S. 427, 65 S.Ct. 1246, 1250; Walling v. Youngerman-Reynolds Hardwood Company, 325 U.S. 419, 65 S.Ct. 1242, 1250; Walling v. Helmerich &amp; Payne, 323 U.S. 37, 65 S.Ct. 11.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To be sure, the Supreme Court has not yet considered a bonus arrangement involving no contractual obligation; but, interpreting those decisions as best we can,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> their implication, coupled with the language of \u00a7 7 (a) (3), seems to us to require the conclusion we have reached.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>district judge that the \u201cgood faith\u201d of the employer is immaterial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">In arriving at that conclusion we have given appropriate weight to the administrator\u2019s official interpretation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This interpretation spoke not only of a bonus which the employer \u201cpromises\u201d or \u201cagrees\u201d to pay, but also of one which he \u201carranges\u201d to pay. If, said the Administrator, the employer pays a bonus \u201cwithout having previously * * * arranged\u201d to do so, then it does not count, but it docs count if he \u201carranges\u201d to grant a bonus with regularity and if the amount thereof \u201cmay be ascertained by the application of a formula.\u201d That interpretation, which is not unreasonable,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> fits this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-6\"> So, too, may the plaintiff show on defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A40\"> Cf.
