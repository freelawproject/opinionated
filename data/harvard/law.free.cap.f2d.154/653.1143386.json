In so. far as the appeal relates to the counterclaim, we may entertain it, since the counterclaim sought an injunction. Defendants\u2019 suggestion that we \u201csearch the record,\u201d and thus determine the validity of plaintiff\u2019s claim, is an oblique suggestion that we review the order denying defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. But such an order is not, appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">2. Except as to two items, noted below, the state court judgment was res judicata barring the counterclaim. For necessarily within the issues which could have been litigated in the state court action, under defendants\u2019 pleadings there, was their claim that their use of the name \u201cJuliana\u201d in their trade-name conferred on them the right to prevent plaintiff from using it as a label.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">3. After the entry of that judgment, defendants began to mark their goods \u201cJuliana\u201d; the counterclaim, to the extent that it rested upon that use, was not similarly barred. But obviously, too, to that extent it lacks merit because of plaintiff\u2019s prior use.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\"> 4. Also not barred by the state court judgment is the claim based on paragraph 25. The only asserted foundation for that claim is 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 102. But such a right can be asserted only by one who has obtained a registered trade-mark, and that defendants have not done. <em>Since </em>defendants have not appealed to the Commissioner of Patents, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 89 is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
