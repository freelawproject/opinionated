The proceeding was instituted by the filing of a libel, which subsequently was amended. Appellee Pillsbury moved to dismiss the amended libel. The motion was heard on December 11, 1944. There was no other hearing. On December 26, 1944, the following \u201corder,\u201d signed by a judge of the District Court, was filed and entered: \u201cIt is ordered that the motion of respondent [appellee], Warren H.

On February 21, 1945, the judge signed and caused to be filed a \u201cdecree\u201d purporting to dismiss the amended libel which, in fact, was dismissed by the \u201corder\u201d of December 26, 1944. From the \u201cdecree\u201d of February 21, 1945, this appeal was taken on April 24, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-22\">As heretofore stated, the \u201corder\u201d of December 26, 1944, was a final decision. There was no other final decision in this case. No other final decision was necessary. The \u201cdecree\u201d of February 21, 1945, was not a final decision and was not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-23\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
