The registration so relied upon is registration No. <em>120,648, </em>a \u201csoft copy\u201d of which was filed with, and \u201cas a part\u201d of, the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-27\">Appellant specifically alleged:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-28\"><em>\u201c2. </em>That Opposer secured registration of said mark in the U. S. Patent Office on Feb. 19, 1918, per certificate No. 120,648, a soft copy of which is filed herewith and as a part hereof; that said registration is now owned by Opposer, and is in full force and effect, having been renewed in 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-29\">\u201c3. That Applicant\u2019s alleged TradeMark consists of the word \u2018Vad,\u2019 which is so similar to Opposer\u2019s Trade-Mark as to be likely to cause confusion in the minds of the public, and to deceive purchasers. Opposer states that the goods upon which Applicant alleges his mark to be applied have the same descriptive properties as Op-poser\u2019s goods; hence that Opposer would be injured by its registration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-30\">In its answer to the notice of opposition appellee stated inter alia:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-31\">\u201cApplicant, The Vad Corporation, answering the notice of opposition herein, denies each and every allegation in said notice of opposition except as hereinafter admitted or specifically avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-32\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b209-33\">\u201c2. It admits the issuance of Reg. No. 120,648 on February 19, 1918, but is without any knowledge as to the renewal thereof or the ownership by opposer.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-34\">\u201c3. It denies each and every allegation contained in paragraph 3 of the notice of opposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-35\">Appellee thus placed in issue the question of appellant\u2019s ownership of the mark \u201cVadeo\u201d and it became incumbent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>upon appellant to prove same. So far as disclosed by the record, appellant made no effort to make such proof. It took no testimony, nor did it introduce any evidence of any character.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The copyo of registration No. 120,-648 filed with, and \u201cas a part\u201d of, the notice of opposition discloses that the certificate of registration was issued to \u201cVan Antwerp\u2019s Drug Corporation, Inc., of Mobile, Alabama,\u201d February 19, 1918. Upon the copy is stamped \u201cRenewed.\u201d There is nothing on the document to indicate when it was renewed, nor at whose instance it was renewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record that appellant ever acquired ownership of, or any interest in the business of, Van Antwerp\u2019s Drug Corporation, Inc. It is not even alleged in its notice of opposition that it did so. In fact, it made no reference whatsoever to the Van Antwerp\u2019s Drug Corporation, Inc., in its notice of opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Upon the state of the record so outlined, the Examiner of Trade-Mark Interferences held that appellant had not established a right to oppose appellee\u2019s registration, saying, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\u201cThe Opposer [appellant here] has filed an official copy of the registration pleaded in the notice of opposition; however, it appears that this registration issued to a stranger to this proceeding and no proofs have been submitted in support of opposer\u2019s claim of ownership thereof. The registration, accordingly, is incompetent as evidence of use or ownership of the mark by the opposer and in the absence of any other evidence upon that issue, the examiner is in- agreement with the applicant that the opposer lacks the right to herein contest the question of likelihood of confusion in trade.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The commissioner affirmed the foregoing decision, saying, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">\u201cThe registration pleaded by opposer was issued to Van Antwerp\u2019s Drug Corporation, Inc. \u00c9ecause opposer failed to prove its alleged ownership-of the registration, or of the registered mark, the examiner of interferences very properly held \u2018that the opposer lacks the right to herein contest the question of likelihood of confusion in trade;\u2019 and so dismissed the opposition and \u2018adjudged that the applicant is entitled to the registration for which ,it has made application.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">It is obvious that the decisions of the respective tribunals of the Patent Office, holding that appellant had failed to establish any right to oppose appellee\u2019s application for registration and, for that reason,, dismissing appellant\u2019s notice of opposition,, were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">The decision of the commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
