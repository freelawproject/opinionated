Notice of appeal was filed August 31, 1945. On October 8th (within the forty-day period after the filing of notice of appeal) the time for filing the record in this Court was extended by the District Court to November 5th. On November 1st (within the time limit as extended) the time was again extended by the District Court to November 24th. On November 27th \u2014 the record not then having been filed \u2014 appellees filed in this Court under Rule 75(j) a preliminary record and moved to dismiss, notice of which was duly served on appellant\u2019s attorney of record. On November 29th appellant filed objections to the motion to dismiss, admitting the default, hut asking us to overlook it for \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d The explanation of appellant\u2019s neglect is that appellant\u2019s counsel was professionally engaged in attending to other matters. We think this is not an adequate reason to justify our exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-27\">Shortly after the adoption of the new Rules we did grant relief in a somewhat similar case, on the ground that the Rules were new and that it was unlikely counsel had sufficiently acquainted themselves with their terms, but we were careful on that occasion to advise the Bar that we intended thereafter to exercise sparingly our discretion to save an appeal prosecuted in disregard of the Rules.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In accordance with that ruling we have since, we think, invariably declined to extend relief, except for convincing reasons, where, as is the case here, appellee after appellant\u2019s default has himself filed a preliminary record and moved to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-28\">The reasons advanced in the present case show neglect, but fail to show excusable neglect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly we are granting appellees\u2019 motion, and an order will be entered dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-29\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-19\"> Rule 73(g), Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AB_\"> Burke v.
