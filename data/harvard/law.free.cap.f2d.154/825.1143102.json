The \u201cCavelier\u201d was bound up stream, and in order to get on her course had to, swing around to port substantially 180\u00b0. The \u201cStanton\u201d was also bound up stream through the anchorage ground, a course which required her to pick her way through numerous anchored vessels. She argues, as we understand it, that, in spite of the veering that this entailed, her course \u2014 as distinct from her heading \u2014 was ascertainable by the \u201cCavelier,\u201d and was therefore steady; and, that it is not necessary that both vessels should be on steady courses, but only that the holding on vessel should be. At least, that is the only possible basis for the \u201cStanton\u2019s\u201d position that this was a starboard hand situation. The rule has always been interpreted as limited to situations in which both vessels are on steady courses; and we are not disposed to import an exception. The duty of the holding on vessel to keep her course and speed is at times a trying one, and we do not think that she sho\u00fcld be so bound when the other vessel is not on a steady course. We decide the case on the assumption that it was one of \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d under Article 27 of the Inland Rules, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-13\">The faults of the \u201cCavelier\u201d were in any event obvious. She was emerging from behind the tanker across the \u201cStanton\u2019s\u201d projected path, and it was plainly wrong not to give any signal of her purpose. It is not necessary to say that a vessel getting under way after weighing anchor in an open anchorage leaves a \u201cberth\u201d within Rule V of Article 18, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203; but certainly when she is blanketed by another vessel from behind which she means to come out, all those considerations apply which demand a \u201cslip whistle.\u201d Besides, there was no excuse for not seeing the \u201cStanton\u201d as she approached; the \u201cStanton\u2019s\u201d masts and stack were visible, as well as the top of her superstructure. The \u201cCavelier\u201d neglected the most rudimentary precautions required for her navigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-14\">Nor can the \u201cStanton\u201d excuse her failure to make out the \u201cCavelier\u201d before she moved from behind the tanker. Just as the \u201cStanton\u2019s\u201d masts, stack and superstructure were observable from the \u201cCavelier\u2019s\u201d bridge, so were the \u201cCavelier\u2019s\u201d from the \u201cStanton\u2019s.\u201d Nothing more surely catches the eye than a moving object across a field marked by stationary objects. Again, it would be unwarranted for us to declare \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d the judge\u2019s finding that the \u201cStanton\u2019s\u201d speed was about seven knots; even Stegall, her chief mate, put her speed at about six knots. Precision on such an issue is unattainable; it is enough that the \u201cStanton\u201d was moving too fast safely to thread her way over the water she chose. The libellant makes a very plausible argument that it. was ipso facto negligence not to choose the channel. We need not go so far, but we do hold that she was charged with the utmost vigilance when she preferred the crowded anchorage to a channel which the judge found to be free of vessels. That measure of vigilance she was very far from discharging.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-15\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
