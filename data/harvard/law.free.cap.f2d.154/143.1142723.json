S. P. Q. 193, affirming the decision of the Examiner of Trade-Mark Interferences sustaining the opposition of appellee to the application of appellant filed June 19, 1942, for registration of the word \u201cClarifoil,\u201d printed in capital letters, as a trade-mark for goods described in the application as \u201cTransparent or Translucent Wrapping and Packing Material.\u201d The application alleges use of the mark \u201csince June 16, 1942.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-14\">In its notice of opposition appellee relies upon its ownership of registration No. 281,471, issued March 17, 1931, upon an application filed November 1, 1930. The registered mark so relied upon is a composite mark consisting of the word \u201cDu Pont\u201d arranged in an oval, below which oval is the notation .\u201cClar-apel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-15\">It is conceded that the contesting marks are applied to merchandise of the same descriptive properties, and the record discloses that part of the merchandise is substantially identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-16\">According to the testimony, the merchandise distributed by appellee is a cellulose film widely used as a wrapping material for such products as cigars, cigarettes, and food-stuffs of almost every description; and during normal times a wide line of textiles, trinkets, and things of that sort.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-17\">The opposition is based upon that portion of the proviso to section 5(b) of the Trade Mark Act of February 20, 1905, which states: \u201cThat trade-marks which * * * so nearly resemble a registered or known trade-mark owned and in use by another and appropriated to merchandise of the same descriptive properties as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers shall not be registered.\u201d 15 U.S.C. sec. 85(b), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 85(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-19\">Appellant urges that the merchandise is sold exclusively to a discriminating class of purchasers and therefore the marks may be considered dissimilar, even if they would be considered deceptively similar if the product were sold to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-20\">The record, however, fails to establish the fact that the merchandise is sold to a discriminating class of purchasers; but, if established, it would not be controlling here if the contested marks so nearly resemble one another as to be likely to cause confusion. See, Schering &amp; Glatz, Inc. v. Sharp &amp; Dohme, Inc., 146 F.2d 1019, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-21\">Moreover, it is true, as stated in the decision of the Examiner of Interferences, that \u201ctrade practices in this respect may change and hence the class of purchasers to whom the goods are now sold is not deemed to be a controlling factor herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-22\">Appellee\u2019s mark, as hereinbefore noted, is comprised of the separately displayed words \u201cDu Pont Clar-apel\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-23\">The Examiner of Trade-Mark Interferences and the First Assistant Commissioner of Patents both correctly held, in accordance with the rule of law laid down and followed by this court, that the addition of the surname \u201cDuPont\u201d to one of two otherwise confusingly similar marks is not of itself sufficient to avoid the likelihood of confusion. Richard Heilman, Inc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>v. Oakford &amp; Fahnestock, 54 F.2d 423, 19 C.C.P.A., Patents, 816; California Prune &amp; Apricot Growers Association v. Dobry Flour Mills, Inc., 101 F.2d 838, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents, 910. See also Menendez v. Holt, 128 U.S. 514, 9 S.Ct. 143, 32 L.Ed. 526; Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc., 150 F.2d 439, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">In the case last cited, appellant made the distinguishing feature of its corporate name, \u201cFirestone,\u201d a part of its trade-mark, \u201cFirestone Air Chief,\u201d as appropriated to radios and radio supplies. The name \u201cFirestone,\u201d as the reproduction of the mark in the prevailing opinion discloses, is separately displayed and made equally prominent with the other words in the mark. Appellee\u2019s mark in that case, upon goods of the same descriptive properties, was \u201cAirline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Notwithstanding the prominent use of the well known name of \u201cFirestone\u201d and other distinctive portions of appellant\u2019s mark, this court in rendering its decision in favor of the appellant disregarded the name of \u201cFirestone\u201d as the dominant portion of the trade-mark and held that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\u201c * * * the term \u2018Air Chief\u2019 and \u2018Airline,\u2019 considered alone, being the dominant portions of the two marks, are so vastly different in meaning, appearance, and sound as to insure against the probability of confusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-7\"> It is a matter of common knowledge that in the purchase of goods people generally do not stop to scrutinize marks nor retain a vivid recollection of their diversified featuics. Each of the contested marks, therefore, is to be considered in its entirety and viewed as the general public would view and remember it in making a purchase of the merchandise to which it is attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">It is clearly apparent, however, that while trade-marks must be considered as a whole in determining the question of similarity, and while the name \u201cDu Pont\u201d may be more conspicuous in appellee\u2019s mark than \u201cClar-apel,\u201d nevertheless the public in making purchases of the goods would be likely to remember and use the word \u201cClar-apel\u201d as indicating origin of the goods. For that reason, \u201cClar-apel\u201d must be regarded as the dominant portion of appellee\u2019s mark. See Frankfort Distilleries, Inc., v. Kasko Distillers Products Corporation, 111 F.2d 481, 27 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">The record establishes that more than ten years after the goods had been marketed on an international basis by appellee under its trade-mark, appellant entered the field with the substantially identical product which it sells under its mark \u201cCiarifoil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">The question therefore is whether the word \u201cClar-apel,\u201d the dominant portion of appellee\u2019s mark, is confusingly similar to the word \u201cCiarifoil.\u201d Both of the contested words are coined; no entry or meaning being attributed to either word in any dictionary reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">In the brief of appellant it is argued in effect that the contesting marks have only one feature in common, their first syllable \u201cCiar\u201d; otherwise they are wholly dissimilar in appearance when printed and in sound when spoken. That such an argument is obviously without merit, is pointed out in appellee\u2019s brief\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">\u201cIt is submitted that the first two syllables, namely, \u2018Clari\u2019 and \u2018Clara\u2019 are practically identical in sound. When spoken, they are substantially indistinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">\u201cMoreover, the third and remaining syllable of both words ends in the same letter, namely \u2018L.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\">\u201cThus, both are words of three syllables, the first two syllables of both are substantially identical; and the third syllable of both ends with the same letter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-16\">Technical reasoning, which in the last analysis amounts to nothing more than a process of the dissection of a word and the comparison of its divorced segments, should not be employed to obtain registration for the use of a word as a whole, which, if registered, would put the newcomer in a position not only to appropriate the good will of the owner of a trade-mark but also to take advantage, intentionally or otherwise, of a purchasing public.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-17\">It is true, as stated in the decision of the First Assistant Commissioner of Patents, that \u201c * <em>* </em>* obviously, the spoken expressions \u2018Clar-apel\u2019 and \u2018Clarifoil\u2019 sound very nearly alike.\u201d This court has held, and the rule is applicable here, that if the mark of a newcomer when voiced is so constituted as to be similar in sound to the language expressed in a trademark attached to identical goods or merchandise of the same descriptive properties, the registration of the newcomer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>mark will be prohibited regardless of its significance otherwise in appearance and meaning. See Skol Co., Inc., v. Olson, 151 F.2d 200, 33 C.C.P.A., Patents \u2014, and authorities therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">It is our opinion that notwithstanding appellee\u2019s use of the surname <em>\u201cDa </em>Pont,\u201d the two marks, respectively considered as a whole, so nearly resemble one another in sound, meaning, and appearance as to be likely to cause confusion when concurrently used in the sale of identical merchandise or merchandise of the same descriptive properties. In view of that conclusion, it is unnecessary to consider other incidental points which were discussed and properly passed upon by the Commissioner of Patents. His decision, which applies the correct principles of law to the facts presented, is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b200-6\">GARRETT, Presiding Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A0-\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">I respectfully dissent from the conclusion reached by my associates in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">It seems to me that the presence of the word \u201cDu Pont\u201d as an integral and presumably valid part of appellee\u2019s mark so clearly states the origin of appellee\u2019s goods that there is not the slightest likelihood of the public being confused or purchasers deceived as to the origin of appellant\u2019s merchandise by the application thereto of the notation \u201cClarifoil\u201d as a trade-mark, notwithstanding its partial resemblance to the word \u201cClar-apel.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
