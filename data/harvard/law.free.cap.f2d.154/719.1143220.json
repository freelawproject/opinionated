Shwayder, Frances Shwayder Borwick, and W. W. Grant<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are copartners doing business under the. name of Winter-Weiss Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-14\">Upon an amended charge filed by International Union, United Automobile, Aircraft and Agricultural Implement Workers of America,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> an affiliate of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the Board issued its complaint against the respondents, alleging that they had engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of \u00a7 8 (1) and (3) and \u00a7 2(6) and (7) of fhe National Labor Relations Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 158(1, 3), 152(6, 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-16\">Jurisdiction of the Board is established by the evidence and is not challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-17\">At the hearing, the following facts were established by substantial evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b774-18\">The Union began organizing activities among respondents\u2019 employees in 1942. By October, 1943, 18 employees had joined the Union. Amos Leaf and Stanley Shaffer joined on July 17, 1942. Shortly thereafter, they were appointed stewards in the Union organization drive and a new Union Field Representative took over organizing activities at the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-19\">Earl Sloan, a supervisor, in the summer of' 1942, told Leaf and others \u201cthat they didn\u2019t need no union; they didn\u2019t want a union.\u201d Leonard Lennox, a foreman of maintenance told employee Warner that the Company did not approve of the Union. Hans Jorgensen, a leadman, told employee Mosher that the respondents \u201cwouldn\u2019t stand for union activities\u201d and that they \u201cwouldn\u2019t stand\u201d for a man belonging to the Union. Jorgensen was not a foreman. There were six men in the department. He laid out their work and had authority to criticize their work and to report derelictions to the foreman. Earl Marteleon, a foreman, in October, 1943, asked Leaf, \u201cWhat is the idea of trying to organize my department?\u201d Leaf replied that he was not trying to organize Marteleon\u2019s department, but the entire plant. Marteleon then said, \u201cI don\u2019t want them to do me like they did O. C. Gossett. I have worked myself up to supervisor and I don\u2019t want them to take my authority away and lose all my seniority here just on account of a little union agitation. You remember when Gos-sett was on nights and he was foreman and had the union trouble, well, they * * * took his authority away and made him work in with another foreman and I don\u2019t want that to happen to me. The Company don\u2019t want a union here and it just puts me on the spot, because you are in my department.\u201d In October, 1943, Marteleon inquired of employee Cook if he (Marteleon) was the reason the Union wanted to get in. Marteleon told Leaf that the discharge of Shaffer in November, 1943, was due to the latter\u2019s Union activities. Harold Shearer, an assistant foreman in the Navy department, in 1943, asked Leaf how he was coming along with the Union. Leaf replied he was getting a few every day. Shearer then said, \u201cI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>think you are bumping your head against a stone wall,\u201d because he had heard Lee Elder tell Tiny Ranum that he would have to work against the Union or he would not have a job. Shearer further told Leaf that respondents would get rid of him for his Union activities, and that he did not have a chance there. Employee Chappell heard Shearer, in the fall of 1943, apply a profane adjective to the Union and express the hope that it would not get in the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Bennie A. Morton was employed by respondents on December 15, 1941. He joined the Union on July 17, 1942. On July 18, 1942, during the lunch hour, he distributed Union literature at respondents\u2019 plant and pasted stickers on a crane in the steel yard of respondents. At the end of the day\u2019s work on July 18, 1942, he was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Leaf was employed by respondents as a welder on August 17, 1941. He continued in that employment until January 24, 1944, when respondents discharged him.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">In the course of his organizing activities in behalf of the Union, he secured application cards from approximately 30 employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">In September, 1942, Leaf\u2019s draft classification was 1-A. He attempted to enlist in the Navy but was rejected because of a heart condition. He then took up the question of deferment with Nathan R. Kobey, respondents\u2019 attorney and advisor on labor matters. Kobey told him that respondents would seek a deferment for him if he would quit his Union agitation, that a union was not needed in the plant, and that any questions which arose could be best handled individually. Leaf told him if anything came up, he would talk to him individually and would forget about the Union. The respondents secured a deferment for Leaf and his classification was changed to 2-A. He received a second deferment in May, 1943. In September, 1943, Weiss told Leaf that he would seek another deferment for him. In October, however, after Leaf and Shearer started work on the Union organization drive, Kobey went to the plant, called Leaf to one side, and inquired, \u201cWhat is all this agitation?\u201d Leaf mentioned certain grievances. Kobey then told Leaf \u201che was off on the wrong foot trying to organize here,\u201d and that Leaf\u2019s draft classification as 2-B would be changed. In October, 1943, Weiss told Leaf, \u201cW= don'.t need no union here. You are just away out of line on having a union in this plant.\u201d At the same time, Weiss advised Leaf that it had been reported to him that Leaf had made anti-semitic remarks. Weiss said to Leaf, \u201cDon\u2019t you know you are just helping the Nazis trying to organize this plant? We don\u2019t'need no union here.\u201d Leaf was reclassified as 1-A in November, 1943. On December 8, he discussed the question of deferment with Weiss. Thereupon, Weiss applied for another deferment, but warned Leaf that he should quit his Union agitation. Leaf was ordered to report for physical examination on January 18, 1944, and was rejected. On January 22, 1944, Leaf was called 1o foreman Marteleon\u2019s office where respondent Winter told him, \u201cWell, we found out that you are not going to the Army and we don\u2019t need you around here. You are too much of a radical agitator.\u201d Leaf continued to work until the morning of January 24. Marteleon refused to sign his release slio, saying he did not want to get involved. The slip was signed by respondent Winter. It stated as the reason for the discharge: \u201cSlanderous remarks in regard to his foreman.\u201d Leaf\u2019s foreman, Harold Sloan, was a single man and had been deferred three times. Sloan\u2019s deferment was the subject of adverse comment in the plant. It was reported to respondents that Leaf had called Sloan a slacker. Two employees undertook to discover the reason for Leaf\u2019s discharge. Jorgensen explained it to one of them by saying, \u201cThe Company would not stand for union activities.\u201d The other employee inquired of respondent Winter whether, \u201cAll our jobs are as insecure as Amos\u2019,\u201d referring to Leaf. Winter said, \u201cIt is as secure as you yourselves will make it. * * * We want everybody to do his work and keep your mouth shut. That is all we ask of you. Your job is secure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">During the period of his employment by respondents, Leaf was a good worker and rendered satisfactory service. His inilial wages were 75 cents per hour. In April, 1942, his wages were increased to 85 cents, in June, 1942, to 90 cents, in July, 1942, to 95 cents, and in September, 1943, to $i per hour. The last raise was awarded for merit and ability as a crew leader.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">Leaf denied that he called Sloan a slacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">The Board found that respondents, by discriminating in regard to hire and tenure of Leaf, thereby discouraging membership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>in the Union, had engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of \u00a7 8(3) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(3); and, by interfering with, restraining, and coercing their employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in \u00a7 7 of the Act, 29 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 157, had engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of \u00a7 8(1) of \u25a0the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(1). The Board issued the usual cease and desist and reinstatement order.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Much of the evidence introduced by the Board was controverted by evidence introduced by the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The weight of the evidence, the credibility of the witnesses, and the inferences reasonably to be drawn from the evidence, were matters to be determined by the Board and not by this court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">In National Labor Relations Board v. Standard Oil Co., et al., 10 Cir., 124 F.2d 895, 903, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-7\">\u201cSection 10(e) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(e), provides: \u2018The findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive.\u2019 This \u2018means \u25a0evidence which is substantial, that is, affording a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably \u25a0inferred. * * * Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, and must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established. \u201cIt means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \u25a0might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d * * * It must be enough to justify, if the trial were to a jury, a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-15\">Respondents complain of the breadth of the cease and desist order. The respondents did not raise that question before the Board and the objection here comes too late.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-16\">The order will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-15\"> Hereinafter called the Board,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AD4\"> Hereinafter referred to as respondents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b774-20\"> Hereinafter called tlie Union.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AuNo\"> Hereinafter called the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"A_C\"> Swift &amp; Co. v.
