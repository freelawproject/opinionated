Plaintiff moved under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, rule 12 (b) (6), 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c; to dismiss the Third Defense as a matter of law, and defendants moved for summary judgment under Federal Rule 56 on the basis of this defense. The p\u00e1rties filed affidavits, and the judge then wrote a considered opinion, D.C., 64 F.Supp. 516, holding the defense good as a pleading, but insufficient in law upon the \u201cuncontradicted facts.\u201d He therefore'stated that plaintiff\u2019s motion would be granted, and defendants\u2019 motion denied; and the order in question is in the limited form of dismissing the \u201cThird Defense\u201d in defendants\u2019 answer and - denying defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Without attempting to proceed further below, defendants -took this appeal, which plaintiff has moved to dismiss on the ground that the order from which it is taken is not a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-29\"> An order merely striking one of several defenses and allowing the action to continue for adjudication of the rest would seem as nearly interlocutory as any pleading ruling can ever be; and such has been the universal view, both before the adopti6n of the new civil rules, United States v. Continental Casualty Co., 2 Cir., 69 F.2d 107; Rexford v. Brunswick-Balke-Collen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>der Co., 228 U.S. 339, 33 S.Ct. 515, 57 L.Ed. 864, and since, United States v. Florian, 312 U.S. 656, 61 S.Ct. 713, 85 L.Ed. 1105, reversing (and restoring the first opinion in) Florian v. United States, 7 Cir., 114 F.2d 990; Shultz v. Manufacturers &amp; Traders Trust Co., 2 Cir., 103 F.2d 771; Leonard v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 7 Cir., 130 F.2d 535; Audi Vision, Inc. v. RCA Mfg. Co., 2 Cir., 136 F.2d 621, 147 A.L.R. 574 (decided by the court now sitting); Oppenheimer v. F. J. Young Co., 2 Cir., 144 F.2d 387; Toomey v. Toomey, App.D.C., 149 F.2d 19; and Markham v. Kasper, 7 Cir., 152 F.2d 270. This carries out a federal policy going back to the early days of the Republic, which \u201chas shown no signs of weakness in recent years,\u201d the \u201cphilosophy\u201d of which \u201cis that many mistakes, apparently important at the time, will be seen to be trivial from the perspective of a final disposition of the case, and that disputes will therefore be more expeditiously settled.\u201d Perkins v. Endicott Johnson Corp., 2 Cir., 128 F.2d 208, 211, 212, affirmed Endicott Johnson Corp. v. Perkins, 317 U.S. 501, 63 S.Ct. 339, 87 L.Ed. 424. It is reiterated as a policy of desirable and affirmative substance \u201cagainst piecemeal litigation\u201d in Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 229, 233, 234, 65 S.Ct. 631, citing the Florian and other cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Defendants, however, assert that \u201cthere are two separate and distinct sets of facts involved in this case,'\u201d citing Reeves v. Beardall, 316 U.S. 283, 62 S.Ct. 1085, 86 L.Ed. 1478. But that case as-' sumed and relied on the general rule against splitting appeals, re-enforced in Federal Rule 54(b), in order to make the decision mad\u00e9 necessary under that rule as to whether the appeal there had been taken from one of two separate and distinct <em>claims, </em>based upon \u201cdiffering occurrences or transactions.\u201d It lends no countenance to the idea that differing defenses to the <em>same </em>claim may be reviewed in piecemeal fashion. That would mean that pleading rulings on a multitude of matters could be separately appealed, e. g., separate rulings concerning payment, release, statute of limitations, .estoppel, accord and satisfaction, and other matters stated in Federal Rule 8(c), all of which are more distinct from the main claim than is the defense here involved. For it is quite clear that the defendant of unclean hands need not be pleaded, but, since it goes to the heart of the plaintiffs case, may be taken up without affirmative claim therefor. Gynex Corp. v. Dilex Institute of Feminine Hygiene, 2 Cir., 85 F.2d 103, 106; General Electric Co. v. Hygrade Sylvania Corp., D.C.S.D.N.Y., 45 F.Supp. 714, 718, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">Indeed, the facts here must be examined to note how closely intertwined is this defense with the validity of the patent. Defendants\u2019 pleading itself, set forth in full in the note,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is rather blind; but the affidavits make clear what is meant. Plaintiff\u2019s patent, No. 2,056,462, is for an invention in the manufacture of molded articles from urea and formaldehyde. It has both product arid method claims, covering a.molding composition, or powder, made and sold by plaintiff, which, upon the application of heat and pressure according to the methods stated, may be shaped and hardened into plastic articl.es. Purchasers of the composition receive an implied license to use the process, while the grant of licenses under th\u00e9 method claim (of which two are now outstanding) is confined to those persons who purchase the composition. The legal claim is that this extends the monopo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>ly of the method claim beyond its scope and to the products made by the process; and there is cited the well-known series of cases culminating in Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Inv. Co., 320 U.S. 661, 64 S.Ct. 268, 88 L.Ed. 376, that the monopoly of a patent cannot be pressed to include an unpatented article. But Judge Bright, below, following Judge Leibell in General Electric Co. v. Hygrade Sylvania Corp., D.C.S.D.N.Y., 61 F.Supp. 531, did not see how this doctrine could apply, because the product itself was patented and there was no extension of the patent beyond what the patent grants. And this seemed to follow, because the combination of method and product claims in one patent is not illegal. Musher Foundation v. Alba Trading Co., 2 Cir., 150 F.2d 885, 889, certiorari denied Alba Trading Co. v. Musher Foundation, 66 S.Ct. 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">In fact, this seems to go beyond the doctrine of unclean hands and to go to the validity of the patent itself, for, unless these claims are invalid, plaintiff seemingly can rely upon express claims in the patent for everything it has or asserts. Of course we are not settling this issue, but only pointing to its vital significance on the main issue of patent validity and the lack of even as much possible basis as with some other defenses for asserting it to involve a \u201cdiffering occurrence or transaction\u201d from the one sued upon. As a matter of fact, defendants \u2014 even under their other defenses, as we have seen \u2014 may present any facts or law supporting their contentions to the court below until the judgment does become final. Western States Mach. Co. v. S. S. Hepworth Co., 2 Cir., 152 F.2d 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">In their memorandum of law to us defendants made a passing suggestion that their Third Defense was the type of claim which \u201ccould have been labeled a counterclaim\u201d or \u201ccould have been set forth as the complaint in an action against the plaintiff\u201d \u2014a contention exploited somewhat more in a supplemental memorandum. This is an afterthought not presented below, and should not be considered now, United States v. Bennett, 2 Cir., 152 F.2d 342, 349, and cases cited, particularly as the allegations are <em>not at all </em>adequate under cases such as Lances v. Letz, 2 Cir., 115 F.2d 916, and McCurrach v. Cheney Bros., 2 Cir., 152 F.2d 365, to support a claim for a declaratory judgment. Had the matter been raised below, however, the defendants would have faced an obvious dilemma. If they had gone so far as to state a counterclaim upon a differing occurrence or transaction so that judgment upon it would have been appealable under Federal Rule 54(b), it would have been merely a permissive counterclaim under Federal Rule 13(b), and hence would require separate grounds of jurisdiction and perhaps venue \u2014very likely lacking here. Derman v. Stor-Aid, Inc., 2 Cir., 141 F.2d 580; Lesnik v. Public Industrials Corp., 2 Cir., 144 F.2d 968; 1 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 695-700, id. 1945 Cum.Supp. 329-331; Crosley Corp. v. Westinghouse Electric &amp; Mfg. Co., 3 Cir., 130 F.2d 474, 476, certiorari denied Westinghouse Electric &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Crosley Corp., 317 U.S. 681, 63 S.Ct. 202, 87 L.Ed. 546; Leaver v. Parker, 9 Cir., 121 F.2d 738, certiorari denied Leaver v. Citizens Nat. Trust &amp; Savings Bank of Riverside, 314 U.S. 700, 62 S.Ct. 480, 86 L.Ed. 560. But if defendants kept to their contention made here that the patent was invalid, they would be met with the cases holding that a counterclaim asking for no more than a defendant\u2019s judgment on the original claim was a mere superfluity. See, e. g., Leach v. Ross Heater &amp; Mfg. Co., 2 Cir., 104 F.2d 88; Altvater v. Freeman, 319 U.S. 359, 364, 369, 63 S.Ct. 1115, 87 L.Ed. 1450; 1 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, 1945 Cum.Supp, 318-320.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Of course where jurisdiction exists and no question of separate appeal is involved, this question is not important. Cf. Barber Asphalt Corp. v. La Fera Grecco Contracting Co., 3 Cir., 116 F.2d 211. On the question of appeal, however, the case is not aided by the filing of a compulsory counterclaim, for it is now settled that dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>missal of such a counterclaim is not separately appealable. This question was directly raised and considered at length in Audi Vision, Inc. v. RCA Mfg. Co., supra, where the appeal was dismissed; and that case has been expressly cited and followed in Toomey v. Toomey and Markham v. Kasper, both supra. It is the view of Professor Moore, 3 Federal Practice, 1945 Cum.Supp. 55, 140, 141, and of the Advisory Committee, which has reframed and restated Federal Rule 54(b) around it. See Second Preliminary Draft of Proposed Amendments to Rules of Civil Procedure, May, 1945, 62, 63. It is true that earlier Jefferson Electric Co. v. Sola Electric Co., <em>7 </em>Cir., 122 F.2d 124, had held dismissal of such a counterclaim to be a final order; but as pointed out in the cases and authorities cited, the court appears to have been misled by the effect of Federal Rule 41 (b, c), making such a dismissal an adjudication upon the merits. It did not cite the more pertinent and decisive rule, 54(b). In that case the final judgment, resting on a different ground, <em>7 </em>Cir., 125 F.2d 322, was reversed for dismissal of the counterclaim in 317 U.S. 173, 63 S.Ct. 172, 87 L.Ed. 165; but since this point was not brought before the Supreme Court, the later proceedings are not significant here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> More recently, however, that Circuit cited and followed the ruling of the Audi Vision case in Markham v. Kasper, supra; and there seems now no dissent from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">The broadening of the scope of the civil action by the new civil rules led not unnaturally to some initial confusion as to the working of Federal Rule 54(b), which has now been settled by the precedents even without the Committee\u2019s proposed amendment. The law now carries out the historic federal policy. Of course there may be times when a quick appellate decision on a part of the case may be helpful, though one may expect that will rarely be so on the bitterly fought antitrust problems. But the policy is the fruit of experience and embodies a general judgment which is not to be cast aside for an occasional aberrant case. And the policy is more broadly based than merely upon the natural desire for the expeditious and direct way of handling a particular case; for it eschews the whole practice of encouraging appeals on rulings concerning the perfectibility of pleadings and the resulting emphasis upon pleading technicalities which ensues.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And even if there be individual judicial doubts about the policy, it nevertheless seems both desirable and necessary that it be followed; for that is the essence of a procedure uniform throughout the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-6\"> Overruling several cases, including United States v. 243.22 Acres of Land, 2 Cir., 129 F.2d 878, certiorari denied Lambert v.

Hence, not having occasion to do so, the Supreme Court did not pass on the question whether the counterclaim was compulsory or permissive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b871-10\">FRANK, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A1b\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">1. My colleagues, I think, have, brushed to one side at least seven recent decisions of the Supreme Court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> together with a half-dozen or more of our own, to reach a conclusion which, if it becomes a precedent, will seriously interfere with sound judicial administration of the patent and anti-trust laws. For it frustrates the policy, often recently announced by the Supreme Court, that the owner of a valid patent may not enforce it against infringers if the owner has abused tile patent monopoly by using it in a manner violative of the anti-trust laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">I shall try to show below (point 6) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>defendants\u2019 \u201cThird Defense\u201d should he treated as a counterclaim setting up such patent abuse. On that assumption, the crucial question in the instant case is this: When a defendant in a patent infringement suit interposes such a counterclaim, is it a \u201cpermissive\u201d or a \u201ccompulsory\u201d counterclaim? For everyone agrees that, if it is \u201cpermissive,\u201d a district court order dismissing it, leaving the balance of the case still to be tried, is separately appeal-able. Everyone agrees, too, that, if a counterclaim is not \u201ccompulsory,\u201d it is \u201cpermissive\u201d and that the following is the acid test in distinguishing the two: If a defendant fails to set up a \u201ccompulsory\u201d counterclaim, he cannot in. a later suit assert it against the plaintiff, since it is barred by res judicata; but if it is \u201cpermissive,\u201d then it is not thus barred. To put it differently, if a counterclaim is the kind not thus barred, it is \u201cpermissive.\u201d We have recently employed that test; see Clair v. Kastar, 2 Cir., 138 F.2d 828, 830; See also Moore, Federal Practice, 682; Clark, Code Pleading, 447; Big Cola Corp. v. World Bottling Co., 6 Cir., 134 F.2d 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Now in Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Inv. Co., 320 U.S. 661, 64 S.Ct. 268, 88 L.Ed. 376, the Supreme Court squarely held that, if a defendant omits to assert a pat-tent-abuse defense or counterclaim, res judicata does not prevent him from asserting it in a subsequent infringement suit against him on the same patent. By the decisive (res judicata) test, such a counterclaim is accordingly \u201cpermissive.\u201d In \u2019the light of the foregoing, I see no escape from the conclusion that an order dismissing a patent-abuse counterclaim is separately .appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">That reasoning seems to me to compel a decision that the district court\u2019s order here' is now properly before us on defendants\u2019 appeal. But, as my colleagues do not agree, I think it desirable to expand my reasoning, first, however, for clarity, stating the facts to include some omitted from my colleagues\u2019 opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">2. Defendants set up in their answer alternative defenses \u2014 (a) that the patent is invalid and not infringed by them and, (b), in their \u201cThird Defense,\u201d that, even if the patent is valid and infringed, nevertheless plaintiff is not entitled to enforce it because, in dealings with persons other than defendants, plaintiff has abused the patent monopoly in violation of the antitrust laws. Defendants\u2019 answer concluded with a prayer \u201cfor such other and further relief as the court may deem just.\u201d Plaintiff moved to dismiss this patent-abuse part of the defendants' answer, urging that it failed \u201cto state a claim upon which relief can be granted,\u201d and the judge\u2019s opinion shows that he regarded that as the question before him. Defendants, at the same time, moved for summary judgment on that claim. Both sides filed affidavits from which the district court concluded that \u201cthe facts material to the defense are not disputed.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Those were facts which, having to do entirely with the way plaintiff did business with third persons not parties to the suit, in no way appeared on the face of plaintiff\u2019s complaint, or on the face of the patent, and which could not legitimately constitute any part of plaintiff\u2019s or defendants\u2019 proofs on the issues of patent validity and infringement. The district judge held the patent-abuse (\u201cunclean hands\u201d) defense \u201cgood as a pleading\u201d but insufficient \u201con the merits.\u201d He denied the motion for summary judgment and entered an order which dismissed defendants\u2019 claim (again, \u201con the merits\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As all the facts bearing on the issue, of patent-abuse were thus undisputed and before the district court, the dismissal order left defendants with no way of amending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>their pleadings so as to revive that issue in the district court, prior to the trial on the other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">The consequence is that, so far as the district court is concerned, the patent-abuse issue has been as completely disposed of as if it had been separately tried and as if final separate judgment thereon had been entered against defendants. On the motion now before us \u2014 to dismiss defendants\u2019 appeal, not from the denial of summary judgment but solely from the dismissal order- \u2014 we must assume, arguendo, that the district court\u2019s order was erroneous on the merits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Making that assumption, as we must, it follows that, if that order is not now reversed, defendants will be forced to go to trial \u2014 ex hypothesi, uselessly \u2014 on the distinct issues of patent invalidity and infringement, usually a most expensive process. My colleagues, however, hold that no other course is open to defendants, i. e., that defendants cannot have this court pass on the order dismissing the patent-abuse claim until a trial has been concluded on the other issues and judgment has been entered thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">3. This conclusion results from the fact that my colleagues hold that a defense of patent-abuse is like a defense of payment or statute of limitations, and that therefore, if regarded as a counterclaim, it is \u201ccompulsory.\u201d They reach that conclusion by disregarding the procedural decision in Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Inv. Co., 320 U.S. 661, 64 S.Ct. 268, 88 L.Ed. 376. There the defendant, Mercoid, when sued as a contributory infringer, by plaintiff, Mid-Continent, pleaded, both in its answer and in a counterclaim, that Mid-Continent and its exclusive licensee had conspired to expand the patent monopoly in violation of the anti-trust laws. Mercoid had been privy to a previous suit in which the patent had been held valid, but the patent-abuse defense had not been interposed in that case, although Mercoid then knew all the pertinent facts concerning it. The Supreme Court held that the judgment in the prior suit did not constitute res judicata so as to bar either the defense or the counterclaim in the second suit. It seems inescapable, then, that such a counterclaim is \u201cpermissive,\u201d not \u201ccompulsory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">My colleagues casually remark that the Mercoid case did not involve the question of the separate appealability of an order dismissing the counterclaim. But that remark is pointless. For, as the patent-abuse counterclaim was there held \u201cpermissive\u201d (i. e., not barred by res judicata), it necessarily follows that, had it been dismissed by a separate order in advance of the disposition of the rest' of the suit, it would have been appealable forthwith. No one will dispute, I think, the following statement made by Moore, Federal Practice, p. 700: \u201cUnlike compulsory counterclaims upon which separate judgments cannot be entered, a judgment may be entered on a permissive counterclaim before, after, or at the same time judgment is entered upon the original claim. This is permitted by Rule 54(b) because the permissive counterclaim is, as frequently pointed out, essentially an independent action. But \u2018In case a separate judgment is so entered, the court by order may stay its enforcement until the entering of a subsequent judgment or judgments and may prescribe such conditions as are necessary to secure the benefits thereof to the party in whose favor the judgment is entered.\u2019 [Rule 54(b)] This in no way affects the right of appeal. The judgment on the permissive counterclaim becomes appealable when entered, and the time for appeal begins to run from the entry of such judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">Moore\u2019s comment is supported by Rules 13(b) and 54(b). 13(b) defines a \u201cpermissive\u201d counterclaim as one \u201cnot arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s claim\u201d; and 54(b) authorizes a separate judgment \u201cwhen more than one claim for relief is presented in an action,\u201d upon a determination of the issues material to a claim and all counterclaims \u201carising out of the transaction or occurrence which is the subject matter of the claim.\u201d Thus the controlling phrase, \u201carising out of the transaction or occurrence,\u201d appears in both 13(b) and 54(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">In Reeves v. Beardall, 316 U.S. 283, 62 S.Ct. 1085, 1087, 86 L.Ed. 1478, the Court, relying on 54(b), held appealable an order which, leaving two of plaintiff\u2019s claims pending, dismissed another \u201centirely distinct claim\u201d arising \u201cout of wholly separate and distinct transactions\u201d; the Court said that if \u201ca judgment has been entered which terminates the action with respect to such a claim, it is final for purposes of appeal under \u00a7 128 of the Judicial Code [28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 225].\u201d In the light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>presence in both Rules of the same controlling phrase, the ruling in Reeves v. Beardall, supra, renders an order dismissing a \u201cpermissive\u201d counterclaim a separate judgment, separately appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Toomey v. Toomey, App.D.C,, 149 F.2d 19, 20, so recognized. There the Court s\u00e1id: \u201cBefore the Rules were adopted the dismissal of any counterclaim, leaving the plaintiff\u2019s claim pending, did not have the effect of a final judgment. But the Rules 'indicate a \u201cdefinite policy\u201d * * * to permit the entry of separate judgments where the claims are \u201centirely distinct.\u201d <em>* * * </em>Such a separate judgment will frequently be a final judgment and appealable, though no disposition has been made of the other claims in the action.\u2019 Reeves v. Beardall, 316 U.S. 283, 285, 62 S.Ct. 1085, 86 L.Ed. 1478. The same may be said of claims <em>and counterclaims </em>which are entirely distinct.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Audi-Vision, Inc. v. RCA Mfg. Co., 2 Cir., 136 F.2d 621, 623, 147 A.L.R. 574,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Markham v. Kasper, <em>7 </em>Cir., 152 F.2d 270,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> cited by my colleagues, are not in point, for each of, these cases dealt with an obviously \u201ccompulsory\u201d counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">The foregoing shows, I think, that my colleagues err in saying that a defense of patent-abuse is like a defense of payment; an order striking the latter defense would, of course, not be appealable separately, for it arises out of the same transaction as the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Mercoid makes it plain that patent-abuse is not similarly intertwined with the patent owner\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">4. The Mercoid case merely made explicit what already was implicit in Sola Electric Co. v. Jefferson Electric Co., 317 U.S. 173, 63 S.Ct. 172, 87 L.Ed. 165. The latter case was decided some seven months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>after Reeves v. Beardall, when the procedural question there involved must still have been vividly in the minds of the Supreme Court Justices. In the Jefferson Electric case, the plaintiff sued for royalties alleged to be due from defendant under a patent license. Defendant set up in a counterclaim that certain of the patent claims were invalid, referring to a provision of the license that gave plaintiff control of the prices at which defendant could sell the patented product; defendant argued that this provision was illegal. On plaintiff\u2019s motion, the district court dismissed the counterclaim. Defendant appealed and plaintiff moved (as does plaintiff here) to dismiss the appeal, urging that it was not from a final, but from an interlocutory order. The Circuit Court denied the motion, Jefferson Electric Co. v. Sola Electric Co., 7 Cir., 122 F.2d 124. Subsequently, when it heard the appeal on the merits, the Circuit Court held for the plaintiff on the ground that defendant, as licensee, was estopped to contest the patent\u2019s validity; 7 Cir., 125 F.2d 322. The Supreme Court, having granted certiorari (316 U.S. 652, 62 S.Ct. 946, 86 L.Ed. 1733), reversed and remanded. Citing Morton Salt Co. v. Suppiger, 314 U.S. 488, 489, 62 S.Ct. 402, 86 L.Ed. 363, it held that, because of the price control provision, the license was illegal, as a violation of the anti-trust laws, unless the patent was valid, and that therefore the defendant was not estopped to assert the patent\u2019s invalidity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">The Supreme Court significantly did not reverse on the procedural ground \u2014 of lack of finality of the district court\u2019s order \u2014 but on the merits, although (as in the case here at bar) the district court\u2019s order had left the balance of the suit undisposed of and still to be tried.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> My colleagues say that the Supreme Court was unaware of the unfinished state of the case existing when the district court\u2019s order was entered. That, I think, is a curious suggestion. For the second opinion of the Circuit Court on the merits (7 Cir., 125 F.2d 322, at page 323), which the Supreme Court was reviewing, expressly said: \u201cThe appeal now before us is from a ruling of the District Court striking a counterclaim filed by the defendant. This counterclaim alleged invalidity of the patents under which appellant held the license. We have therefore overruled a petition filed by appellee to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the order was not an appealable one, but was merely an interlocutory one which neither granted, denied nor dissolved an injunction. Jefferson Electric Co. v. Sola Electric Co., 7 Cir., 122 F.2d 124.\u201d It should be noted that in the procedural part of the Mercoid opinion the Supreme Court cited the Jefferson Electric case. See Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continental Inv. Co., 320 U.S. 661, at page 670, 64 S.Ct. 268, 88 L.Ed. 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">In Jefferson Electric, the price-fixing provision of the license appeared on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, so that, before Mercoid, it might conceivably have been argued that the counterclaim was \u201ccompulsory.\u201d Here, however, as in Mercoid, the facts on which defendants rely to show patent-abuse can nowhere be found in plaintiff\u2019s complaint and are quite distinct from the facts there set forth. Consequently, the Mercoid case and Reeves v. Beardall are even closer to this case than to Jefferson Electric Co. v. Sola Electric Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">In Audi Vision, Inc. v. RCA Mfg. Co., 2 Cir., 136 F.2d 621, 623, 147 A.L.R. 574, the majority opinion criticized the Seventh Circuit for not dismissing the appeal in the Jefferson Electric case. That critical comment in the Audi Vision Case, however, was but dictum, since it was not at all a necessary basis of this court\u2019s decision, which dealt with an obviously \u201ccompulsory\u201d counterclaim; moreover, that dictum, which overlooked the fact that the Supreme Court had entertained the Jefferson Electric appeal, was uttered six months before the Mercoid decision.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>5. <em>My </em>colleagues say that, even if the Third Defense be regarded as a \u201cpermissive\u201d counterclaim, it must be dismissed for lack of federal jurisdiction. Surely not: The Mercoid case (320 U.S. at page 671, 64 S.Ct. 268, 88 L.Ed. 376) holds squarely that a federal court has jurisdiction of a counterclaim for patent-abuse since it is founded on a violation of the anti-trust laws. See 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 41(1) (c) and (23); 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 15; Barber Asphalt Corp. v. La Fera Grecco Co., 3 Cir., 116 F.2d 211, 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">We have recently held that, in the case of a \u201cpermissive\u201d counterclaim, venue requirements need not be satisfied. Lesnick v. Public Industrials Corp., 2 Cir., 144 F.2d 968; see also General Electric Co. v. Marvel Rare Metals Co., 287 U.S. 430, 53 S.Ct. 202, 77 L.Ed. 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">6. My colleagues say, however, that the arguments advanced by defendants in support of their \u201cThird Defense\u201d show that it is but an indirect way of pleading the patent\u2019s invalidity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Thus my colleagues speak of \u201cdefendants\u2019 * * * ' contention made here that the patent was invalid.\u201d) I pass the question of the soundness of those decisions which held separately appealable an order dismissing a counterclaim which contests patent validity,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as that question is academic here. For my colleagues wholly' misdescribe the position taken by defendants on the merits, as to their \u201cThird Defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Contrary to what my colleagues say, defendants did not in the district court or here assert, in support of their \u201cThird Defense,\u201d that the mere inclusion in the patent of a method claim and a product claim constituted an illegal use of the patent or rendered it invalid. They have asserted that plaintiff, in its exploitation of the patent, discriminatorily granted licenses to third persons under the method claim in a manner which unlawfully extended its patent monopoly, a fact not apparent on the face of plaintiff\u2019s complaint or germane to the issues of patent invalidity or infringement. In their brief in this court in opposition to the motion to dismiss this appeal, defendants say: \u201cThese facts, which are not disputed, show how plaintiff and its licensees have improperly conducted their businesses, and how such practices interfere with the sale by defendants of their molding powder. On the other hand, proof on the questions of validity and infringement is entirely different.\u201d In his opinion, the district judge described as follows defendants\u2019 position: \u201cThe specific claim' made by defendants is that plaintiff has misused its patent by extending the monopoly granted under the method claims to the control of products not patented by such-claims. * * * Defendants\u2019 argument, * * * is that plaintiff and its licensees sell a product not within or protected by the monopoly granted by the method claims of the patent, and by the sale of the product, plaintiff granted to purchasers a. royalty free license to carry out the patentee\u2019 process; neither plaintiff nor its licensees use the process; and the license rights granted under the method claims are con-, tingent on the purchase from it of the product. Thus, it is said, plaintiff uses the. method claims to extend the monopoly thereby granted to aid it in selling the product.\u201d And plaintiff well understood that, in their \u201cThird Defense,\u201d defendants were not assailing the validity of the patent but its use by plaintiff, for plaintiff said in its brief in the district court: \u201cIn dealing with questions of \u2018misuse\u2019 of the patent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>monopoly it is necessary to consider the patent owner\u2019s method of doing business in relation to the scope of the monopoly granted by the patent. Such an inquiry is directed primarily to the interplay between the patent owner\u2019s course of business and his use of his patent rights, with a view to ascertaining whether the result of the interplay is the creation of a monopoly not granted by the patent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">If (as I think we should) we were to refuse to dismiss the appeal and were to deal with the merits, we might find that, on the facts, defendants\u2019 patent-abuse defense is legally unsound, in which event defendants would be remitted to their other defenses in the district court, including that of invalidity of the patent;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but we should, not on the present motion, explore the question whether or not the facts disclose anti-trust violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">7. Especially as defendants concluded their answer with a prayer for general relief .(i. e., \u201cfor such other and further relief, * * * \u201d), a prayer not found in the conventional answer, I think we must construe their \u201cThird Defense\u201d as a counterclaim asking a declaratory judgment and damages. Not only did the plaintiff and the district judge treat it as a demand for affirmative relief, in saying that it \u201cfailed ,to state a claim upon which relief can be \u25a0granted,7 \u2022 but the Rules, I think, also so require.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">Thus Rule 54(c) \u2014 one of the vaunted achievements of the procedural reformers \u2014wisely provides that a party is to receive the relief to which the facts he pleads entitle him, even if he has not demanded such relief.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> My colleagues in the instant case cold-shoulder that Rule on the ground that defendants\u2019 contention that their claim of patent-abuse is a counterclaim, constituted \u201can after-thought not presented below.\u201d This is a singular suggestion, since this court (per Judge Clark) has gone extremely far in generously granting relief to a bewildered party on the basis of an \u201cafterthought\u201d which did not even occur to the party but which was conceived, on appeal, by this court itself. See Dioguardi v. Durning, 2 Cir., 139 F.2d 774, 775; and especially Truth Seeker Co. v. Durning, 2 Cir., 147 F.2d 54, 56, where we stressed the fact that plaintiff prayed for \u201csuch other and further relief, etc.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> I think we should do at least as much for the defendants here.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-14\">My colleagues have here, for some unexplained reason, neglected Rule 8(f) which reads; \u201cAll pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice,.\u201d and Rule 8(c) which provides: \u201cWhen a party has mistakenly designated * * * a counterclaim as a defense, the court on terms, if justice so requires, shall treat the pleading as if there had been a proper designation.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Surely here \u201cjustice so re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>quires,\u201d if we are to heed what the Supreme Court said in Mercoid and related cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">In the Mercoid case, the Supreme Court, after stating the policy forbidding judicial approval of a \u201cscheme which involves a misuse of the patent privilege and a violation of the anti-trust laws;\u201d said (320 U.S. 670, 64 S.Ct. 273, 88 L.Ed. 376): \u201cAnd the determination of that policy is not \u2018at the mercy\u2019 of the parties * * * nor dependent on the usual rules governing the settlement of private litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> That policy calls, I think, for this conclusion: When the issue of patent-abuse becomes apparent to the court, it should, if practicable, be decided at the outset of the suit, i. e., in advance of the trial of the other issues, and the court\u2019s decision on that threshold issue should be appealable at .once, because, if the patentee is guilty of abusing the patent, he should not be allowed to compel the defendant to go to the trouble and expense of defending the suit for enforcement of the patent.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This is no light matter, for it -is well known that the notoriously great cost of such a defense has often induced alleged infringers to' accept licenses on onerous terms rather than to engage in litigation, with the result that \u201cspurious\u201d patents, uncontested, substantially reduce competition.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> That policy, expressed frequently in recent years by the Supreme Court,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> which would prevent such injury to the public, my colleagues\u2019 decision frustrates.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">Their decision stems, I. think, from a confusion of two doctrines relating to appeals. The first doctrine \u2014 announced in cases like Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.S. 323, 60 S.Ct. 540, 84 L.Ed. 783; Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 229, 65 S.Ct. 631; United States v. Florian, 312 U.S. 656, 61 S.Ct. 713, 85 L.Ed. 1105, and Endicott Johnson Corp. v. Perkins, 317 U.S. 501, 63 S.Ct. 339, 87 L.Ed. 424, affirming Perkins v. Endicott Johnson Corp., 2 Cir., 128 F.2d 208 \u2014 in order to \u201cprotect from delay the progress of the trial,\u201d bars an appeal from an order, made in the course of a suit not yet concluded, when the appeal will lead to \u201cthe piecemeal disposition of what for practical purposes is a single controversy,\u201d and will result in \u201cseparate reviews of the component elements in a unified cause.\u201d The second doctrine \u2014 announced in cases like Reeves v. Beardall, supr\u00e1, and in many of our own decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>.such as, e. g., Collins v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp., 2 Cir., 106 F.2d 83, Lewis v. Vendome Bags, 2 Cir., 108 F.2d 16, and Zalkind v. Scheinman, 2 Cir., 139 F.2d 895 \u2014 again in order to discourage delays, permits an immediate appeal from an order dismissing one of two distinct claims \u201carising out of wholly separate and distinct transactions.\u201d Because they fail to observe that these two doctrines are designed, each in its own way, to yield expedition, my colleagues would, in effect, do away with the second by absorbing it in the first \u2014all in the interest of alleged \u201cuniform\u201d procedure. It is the second of these doctrines which, I think, should govern here: Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Inv. Co., plus Jefferson Electric Co. v. Sola Electric Co. plus Reeves v. Beardall equals this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">8. By referring several times to the dictum in Audi Vision, Inc. v. RCA Mfg. Co., supra, my colleagues seem to suggest (perhaps I am wrong) that the district court's dismissal order was interlocutory because the court did not use the talismanic term \u201cjudgment\u201d or \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Never until today has this court dismissed an appeal on that ground. In Sidis v. F-R Pub. Corp., 2 Cir., 113 F.2d 806, 138 A.L.R. 15, the district court\u2019s order merely dismissed two causes of action (leaving another to be tried) without stating that the order was a judgment or final;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> this court refused to dismiss the appeal. Similarly, we refused to dismiss an appeal from a like order, again not denominated as final or a judgment,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> in Musher Foundation v. Alba, 2 Cir., 127 F.2d 9; and so in Zalkind v. Scheinman, 2 Cir., 139 F.2d 895.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Nor can I understand why the mere wording of the district court\u2019s order should determine whether it is appealable. For Rule 54(a) says: \u201c \u2018Judgment\u2019 as used in these rules includes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies.\u201d The order here was one which, to quote Rule 54(b), \u201cupon a determination of the issues material to a particular claim,\u201d proceeded to the point of \u201cdisposing of such claim,\u201d its effect being to \u201cterminate the action with respect to the claim so disposed of\u201d so that the action would \u201cproceed as to the remaining claims.\u201d It was therefore \u201ca separate judgment,\u201d within Rule 54(b), although called an \u201corder.\u201d True, Rule 54(b) adds, \u201cIn case a separate judgment is so entered, the court by order may stay its enforcement until the entering of a subsequent judgment or judgments. *' * * \u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> But here the judge entered no stay order.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AuQ\"> Morton Salt Co. v.

The contract contained a cancellation clause giving defendant a right to cancel on written notice, and defendant had given such notice. Anticipating a defense based on the cancellation clause, plaintiff in its complaint alleged that defendant had conspired with one of plaintiff\u2019s employees to deprive plaintiff of the benefit of the contract and that defendant had received all the benefits of the contract, notwithstanding its claimed cancellation. In its answer, defendant relied on the cancellation clause. Defendant also pleaded two counterclaims. In the first counterclaim, it relied ou the same clause, alleging that the expenses incurred by plaintiff before the \u25a0cancellation did not exceed $1500 and that therefore defendant was entitled to a refund (with interest) of the sum of $1740 initially paid plaintiff by defendant. Defendant\u2019s second counterclaim set up an account of goods delivered, showing $1454.61 still due. Plaintiff, in reply, challenged only the first counterclaim. On depositions taken by both sides, defendant moved for summary judgment \u25a0dismissing the complaint and for judgment on the proceedings as to the second counterclaim. The district court granted the motion. In its opinion it said that defendant\u2019s liability for time nnd expense incurred before cancellation \u201cis put in issue by the first counterclaim and the reply will be determined by a trial of that issue.\u201d The first counterclaim was then on the trial calendar awaiting trial. Defendant stipulated that plaintiff\u2019s daim to a refund of some $810 \u201cshall be tried together with the [first] counterclaim.\u201d Plaintiff appealed, conceding the validity of the judgment for defendant on the second counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah-\">This court dismissed the appeal as premature. Noting that the sole issue on the appeal was the district court\u2019s order dismissing plaintiff\u2019s claim, this court said: \u201cIn the present ease it can hardly be questioned that the tests of finality have not been met. In fact, the claims [i. e. plaintiff\u2019s claim and defendant\u2019s first counterclaim] are so connected that they turn upon the proper meaning and application of a single sentence in a lengthy written contract \u2014 the cancellation clause quoted above. Clearly the counterclaim here involved was a compulsory one within the moaning of Rule 13(a), which had to be pleaded in this action if it was to be pressed at all. Having been pleaded, it takes its force entirely from this provision of the contract, which is a vital element of plaintiffs\u2019 case, first as a possible bar to recovery of the contract price, and second as a basis for the claim of,an additional allowance for expenses. Complete adjudication of either claim or counterclaim therefore, cannot be had without continued resort to this sentences.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"Ae7\"> See note. 8a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b875-6\"> Cf.

Kasper, 152 F.2d 270, the Seventh Circuit overruled its procedural decision in the Jefferson Electric ease. I \u2022cannot agree. The Markham opinion does not mention Jefferson Electric. I have examined the record and briefs in Markham. There, in a suit to quiet title, the district court\u2019s order struck out a defense, based on an alleged compromise, which the defendants had set up, substantially in duplicate, both in their answer and in a so-called counterclaim; moving to dismiss the appeal, plaintiff\u2019s lawyer in the Markham case in his brief distinguished Jefferson Electric on the ground that the district court\u2019s dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>order in Markham did not deny defendants liberty to amend their pleadings and they had not elected to stand on them. Cf. Oppenheimer v. F. J. Young &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 144 F.2d 387, 388. Moreover, the stricken defensive matter in Markham related directly to dealings between the parties to the suit; the \u201ccounterclaim,\u201d if it was such, was \u201ccompulsory\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b876-10\"> In so saying, my colleagues indulge in a discussion of the merits, going so far as to cite with apparent approval a district court decision in another case said to be in accord with the substantive ruling below. I shall not follow the example of my colleagues in discussing the merits, first, because this court has rocently held that such a course is improper on a motion to dismiss an appeal\u2014 Zalkind v. Scheinman, 2 Cir., 139 F.2d 895 at 904 and second, because it is unfair to the parties, neither side having as yet, in this court, filed a brief on the substantive issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"ASB\"> Dominion Electric Manufacturing Co. v.

Plaintiff appealed, seeking a decision for costs alone. If regard were had solely to plaintiff\u2019s theory of its case, it was bound .to lose. But we held that the suit should be treated as one for return of tire books or, in the alternative for damages \u2014 a thought never intimated by plaintiff in the district court or on appeal \u2014 and remanded for trial, thus ensuring plaintiff al least nominal damages and the desired costs.</p>\n<p id=\"AcZ\">In Cook v.

I cannot understand that logic. Proof of validity involves the prior art (or the like) and proof of infringement involves the defendants\u2019 conduct, but proof of patent-abuso concerns the plaintiff\u2019s conduct extrinsic to the patent, and usually, as here, plaintiff\u2019s dealings with third persons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"ARL\"> See, e. g., Precision Co. v.
