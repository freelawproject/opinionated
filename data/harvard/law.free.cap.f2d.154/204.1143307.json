This appeal is from a summary judgment for the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-24\">Appellant had filed with the Board a claim to insurance benefits as the widow of a wage-earner. The Board had found, on conflicting evidence, that appellant was not \u201cliving with\u201d the wage-earner at the time of his death and therefore was not entitled to benefits. 53 Stat. 1365, \u00a7 202(e) (1), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402(e) (1), 53 Stat. 1378, \u00a7 209(n), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 409(n). The Board filed in the District Court a certified copy of the record, including the evidence on which the Board\u2019s findings and judgment were based. The proceedings before the court were a review of that record, not a trial de novo. Since the evidence in support of the Board\u2019s findings of fact was substantial, those findings were conclusive. 53 Stat. 1370, \u00a7 205(g), 42 U.S. C. A. \u00a7 405(g). The District Court was therefore right in entering summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
