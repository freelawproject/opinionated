Such a provision, which has prototypes in many other federal criminal statutes, is clearly valid. See Ventimiglia v. Aderhold, Warden, D. C., 51 F.2d 308. The motion to vacate the sentence is thus lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-25\">The judgment of the District Court is, accordingly, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
