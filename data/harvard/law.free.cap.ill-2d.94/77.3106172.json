The appellate court, by order (100 Ill. App. 3d 1201), reversed, finding that the legal guardian did not receive proper notice of the proceedings. We allowed the State\u2019s petition for leave to appeal.</p> <p id=\"b152-13\" pgmap=\"152(29) 153(7)\">This case presents one issue: Is the jurisdiction of the circuit court properly invoked when the State fails to name or notify a court-appointed guardian of a minor in a proceeding brought against the guardian\u2019s charge?</p> <p id=\"b153-5\" pgmap=\"153\">On September 25, 1980, the court, in proceedings not relevant to this case, found that the parents were unable to care for the minor and appointed, as legal guardian over the minor, the Guardian Administrator of the Department of Children and Family Services (guardian). The guardian placed the minor in the temporary care of his mother while it sought alternate placement.</p> <p id=\"b153-6\" pgmap=\"153\">On October 16, 1980, a petition charging the minor with theft was filed. Supplemental petitions charging other thefts were filed on November 12 and 25, 1980. These three petitions named the minor and his parents as respondents, but not the guardian. The minor and his mother were served with each of the three petitions. The father\u2019s address was listed on the petitions only as Los Angeles, California. He was neither served with summons nor given notice by any means of the October 16 or November 12 petitions. He was given notice by publication of the November 25 petition. No summons was served on the guardian.</p> <p id=\"b153-7\" pgmap=\"153\">A temporary detention order was entered on November 25, 1980, which ordered the minor into the temporary custody of the Juvenile Detention Center. This order permitted release of the minor to the custody of the guardian for screening. In addition, the order referred to the three petitions served on the minor and his mother and set the date for the adjudicatory hearing.</p> <p id=\"b153-8\" pgmap=\"153\">The adjudicatory hearing was held on December 15, 1980. The minor, his attorney, his mother, and the State\u2019s Attorney were present. The guardian was not. The minor admitted to the theft charge alleged in the October 16 petition, and upon motion by the State, the other two petitions were dismissed. The court found the minor to be delinquent and adjudged him a ward of the court.</p> <p id=\"b153-9\" pgmap=\"153(8) 154(67)\">The initial dispositional hearing took place on Decernber 22, 1980. At this hearing, the guardian\u2019s caseworker appeared for the first time in the proceedings. The matter was continued until January 15, 1981. On this date, after reviewing the minor\u2019s record and the evidence presented, the court terminated the guardianship and committed the minor to the Department of Corrections, Juvenile Division, for an indefinite term not to exceed his 21st birthday.</p> <p id=\"b154-5\" pgmap=\"154\">The State maintains that the wording of section 4\u2014 1(2)(d) of the Juvenile Court Act (Act) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 37, par. 704 \u2014 1(2)(d)) requires that the petition name as respondent either the legal guardian or the person having custody or control over the minor. Since the minor was living with his mother when the petitions were filed, the State reasons that the mother was a \u201cperson having custody or control of the minor.\u201d It concludes, therefore, that since the mother was named as a respondent and served, there was no longer any statutory requirement to name and serve the legal guardian.</p> <p id=\"b154-6\" pgmap=\"154\">The State further claims that the guardian had de facto notice of the proceeding through the November 25 temporary detention order. We find nothing in the record, however, to indicate that the guardian received a copy of this order. The State also asserts that the guardian had defacto notice based on its caseworker\u2019s involvement with the minor. Finally, the State contends that the guardian was not deprived of an opportunity to participate in the proceedings and that neither the minor nor the guardian was prejudiced by the lack of formal notice.</p> <p id=\"b154-7\" pgmap=\"154(68) 155(172)\">The minor responds that the guardian was appointed after the court had found the parents unfit or unable to care for him and removed him from their custody. The minor asserts that the State\u2019s interpretation of section 4 \u2014 1(2)(d) is at odds with the purpose of appointing a guardian, which is \u201cto make important decisions in matters having a permanent effect on the life and development of the minor ***.\u201d (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 37, par. 701 \u2014 11.) Moreover, he contends that the State\u2019s interpretation conflicts with the due process requirements of juvenile proceedings as set out by the Supreme Court in In re Gault (1967), 387 U.S. 1, 18 L. Ed. 2d 527, 87 S. Ct. 1428. He also claims the State\u2019s reading of section 4 \u2014 1(2)(d) is in conflict with this court\u2019s interpretation of that section. He points out that in In re J.W. (1981), 87 Ill. 2d 56, 60, it was said: \u201cEvery parent, legal guardian, and custodian, or when necessary the nearest relative, must be named as a respondent in the case. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 37, par. 704 \u2014 1.)\u201d The minor further maintains that the failure to name the guardian as a party respondent deprived the guardian of its \u201cright to be present, to be heard, to present evidence material to the proceedings, [and] to cross-examine witnesses ***.\u201d Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 37, par. 701-20(1).</p> <p id=\"b155-5\" pgmap=\"155\">Due process of law requires that notice in juvenile proceedings be equivalent to that constitutionally required in criminal or civil cases. (In re Gault (1967), 387 U.S. 1, 18 L. Ed. 2d 527, 87 S. Ct. 1428.) This constitutional mandate is enumerated in sections 4 \u2014 1 to 4 \u2014 4 of the Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 37, pars. 704 \u2014 1 to 704 \u2014 4), which set out the requirements for valid notice. Section 4 \u2014 1(2) lists those interested parties who must be named as respondents. This section provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b155-6\" pgmap=\"155(129) 156(14)\">\u201cThe petition shall *** set forth (a) facts sufficient to bring the minor under Section 2 \u2014 1; (b) the name, age and residence of the minor; (c) the names and residences of his parents; (d) the name and residence of his legal guardian or the person or persons having custody or control of the minor, or of the nearest known relative if no parent or guardian can be found; and (e) if the minor upon whose behalf the petition is brought is detained or sheltered in custody, the date on which detention or shelter care was ordered by the court or the date set for a detention or shelter care hearing. If any of the facts herein required are not known by the petitioner, the petition shall so state.\u201d (Emphasis added.) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 37, par. 704-1(2).)</blockquote> <p id=\"b156-6\" pgmap=\"156\">While subsection (d) reads in the disjunctive, we note that the entire section reads in the conjunctive. A petition filed pursuant to section 4 \u2014 1(2) is required to set forth facts for each of the subsections or else indicate that such facts are unknown.</p> <p id=\"b156-7\" pgmap=\"156\">The question to determine here is whether the mother had custody or control of the minor as contemplated by the Act. If she did not, then the guardian was required to be named as a respondent.</p> <p id=\"b156-8\" pgmap=\"156\">The Act provides that custody or guardianship granted thereunder continues until the court otherwise directs (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 37, par. 705 \u2014 7(5)). The minor or any person interested in the minor may apply to the court for a change in custody of the minor or for restoration of the minor to the custody of his parents. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 37, par. 705 \u2014 8(3).) Moreover, \u201c[wjhenever the Department [of Children and Family Services] discharges a minor from its care and service, the Guardianship Administrator of the Department shall petition the court for an order terminating guardianship.\u201d Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 37, par. 705-7(1)(f).</p> <p id=\"b156-9\" pgmap=\"156\">Under the Act, guardianship of the person of a minor includes \u201cthe rights and responsibilities of legal custody except where legal custody has been vested in another person or agency.\u201d (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 37, par. 701\u2014 11(c).) \u201cLegal custody\u201d means the relationship created by an order of court which imposes on the custodian the responsibility of physical possession of a minor, the duty to protect, train and discipline him and to provide him with food, shelter, education and ordinary medical care. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 37, par. 701-12.</p> <p id=\"b156-10\" pgmap=\"156(40) 157(15)\">Neither the minor, the minor\u2019s mother, the guardian, nor any other interested party ever filed a petition with the circuit court seeking a change in custody prior to the filing of the three petitions at issue here. Legal custody of the minor was never removed from the guardian and restored to the minor\u2019s mother.</p> <p id=\"b157-5\" pgmap=\"157\">The mother, at the time the petitions were filed, did not have the status of a person having custody or control over the minor as the State urges. She was properly named a respondent pursuant to section 4 \u2014 1(2)(c) because she was a parent. However, the mother could not be named under section 4 \u2014 1(2)(d) as an alternative to naming the legal guardian. Section 4 \u2014 1(2)(d) required that the petitions filed in this case name the guardian as a necessary party respondent.</p> <p id=\"b157-6\" pgmap=\"157\">The notice provisions of the Act further provide that \u201c[a] summons shall be directed to the minor and to each person named as a respondent in the petition.\u201d (Emphasis added.) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 37, par. 704 \u2014 3(1).) A pleading that does not name and notify a necessary respondent in a juvenile proceeding fails to invoke the jurisdiction of the court and thereby renders its orders void. See People ex rel. McEntee v. Lynch (1906), 223 Ill. 346; In re R.P. (1981), 97 Ill. App. 3d 889; In re C.G. (1979), 69 Ill. App. 3d 56.</p> <p id=\"b157-7\" pgmap=\"157\">Here, as earlier stated, the State neither named nor notified the guardian of the December 15 adjudicatory hearing. By not doing so, the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction was not properly invoked and its order of December 15 and subsequent orders were void.</p> <p id=\"b157-8\" pgmap=\"157\">The judgment of the appellate court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b157-9\" pgmap=\"157\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\"> <author id=\"b157-10\" pgmap=\"157\">JUSTICE GOLDENHERSH,</author> <p id=\"A4B\" pgmap=\"157\">specially concurring:</p> <p id=\"b157-11\" pgmap=\"157(72) 158(38)\">I agree that because the guardian did not receive notice of the proceedings the judgment of the circuit court was properly reversed. I cannot, however, agree with that portion of the opinion which states: \u201cA pleading that does not name and notify a necessary respondent in a juvenile proceeding fails to invoke the jurisdiction of the court and thereby renders its orders void.\u201d (94 Ill. 2d at 83.) As authority for this statement the majority opinion cites People ex rel. McEntee v. Lynch (1906), 223 Ill. 346. When McEntee was decided \u201cAn Act to regulate the treatment and control of dependent, neglected and delinquent children\u201d provided:</p> <blockquote id=\"b158-5\" pgmap=\"158\">\u201cSec. 2. The circuit and county courts of the several counties in this State, shall have original jurisdiction in all cases coming within the terms of this act. In all trials under this act any person interested therein may demand a jury of six or the judge of his own motion may order a jury of the same number to try the case.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b158-6\" pgmap=\"158\">Sec. 3. In counties having over 500,000 population, the judges of the circuit court shall at such times as they shall determine, designate one or more of their number, whose duty it shall be to hear all cases coming under this act. A special court room to be designated as the juvenile court room, shall be provided for the hearing of such cases, and the findings of the court shall be entered in a book or books to be kept for that purpose, and known as the \u2018Juvenile Record,\u2019 and the court may for convenience be called the \u2018Juvenile Court.\u2019 \u201d (Hurd\u2019s Ill. Rev. Stat. 1905, ch. 23, pars. 170, 171.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b158-7\" pgmap=\"158\">At that time section 12 of article VI of the Illinois Constitution of 1870 provided that \u201cthe circuit courts shall have original jurisdiction of all causes in law and equity\u201d and that county courts had original jurisdiction in certain specified matters \u201cand such other jurisdiction as may be provided for by general law.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b158-8\" pgmap=\"158(104) 159(94)\">A court of general jurisdiction was presumed to have jurisdiction to render any judgment entered by it (Bartunek v. Lastovken (1932), 350 Ill. 380), and every reasonable presumption was indulged in favor of its jurisdiction. (Matthews v. Hoff (1885), 113 Ill. 90.) However, no such presumption prevailed in connection with special statutory jurisdiction. In such cases jurisdiction was never presumed, and whatever the jurisdiction of the court, the proceedings were required to be in strict conformity with the statute. (Brown v. VanKeuren (1930), 340 Ill. 118.) As said in City of Chicago v. Hitt (1929), 334 Ill. 619, 628, \u201cA court of general jurisdiction may have a special statutory jurisdiction conferred upon it not exercised according to the course of common law and which does not belong to it as a court of general jurisdiction. Nothing is taken by intendment in favor of the jurisdiction of a court of limited jurisdiction, or of a court of general jurisdiction while exercising special or limited powers. In the latter case the record must show the facts which authorize the court to act, and a judgment rendered without jurisdiction may be treated as void everywhere.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b159-5\" pgmap=\"159\">Article VI, section 9, of the Constitution of 1970 provides: \u201cCircuit courts shall have original jurisdiction of all justiciable matters except when the Supreme Court has original and exclusive jurisdiction ***.\u201d In view of this broad grant of jurisdiction in our present constitution, the rationale of authorities such as McEntee is no longer applicable. The defect in this case is not that there was a failure to invoke jurisdiction; the court had jurisdiction, and there was no necessity for invoking it. The defect here was that the required statutory notice was not given and the order was therefore erroneously entered.</p> <p id=\"b159-6\" pgmap=\"159\">JUSTICE UNDERWOOD joins in this special concurrence.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b159-7\" pgmap=\"159\">JUSTICE SIMON,</author> <p id=\"ATK\" pgmap=\"159\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b159-8\" pgmap=\"159\">The notice provided to the minor and to his mother, with whom he was residing, was more than sufficient to apprise him of the charges against him and to permit him to prepare and present a defense. I would not overturn the circuit court\u2019s adjudication of delinquency on the grounds of inadequate notice under either the statute or the Constitution.</p> <p id=\"b159-9\" pgmap=\"159(41) 160(113)\">Section 4 \u2014 1(2) of the Juvenile Court Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 37, par. 704 \u2014 1(2)) requires that certain persons be named in a petition initiating juvenile proceedings against a minor. The prosecutor must include the name of the minor\u2019s \u201clegal guardian or the person or persons having custody or control of the minor ***.\u201d (Emphasis added.) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 37, par. 704 \u2014 1(2)(d).) The use of the word \u201cor\u201d in the statute permits the prosecutor to name either the guardian or a person having \u201ccustody or control\u201d of the minor. I believe that the minor\u2019s mother had \u201ccustody or control\u201d of her son by virtue of his residence in her home pending \u201calternative placement.\u201d Therefore, the naming of the mother in the petition was sufficient to comply with section 4 \u2014 1(2)(d), and it was not necessary to name or notify the guardian.</p> <p id=\"b160-5\" pgmap=\"160\">The majority avoids this result by adopting an exceedingly technical and erroneous interpretation of the phrase \u201ccustody or control.\u201d The majority holds that \u201ccustody or control\u201d in section 4 \u2014 1(2)(d) is identical to \u201clegal custody,\u201d which is defined in section 1 \u2014 12 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 37, par. 701 \u2014 12). In this case the Guardian Administrator of the Department of Children and Family Services possessed \u201clegal custody\u201d over the minor by virtue of his guardianship. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 37, par. 701 \u2014 11(c).) Because \u201clegal custody\u201d cannot change except by order of the court, the guardian\u2019s administrative act placing the minor in his mother\u2019s home could not create \u201clegal custody\u201d in her. Thus, the majority argue that the notice to the mother was not to a person having \u201clegal custody\u201d over the minor.</p> <p id=\"b160-6\" pgmap=\"160(96) 161(7)\">The majority\u2019s interpretation of section 4 \u2014 1(2)(d) ignores the language of the statute. If the legislature had meant \u201clegal custody\u201d in this section it would have used that phrase and not \u201ccustody or control.\u201d The use of the phrase \u201ccustody or control\u201d implies that the legislature meant to provide for the many informal and unconventional relationships between adults and a minor. I would hold that the mother\u2019s temporary custody of the minor was more than sufficient to constitute \u201ccustody or control\u201d under section 4 \u2014 1(2)(d) and that consequently notice to the guardian was not required by the statute.</p> <p id=\"b161-5\" pgmap=\"161\">This interpretation of section 4 \u2014 1(2)(d) is consistent with its purpose of achieving due process by providing notice of the proceedings to the minor and other interested parties. (See In re J.W. (1981), 87 Ill. 2d 56, 60.) In In re Gault (1967), 387 U.S. 1, 33, 18 L. Ed. 2d 527, 549, 87 S. Ct. 1428, 1446, the United States Supreme Court observed that notice is required in a juvenile proceeding in order to inform the minor of the precise nature of the charges against him and to afford him with a \u201creasonable opportunity to prepare.\u201d The record in this case illustrates that notice to a parent in temporary \u201ccustody or control\u201d of the minor was more than sufficient. The minor, assisted by legal counsel, fully contested the matter at each stage in the proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b161-6\" pgmap=\"161\">For much the same reason, the failure to notify the guardian of the proceedings does not violate due process either. It is important to note that this is not a case in which the guardian is objecting to the adjudication of his rights or those of the minor without notice. (Cf. In re Anast (1974), 22 Ill. App. 3d 750, 756 (due process was violated where a stepfather was not notified of proceedings in which his custody of minor children was terminated).) Here it is the juvenile who argues that his rights were violated by the failure to notify the guardian of the proceedings. As evidenced by the conduct of the proceedings the notice to the minor and his mother was more than sufficient to inform him of the charges and to permit the preparation of a suitable defense.</p> <p id=\"b161-7\" pgmap=\"161\">Because I cannot discover any statutory or constitutional defect arising from the failure to notify the guardian I would reverse the decision of the appellate court.</p> <p id=\"b161-8\" pgmap=\"161\">CHIEF JUSTICE RYAN joins in this dissent.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
