This was one of three notes payable at different times and secured by mortgage. Bridgman transferred them all with the mortgage to Bacon, endorsing the notes, and Bacon endorsed and transferred them to Mrs. Clark.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In August, 1875, the mortgage was foreclosed on the first note by advertisement and the property bid in by Mrs. Clark. She subsequently conveyed the premises by warranty deed to one Caesar Lenhart for $1050. Having done this, she sued the third note, and recovered upon it. Error is brought by the two endorsers.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The mortgage was foreclosed for nothing but the first instalment. No portion of the one now in suit was due or included in the sale. The result is that after that foreclosure as decided in <em>McCurdy v. Clark </em>27 Mich. 445, and <em>Miles v. Skinner </em>42 Mich. 181, the mortgage remained in force as-to this note and the parties who endorsed it had a right, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>called on to pay it, to look to the security for indemnity. By her warranty deed Mrs. Clark discharged the mortgage and released the endorsers.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">As the subject was fully considered in the cases referred to it is not necessary to enlarge lip\u00f3n it. The judgment must be reversed as to the plaintiffs in error with costs of both courts.\"</p>\n<judges id=\"b517-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
