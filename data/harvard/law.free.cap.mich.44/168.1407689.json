The defendant, having properly demanded a bill of particulars of the plaintiff\u2019s demand, did not waive his right thereto by pleading to the declaration or noticing the case for trial. The plaintiff refusing to comply with the demand made, and insisting upon the right to a trial, the court rightly sustained the objection to the evidence offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">There is no error in the record and the judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b193-10\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
