Egbert Wheeler.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b200-4\"><em>Jmtiee's judgment when defendant is in custody </em>\u2014 Motion <em>for farther return.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b200-5\">Where a justice\u2019s judgment is rendered within the time that would ordinarily be proper, it cannot on appeal be assumed without proof that he has exceeded his jurisdiction by delaying judgment while the defendant was in custody; and if he in fact did so, an order to compel a farther return should be applied for to show it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b200-6\">A justice\u2019s judgment rendered within four days was held sufficiently regular to sustain an appeal where the parties appeared at the hearing by attorney only, and no objection to an adjournment was shown to have been made, and there was nothing to show that defendant was in custody, and that judgment ought therefore to have been rendered at once.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-7\">Error to Shiawassee.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AZP\">Submitted June 16.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AXgY\">Decided June 23.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-8\">Trespass.

V. B. Wixom </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_y\">Where the statutes require a justice\u2019s judgment to be rendered forthwith, it is void if delayed to a later day: <em>Sibley v. Howard </em>3 Den. 72; Tiff. Justice\u2019s Guide (3d ed.), 287, 436.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b200-11\">Campbell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjB\">In this case which was commenced before a justice by warrant, the justice rendered a judgment, after four days\u2019 adjournment from the hearing, in favor of defendant. Plaintiff appealed, and the circuit court of Shiawassee county dismissed the appeal on the ground that the defendant was in custody at the time of hearing, and that the justice was bound to render judgment at once, and lost jurisdiction by the adjournment. Comp. L., \u00a7 5380.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">Assuming it to be true \u2014 which we do not now feel warranted in holding without further consideration \u2014 that if the. defendant had been in actual custody at the hearing the delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>in judgment would have prevented an appeal, we do not think it appears he was in such custody, and as no return was procured from the justice to show how the fact was, it is too late now to assume anything not appearing in derogation of the justice\u2019s action. It cannot be assumed the justice exceeded his jurisdiction, where he gave judgment within the time proper in ordinary cases. If he -did, there should have been an application to compel a further return.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The record shows that the suit was begun by warrant under which defendant was brought into court November 17, 1879. The cause was adjourned by consent after pleading, until November 21. On that day a written stipulation was made, signed by the attorneys of both parties, which provided that the cause <em>\u201c </em>is hereby adjourned to November 25th, A. D. 1879, at 10 o\u2019clock a. m., without the appearance of either party, at which time it is hereby agreed that the case shall be tried.\u201d The return shows the parties appeared at the hearing by attorney. It is fairly to be presumed there was no personal appearance, and if so the rule as to the course to be taken on defendants being in custody could hardly apply, unless in some manner the fact was brought to the attention of the justice. It does not appear that any one objected to the adjournment.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">We think therefore that the appeal was valid and should not have been dismissed. '</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The judgment of dismissal must be reversed with costs and the cause remanded for hearing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b201-7\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
