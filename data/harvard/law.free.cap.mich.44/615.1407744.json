J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae7\">There seems to be one objection in this case fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery and which renders any discussion of the other questions raised unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The action is brought to recover upon a breach of a bond given for the jail limits. In the condition thereof it is recited that the principal is in custody \u201c by virtue of a <em>capias ad respondendum </em>issued out of the circuit court,\u201d etc. Upon the trial it appeared that he was in custody not by virtue of such a writ, but by virtue of a <em>capias ad satisfaciendum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The sureties executed the bond in suit in view of the recitals therein contained and the legal obligations arising thereon, and their contract could not be enlarged by showing a different liability contrary to such recitals, and of which it could not be assumed they had any legal knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">This doctrine concerning the right of sureties to a strict construction of the obligation creating their responsibility and measuring the extent thereof, is settled by previous decisions in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">Under our statute, where a bond for the jail limits is given and the prisoner has been confined by virtue of a <em>capias ad </em>respondendum, the plaintiff is entitled to recover only the actual damages sustained by him, while in the case of a <em>capias </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number><em>ad satisfaciendum, </em>tlae damages is the amount directed to be collected by such execution. 2 Comp.
