In April 2012, Bruce became its Chief Executive Officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At CCMH, Strubbe was an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), and Christie\n   and Trader were paramedics. They filed a sealed qui tam complaint as relators in April 2015. The United States declined to intervene. The relators filed an amended complaint. It alleges that CCMH submitted false claims for Medicare reimbursement and made false statements or reports to get fraudulent claims paid. Specifically, Count I alleges that CCMH violated the FCA by submitting (1) claims for breathing treatments administered by paramedics; (2) claims for laboratory services done by paramedics and EMTs; (3) claims with false credentials of service providers; (4) claims for EMT and paramedic services at Eventide, L.L.C. and Denison Care Center; and (5) cost reports with improper reimbursements and payments to vendors for non-CCMH expenses. Count II alleges CCMH knowingly made or used false statements to get false claims paid, including (1) records documenting breathing treatments at 30 minutes; (2) records listing paramedics as \"specialized ancillary staff\" for breathing treatments; (3) reimbursement requests and invoices for improper payments for non-CCMH expenses; (4) documents with false credentials for emergency medical staff; and (5) cost reports with false costs. Count III alleges that CCMH conspired with Eventide to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Strubbe, Trader, and Christie also sued CCMH and Bruce for violating the FCA's anti-retaliation provision. According to the complaint, Strubbe began reviewing hospital financial documents in July 2014. Soon after, she \"spoke to all Board members about the financial situation of CCMH [and] her belief that the finances were not adding up.\" In November, Strubbe tore her rotator cuff at work. Initially, CCMH put her on \"light duty.\" In July 2015, however, CCMH told Strubbe her light-duty assignments were a financial hardship for the hospital and moved her to part-time status. CCMH removed Strubbe from part-time status in March 2016 (effectively a termination).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Christie and Trader also began investigating CCMH's finances in 2014. They complained to other hospital staff that \"there was something wrong with the changes in the breathing treatments.\" Christie also complained there was \"potentially something wrong with the financial statements provided by CCMH to the Board.\" In January 2015, Christie reported to her supervisor that Jonathan Richard was \"not properly licensed\" as a paramedic. Both Christie and Trader then reported the license violation to the Iowa Department of Public Health. Four months later, CCMH transitioned Christie from night shifts to day shifts. It terminated Christie later that month for speeding while driving an ambulance. Trader still works at CCMH as a paramedic, but claims that it subjects him to harrassment and other discriminatory treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   CCMH moved to dismiss the complaint. The district court dismissed the substantive FCA claims for failure to plead with particularity because the complaint did not set forth facts showing any false claims were submitted, or plead how the relators acquired this information. It also dismissed Christie and Trader's retaliation claims as not stating a plausible claim for relief. However, the court denied CCMH's motion to dismiss Strubbe's retaliation claim. CCMH then moved for summary judgment on it. Concluding that Strubbe could not prove a prima facie case of retaliation, the district court granted summary judgment to CCMH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This court reviews de novo the district court's dismissal of a claim under Rule 9(b), \"accepting the allegations contained in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the\n   nonmoving party.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     United States ex rel.

First, the complaint alleges that shortly after Bruce became CEO, CCMH required paramedics to perform breathing treatments previously provided by nursing staff. Hospital management told employees this change was for \"billing\" and \"cost reimbursement purposes\" and required them to document each treatment at 30 minutes, regardless of its length. The complaint alleges-upon information and belief-that these changes allowed CCMH to bill these treatments separately to get a higher reimbursement from Medicare. Further, the complaint alleges that CCMH treats paramedics as \"specialized staff,\" making the treatments separately billable. Relators also contend-upon information and belief-that patients are receiving breathing treatments who do not need them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Second, the complaint alleges that CCMH ordered paramedics and EMTs to perform laboratory services, like blood draws. The relators claim-upon information and belief-that this change, like the breathing treatments, was intended to increase Medicare reimbursement by allowing\n   CCMH to bill these services separately. Third, the complaint identifies three employees with misclassified titles. For example, the complaint alleges-upon information and belief-that CCMH billed Medicare for Richard's services as a paramedic, though he was \"not properly licensed.\" Fourth, the relators claim paramedics and EMTs provided services at two other health care facilities-Eventide and Denison. Based on information and belief, CCMH instituted this change to increase Medicare reimbursement. Finally, the complaint alleges that CCMH reported improper expenses to Medicare. Relators contend-upon information and belief-that CCMH submitted cost reports to Medicare with payments to Bruce's relatives above the market value and with duplicate payments to the credit card companies and the sellers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Relators did not plead representative samples of false claims. In\n   <em>\n    Joshi\n   </em>\n   , a hospital anesthesiologist brought a qui tam claim alleging that the hospital sought Medicare reimbursements at higher rates and submitted claims for services and supplies not provided.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Joshi\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1037253\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/441/552/#p555\">\n    441 F.3d at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Joshi did not provide representative samples, but alleged that every claim over a sixteen-year period was fraudulent.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1037253\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/441/552/#p555\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1037253\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/441/552/#p555\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1037253\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/441/552/#p555\">\n    at 556-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Though Rule 9(b) does not require alleging the \"specific details of\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   alleged fraudulent claim,\" this court dismissed Joshi's claim because a relator \"must provide\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   representative examples of [the] alleged fraudulent conduct, specifying the time, place, and content of [the] acts and the identity of the actors.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1037253\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/441/552/#p555\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1037253\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/441/552/#p555\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1037253\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/441/552/#p555\">\n    at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The relators here pleaded more than the relator in\n   <em>\n    Joshi\n   </em>\n   . However, like\n   <em>\n    Joshi\n   </em>\n   , the complaint here alleges a fraudulent scheme without representative examples with the required specificity. For instance, the complaint alleges CCMH submitted false claims for unnecessary breathing treatments. It gives one example of a patient who received an unnecessary breathing treatment, but fails to include the date, the provider performing the treatment, any specific information about the patient, what money was obtained, and most importantly, whether a claim was actually submitted for that particular patient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Thayer\n   </em>\n   , a relator can also satisfy Rule 9(b) by pleading the \"particular details of a scheme to submit false claims paired with reliable indicia that lead to a strong inference that claims were actually submitted.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Thayer\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186165\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/914/#p918\">\n    765 F.3d at 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The allegations in Count I are close to meeting this standard. The complaint includes some details of the fraudulent scheme. It pleads the names of the individuals that instructed them to carry out the breathing treatments and blood draws, the two-year period when these services were provided, and statements by their supervisor that the changes to the breathing treatments were for billing and cost reimbursement purposes. The complaint also pleads how hospital management told them to document each breathing treatment at 30 minutes, regardless of its length. It includes the names of three individuals who relators believed were misclassified, and how Christie and Trader learned of Richard's licensure violation. The relators also give some details about one receipt for gas and moving expenses that was allegedly altered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   However, the complaint lacks the sufficient indicia of reliability leading to a strong inference that claims were actually submitted. In\n   <em>\n    Thayer\n   </em>\n   , the relator-a center manager for several Planned Parenthood clinics-alleged a fraudulent scheme.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186165\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/914/#p918\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186165\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/914/#p918\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186165\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/914/#p918\">\n    at 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Strubbe claims that CCMH had notice before this because the federal government sent informal interrogatories to CCMH in August 2015 that mimicked the open records request her attorney sent in March. Strubbe presented no evidence, however, that CCMH knew her attorney sent that records request. Strubbe has shown only that CCMH had knowledge of her protected activity beginning in November 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Retaliatory acts under the FCA include discharging, demoting, suspending, threatening, harrassing, or otherwise discriminating against an employee.\n   <strong>\n    \u00a7 3730(h)(1)\n   </strong>\n   . Strubbe's removal from part-time status-effectively a termination-in March 2016 is a retaliatory act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Strubbe cannot prove that her termination was solely motivated by protected activity. She contends causation can be inferred because CCMH assigned her light-duty work after she was injured, but stopped once it learned of her FCA claim. Meanwhile, Stacey Kruse, another employee with a shoulder injury, continued to get light-duty work. Strubbe claims that an email from CCMH to Kruse, describing Kruse as a \"low key injured employee,\" provides further proof CCMH removed her from part-time status because of her protected conduct. However, these events all occurred before CCMH knew Strubbe brought the FCA claim. They do not demonstrate CCMH terminated Strubbe solely because of her protected conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   CCMH did not terminate Strubbe until four months after learning of her involvement in the FCA claim. By then, she had not performed work at CCMH for six months. A temporal connection between the protected conduct and adverse action may be sufficient to establish a prima facie case where the proximity is \"very close.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Clark Cty.

CCMH claims it removed Strubbe from part-time status under its policy requiring employees to have worked in the previous six months. Strubbe can prove this reason is pretextual by showing CCMH \"(1) failed to follow its own policies, (2) treated similarly-situated employees in a disparate manner, or (3) shifted its explanation of the employment decision.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Schaffhauser v.

CCMH's policy states, \"The minimum requirement to remain a per diem employee is to have worked in the past six months....\" CCMH followed this policy when it terminated Strubbe. By the time it removed her from part-time status, Strubbe had not worked as an EMT for over a year and had not performed any work for CCMH for six months. CCMH has not changed its explanation for Strubbe's termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Strubbe claims that CCMH treated Kruse, a similarly situated employee, differently by giving her light-duty work. Strubbe has not demonstrated that Kruse is similarly situated. She did not provide sufficient information detailing the significance of Kruse's injury, her physical limitations, her position at CCMH, or whether she had worked in the last six months. Further, CCMH sent Kruse the email describing her as a \"low key injured employee\" before CCMH learned of Strubbe's FCA claim.

Indeed, the majority opinion and the district court essentially require that the relators here witness the Medicare forms being submitted in order to get past the pleading stage in this case. If that were the case, only someone with access to the hospital's internal accounting records could successfully bring a qui tam action in this situation. Indeed, as relators point out, the accounting records became unaccessible to employees and the public once Bill Bruce became CEO (and incidentally, the HR manager) of the hospital. Bruce and the hospital can thus effectively eliminate any civil liability for false claims by eliminating access to financial information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The complaint contained 198 paragraphs, including 55 paragraphs in the \"Specific and Detailed Allegations\" section, and spelled out the impropriety of EMTs and paramedics being asked to perform work differently, and to perform work-(i.e., breathing treatments on\n   <em>\n    inpatients\n   </em>\n   )-that EMTs and paramedics were not the most qualified and certainly not the most conveniently situated to perform. The complaint alleges the relators were told the reason for this abrupt change in procedure and policy was for \"billing\" purposes. Comp. \u00b6\u00b6 26-28. The complaint detailed the exponential increase in separately billed \"breathing\" treatments even while the number of hospital patients declined. \u00b6\u00b6 33-35. The complaint detailed how relators were required to make false entries into the computer system that was used for Medicare billing-averring that the treatments lasted at least thirty minutes regardless of how long the treatment lasted. \u00b6\u00b6 30, 98. Requiring the relators to plead an exact day in which any one of them performed a breathing treatment in less than 30 minutes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ante at 1165-66, is more than is necessary.\n   <em>\n    United States ex. rel Thayer v.
