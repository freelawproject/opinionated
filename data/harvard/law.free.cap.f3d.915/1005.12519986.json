With his term of incarceration set to expire, Pittman moved for relocation of his supervised release (\"SR\") per\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203605\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). The district court denied the motion as premature because Pittman was not then (and still is not) on SR. Concluding that we lack jurisdiction, we dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pittman pleaded guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) and 924(a)(2). The district court sentenced him to fifty-one months imprisonment, followed by three years of SR. Pittman seeks to serve his SR in the Northern District of Georgia, where he has familial ties, including a young son, instead of in the Northern District of Texas, where he has no such ties. Consequently, in April 2018, Pittman moved for relocation of his SR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The district court denied the motion, finding that \"[b]ecause Pittman remains incarcerated and is not yet 'on' [SR], his request for transfer of jurisdiction is premature. The [c]ourt cannot transfer jurisdiction of [SR] while a defendant is incarcerated.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pittman appeals,\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pittman makes two principal arguments. First, he asserts that the district court erroneously concluded that his request for transfer was premature, maintaining that the district court \"can transfer jurisdiction to another district for supervision\" even though he is incarcerated. Pittman faults the court's \"interpretation\" of \u00a7 3605 and contends that \"[i]f [his] [c]ase [m]anager can file [a] relocation request [for SR] while the Defendant is incarcerated, the [d]istrict [c]ourt lacks no jurisdiction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Second, Pittman avers that forcing him to enter a residential reentry center (\"RRC\") in the Northern District of Texas would undermine his ability \"to [reintegrate] into society.\" He emphasizes that \"[t]he primary function of the RRC is to provide [him] with the time needed to attain a stable residence, gainful employment[,] and to prepare for his [reentry] into society.\" Ultimately, Pittman asserts that his \"chance of criminal recidivism is far less likely if he [is] release[d] into an environment where he has support and stability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The government contends that we lack jurisdiction because \"this appeal is not from a final order.\" The government maintains that \"because-as the district court correctly concluded-Pittman's motion is premature, there is no final order under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Finality as a condition of review is [a] historic characteristic of federal appellate procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Cobbledick v.

The district court has not yet entered a final order determining whether to authorize Pittman's request for a transfer of jurisdiction. Instead, the court concluded that Pittman's motion was \"premature\" because \"[t]he [c]ourt cannot transfer jurisdiction of [SR] while a defendant is incarcerated.\" Consequently, the best view is that, as in\n   <em>\n    Branham\n   </em>\n   , the denial of Pittman's motion is \"simply not a final, appealable order.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"288623\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/754/1243/#p1245\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Similarly, \u00a7 3742(a) does not provide jurisdiction to hear Pittman's appeal. As the government notes, this statutory provision \"applies to sentences, not transfers of jurisdiction over [SR] terms.\" Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Fernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2180361\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/379/270/\">\n    379 F.3d 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 277 n.8 (5th Cir. 2004), we held that \"the location of [SR] jurisdiction is not a\n   <em>\n    condition\n   </em>\n   of the [SR].\" Therefore, because Pittman is not challenging a condition of his sentence, this provision does not afford jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   One other potential jurisdictional basis-although not expressly cited by Pittman-is the collateral order doctrine, which allows appeals from a \"small class [of orders] which finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\"\n   <em>\n    Cohen v.

Moreover, it did not \"resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action\" and instead squarely addressed the jurisdictional transfer issue. Lastly, the order is not \"effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment\" because should Pittman choose to renew his motion once on SR, he would be able to appeal any adverse judgment per \u00a7 1291.
