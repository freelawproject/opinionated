Shortly after his arrival, the location's assistant manager accused him of attempting to rob the store. Patterson was detained by the police as a result of the PLCB employee's accusation. Patterson filed a Complaint pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1983 against the PLCB alleging race discrimination and violations of Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection in connection with these events. Patterson now appeals the District Court's Order granting the PLCB's motion to dismiss his Complaint on Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the morning of November 17, 2014, Patterson-an African-American male and a longtime PLCB employee performing maintenance-arrived at a PLCB-run store in Eddystone, Pennsylvania to inquire about the store's operating condition. Upon his arrival, Patterson asked for a manager and was directed by a store clerk to the assistant manager. Patterson then identified himself to the assistant manager as a maintenance worker for the PLCB and asked whether the store's electricity and plumbing were in working order or if the store might otherwise be in need of repairs. The assistant manager became \"very rude\" to Patterson, so he exited the liquor store, entered his \"state-owned van, and reported the assistant manager to his foreman over the phone.\" App. 11. Per his foreman's instruction, Patterson left the Eddystone store and drove towards another PLCB store in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   En route to the Newtown Square store, Patterson was stopped by the police and questioned about \"robbing\" the Eddystone store.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   During the stop, an officer informed Patterson that the Eddystone assistant manager had called to report a \"black guy\" in a \"state van\" who was trying to \"rob her store.\" App. 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Patterson filed a Complaint against the PLCB alleging race discrimination and violations of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1983. The PLCB filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), which the District Court granted upon a finding that the PLCB was entitled to Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity from suit. Patterson appeals, arguing that the District Court erred in finding that the PLCB was an \"arm\" of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Patterson contends that, in reaching its conclusion that the PLCB is immunized from suit under the Eleventh Amendment, the District Court improperly weighed this Court's three-factor test, established in\n   <em>\n    Fitchik v.

The \"status under the law\" factor, though less definitive, tips in favor of immunity because Pennsylvania statutory and case law overwhelmingly views the PLCB as an arm of the state. The autonomy factor weighs strongly in favor of immunity because the PLCB is subject to substantial oversight and control from the state's executive and legislative branches. On balance, the first and third factors effectively cancel each\n   other out, as they point in opposite directions. The PLCB's status under Pennsylvania law tips the scale in favor of the PLCB being considered an arm of the state. We therefore conclude the PLCB is an arm of the state that is entitled to Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order of the District Court granting the PLCB's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Patterson has withdrawn his claim under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201981\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and now bases his appeal on the District Court's determination that his claim under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n    </extracted-citation>\n    is barred on Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity grounds.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    In so holding, Patterson's claim fails for a separate reason: a state, including an entity that is an arm of the state, is not a \"person\" under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and therefore cannot be sued for damages under that statute.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Will v.
