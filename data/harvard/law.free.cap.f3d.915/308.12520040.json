The student, Caleigh Wood, contends that school officials Evelyn Arnold and Shannon Morris (the defendants) used the statements about Islam to endorse that religion over Christianity, and compelled Wood against her will to profess a belief in Islam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Upon our review, we conclude that the challenged coursework materials, viewed in the context in which they were presented, did not violate Wood's First Amendment rights, because they did not impermissibly endorse any religion and did not compel Wood to profess any belief. We therefore affirm the district court's judgment awarding summary judgment in favor of the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the 2014-2015 school year, Wood was an eleventh-grade student at La Plata High School, a public high school in Charles County, Maryland. Arnold was La Plata's principal, and Morris was employed as one of the school's vice-principals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As an eleventh-grade student, Wood was required to take a world history course, which was part of the school's social studies curriculum. The year-long course covered time periods from the year \"1500 to the [p]resent.\" Among the topics covered in the course were the Renaissance and Reformation, the Enlightenment period, the Industrial Revolution, and World Wars I and II. The topics were divided into separate units, with each unit generally being taught over a period of between ten and twenty days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The smallest unit of the world history course, encompassing five days, was entitled \"The Muslim World.\" The unit was \"designed to explore, among other things, formation of Middle Eastern empires including the basic concepts of the Islamic faith and how it along with politics, culture, economics, and geography contributed to the development of those empires.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As part of the \"Muslim World\" unit, Wood's teacher presented the students with a PowerPoint slide entitled \"Islam Today,\" which contrasted \"peaceful Islam\" with \"radical fundamental Islam.\" The slide contained the statement that \"Most Muslim's [sic]\n   <em>\n    faith is stronger\n   </em>\n   than the average Christian\" (the comparative faith statement) (underlining in original). The school's content specialist, Jack Tuttle, testified that use of the comparative faith statement was inappropriate, and that he would have advised a teacher who was considering teaching this statement \"[n]ot to do that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Wood also was required to complete a worksheet summarizing the lesson on Islam. The worksheet addressed topics such as the growth and expansion of Islam, the \"beliefs and practices\" of Islam, and the links between Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. Part of the worksheet required the students to \"fill in the blanks\" to complete certain information comprising the \"Five Pillars\" of Islam. Included in that assignment was the statement: \"There is no god but\n   <em>\n    Allah\n   </em>\n   and Muhammad is the\n   <em>\n    messen\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ger\n   </em>\n   of Allah[,]\" a portion of a declaration known as the\n   <em>\n    shahada\n   </em>\n   (the\n   <em>\n    shahada\n   </em>\n   assignment).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For ease of reference, we collectively refer to the comparative faith statement and the\n   <em>\n    shahada\n   </em>\n   assignment as the \"challenged materials.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Wood's father objected to the use of the challenged materials. He asserted to the defendants that Islam should not be taught in the public school and demanded that his daughter be given alternative assignments. He directed his daughter to refuse to complete any assignment associated with Islam on the ground that she was not required to \"do anything that violated [her] Christian beliefs.\" Wood's failure to complete the assignments that, in her view, \"promot[ed] Islam,\" resulted in Wood receiving a lower percentage grade for the course but did not affect her final letter grade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Wood later sued the defendants,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging that they violated the Establishment Clause by \"impermissibly endors[ing] and advanc[ing] the Islamic religion.\" Wood further alleged that the defendants violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment by requiring her to complete the\n   <em>\n    shahada\n   </em>\n   assignment, thereby \"depriv[ing] [her] of her right to be free from government compelled speech.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment. Wood now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We review the district court's award of summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buxton v.

Wood contends that the district court erred in awarding summary judgment to the defendants on both her Establishment Clause claim and her Free Speech Clause claim. We address each claim in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We begin with Wood's Establishment Clause claim. Wood contends that through the comparative faith statement, \"Most Muslim's [sic]\n   <em>\n    faith is stronger\n   </em>\n   than the average Christian,\" the defendants endorsed a view of Islam over Christianity in violation of the Establishment Clause. Wood also argues that the assignment requiring students to write a portion of the\n   <em>\n    shahada\n   </em>\n   impermissibly advanced the Islamic religion and compelled Wood to \"den[y] the very existence of her God.\" According to Wood, the challenged materials lacked any secular purpose and had the \"effect of promoting and endorsing Islam.\" We disagree with Wood's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Establishment Clause provides that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" U.S. Const. amend.

In this case, the comparative faith statement was part of an academic unit in which students studied Middle Eastern empires and the role of Islam. The unit did not focus exclusively on Islam's core principles, but explored \"among other things, formation of Middle Eastern empires including the basic concepts of the Islamic faith and how it along with politics, culture, economics, and geography contributed to the development of those empires.\" Nothing in the record indicates that the comparative faith statement was made with a subjective purpose of advancing Islam over Christianity, or for any other predominately religious purpose. Nor does the record show that the proffered secular purpose of teaching about Muslim empires in the context of world history was pretextual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lambeth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8971551\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/407/266/#p271\">\n    407 F.3d at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The students were not required to memorize the\n   <em>\n    shahada\n   </em>\n   , to recite it, or even to write the complete statement of faith. Instead, the worksheet included a variety of factual information related to Islam and merely asked the students to demonstrate their understanding of the material by completing the partial sentences.

As already discussed, neither the comparative faith statement nor the\n   <em>\n    shahada\n   </em>\n   assignment advanced or inhibited any religion. And there is no evidence in the record that these materials were obtained from a religious institution or benefited any such institution. Finally, there is no evidence that use of the challenged materials resulted in \"invasive monitoring\" of activities to prevent or advance religious speech.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Educ. of Westside Cmty.

Under the world history curriculum, it appears that lessons on the Muslim world constituted, at most, five days of a year-long course. Thus, we conclude that neither the comparative faith statement nor the\n   <em>\n    shahada\n   </em>\n   assignment resulted in an excessive entanglement with religion. Because the challenged materials satisfy all three prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Lemon\n   </em>\n   test, we hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants on Wood's Establishment Clause claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We next consider Wood's Free Speech Clause challenge. Wood argues that the defendants violated her free speech rights by requiring her to complete in writing two missing words of a portion of the\n   <em>\n    shahada\n   </em>\n   , namely, that \"[t]here is no god but\n   <em>\n    Allah\n   </em>\n   and Muhammad is the\n   <em>\n    messenger\n   </em>\n   of Allah.\" In her view, \"the curriculum\n   implemented and supervised by [d]efendants compelled [Wood] to confess by written word and deed her faith in Allah.\" We disagree with Wood's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Generally, when a governmental entity requires a person \"to utter or distribute speech bearing a particular message,\" we subject that requirement to \"rigorous scrutiny.\"\n   <em>\n    Greater Balt.

In the public school setting, students do not \"shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,\" but retain their First Amendment rights \"applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.\"\n   <em>\n    Tinker v.

However, the Supreme Court has emphasized that students' First Amendment rights in public schools \"are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings.\"\n   <em>\n    Kuhlmeier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/#p267\">\n    484 U.S. at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/#p267\">\n    108 S.Ct. 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In considering the right against compelled speech in the public school context, the Third Circuit has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   First Amendment jurisprudence recognizes that the educational process itself may sometimes require a state actor to force a student to speak when the student would rather refrain. A student may also be forced to speak or write on a particular topic even though the student might prefer a different topic. And while a public educational institution may not demand that a student profess beliefs or views with which the student does not agree, a school may in some circumstances require a student to state the arguments that could be made in support of such beliefs or views.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    C.N. v.

We agree with the Third Circuit's reasoning. Although a student's right against compelled speech in a public school may be asserted under various circumstances, that right has limited application in a classroom setting in which a student is asked to study and discuss materials with which she disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In the present case, the record is clear that the\n   <em>\n    shahada\n   </em>\n   assignment did not require Wood to profess or accept the tenets of Islam. The students were not asked to recite the\n   <em>\n    shahada\n   </em>\n   , nor were they required to engage in any devotional practice related to Islam.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W.

Instead, the\n   <em>\n    shahada\n   </em>\n   assignment required Wood to write only two words of the\n   <em>\n    shahada\n   </em>\n   as an academic exercise to demonstrate her understanding of the world history curriculum. On these facts, we conclude that Wood's First Amendment right against compelled speech was not violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For these reasons, we affirm the district court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The underlined words reflect the parts of the statement that the students were required to complete.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    At the time the complaint was filed, Wood was a minor.

Those claims were dismissed by the district court, and have not been pursued on appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Although scholars could debate endlessly the content of the comparative faith statement and its suitability for use in an educational context, the \"primary effect\" prong of the\n    <em>\n     Lemon\n    </em>\n    test \"must be assessed objectively.\"\n    <em>\n     Mellen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136015\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/327/355/#p370\">\n     327 F.3d at 374\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, Wood's argument that the comparative faith statement is a \"subjective, biased statement\" about Islam is outside the bounds of our consideration whether use of the statement was constitutional. For the same reason, Wood's contention that she viewed the comparative faith statement as offensive, and that some school officials thought the statement was inappropriate, is unavailing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lee\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480868\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/577/#p598\">\n     505 U.S. at 597\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480868\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/577/#p598\">\n     112 S.Ct. 2649\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"We do not hold that every state action implicating religion is invalid if one or a few citizens find it offensive.\");\n    <em>\n     Brown\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535045\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/27/1373/#p1379\">\n     27 F.3d at 1383\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[A] child's subjective perception that a state action disapproves of or is hostile toward his or her religion is not, by itself, sufficient to establish an Establishment Clause violation.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    In Wood's amended complaint, she objects to other portions of the world history curriculum, such as the fact that that Wood was \"instructed from the text of the Qur'an,\" that Wood was \"instructed ... that [r]ighteous women are ... obedient\" to men, and that the course devoted only a single day to the study of Christianity while multiple days were spent studying Islam.
