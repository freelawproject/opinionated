He argues that a violation of the Pennsylvania Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30), does not qualify as a \"serious drug offense\" under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(A)(ii). We must first decide whether \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii)'s definition of a \"serious drug offense\" encompasses attempts (as defined under federal law) to manufacture, distribute, or possess with intent to manufacture or distribute a controlled substance. If it does, we must then consider whether the scope of attempt and accomplice liability under Pennsylvania law is coextensive with the meaning of those terms under federal law.

According to Daniels, his convictions cannot count as ACCA predicates because the elements of the state drug statute sweep more broadly than the generic definition of a drug distribution crime. He argued that, \"[b]y virtue of Pennsylvania's treatment of solicitation and mere offers to sell, it is far from clear that a violation of 35 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30), is, as a categorical matter, a 'serious drug offense' within the meaning of ACCA.\" (JA25.) At sentencing, Daniels also argued that, without his armed career criminal designation, his Guidelines range would have been 92 to 115 months. However, application of this designation would result in a Guideline range of 180 months (the statutory minimum) to 210 months. The District Court rejected Daniels's challenge and sentenced him to 180 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203231\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, no subsequent panel overrules the holding in a precedential opinion of a previous panel. Court en banc consideration is required to do so.\"). It is also not unexpected that he challenges the various rulings from other circuits adopting an expansive interpretation of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) and holding that this ACCA provision encompasses attempts. Daniels contends that the Supreme Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Mathis v.

According to Daniels, the focus upon state statutory elements under the categorical approach \"cuts against the argument that the presence of the term 'involving' in Section 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) should encourage a more elastic approach to inclusion of drug offenses that do not approximate those listed in Section 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).\" (Appellant's Reply Brief at 8.) Additionally, Daniels argues \"[i]t would violate due process to impose such liability in the absence of any such reference [to attempts].\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Daniels finally attempts to compare \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) with the ACCA's \"residual\" clause (i.e., \"violent felony\" means any crime that, inter alia, \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii) ).

We hold that the definition of a \"serious drug offense\" under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) encompasses attempts, as defined by federal law, to manufacture, distribute, or possess with intent to manufacture or distribute a controlled substance. Our holding thereby implicates a categorical comparison between the elements of an inchoate drug crime under the applicable state law with the elements of such an inchoate offense under federal drug law (an analysis we conduct in the next section of this opinion). We accordingly need not-and do not-decide if \" Section 924(e) does not require the state statute under which a defendant was convicted to be co-extensive with a federal drug statute.\" (Appellee's Brief at 8.) Given our analysis of Pennsylvania and federal law governing attempts and accomplice liability, we leave for another day the government's alternative arguments that, \"even if the Pennsylvania statute extended to offers to sell: any statute that bars an 'offer to sell drugs' is one 'involving' the distribution of drugs under ACCA, as many courts have held\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26 (citations omitted) ), and that, even if Pennsylvania's solicitation law sweeps more broadly than its federal counterpart, \"[s]uch criminal\n   conduct is not so remote or tangential to its aim, that is, the actual or constructive transfer of a controlled substance, to justify disqualification as a 'serious drug offense' under ACCA\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518657\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/319/\">\n    904 F.3d at 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that we have yet to determine whether or in what circumstances state statutes criminalizing offers to sell constitute \"controlled substance offenses,\" noting that other circuits have held state statutes expressly criminalizing mere offers do not qualify, and, assuming that such statute sweeps beyond career offender Guideline, concluding that Section 780-113(a)(30) does not do so).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We also do not agree with the other assertions raised by Daniels. Daniels (yet again) cites to no case law rejecting\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   or the numerous \"serious drug offense\" rulings from other circuits based on\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   , the rule of lenity, or vagueness concerns. On the contrary, he draws more attention to this lack of case law by observing that the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   (which was overruled by\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ) \"pointed out, as the Government has here, that 'every Court of Appeals that ha[d] construed the' [attempted burglary] issue in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   , 'ha[d] held the offense qualifies as [an ACCA predicate.]' \" (Appellant's Reply Brief at 14 (quoting\n   <em>\n    James v.

Furthermore, the limits of the modified categorical approach recently addressed by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   have no bearing on the current appeal.

It is Daniels who then goes beyond the bare terms of Section 780-113(a)(30) to point out that this specific provision includes attempts as well as completed drug crimes. The\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   Court also focused on the \"grave uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a crime,\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as well as \"how much risk it takes for a crime to qualify as a violent felony,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Attempts and Accomplice Liability under Federal and Pennsylvania Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Because \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii)'s definition of \"a serious drug offense\" encompasses attempts (as defined under federal law) to manufacture, distribute, or possess with intent to manufacture or distribute a controlled substance, we must decide whether Pennsylvania criminalizes conduct under the attempt or accomplice framework that are not crimes under federal law. According to Daniels, Pennsylvania law sweeps more broadly than federal law because it criminalizes offers to sell, mere preparation, and solicitation by the buyer. We do not agree. Given our recent precedential opinions in\n   <em>\n    Glass\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that Pennsylvania's approach to attempts as well as the state's doctrine of accomplice liability are coextensive with its federal counterparts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The federal and Pennsylvania approaches to attempt liability in the drug offense context are essentially identical. As we have already explained, Pennsylvania law defines \"deliver\" or \"delivery\" as \"the actual, constructive, or attempted transfer from one person to another of a controlled substance.\" 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 780-102(b).

Section 846 of the CSA provides that \"[a]ny person who attempts ... to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt.\" Most federal courts (including this Circuit) have followed the Model Penal Code's framework for attempt liability.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518887\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/906/281/\">\n    906 F.3d at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Consistent with the Model Penal Code, federal 'attempt' requires intent and a substantial step towards to the commission of the crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n    <em>\n     Rivers\n    </em>\n    , the evidence clearly established that the defendant went beyond mere preparation (e.g., the defendant on his own initiative gave his telephone number to the undercover officer so that she could contact him to purchase illicit substances, they engaged in a telephone discussion to arrange a transaction, setting the price as well as the time and location, the defendant was proceeding toward and was near the site for the transaction when he was arrested, and he had a bag containing counterfeit cocaine).\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at *17.
