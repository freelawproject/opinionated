For instance, he contends that many of the terms of the TPA included incorrect amounts, that Propel did not include an itemized list of closing costs in the documents, and that the TPA was missing certain allegedly required financial disclosures. He also alleges that, as a condition of the TPA, he was required to agree to repay Propel by preauthorized electronic fund transfers (\"EFTs\") and that the required authorization form does not contain a space that would allow him to indicate that he declined to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Curtis brought a proposed class action against Propel in federal district court, alleging violations of TILA, EFTA, and VCPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Propel moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), contending that the TPA is not subject to TILA or EFTA because it is not a consumer credit transaction and that the TPA is exempt from the VCPA.

The district court also determined that the TPA is subject to TILA and EFTA because, as \"third-party financing of a tax obligation\" for \"personal, family, or household purposes,\" the TPA is both a credit transaction and a consumer transaction and thus qualifies as a consumer credit transaction governed by those statutes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265972\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/265/647/#p652\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265972\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/265/647/#p652\">\n    at 652-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the court certified for interlocutory review (1) its decision that Curtis has standing to proceed on his EFTA claims and (2) its determination that TPAs sanctioned by Virginia Code section 58.1-3018 are subject to TILA and EFTA as consumer credit transactions. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Propel makes two arguments on appeal. First, Propel contends that Curtis does not have standing to bring a claim under EFTA because he did not adequately allege that Propel required him to agree to EFTs or that he made or attempted to cancel any EFT payments. Second, Propel contends that Curtis's complaint does not state a claim for relief under either TILA or EFTA because the TPA is not a consumer credit transaction within the terms of those statutes. Before considering these issues, we first set forth the statutory framework to provide the necessary context for our analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   TILA and EFTA are consumer protection statutes that regulate the terms of certain transactions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   , 1693\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   The purpose of TILA is \"to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms\" in order to improve consumer decisionmaking and \"to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair\" credit practices.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1601(a). Similarly, EFTA was enacted to establish \"individual consumer rights\" in the context of EFT transactions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1693(b). Thus, both TILA and EFTA are \"remedial consumer protection statute[s]\" which we \"read liberally to achieve [their] goals\" of protecting consumers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Phelps v.

First, we hold that Curtis has standing to bring claims under EFTA because the harm that he alleges is a substantive statutory violation that subjects him to the very risks that EFTA, a consumer protection statute, was designed to protect against. Second, we hold that the TPA is subject to TILA and EFTA because the TPA is a consumer credit transaction. Because the statutes define these terms separately, we consider them as such. We determine that the TPA is a credit transaction because it provides for third-party financing of a tax obligation and that it is a consumer transaction because, as financing of a real property tax debt, it is a voluntary transaction that Curtis entered into for personal or household purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Propel contends that Curtis lacks standing to bring claims under EFTA. \"We review legal questions regarding standing de novo,\" and \"[w]hen standing is challenged on the pleadings, we accept as true all material allegations of the complaint and construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.\"\n   <em>\n    David v.

Pt. 1026, Supp. I, pt. 1, cmt. 2(a)(14);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ford Motor Credit Co. v.

Accordingly, the question here is whether the TPA is a credit transaction on the basis that it involves third-party financing of a tax obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We conclude that the TPA provides for third-party financing of a tax obligation as set forth in the statute for two reasons. First, it is clear from the terms of the TPA itself, which state that Propel will pay Curtis's taxes in exchange for installment repayments, interest, and fees from Curtis. By entering into that transaction, Curtis \"defer[red] payment\" of his property tax obligation by having Propel, a third party, pay it immediately in exchange for subsequent installment payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). This is financing of a tax obligation, indistinguishable from the type of financing that occurs when a homebuyer takes out a mortgage with a bank to defer payment of the listing price in exchange for regular repayments. In this respect, the TPA thus operates as any other financing transaction would.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, the TPA is a financing transaction because it creates third-party obligations between Curtis and Propel. Specifically, the TPA requires Curtis to pay Propel interest and fees--an obligation wholly separate from Curtis's tax obligation to the locality and owed only to Propel. Similarly, when a homebuyer takes out a home mortgage, she agrees to pay the bank interest and fees--costs which are unrelated to the homebuyer's underlying obligation to pay the listing price to the seller. These characteristics of the TPA--that it allows Curtis to defer payment of his property taxes and that it creates third-party obligations between Curtis and Propel--align precisely with those of third-party financing of a tax obligation as allowed by the statute. To dismiss the third-party nature of the relationship between Curtis and Propel here would be to dismiss the Staff Commentary, which defines third-party financing of tax obligations as credit, altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Propel contends that the TPA is not a credit transaction because it is different from a bank loan. While that may be true, it is also irrelevant. In discussing what constitutes acceptable third-party financing of tax liens and assessments, the Staff Commentary by its terms used a bank loan as an \"example,\" not a limitation. 12 C.F.R. Pt. 1026, Supp. I, pt. 1, cmt. 2(a)(14). Whether an agreement is a credit transaction is not determined by how closely it resembles a bank loan. The inquiry is whether it provides for \"third-party financing\" of a tax obligation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Moreover, differences between the TPA and a bank loan do not transform the TPA into something other than third-party financing of a tax obligation. For instance, TILA does not only apply to payments made directly to consumers. We know this because, for example, TILA requires creditors to describe how much credit they provide \"to [the consumer]\n   <em>\n    or on [the consumer's] behalf\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201026.18\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1026.18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (emphasis added). Therefore, the fact that Propel pays the locality directly instead of loaning money to Curtis as a bank might\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not affect whether the transaction falls under TILA's definition of credit. Nor does the fact that the TPA is different from a bank loan because it is a regulated transaction that includes protections for both third-party lenders (reimbursement if the taxpayer defaults) and taxpayers (limited\n   remedies for the third party if the tax obligation is reinstated by the locality upon default) compel a different result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2058.1-3018\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 58.1-3018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C). These protections do not change the underlying nature of the TPA as an agreement that provides a mechanism for taxpayers to finance payment of their tax obligations through a third party. Indeed, the TPA here involves third-party financing of a tax obligation on its face, and the plain language of the statute, regulations, and Staff Commentary in no way precludes TILA from covering transactions like this one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In support of its view, Propel cites cases from the Third and Fifth Circuits that are neither binding nor, more importantly, analogous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Billings v.

The Fifth Circuit reasoned that because \"the tax obligation [wa]s simply\n   <em>\n    transferred\n   </em>\n   from the taxing authorities to the transferee lending institution, and there [wa]s no independent line of credit extended to the property owner,\" these arrangements were not third-party financing of a tax obligation subject to TILA.\n   <em>\n    Billings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258770\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/608/\">\n    821 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   613 n.4 (emphasis added) (citing\n   <em>\n    Pollice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11232111\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/225/379/\">\n    225 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   409-11 ). Central to the Fifth Circuit's determination was the fact that the transaction involved a tax lien transfer, bringing the transaction closer to a direct tax obligation held by a third party as opposed to third-party financing of a tax obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In stark contrast to those cases, the locality here does not transfer Curtis's tax lien to Propel. Instead, the locality retains the tax lien until Curtis has fully repaid Propel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 32 (explaining as a term of the TPA that the locality will retain any tax liens and will not release any judgments until Curtis completely repays his balance to Propel). The tax obligation here is therefore\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \"simply transferred\" from the locality to the third-party lender as it was in the cases on which Propel relies.\n   <em>\n    Billings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258770\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/608/\">\n    821 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   613 n.4. Rather, by operation of the TPA, Propel extends a line of credit to Curtis to finance the real property taxes that Curtis owes to the locality. The arrangement here thus severs the\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   linkage to a preexisting tax obligation that has led to the general rule excluding tax liens from the definition of credit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, like a mortgage or a bank loan, the TPA involves a consumer enlisting a third party to help it defer payment of a debt in exchange for interest and fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Propel contends that the fact that the locality retains Curtis's tax lien makes the transaction look\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   like a tax obligation and thus is further evidence that the TPA is not a credit transaction. But the fact that a third party has an interest in the thing being financed does not transform a credit transaction into something else. Indeed, this is common in ordinary consumer\n   credit transactions. For example, suppose a consumer purchases an automobile from a dealership and takes out a bank loan to finance it. Under the terms of that loan, the bank places a lien on the automobile until the consumer has paid off the balance. If the consumer sells the car to a secondhand buyer before she pays off the balance of her bank loan, the secondhand buyer might take the automobile subject to the lien. Any bank loan that the secondhand buyer might take out to finance his purchase of the automobile does not cease to be a credit transaction merely because the first bank still holds a lien over the automobile. Similarly, the TPA here does not lose its character as a credit transaction just because a third party--here, the locality--retains a lien related to the underlying obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Indeed, straightforward application of the language of TILA, its regulations, and the Staff Commentary tells us unambiguously that the TPA is a credit transaction because it provides for third-party financing of a tax obligation. But even if the plain language were ambiguous, policy considerations would counsel us to interpret TILA and EFTA to cover transactions like the TPA here because \"TILA is a remedial consumer protection statute that is read liberally to achieve its goals,\" and we \"construe TILA broadly so that it will provide protection for the consumer.\"\n   <em>\n    Phelps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9260697\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/306/593/#p596\">\n    306 F.Supp.2d at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Under this standard, it would frustrate the purpose of TILA and EFTA to exclude the TPA here from regulation. Accordingly, we conclude that the TPA is a credit transaction under those statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Having established that the TPA is a credit transaction, we next consider whether it is also a consumer transaction within the meaning of TILA and EFTA. Under TILA, a consumer transaction is \"one in which the party to whom credit is offered or extended is a natural person, and the money, property, or services which are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i).

Pt. 1026, Supp. I, pt. 1, cmt. 2(a)(12), there are things that seem, on their face, to qualify. Here, the subject of Curtis's transaction was his residential home, and he sought credit to finance the property taxes he owed on that home. It is hard to imagine a transaction more likely to constitute one \"primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Propel urges us to look to bankruptcy law by analogy, arguing that because tax obligations are not debt for purposes of bankruptcy, payment of those obligations cannot involve a consumer transaction. This argument is plainly contradicted by the Staff Commentary.

The associated regulation and commentary known as \"Regulation Z\" clarifies that tax liens, tax assessments, and court judgments are excluded from the definition of \"credit.\" 12 C.F.R. Pt. 1026, Supp. I, pt. 1, cmt. 2(a)(14). However, \"third-party financing of such obligations (for example, a bank loan obtained to pay off a tax lien) is 'credit' for purposes of the regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In my view, the TPA does not qualify as a \"credit\" transaction because Virginia Code \u00a7 58.1-3018 (the Virginia statute), rather than a creditor, grants to a taxpayer like Curtis the right to defer payment of a local tax assessment by entering into a tax-payment plan with a third-party payor like Propel. Among other things, the statute gives the third-party payor a right of recourse against the local government, Va. Code \u00a7 58.1-3018(C)(1), and terminates the TPA as a matter of law once the third-party payor has availed itself of that statutory remedy,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 58.1-3018(C)(4). Given these striking differences, some of which restrict the rights of the third-party payor against the taxpayer, I am puzzled that the majority opines that a TPA effectively \"operates as any other financing transaction would.\" Maj. Op. 243. In my view, this simple declaration by the majority is factually and legally incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   A TPA is not a \"credit transaction,\" within the meaning of TILA, because the preexisting obligation of the taxpayer is not severed by the third-party payor's payment, and the third-party payor does not grant any right to the taxpayer that is not conferred already by statute. The TPA, a creature of Virginia statute, merely implements those statutory rights, with accompanying benefits to both the taxpayer and the third-party payor. The majority sidesteps this statutory framework and strains to conclude that the TPA must be a credit transaction under TILA because (1) Propel has advanced payment on behalf of the taxpayer, and (2) the taxpayer is required to pay that sum back to Propel, unless (3) the taxpayer later defaults on its TPA obligations and Propel obtains repayment from the locality. Any facial appeal of this approach, however, is undermined by the plain terms of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Virginia Code \u00a7 58.1-3018 authorizes the mechanism of TPAs and exercises substantial control over the formation and termination of such agreements. The statute defines TPAs as agreements in which an entity like Propel \"contracts with a taxpayer to pay [local taxes] to a county, city or town on behalf of that taxpayer.\" Va. Code \u00a7 58.1-3018(A). The statute further requires that the TPA \"provide for the reimbursement of the third party by the taxpayer\" in installment payments.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 58.1-3018(B)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Under this plain language, the Virginia statute authorizes the third-party payor to pay the taxpayer's outstanding local tax assessment in return for the taxpayer's promise to repay the third party in accordance with the TPA payment plan. The material terms of that payment plan are regulated by the Virginia statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (setting forth the maximum repayment period, the maximum interest rate, and the maximum origination fee). The statute also requires the third-party payor to provide monthly status reports to the local government\n   regarding the taxpayer's compliance with the TPA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 58.1-3018(B)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The locality's oversight of the taxpayer's compliance with the TPA continues throughout the repayment process. After the third party pays the locality on behalf of the taxpayer, the locality \"toll[s]\" any enforcement period for the taxes owed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 58.1-3018(E). Notably, the locality does not remove the lien or transfer it to the third-party payor, who lacks recourse against a defaulting taxpayer with respect to the underlying tax obligation if the third-party payor obtains reimbursement from the locality as permitted by statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 58.1-3018(C)(4). Upon such repayment of principal from the locality, the TPA terminates as a matter of law and the locality \"reinstates\" the full amount of its tax assessment against the taxpayer, ending the tolling period of enforcement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 58.1-3018(C)(2), (4). Thus, the link between the taxpayer and the preexisting tax assessment is not severed by a TPA as the majority contends, but remains in effect throughout the course of the TPA's operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Contrary to the majority's conclusion, a TPA cannot realign this statutory relationship of the parties and transform the third party's payment of the tax assessment into a \"credit transaction\" under TILA. The Virginia statute merely invites a third-party payor to \"front\" the money for payment of the taxpayer's obligation, in return for receiving fees and interest allowed by the statute, and tolls enforcement of the tax lien against the taxpayer only so long as he complies with the parties' tax-payment plan. In other words, the TPA \"changes only the entity to which\" the taxpayer is \"indebted for the taxes originally owed, not the\n   <em>\n    nature\n   </em>\n   of the underlying debt.\"\n   <em>\n    Billings v.

Op. 244. Although the third-party payor under a TPA collects interest and fees from the taxpayer, any similarity to a bank loan ends there. A TPA is not an independent financial agreement in which a lender or its assignee retains full recourse against the individual receiving the benefit of payment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Billings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258770\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/608/\">\n    821 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   613 &amp; n.4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Pollice v.
