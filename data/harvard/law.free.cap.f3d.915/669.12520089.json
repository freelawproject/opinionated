But for the alleged misinformation that Hill was eligible for such a sentencing enhancement, Hill contends, he might not have entered a plea agreement stating that he should be sentenced to between 57 and 71 months imprisonment, and the district court, in turn, might have imposed a different sentence. We reject this argument, because Hill has failed to show that the alleged misinformation about his ACCA eligibility was \"demonstrably made the basis for the sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The record establishes that Hill's potential eligibility for an ACCA enhancement was not before the sentencing court, and Hill's personal concerns and motivation for entering into the plea agreement do not suffice to establish that the district court made an error of constitutional magnitude. Therefore, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In February 2012, Hill pointed a firearm at a woman during a drunken argument and fled before the police could arrive. After being arrested during a traffic stop a few months later, Hill was subject to a one-count indictment for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). The indictment also alleged that Hill committed this offense after having previously been convicted of five felonies under Oregon law, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). Section 924(e)(1) is part of ACCA, and increases a defendant's prison term to a minimum of 15 years if a defendant who violates \u00a7 922(g) has three previous convictions for \"a violent felony or serious drug offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). ACCA defines \"violent felony\" to include \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that- ... otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B). This portion of the definition of \"violent felony\" is referred to as ACCA's \"residual clause.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2555-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After Hill was indicted, his counsel emailed the prosecuting attorney to discuss a plea agreement. In the email, Hill's counsel tried to persuade the prosecutor that \"this is the type of case that can plea without ACC[A].\" Hill's counsel stated he had sought the police reports for the prior offenses listed in the indictment, and according to the counsel, \"the crimes are fairly stale. The last one was from 2001, two of the records from 1987 and 1989 have been destroyed, and [the Portland Police Department] could not provide one from 1992.\" Moreover, Hill's counsel argued: \"Unlike many ACC[A] predicates I've encountered, none of the cases involve the use of weapons and those that involve threat or intimidation are comical. In one case [Hill] tried to rob a store with his finger and in another the clerk was not intimidated at all.\" Counsel went on to present background information that he believed mitigated Hill's criminal record. Accordingly, Hill's counsel requested that the prosecutor \"dismiss the ACC[A] and allow Mr. Hill to plea to a 57 month sentence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The prosecutor's response to this email is not in the record, but the parties agreed to a plea agreement which stated: \"[p]ursuant to plea negotiations, the parties have agreed that the defendant will be permitted to plead guilty to the charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm without the Armed Career Criminal enhancement.\" Accordingly, \"[a]t the time of the change of plea hearing, the government will ask the Court to strike the 'Armed Career Criminal' penalty provision ( \u00a7 924(e) ) in Count 1.\" The section of the plea agreement entitled \"Sentencing Recommendation after applying 3553(a) Factors\" stated that, after considering those factors and the advisory sentencing guideline range, \"the parties agree that the defendant should be sentenced to between 57 and 71 months imprisonment, to be followed by 3 years of supervised release.\" It further stated that \"[t]he government believes, based upon the mitigation materials you have provided, that a non-Armed Career Criminal sentence is appropriate,\" but, \"based upon the defendant's lengthy criminal history and the nature of this incident,\" the government nevertheless believed that \"a 71 month sentence of imprisonment is warranted.\" Hill was \"free to seek a sentence of no less than 57 months imprisonment.\" Finally, the agreement specified that it was made pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, meaning that the Court was not bound to follow the parties' recommended sentencing range. Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the pre-sentence report (PSR), the U.S. Probation Office calculated that Hill had a total offense level of 21, a criminal history category of VI, and a resulting advisory guideline range of 77-96 months'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   imprisonment. The parties agreed as to all of those conclusions. The PSR recommended a sentence of 77 months' imprisonment, which was \"within, but at the low end of the advisory guideline range, followed by a 3-year term of supervised release,\" given Hill's \"significant criminal history involving firearms, violence, and a disregard for lawful court orders.\" In describing the offense conduct, the PSR noted that \"[t]he Indictment initially charged [Hill] under the Armed Career Criminal Statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1) ; however, as part of plea negotiations, that enhancement was stricken at the time the defendant entered his plea.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court conducted Hill's sentencing hearing in May 2013. The prosecutor argued in favor of a 71-month sentence. He noted Hill's criminal history and stated that \"while some of it is very old, and that was the reason the Government sort of removed the armed career criminal enhancement from the table, it doesn't disappear. It's still out there.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court accepted Hill's guilty plea. In providing Hill with its reasons for the sentence, the court reviewed Hill's criminal history, \"which [was] very serious and lengthy,\" along with \"the very serious nature of th[e] offense, and then the good parts of [Hill's] life and character\" and his \"psychological issues,\" including his problem with alcohol. The court accepted the PSR's calculation of the advisory sentencing guidelines range, and noted that if it \"were to follow the presentence report, the low end of [Hill's] range would be 77 up to 96 months.\" Instead, the court \"tried to consider various factors under Section 3553(a) to fashion a fair and just sentence here under [Hill's] individual circumstances.\" It therefore decided to impose the below-guidelines sentence of 67 months, which was within the 57-to 71-month range recommended by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After the court announced the sentence, it asked whether there were other pending charges requiring dismissal or other resolution. The prosecutor stated that there were none, and continued: \"It's my understanding that when [Hill] entered his change of plea, it was at that time that the Court struck the armed career criminal enhancement, so there are no other charges to be dismissed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Other than the prosecutor's brief references to the ACCA enhancement as being inapplicable to Hill, as noted above, there was no discussion of ACCA at the sentencing hearing. The court did not mention ACCA in its Statement of Reasons; rather, it indicated that a downward variance was appropriate given Hill's \"psychological issues.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Judgment was entered on June 1, 2013. Because Hill did not file a direct appeal, that judgment became final on June 15, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In June 2015, the Supreme Court issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). In\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the Court addressed ACCA's residual clause; that is, its definition of \"violent felony\" as a crime that \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B). Because that language left \"grave uncertainty\" about both \"how to estimate the risk posed by a crime\" and \"how much risk it takes for a crime to qualify as a violent felony,\" it created \"more unpredictability and arbitrariness than the Due Process Clause tolerates.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2557-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   invalidated ACCA's residual\n   clause as unconstitutionally vague and held that any sentence imposed under that clause was likewise invalid.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In a subsequent case, the Court held that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's new rule applied retroactively on collateral review.\n   <em>\n    Welch v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595643\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1257/#p1264\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1264-65,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595643\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1257/#p1264\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Within one year after\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , Hill filed a motion to vacate his sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In his motion, Hill argued that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   affected the calculation of his Guidelines range. Specifically, an applicable section of the Guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, defined \"crime of violence\" using the same language that the Court invalidated in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . Hill argued that his sentence was unconstitutional to the extent it was affected by this unconstitutionally vague language. This argument was quickly foreclosed by the Supreme Court's subsequent decision in\n   <em>\n    Beckles v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/\">\n    197 L.Ed.2d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), which held that the Sentencing Guidelines are not subject to vagueness challenges under the Due Process Clause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/\">\n    at 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   was decided, Hill regrouped and filed a supplemental memorandum. In this memorandum, Hill argued that as a result of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , he was not subject to the 15-year mandatory minimum ACCA sentence because his prior Oregon convictions did not qualify as violent felonies without reliance on the unconstitutional residual clause. His plea agreement and sentence were tainted, Hill contends, because the potential for receiving ACCA's 15-year mandatory minimum enhancement was a key reason he agreed to the sentencing range in the plea agreement, and the plea agreement, in turn, influenced the sentencing judge. Because Hill's sentencing process was impacted by an unconstitutionally vague law, Hill argues, the court should vacate his sentence as unconstitutional and remand for resentencing. Hill has not sought vacatur of his plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On July 25, 2017, the court denied Hill's \u00a7 2255 motion in a minute order without explanation. On October 25, 2017, it entered an additional minute order granting a certificate of appealability on the issue of \"whether Mr. Hill's sentence violated his constitutional rights under\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

In order to succeed on this claim, Hill must first establish that the district court imposed a sentence founded on misinformation of a constitutional magnitude, meaning that it relied on information that is (1) false or unreliable, and (2) demonstrably made the basis for\n   the sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vanderwerfhorst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038787\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/576/929/#p935\">\n    576 F.3d at 935-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The challenged information in this case, Hill claims, is the misinformation that Hill was eligible for an ACCA 15-year minimum sentence. Hill argues that his prior Oregon convictions do not qualify as violent felonies now that the residual clause has been struck down by\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , and therefore he was not eligible for an ACCA enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We need not resolve whether this information was false or unreliable, however, because even assuming Hill is correct, he has not shown that such information was demonstrably made the basis for his sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vanderwerfhorst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038787\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/576/929/#p935\">\n    576 F.3d at 935-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although Hill's indictment included an ACCA charge, there is no dispute that the charge was dismissed when Hill entered his change of plea. The PSR noted that the ACCA charge had been stricken, as did the prosecutor at sentencing. Even the plea agreement was not expressly based on the potential for an ACCA enhancement; to the contrary, it stated that, based on mitigation materials provided by Hill's counsel, a \"non-Armed Career Criminal sentence is appropriate.\" Accordingly, no ACCA-related enhancement was before the district court at sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   During the sentencing hearing, Hill concedes, \"the sentencing court did not reference the ACCA when it imposed sentence.\" Rather, the court discussed Hill's criminal history, alcoholism, psychological issues, and other factors. Further, rather than impose an enhanced sentence, the court imposed a below-Guidelines sentence that was within the sentencing range set forth in the plea agreement. In fact, there is no evidence that the court even considered whether Hill was eligible for an ACCA enhancement, let alone that the court made it the basis for Hill's sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Hill argues that there is nevertheless an indirect relationship between his supposed eligibility for an ACCA enhancement and the court's sentence. According to Hill, the potential for a 15-year mandatory ACCA sentence was a looming presence in his plea negotiations, and affected the sentencing range set forth in the plea agreement. Because the district court considered the sentencing range in the plea agreement, Hill argues, the court was indirectly affected by the background presence of ACCA eligibility. This argument fails. A defendant must show that the challenged information was \"demonstrably made the basis for the sentence\"; even evidence that the district court mentioned the challenged information in passing may not suffice.\n   <em>\n    Vanderwerfhorst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038787\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/576/929/#p935\">\n    576 F.3d at 935-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given that Hill has provided no evidence that the threat of an ACCA charge played a role in the district court's formulation of the sentence, he fails to meet the standard here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Because Hill has not established that the challenged information was the basis of the court's sentence, we reject Hill's claim that his due process rights were violated, and conclude he is not entitled to a hearing on that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Because the government does not distinctly argue that Hill's claim is untimely under the one-year statute of limitations in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (f), it has waived this argument and we do not address it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Day v.
