Because an armed robbery conviction requires at least as much force as simple robbery under \u00a7 812.13(1), it qualifies as a violent felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20812.13\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (holding robbery under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20812.13\">\n    Fla.

Robbery under \u00a7 2C:15-1(a)(1), the only provision he challenges, \"requires more force than that necessary merely to snatch [an] object\"-there must be \"some degree of force to wrest the object from the victim.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
