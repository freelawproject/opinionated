She appeals, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support her convictions, that the Fifth Amendment bars her misprision conviction, and that the district court erred in refusing to give her proposed \"mere presence\" jury instruction. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) began investigating a methamphetamine trafficking ring in Batesville, Arkansas, in December 2014. Solis held title to one of the four houses under DEA surveillance. She lived in the house with five individuals: her three children; her boyfriend,\n   Ivan Pedraza (Pedraza); and her boyfriend's brother, Fredy Pedraza (Fredy), who served as the methamphetamine \"cook.\" Solis was also the registered owner of four vehicles used by the Pedrazas in conducting drug deals and investigated by the DEA. During a controlled purchase on May 13, 2015, Solis sat in the passenger's seat of a car with Pedraza while he exchanged methamphetamine for money with a confidential informant through the passenger's window.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Further evidence of Solis's involvement in the conspiracy included a package addressed to Solis's house containing an air conditioning unit stuffed with methamphetamine, surveillance of Pedraza and Fredy leaving Solis's house to sell drugs and later returning to the house, and intercepted calls between Pedraza and Solis discussing Solis's plan to purchase acetone, which is a cleaning product used to remove adulterants from methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Using one of Solis's vehicles, Pedraza drove Solis and two of her children to Dallas, Texas, on July 17, 2015, where he planned on purchasing ten kilograms of methamphetamine. Before they left, Pedraza called Fredy and asked for some car seats. Fredy responded that the car seats were filled with \"stew,\" a slang term for drugs. Pedraza at first asked him to \"take the stew out of them,\" but later said that he would instead purchase car seats before driving to Dallas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After Pedraza, Solis, and the children arrived in Dallas, DEA agents intercepted a phone conversation in which Solis asked Pedraza if he had \"fix[ed] everything there.\" An agent testified that Solis was asking whether Pedraza worked out all the details of the drug deal. Solis and Pedraza drove back to Batesville on July 19, 2015. DEA agents informed local law enforcement that Solis's vehicle likely contained cash and methamphetamine, and a state trooper stopped the car for a traffic violation. Solis consented to a search of the vehicle. After the trooper found a cordless screwdriver with a single Phillips bit and a suitcase containing Ziploc bags, he examined the car seats and found them abnormally heavy. Using the cordless drill and the Phillips bit, he disassembled the car seats and found $19,000 in rubber-banded cash and 2.5 kilograms of methamphetamine. He found another $1,796 in rubber-banded cash in Solis's purse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   DEA and local law enforcement agents executed search warrants on the four houses associated with the drug trafficking ring. Agents found $18,000 in cash stashed in various places in Solis's residence. Searches of the sparsely furnished stash houses revealed distributable amounts of methamphetamine, along with Ziploc bags, digital scales, acetone, and a car seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Solis was indicted on the counts set forth above. Before trial, Solis requested a jury instruction stating that mere presence in a jointly occupied vehicle would be insufficient to establish possession of illegal substances. The district court declined to include the instruction, finding it duplicative and slightly inaccurate. The jury convicted Solis on all three counts. The district court sentenced Solis to 235 months' imprisonment on the drug distribution offenses and 36 months' imprisonment on the misprision offense, to run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Solis argues that the evidence is insufficient to support her convictions. We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction, \"viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict and reversing the verdict only if no reasonable jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ramos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277563\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/747/#p753\">\n    852 F.3d 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 753 (8th Cir. 2017) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We disagree. A reasonable jury could have found that Solis intentionally joined the conspiracy based on the evidence that: she allowed her house to be used to receive drugs and store money; she allowed her vehicles to be used for drug deals; she purchased acetone knowing it would be used to purify methamphetamine; she accompanied Pedraza to Dallas knowing he would purchase methamphetamine there; she allowed her children's car seats to be used to store methamphetamine; and she carried drug proceeds in her purse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Solis next argues that the government failed to prove that she possessed with intent to distribute methamphetamine. She claims that the evidence did not support a finding that she knowingly possessed the methamphetamine stashed inside the children's car seats.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350187\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/887/#p894\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (elements of possession with intent to distribute). The government may prove knowing possession by showing constructive possession-that is, that Solis had both knowledge of and control over the contraband.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10509635\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/18/641/#p647\">\n    18 F.3d 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 647 (8th Cir. 1994). Mere presence or physical proximity alone cannot support such a finding. There must be \"some nexus between a defendant and the contraband.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10509635\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/18/641/#p647\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Solis argues that the evidence did not establish a nexus between her and the methamphetamine. She cites our recent decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ramos\n   </em>\n   that evidence of joint occupation of a room in which a firearm was found was, without more, insufficient to support a finding that the defendant constructively possessed that firearm.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277563\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/747/#p753\">\n    852 F.3d at 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   , the evidence supported a finding that Solis: knew that Pedraza had purchased methamphetamine in Dallas; allowed Pedraza to store the drugs in her vehicle; knew that the drugs were stashed in her children's car seats; and had access to those car seats. Accordingly, a reasonable jury could find that Solis had knowledge of and control over the methamphetamine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10509635\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/18/641/#p647\">\n    18 F.3d at 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding a sufficient nexus when the defendant's clothes were in the same bag as the contraband, permitting an inference that he controlled the bag and knew its contents).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Solis next contends that the government failed to prove that she took an affirmative act of concealment necessary to sustain her misprision conviction. We do not reach this issue, however, because we reverse Solis's misprision conviction on Fifth Amendment grounds, as explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   III. Fifth Amendment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Solis argues that the district court erred by entering a misprision judgment against her in contravention of her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Because Solis raises this argument for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Puckett v.

Rush-Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675446\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/574/906/#p910\">\n    574 F.3d 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 910 (8th Cir. 2009) ). \"Usually, for an error to be plain, it must be in contravention of either Supreme Court or controlling circuit precedent.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This statutory offense thus requires proof that the defendant knew of the completion of a felony, failed to notify the proper authorities of that fact, and took \" 'affirmative steps' to conceal\" the felony.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bolden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9247535\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/368/1032/#p1037\">\n    368 F.3d 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1037 (8th Cir. 2004). Perhaps predictably, and as this case demonstrates, where the person who \"knows\" about the felony is also implicated in that same felony, \"there are tensions between the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and the statutory obligation to provide disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Caraballo-Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895772\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/480/62/\">\n    480 F.3d 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 72 n.7 (1st Cir. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The superseding indictment in this case charged that beginning in or around the same time period, Solis both (1) was a co-conspirator in the methamphetamine conspiracy (Count 1); and (2) failed to alert the authorities about that very conspiracy, in violation of the misprision statute (Count 3). At trial, the government urged the jury to convict Solis of misprision and conspiracy based on the same conduct. It explained, \"[Solis] participated in the conspiracy. She possessed meth. She intended to distribute it, and then she concealed it.\" The jury's misprision conviction therefore criminally punished Solis for failing to tell authorities about a crime in which she was already involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination, however, guarantees that witnesses will not be \"compelled to give self-incriminating testimony\"; it forbids \"officially coerced self-accusation[s].\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2180\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/181/#p187\">\n    431 U.S. 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 187-88,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2180\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/181/#p187\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2180\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/181/#p187\">\n    52 L.Ed.2d 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977). And since\n   <em>\n    Hoffman v. United States\n   </em>\n   , it has been settled that this privilege \"not only extends to answers that would in themselves support a conviction ... but likewise embraces those which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a federal crime,\" provided \"the witness has reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1148003\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/341/479/#p486\">\n    341 U.S. 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 486,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1148003\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/341/479/#p486\">\n    71 S.Ct. 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20L.%20Ed.%201118\">\n    95 L.Ed. 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1951) (holding that a defendant could not be compelled to testify about the whereabouts of a fugitive witness where defendant's answers would have \"forge[d] links in a chain of facts imperiling [defendant] with conviction of a federal crime\"). Under\n   <em>\n    Hoffman\n   </em>\n   , therefore, it is plain that the government cannot use the misprision statute to require someone to report a crime-an essential element of misprision-where doing so reasonably could lead to that individual's own prosecution. Accordingly, it was error to charge, and convict, Solis on the misprision count, and that error violated a substantial right: Solis's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Our conclusion comports with decisions by the Ninth and Seventh Circuits applying\n   <em>\n    Hoffman\n   </em>\n   to curtail misprision prosecutions under similar circumstances. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. King\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit held that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination precluded a conviction\n   for misprision of a bank robbery because the defendant had reasonable cause to believe that reporting the robbery could lead to his prosecution as an aider and abetter or as an accessory.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2132036\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/402/694/#p697\">\n    402 F.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 697 (9th Cir. 1968). Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Kuh\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit affirmed dismissal of a misprision charge where the government's evidence showed that, \"at the time the duty to disclose [the felony] arose, the defendants ... were simultaneously involved in criminal conduct\" related to the underlying felony, such that they could reasonably believe that \"disclosing information as to their knowledge of the [felony] would place them in the position of furnishing the Government with evidence that could lead to their prosecution or conviction.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1034972\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/541/672/#p677\">\n    541 F.2d 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 677 (7th Cir. 1976) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
