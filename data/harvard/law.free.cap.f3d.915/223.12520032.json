The district court honored the sentencing recommendation in Johnson's original plea agreement, in which the government agreed not to seek a mandatory life sentence under the federal three-strikes law.

Johnson now argues that he received no benefit from the plea agreement because his prior conviction for a New York robbery offense would not have counted as his third strike, and he thus would have been ineligible for a mandatory life sentence. We disagree. The text and structure of \u00a7 3559(c) reveal a congressional intent to encompass state laws such as the New York robbery offense here, which shares the essential characteristics of the enumerated robbery offenses under federal law. We therefore affirm the district court's sentencing decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record of the sentencing hearing revealed the following: On February 1, 2002, Willie Johnson robbed federally insured Farmer and Merchants Bank in Afton, Virginia along with his then-girlfriend's son, Khalid Ahmad. Both men wore ski masks and carried firearms-Johnson an AR-15 rifle, Ahmad a .40 caliber pistol. Johnson ordered customers to\n   get on the floor and, when one hesitated, yelled, \"I told you to get down, I don't want to have to shoot nobody.\" J.A. 219. He then commanded tellers to stuff the bank's cash in a pillowcase, this time with less subtlety: \"If you don't hurry up I'll kill you, don't think I won't kill you.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203559\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After collecting about six-thousand dollars, Johnson and Ahmad sped away at more than one hundred miles-per-hour in a vehicle they had stolen earlier that morning. In the course of the attempted getaway, the men jumped a curb and drove through a school playground. They ditched the car at the edge of a forested area near the school and ran into the woods. Witnesses heard gunshots. Schoolchildren were rushed indoors. While the men evaded capture that day, they were apprehended shortly after.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A federal grand jury indicted Johnson for conspiring to commit bank robbery and conspiring to use and carry a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count One); robbing a bank with a deadly weapon, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (d) (Count Two); brandishing a semiautomatic assault weapon during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (Count Three); and possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1), with three previous convictions for violent felony offenses under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (the Armed Career Criminal Act, or ACCA) (Collectively, Count Five).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Presentence Investigation Report also revealed the following: Johnson's criminal record, even excluding numerous juvenile adjudications and parole violations, was extensive. In 1975, Johnson assaulted a man with a pool cue, and he later pled guilty to New York assault charges. In 1976, Johnson pled guilty to New York Robbery and was sentenced to seven years' incarceration. He had robbed a man at gunpoint, pistol-whipping the man near his eye and causing a concussion. In 1983, Johnson was charged with ten bank robberies in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. He pled guilty to two of them and received a sentence of ten years' imprisonment. In 1994, he burglarized at least two homes, crimes for which he subsequently pled guilty to attempted burglary and was sentenced to 30-60 months' incarceration. In 1999, Johnson was convicted of three crimes related to breaking into a residence, for which he received three consecutive one-year terms in jail. The present offenses took place in 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Federal law provides for lengthier sentences for repeat, violent offenders like Johnson. Most relevant to Johnson's case was the federal three-strikes law, which provides for a mandatory sentence of life in prison after a third conviction for a \"serious violent felony.\" See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203559\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(F) (listing \"robbery\" as a \"serious violent felony\"). Leading up to Johnson's trial for the instant offenses, the United States filed an Information, see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20851\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), a document alerting the court that Johnson had two prior \"serious violent felony\" convictions-specifically, Johnson's 1976 New York robbery and 1983 federal bank robbery convictions. A conviction in the 2002 bank robbery case, in other words, would have been Johnson's third strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Staring at a mandatory life sentence, Johnson agreed to plead guilty on the third day of trial. Johnson specified in the plea agreement, \"In exchange for my pleas of guilty to the charges in the Indictment, the United States will move to dismiss the Information filed pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203559\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20851\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\" J.A. 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The agreement also contained the following sentencing recommendation: \"I agree to an upward departure on Count Two [bank robbery] to the maximum statutory sentence for that charge [of 300 months]. I agree to this recommendation, in exchange for the United States moving to dismiss the Information that would otherwise enhance my sentence to mandatory life imprisonment.\" J.A. 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The United States honored its end of the bargain by dismissing the Information. The United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia then held Johnson to his end of the bargain, imposing concurrent 300-month sentences for bank robbery (Count Two) and under the Armed Career Criminal Act (Count Five), along with a concurrent 60-month sentence for the conspiracy charge (Count One). This sentence fell within Johnson's then-mandatory guidelines range of 262-327 months. The district court also sentenced Johnson to 120 months in prison for brandishing a semiautomatic assault weapon during and in relation to a crime of violence (Count Three), to be served consecutively. Johnson's effective sentence totaled 420 months in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   About a dozen years later, the Supreme Court ruled that ACCA's residual clause was impermissibly vague under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. See\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/#p2563\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2563,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/#p2563\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). The defendant then filed a petition under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , seeking to vacate his 420-month sentence because Count Five had included a charge based on ACCA's residual clause. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B). There remained a dispute whether ACCA still applied to Johnson without the residual clause. ACCA properly applied if Johnson had three previous \"violent felony\" convictions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A violent felony includes a state felony that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (the force clause). Johnson effectively conceded that his two 1983 federal bank robbery convictions counted as violent felonies. See\n   <em>\n    United States v. McNeal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250748\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/818/141/#p153\">\n    818 F.3d 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 153 (4th Cir. 2016) (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   qualifies under ACCA's force clause). The parties disagreed as to whether Johnson's 1976 New York third-degree robbery conviction required as an element the use of physical force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court ultimately sided with the defendant. Under that ruling, Johnson no longer qualified as an armed career criminal, and his existing sentence on Count Five therefore exceeded the statutory maximum for a felon-in-possession charge without the ACCA enhancement. The court granted Johnson's \u00a7 2255 petition and vacated his existing sentence in full under the sentencing package doctrine, which provides that \"when a defendant is found guilty on a multicount indictment, there is a strong likelihood that the district court will craft a disposition in which the sentences on the various counts form part of an overall plan, and that if some counts are vacated,\" the judge should revisit the sentences on all the remaining counts.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ventura\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275698\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/301/#p309\">\n    864 F.3d 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 309 (4th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The United States Probation Office prepared a new Presentence Investigation Report reflecting the district court's determination that Johnson was not an armed career criminal under ACCA, and also not listing him as a career offender under the Sentencing Guidelines, resulting in an amended guidelines range of 130-162 months. The district court resentenced Johnson to 60 months for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon (Count Five),\n   instead of the original 300-month sentence that reflected the ACCA enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The sentencing court, however, imposed the same sentences as before on the remaining counts after considering the original plea agreement and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court observed \"that the offense conduct was very serious, exposing both the individuals at the bank as well as those in [the] path of his flight to danger.\" J.A. 203. It also rejected Johnson's argument that his sentence should be reduced because of his age. Johnson's \"extreme criminal history,\" coupled with a present offense that was \"one of the worst that ha[d] come before the [c]ourt,\" demonstrated that \"Johnson is a danger to society whenever he has been out of prison.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   204.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court found that Johnson agreed to plead guilty and accept the maximum sentence for bank robbery in exchange for the government's moving to dismiss the Information filed under the three-strikes law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203559\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). That law applies mandatory life sentences to convictions for a serious violent felony for those defendants who were previously convicted \"on separate prior occasions\" of at least two other serious violent felonies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203559\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The present offense and the two prior offenses together counted as the three strikes. Johnson's 1976 New York robbery conviction, his 1983 federal bank robbery conviction, and his federal bank robbery conviction in the present case, in the district court's view, each would have counted as a strike. \"Because Johnson would still be eligible for mandatory life imprisonment [under \u00a7 3559(c) ], he is still receiving the benefit of avoiding a much higher sentence.\" J.A. 203. The district court therefore resentenced Johnson to \"the parties' prior recommended sentence [for] the aggravated bank robbery charge in the plea agreement\" in order to \"honor[ ] the original plan ... [that] the parties agreed to.\" J.A. 203. In the end, the reduced sentence on the firearm possession count did not alter the original effective sentence of 420 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Johnson now asks this court to vacate his new sentence. His principal argument is that the district court made a legal error in concluding that his New York robbery conviction would count as a third strike under the federal three-strikes law, which lists robbery as a qualifying offense.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203559\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

What remains is whether Johnson's 1976 New York robbery conviction counts as strike three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We begin, as always, with the text of the statute. Congress defined a serious violent felony to include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (i) a Federal or State offense, by whatever designation and wherever committed, consisting of murder (as described in section 1111); manslaughter other than involuntary manslaughter (as described in section 1112); assault with intent to commit murder (as described in section 113(a) ); assault with intent to commit rape; aggravated sexual abuse and sexual abuse (as described in sections 2241 and 2242); abusive sexual contact (as described in sections 2244 (a)(1) and (a)(2) ); kidnapping; aircraft piracy (as described in section 46502 of Title 49); robbery (as described in section 2111, 2113, or 2118 [of Title 18] ); carjacking (as described in section 2119); extortion; arson; firearms use; firearms possession (as described in section 924(c) ); or attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit any of the above offenses; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (ii) any other offense punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another or that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person of another may be used in the course of committing the offense[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203559\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(F). The statutory text includes the familiar three-part structure, with an enumerated clause, a force clause, and a residual clause. Johnson argues that \u00a7 3559(c) 's force clause does not apply to him because his robbery conviction was not \"punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203559\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(F)(ii) ; see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%20160.05\">\n    N.Y.

The district court, for its part, rested its case on the enumerated clause. The question, therefore, boils down to this: Did Congress intend to include New York third degree robbery as a serious violent felony in its listing of specific crimes in \u00a7 3559(c) ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The answer, unsurprisingly, is yes. Congress, after all, specifically listed robbery as a qualifying state offense. The statutory language in \u00a7 3559(c) asks whether the \"Federal or State offense,\" not a defendant's actions, \"consist[s] of\" an enumerated offense.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203559\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(F)(i). We will thus apply a \"categorical approach,\" meaning that we will compare the New York robbery statute, rather than the facts underlying Johnson's convictions, to the federal statutes that Congress referenced to describe robbery in the three-strikes law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203559\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (describing robbery by reference to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202111\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2113, 2118 ); see also\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Congress faced no small task in writing the three-strikes law in a way that\n   would incorporate the contours and nuances of myriad state criminal codes, especially with the understanding that those codes will develop over time. With that in mind, Congress could hardly have been clearer in the text of the statute that \u00a7 3559(c) 's enumerated clause should be understood broadly. It listed more than a dozen distinct types of criminal offenses. Cf.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii) (ACCA, listing only three). And the enumerated clause either directly describes each crime in \u00a7 3559(c)(2) (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , arson, extortion, and kidnapping), or, more often, describes that crime by cross reference to another federal statute (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , robbery, carjacking, and firearms possession).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Moreover, Congress began the definition with prefatory language of greater rather than lesser inclusion: a \"serious violent felony\" includes \"a Federal or State offense, by whatever designation and wherever committed.\" This broad language has no counterpart in ACCA, and was no doubt meant to capture a wide variety of state and federal offenses. \"It is hard to see why Congress would have used this language, if it had meant that every detail of the federal offense, including its jurisdictional elements, had to be replicated in the state offense.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Congress could hardly have expected the fifty states to cut-and-paste federal verbiage into every state law. Using different words to prohibit the same conduct, therefore, poses no barrier to a match in the \u00a7 3559(c) context. For example, New York law specifies the ways that force or a threat of force could be used in the commission of a robbery, including by \"[c]ompelling the owner of such property or another person to deliver up the property or to engage in other conduct which aids in the commission of the larceny.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%20160.00\">\n    N.Y.

Section 3559(c) thus concisely describes robbery in a way that traces New York's articulation of the same. To rule otherwise would assume that Congress, through inclusive language, somehow meant to exclude the robbery statutes of almost twenty different states which may not have a presence requirement, but which do share with the referenced federal statutes the essential elements of taking from another by force and violence, or by intimidation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Supreme Court has repeatedly cautioned against interpreting federal statutes to exclude state offenses that employ language common among the several states.

This argument is not persuasive. These jurisdictional elements are not essential to robbery in \u00a7 3559(c). Take \u00a7 2111, the maritime and territorial robbery statute, for example. Congress surely did not seek to exempt Johnson from the three-strikes law simply because his\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   robbery conviction did not have an element requiring the crime to occur within the\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the United States. That would be quite an odd element to find in a state criminal offense. Indeed, the Supreme\n   Court has ignored jurisdictional elements of federal crimes when comparing them to state offenses in the context of statutes that, as here, use the \"described in\" terminology. See\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596710\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1619/#p1626\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even more clearly, \u00a7 3559(c)(2)(F) specifically includes a \"State offense ... wherever committed\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , in a special federal jurisdiction or not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   All in all, we are left with the conviction that Congress intended robbery under the three-strikes law to encompass New York robbery in the third degree. The statute uses language of greater inclusion time and time again when describing the variety of state offenses that qualify under its enumerated clause. And the essence of robbery in New York is just the same as that of the federal robbery statutes that \u00a7 3559(c) references, which is a taking from another by force and violence, or by intimidation.

That plea agreement, in Johnson's view, was based on mutual mistakes in believing that he was an armed career criminal and career offender, both of which increased his then-mandatory guidelines range. But at bottom, Johnson exchanged a guilty plea and sentencing recommendation for the government's agreement not to seek a mandatory life sentence under \u00a7 3559(c). Johnson has continued to benefit from the agreement at resentencing by avoiding the mandatory life sentence. The district court therefore acted well within its discretion in considering the earlier plea agreement when imposing a new sentence on Johnson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The sentencing court's decision whether to consider certain facts is an element of procedural reasonableness,\n   <em>\n    Ventura\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275698\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/301/#p309\">\n    864 F.3d at 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which we review for an abuse of discretion,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

I agree to this recommendation, in exchange for the United States moving to dismiss the Information that would otherwise enhance my sentence to mandatory life imprisonment.\"). The mutual mistakes Johnson alleges (assuming, for present purposes, that they were indeed mistakes) did not materially affect the exchange of performances or deprive Johnson of the benefits for which he bargained. The district court was well within its discretion to provide the United States with its benefit from the bargain by resentencing Johnson to the maximum sentence on the bank robbery count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   It bears mention that the able district judge here conducted Johnson's sentencing with care and patience. He calculated the advisory guidelines range and explained exactly why the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a) warranted an upward variance from the range. Johnson's chief argument at sentencing was that he had aged out of his prime crime years. The district court considered this argument to be outweighed by the violent and extensive character of his crimes, spread over many decades, and the fact that he had agreed to the sentence imposed in exchange for the government's agreement not to pursue a mandatory life sentence. We need not dwell in detail upon the full extent of Johnson's daunting criminal record in order to conclude that the sentence was procedurally and substantively reasonable and in accord with all requirements of law. The district court's decision resentencing Johnson is therefore\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Count Four related to Johnson's co-conspirator.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Johnson may also have borne the risk that his plea agreement would prevent him from taking advantage of subsequent legal developments.

Since the district court's decision rested upon the fact that Johnson continued to receive the benefit of his plea agreement, we too rest our decision on that ground. See\n    <em>\n     Hughes v.

In that case, the Second Circuit compared New York robbery to the generic offense of robbery, finding that the state offense was not a \"crime of violence\" because it lacked a presence requirement.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518533\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/155/#p161\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518533\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/155/#p161\">\n     at 161-64\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But this is not a case about the Guidelines or the generic robbery offense. This is a case about \u00a7 3559(c). No matter how New York robbery might or might not compare with the generic robbery offense, we note here that \u00a7 3559(c) describes robbery with sufficient breadth to include New York robbery. Moreover,\n    <em>\n     Pereira-Gomez\n    </em>\n    did not mention\n    <em>\n     Snype\n    </em>\n    , and we assume the Second Circuit would not overrule\n    <em>\n     sub silentio\n    </em>\n    its prior precedent. And while we are not, of course, bound by decisions of other circuits, we find\n    <em>\n     Snype\n    </em>\n    , in all events, to be persuasive.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    At least nineteen states do not include a narrow presence requirement in their definition of robbery.
