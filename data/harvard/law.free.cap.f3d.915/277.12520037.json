At issue is whether Fire &amp; Safety's payment system violated the FLSA by failing to\n   pay for overtime. The district court held that the payment system violated the FLSA because it used a blended rate that functioned as the actual hourly rate for all hours worked, regardless of whether those hours were overtime or non-overtime. We agree and therefore, affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2008, Harris founded Fire &amp; Safety,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which provides fire investigation and security guard services to the company's clients in the oil and gas industry. In 2013, Fire &amp; Safety began employing individuals (\"Consultants\") to provide onsite safety and environmental consulting services in West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Between December 23, 2014, and December 6, 2016, Consultants were regularly scheduled to work what is known in the industry as a \"hitch.\" J.A. 1266. Consultants assigned to a \"hitch\" worked 12 hours per day for 14 consecutive days, followed by 14 consecutive days off, resulting in a total of 168 hours worked during a full \"hitch.\" Consultants sometimes worked a full, 168-hour hitch, and sometimes fewer than the full 168 hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Fire &amp; Safety initially paid the Consultants on an hourly basis-a regular rate for the first 40 hours worked in a workweek, and then overtime at one and one-half times their regular rate for hours worked over 40 per workweek. Fire &amp; Safety later transitioned to a different payment system based on a \"hitch rate.\" Under that system, if the Consultants worked the full two-week hitch of 168 hours, or 84 hours per workweek, Fire &amp; Safety paid a fixed sum that allegedly reflected a regular rate and an overtime rate-i.e., the regular rate for the first 40 hours a Consultant worked in a particular week and one-and-a-half times the regular rate for the next 44 hours the Consultant worked during the week. If the Consultants worked\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   than a full 168-hour hitch over the two-week period, Fire &amp; Safety adjusted the employee's pay using a \"blended rate.\" Fire &amp; Safety calculated the blended rate by dividing the Consultant's fixed hitch rate by 168 (the total number of hours worked in a normal hitch) and then multiplying that hourly blended rate by the number of hours actually worked by the Consultant to obtain the Consultant's pay for that two-week period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A hypothetical example of a Consultant working at a purported regular rate of $ 10/hour illustrates this payment scheme. Under Fire &amp; Safety's description of the hitch payment structure, the Consultant's fixed rate for a full 168-hour hitch would allegedly be based on 80 hours of non-overtime (at $ 10/hour), for a total of $ 800, and 88 hours of overtime (at $ 15/hour), for a total of $ 1,320, for a combined total of $ 2,120. If the Consultant worked the full two-week, 168-hour hitch, he was paid $ 2,120-his hitch rate. However, if the Consultant worked, say, only 48 hours of the hitch, he was paid using the blended rate, obtained by dividing $ 2,120 by 168 hours; in our example, that results in a blended rate of $ 12.62 (rounded to the nearest cent). For 48 hours of work, the Consultant would then be paid $ 12.62 times 48, for a total of $ 605.76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In October 2015, an anonymous Consultant complained to the Department of Labor's Wage &amp; Hour Division that Fire &amp; Safety was violating the FLSA by failing to pay overtime. A Wage &amp; Hour Investigator assigned to the case ultimately determined that Fire &amp; Safety had failed to pay proper overtime and keep accurate records and calculated that Fire &amp; Safety owed significant back wages. At the end of the investigation, Fire &amp; Safety, without\n   admitting liability or agreeing to pay damages, ceased use of the hitch rate payment scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 22, 2017, the Department of Labor filed a complaint against Fire &amp; Safety, alleging that Fire &amp; Safety violated the FLSA by employing the Consultants for workweeks longer than 40 hours per week without overtime compensation. The Department of Labor also alleged that Fire &amp; Safety violated the FLSA by failing to make and maintain adequate and accurate records of hours worked by the Consultants. The Department of Labor sought back wages, liquidated damages, and an injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following discovery, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. On May 3, 2018, the district court granted in part and denied in part the Department of Labor's motion for summary judgment and denied Fire &amp; Safety's motion for summary judgment. The district court concluded that Fire &amp; Safety violated the FLSA's overtime requirement by failing to pay the Consultants an overtime premium for their overtime hours. The district court also concluded that Fire &amp; Safety failed to keep proper records, including records of the hours worked by each Consultant each day, in violation of the FLSA. The district court denied the Department of Labor's request for injunctive relief but granted $ 817,902.11 in back wages and $ 817,902.11 in liquidated damages, for a total damages amount of $ 1,635,804.22. Fire &amp; Safety timely appealed the district court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We \"review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Morrison v.

The employer in\n   <em>\n    Asselta\n   </em>\n   claimed that the fixed weekly payment reflected both non-overtime and overtime compensation; instead of determining an hourly rate of pay upon which the fixed weekly amount was based, the agreement included a formula that derived the regular rate for non-overtime hours from the fixed weekly amount and the employee's scheduled hours.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 202-03,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157399\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/199/#p204\">\n    67 S.Ct. 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the evidence in\n   <em>\n    Asselta\n   </em>\n   established that the regular rate was in fact obtained by dividing the weekly wage for the scheduled workweek by the number of hours in that scheduled workweek.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 204-05,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157399\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/199/#p204\">\n    67 S.Ct. 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the agreement \"made no adequate provision for overtime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In other words, the hourly rate of pay at issue in\n   <em>\n    Asselta\n   </em>\n   remained the same irrespective of whether an employee worked more than, less than, or exactly 46 hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Crucially, the Supreme Court pointed out that even employees working\n   <em>\n    fewer\n   </em>\n   than 40 hours a week-or no overtime hours-were still paid using the same hourly rate of pay that supposedly factored in overtime.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 205,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157399\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/199/#p204\">\n    67 S.Ct. 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court found that such compensation \"considerably in excess of the formula rate\" violated the FLSA, because the \"payment of 'overtime' compensation for non-overtime work raises strong doubt as to the integrity of the hourly rate upon the basis of which the 'overtime' compensation is calculated,\" and is \"evidence of an attempt to pay a pro-rata share of the weekly wage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, the Supreme Court concluded that for purposes of the FLSA, the regular rate was the hourly rate the employer actually paid (the fixed weekly salary divided by the 46 scheduled hours).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Asselta\n   </em>\n   establishes that in determining the regular hourly rate for purposes of the FLSA, courts must look beyond the contractual agreement to actual pay practices. When determining the regular hourly rate, courts examine whether the blended rate consistently applies across the board, regardless of the number of hours actually worked in a week. Especially significant is whether such a blended rate-which supposedly factors in overtime compensation-is paid even when an employee does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   work overtime hours. Such schemes cast doubt on the \"integrity\n   of the hourly rate\" upon which overtime compensation is calculated and indicate that the blended rate actually serves as the regular rate.\n   <em>\n    Asselta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157399\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/199/#p204\">\n    331 U.S. at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157399\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/199/#p204\">\n    67 S.Ct. 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In particular, the district court properly determined that in practice, Fire &amp; Safety's blended rate operated as the regular rate for the purposes of determining Consultants' overtime compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To better demonstrate this conclusion, we turn to an example of the \"actual fact[s]\" of Fire &amp; Safety's pay practices.\n   <em>\n    Asselta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157399\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/199/#p204\">\n    331 U.S. at 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157399\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/199/#p204\">\n    67 S.Ct. 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to Fire &amp; Safety's 2015 payroll records, one Consultant had an hourly regular rate of $ 23.58, and his hitch rate was $ 5,000 per hitch. Fire &amp; Safety argues that the hitch rate incorporated both straight-time and overtime rates, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.309\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, when the Consultant worked a full hitch, as he did on the pay period ending January 23, 2015, he was allegedly compensated for 80 non-overtime hours at $ 23.58/hour, and 88 overtime hours at $ 35.37/hour (his overtime rate of $ 23.58 x 1.5).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   80 non-overtime hours x $ 23.58/hour = $ 1,886.40\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   88 overtime hours x $ 35.37/hour = $ 3,112.56\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   TOTAL = $ 4,998.96 (rounded up to $ 5,000)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We note that there are two ways to reach this $ 5,000 figure. First, it can be obtained using Fire &amp; Safety's calculation that allegedly incorporates 80 non-overtime hours at the Consultant's regular rate and 88 hours at his overtime rate. However, the $ 5,000 sum can also be reached if the Consultant's blended rate of $ 29.76/hour-$ 5,000 divided by 168-actually operated as the regular rate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   If we examine the Consultant's compensation when he worked\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   than a full hitch, it becomes clear that his blended rate of $ 29.76/hour actually operated as the regular rate. For example, on the pay period ending January 9, 2015, the Consultant worked only six 12-hour days (or 72 hours), rather than a full hitch. Had the Consultant been compensated per his alleged regular rate of $ 23.58/hour, he would have received the following for his 72-hour workweek:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   40 non-overtime hours x $ 23.58/hour = $ 943.20\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   32 overtime hours x $ 35.37/hour = $ 1,131.84\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   TOTAL = $ 2,075.04\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In fact, however, he received $ 2,142.86 for that six-day work period, which is his blended rate ($ 29.76/hour) multiplied by 72 hours worked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Tellingly, the blended rate was also used when a Consultant worked\n   <em>\n    fewer\n   </em>\n   than 40 hours, in other words, when he worked no overtime at all. Consider another Consultant, whose regular rate, as listed on Fire &amp; Safety's 2015 payroll, was $ 21.44/hour, with a hitch rate of $ 4,545/hitch.

Fire &amp; Safety is correct that the Department of Labor's implementing regulations for the FLSA provide that when an employee works a fixed number of overtime hours, the employer may pay the employee a fixed sum each week. In particular, \"where an employee works a regular fixed number of hours in excess of the statutory maximum each workweek, it is, of course, proper to pay him, in addition to his compensation for nonovertime hours, a fixed sum in any such week for his overtime work, determined by multiplying his overtime rate by the number of overtime hours regularly worked.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.309\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   However, Section 778.309 applies only when an employee works a\n   <em>\n    fixed\n   </em>\n   number of overtime and non-overtime hours, and therefore does not address the issue raised in the instant case: whether the FLSA permits an alternative means of compensation, here, the blended rate, when an employee works\n   <em>\n    fewer\n   </em>\n   than a fixed number of overtime hours.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Significantly, in decisions post-dating the Department of Labor's promulgation of Section 778.309, the Second and Fifth Circuits have applied\n   <em>\n    Asselta\n   </em>\n   in holding\n   unlawful payment schemes similar to the one employed by Fire &amp; Safety.

The record included evidence that when an employee worked fewer than 60 hours, the employee was compensated not by his regular hourly rate, but rather by a pro rata rate derived from dividing the fixed salary for the 60-hour workweek by the number of hours the employee worked.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For example, if an employee's rate was $ 10/hour, the weekly salary for an employee working a scheduled 60-hour workweek was $ 700 (($ 10 x 40 straight-time hours) + ($ 15 x 20 overtime hours)).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"268749\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/143/61/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"268749\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/143/61/\">\n    at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But such alleged lack of bad faith cannot excuse a violation of the FLSA. The good-faith nature of an employer's action is relevant in a court's determination of whether to award liquidated damages under the FLSA, not in determining whether it violated the FLSA in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perez v.

Fire &amp; Safety has not appealed the district court's award of liquidated damages, so any invocation of its good faith is irrelevant to our discussion. Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Asselta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   did not rely on employers' good faith-rather, they squarely rejected pay schemes analogous to the one at issue here, wherein employers pay the same rate regardless of straight and overtime hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Because the \"blended rate\" operated as the regular rate within the FLSA, the district court correctly concluded that Fire &amp; Safety did not properly compensate its Consultants for overtime. This is so despite the blended rate's apparent \"overcompensation\" of the Consultants. Fire &amp; Safety emphasizes that when the Consultants worked less than a full hitch, they received more under a blended rate than they would have otherwise received had their purported regular rates been used. However, this purported \"overcompensation\" is illusory. The Consultants were overcompensated only if we accept Fire &amp; Safety's fiction-that the blended rate did not operate as the regular rate. Because the blended rate did in fact function as the regular rate, and therefore should have been the baseline in calculating the overtime rate, it becomes plain that Consultants should have received\n   <em>\n    greater\n   </em>\n   compensation than what they received under Fire &amp; Safety's payment scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Consider again the Consultant working the 6-day, 72-hour shift described above. Because that Consultant's blended rate of $ 29.76/hour (rounded to the nearest cent) was his regular rate, for the shift in question he should have received:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   40 non-overtime hours x $ 29.76/hour = $ 1,190.48\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   32 overtime hours x $ 44.64/hour = $ 1,428.57\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   TOTAL = $ 2,619.05\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Instead, he was paid $ 2,142.86. Accordingly, for the pay period ending on January 9, 2015, that Consultant was undercompensated by $ 476.19. Such undercompensation occurred with respect to 70 Consultants in total. When employees already have received non-overtime pay for all hours worked, as is the case here, \"unpaid overtime compensation\" is due under the FLSA at 50% of the regular rate for the overtime hours worked.\n   <em>\n    Desmond v. PNGI Charles Town Gaming, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053771\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/351/#p354\">\n    630 F.3d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 354-57 (4th Cir. 2011). For instance, regarding his example 72-hour shift, that Consultant would be owed $ 14.88 (the blended rate of $ 29.76\n   multiplied by 0.5) x 32 (the number of overtime hours), equaling $ 476.19, which matches the above figure determining his undercompensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Our holding guards against creative payment schemes in which employers retroactively divide a fixed payment into non-overtime and overtime components to demonstrate supposed compliance with the FLSA. As the Department of Labor regulations emphasize, the \"Congressional purpose to effectuate a maximum hours standard by placing a penalty upon the performance of excessive overtime work\" would be \"defeated\" if an employer \"could merely label as overtime pay a fixed portion of such salary sufficient to take care of compensation for the maximum number of hours that would be worked.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.310\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Fire &amp; Safety failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, Fire &amp; Safety attempts a last-ditch effort to save its payment scheme by arguing that Consultants worked a full 168-hour hitch the majority of the time. But Fire &amp; Safety did not violate the FLSA solely on those occasions that the Consultants worked less than a full hitch. Because the \"blended rate\" actually operated as the regular rate, the Consultants are owed back wages for even those overtime hours worked during a\n   <em>\n    full\n   </em>\n   168-hour hitch. And at any rate, we reiterate that violating the FLSA on a minority of occasions does not excuse that violation.

The FLSA's recordkeeping provisions are vital in ensuring employer compliance with the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McFeeley v.

The district court concluded that Fire &amp; Safety failed to maintain appropriate records under the FLSA. For the following reasons, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Fire &amp; Safety contends that its records satisfied\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20516.2\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 516.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), which provides that with respect to employees working on fixed schedules, employers may maintain records that show the schedule of daily and weekly hours worked by the employee, instead of the hours worked each day and workweek. In weeks in which an employee adheres to the fixed schedule, the employer may indicate \"by check mark, statement or other method\" that such hours were in fact actually worked. 29 C.F.R. 516.2(c)(1). However, the regulation also provides that \"in weeks in which\n   <em>\n    more or less\n   </em>\n   than the scheduled hours are worked,\" the employer must show the \"exact number of hours worked each day and each week.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20516.2\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 516.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The record demonstrates that when Consultants did not work the \"fixed schedule\"-a full 168-hour hitch-Fire &amp; Safety did not show the exact number of hours worked each day and each week for every employee. Fire &amp; Safety provides evidence that they did so on three occasions-when three Consultants worked fewer than 168 hours, those hours were recorded. However, those examples do not show the exact number of hours worked each day in the two-week period, as required by Section 516.2(c)(2), but rather that the Consultants worked fewer hours than 168 hours. And, for the vast majority of Consultants, no hours at all were recorded when they worked less than a full hitch. Indeed, a declaration from the Department of Labor's Assistant District Director overseeing the Wage &amp; Hour Investigator in this case also indicates that Fire &amp; Safety did not have records of the hours worked by each employee during each workday. Apart from the three examples cited, Fire &amp; Safety does not seriously dispute its inadequate recordkeeping, and therefore this does not constitute a genuine dispute of material fact warranting remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Accordingly, Fire &amp; Safety's reference to the specific hours worked by employees on three isolated occasions does not demonstrate compliance with the FLSA's stringent recordkeeping requirements. Therefore, we agree with the district court and hold that Fire &amp; Safety failed to make and maintain proper records under the FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The FLSA shields employees from precisely the type of payment scheme utilized by Fire &amp; Safety-one that appears to compensate employees for both non-overtime and overtime but in reality, uses a single rate for all hours worked, regardless of whether they are non-overtime or overtime hours. Upholding such a scheme and accepting Fire &amp; Safety's retroactive justifications would undercut one of the fundamental purposes of the FLSA: ensuring that employees are adequately paid for all overtime hours. Therefore, for the foregoing\n   reasons, we affirm the district court's decision granting summary judgment to the Department of Labor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    We collectively refer to Harris and Fire &amp; Safety as \"Fire &amp; Safety.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    We describe\n    <em>\n     Asselta\n    </em>\n    with reference to only the employees working 46 hours per week, but the Supreme Court held that the same analysis applies to the watchmen working 54 hours per week.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    For ease of description, we have rounded this Consultant's blended rate to the nearest cent.

However, here, unlike\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    , undisputed facts indicate that Fire &amp; Safety's actual practice did not conform to its alleged agreement because Consultants' pay did not include overtime.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Again, for ease of illustration, we have listed this Consultant's blended rate as $ 29.76, but we, like the Department of Labor, have done this calculation using the blended rate with all its decimals.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Under the FLSA, the \"de minimis\" principle only comes into play when determining whether an employee's time worked is de minimis such that an employer need not compensate her.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Perez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3749765\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/350/#p375\">\n     650 F.3d at 375\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (concluding that roughly 10 minutes per work shift spent donning protective gear are not de minimis and employees are entitled to compensation).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    We reject the Department of Labor's position that Fire &amp; Safety waived this argument.
