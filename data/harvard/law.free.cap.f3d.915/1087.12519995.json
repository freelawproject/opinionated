BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sherman was incarcerated at the Trumbull County Jail from November 18, 2013 to April 30, 2014. During Sherman's incarceration, Drennen worked at the Trumbull County Jail as a corrections officer. Drennen was regularly assigned to patrol the pod where Sherman lived with Michele Rafferty, another female inmate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Between February 1, 2014 and Sherman's release on April 30, 2014, Drennen demanded that Sherman expose her breasts for him to view on three or four occasions. Sherman complied with Drennen's demands. On one or two occasions, Sherman masturbated in Drennen's presence \"because he asked for it.\" (Sherman Dep., R. 102 at PageID #705.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sherman does not allege that Drennen ever touched her. And Drennen never explicitly threatened Sherman. But Sherman was deeply disturbed by Drennen's demands. As a result of Drennen's abuse, Sherman's post-traumatic stress disorder\n   worsened and her night terrors and flashbacks increased in severity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sherman never reported Drennen to anyone in the Trumbull County Jail administration because she felt intimidated by him; she \"didn't know what to expect\" if she refused his demands. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID #716.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sherman and Rafferty sued Drennen and various officials from Trumbull County (together \"Defendants\"), alleging Fourth Amendment and Eighth Amendment claims against Drennen and\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims against the Trumbull County officials. Defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants on every claim except for Sherman's Eighth Amendment claim against Drennen, finding that Drennen was not entitled to qualified immunity on that claim. Drennen appealed the district court's decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Furthermore, the abuse alleged to have occurred in this case did not merely consist of words. It also entailed forced sexual acts. The fact that Drennen effectuated this sexual abuse by ordering Sherman to expose her breasts and masturbate, rather than by touching Sherman himself, does not change the fact that Sherman was repeatedly required to engage in sexual acts against her will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Drennen also argues that he did not violate the Eighth Amendment because Sherman consented to his sexual advances. This argument fails. First, as Drennen acknowledges, \"inmates are generally regarded as unable to consent to sexual relations with prison staff.\" (Def. Br. at 17.)\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wood v.

Sherman states that she only complied because Drennen \"intimidated\" her. (Sherman Dep., R. 102 at PageID #716.) At this stage, the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to Sherman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matsushita\n   </em>\n   , 475 U.S. at 587,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205783\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/574/#p587\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This Court has not determined whether deliberate indifference or the heightened malice standard is required to satisfy the subjective component of an Eighth Amendment claim alleging sexual abuse by a prison guard. But the Court need not resolve this issue at present; Sherman prevails regardless of whether malice or the less-stringent deliberate indifference standard applies. Obviously, Drennen could not conceivably offer a legitimate penological justification for his repeated demands that Sherman expose herself and masturbate against her will. Thus, a jury could conclude that Drennen acted with deliberate indifference or acted maliciously and sadistically for the purpose of causing her harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Having concluded that Sherman established her Eighth Amendment claim for the purposes of summary judgment, the Court will consider whether Sherman's Eighth Amendment rights were clearly established.
