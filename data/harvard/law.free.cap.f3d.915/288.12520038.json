We join other federal courts of appeals in holding that the Code does not preclude such claims. Accordingly, we reverse the contrary determination of the district court and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   From 2003 through 2012, Branch Banking and Trust Company (\"BB&amp;T\") loaned $2.1 million to Ollie William Faison. To effectuate the loans, Faison signed three promissory notes secured by deeds of trust for farmland that Faison owned in North Carolina. Faison agreed that if the notes were placed with an attorney for collection, he would pay \"all costs of collection, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees.\" J.A. 73, 101, 129.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 3, 2014, Faison filed a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. During the ensuing bankruptcy proceedings, BB&amp;T filed three proofs of claims-documents providing proof of a right to payment-for the outstanding principal and interest due on its promissory notes as of the date of Faison's petition. Those three claims were entitled to preferential treatment under the Code because the promissory notes underlying them were secured by collateral-namely, Faison's farmland in North Carolina.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Welzel v. Advocate Realty Invs., LLC (In re Welzel)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9455961,9398188\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/275/1308/\">\n    275 F.3d 1308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1318 (11th Cir. 2001) (en banc) (describing the provisions of the Code that give preferential treatment to secured claims). That preferential treatment meant that BB&amp;T's claims would be satisfied from the value of the farmland before any distributions were made to lower-priority unsecured claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stubbs &amp; Perdue v.

Now holder of the notes, SummitBridge began to defend the three claims in Faison's bankruptcy proceedings, incurring attorneys' fees in the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Almost two years after BB&amp;T assigned its claims to SummitBridge, Faison proposed a plan for repaying his creditors, ultimately approved by the bankruptcy court. The plan treated SummitBridge's three claims as one aggregate secured claim for $1,715,000, the value of the farmland securing the three notes. That amount was enough to cover the outstanding principal and pre-petition interest on the three notes, as well as a portion of SummitBridge's post-petition interest and attorneys' fees. To the extent that SummitBridge had incurred excess attorneys' fees not covered by the farmland's value, the plan made clear, SummitBridge could file an unsecured claim to recover those fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   SummitBridge did just that, filing the claim at issue here: an unsecured claim against Faison's estate for the remainder of the post-petition attorneys' fees it had incurred. Faison objected to SummitBridge's claim on two alternative grounds. First, Faison argued that SummitBridge's underlying contractual claim for attorneys' fees was unenforceable under North Carolina law because SummitBridge had failed to comply with state-law notice requirements. And second, Faison raised the federal-law issue we address today, arguing that \"the Bankruptcy Code does not provide for allowance of an unsecured claim for post-petition attorneys' fees or costs.\" J.A. 265.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The bankruptcy court addressed only Faison's federal-law argument, agreeing with him that the Code does not allow creditors like SummitBridge to assert unsecured claims for post-petition attorneys' fees. SummitBridge appealed the bankruptcy court's order to the district court, and the district court affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"When considering an appeal from a district court acting in its capacity as a bankruptcy appellate court,\" this court conducts \"an independent review of the bankruptcy court's decision, reviewing factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Soc.

And in the years since\n   <em>\n    Travelers\n   </em>\n   was decided, both the Second and Ninth Circuits have concluded that there is no basis in the Code for barring unsecured claims for post-petition attorneys' fees arising out of pre-petition contracts.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 146-49 ;\n   <em>\n    SNTL Corp. v.

Faison argues, and the bankruptcy and district courts agreed, that creditors are barred from asserting such claims by two provisions of the Code: \u00a7 502(b) and \u00a7 506(b). We take those provisions in turn, and like our sister circuits, conclude that neither expressly disallows a creditor like SummitBridge from asserting an unsecured claim for post-petition attorneys' fees based on a valid pre-petition contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ogle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129989,3485935\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/143/\">\n    586 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   146-49 ;\n   <em>\n    In re SNTL Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668992,4103369\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/826/\">\n    571 F.3d at 839-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We begin with \u00a7 502 of the Code, which, as its title explains, governs the \"[a]llowance of claims or interests\" in bankruptcy proceedings. When, as here, a party like Faison objects to a creditor's claim, then \u00a7 502(b) provides that \"the court, after notice and a hearing, shall determine the amount of such claim ... as of the date of the filing of the petition, and shall allow such claim in such amount\" unless one of nine enumerated exceptions applies.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Section 502(b), in other words, does not bar SummitBridge from recovering post-petition attorneys' fees, so long as two conditions are met: First, SummitBridge must have had a \"claim\" for those fees as of the petition date; and second, that claim must not fall within one or more of the nine enumerated exceptions.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Travelers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553749\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/443/\">\n    549 U.S. at 449-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553749\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/443/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that a claim within the meaning of the Code must be allowed under \u00a7 502(b) unless one of the nine enumerated exceptions applies). Faison does not dispute that none of the nine exceptions is implicated here. So the only question is whether SummitBridge had a \"claim\" under the Code for post-petition attorneys' fees as of the petition date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Faison's position is that because no attorneys' fees were incurred until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   bankruptcy proceedings began in this case, SummitBridge could not have had a valid \"claim\" for those fees on \"the date of the filing of the petition.\" We disagree. It is true that the right to payment of attorneys' fees under Faison's promissory notes was contingent on a future, post-petition event-namely, the notes being placed with an attorney for collection. But the Code defines \"claim\" broadly, and expressly includes \"right[s] to payment\" that are \"contingent.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(A) (defining \"claim\" as \"a right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   What matters is that the\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   to those fees arose pre-petition, when Faison signed the promissory notes in question. That is enough, as the Ninth Circuit has explained, to make the fees \"pre[-]petition in nature, constituting a contingent pre[-]petition obligation that bec[omes] fixed post[-]petition when the fees [are] incurred.\"\n   <em>\n    In re SNTL Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668992,4103369\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/826/\">\n    571 F.3d at 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting 5 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 553.03[1][i] (15th ed. 2007) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Faison resists this straightforward conclusion by pointing to the \u00a7 502(b) requirement that a bankruptcy court \"determine the amount of [the] claim ... as of the date of the filing of the petition,\" and allow the claim \"in such amount.\" According to Faison, because post-petition fees, by definition, have not been incurred \"as of the date of the filing of the petition,\" their \"amount\" cannot be \"determine[d]\" on that date-unless, that is, the \"amount\" is deemed to be zero. For two reasons, we again must disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, we think a fair reading of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Travelers\n   </em>\n   precludes this argument. Like the fees here, the attorneys' fees at issue in\n   <em>\n    Travelers\n   </em>\n   also were incurred post-petition, and, as a result, the amount of those fees also was uncertain as of the petition date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553749\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/443/\">\n    549 U.S. at 446-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553749\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/443/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under Faison's reading of \u00a7 502(b), that would be enough to end the\n   <em>\n    Travelers\n   </em>\n   case: Because no \"amount\" for the purported claim-other than zero-could be determined by the bankruptcy court on the date of the petition, there would be no valid \"claim\" at all. But the Supreme Court did not resolve the case on that ground. Instead, it went on to consider whether any of the nine enumerated\n   <em>\n    exceptions\n   </em>\n   to \u00a7 502(b) applied-an analysis that would be wholly unnecessary if post-petition fees could not constitute \"claims\" at all-and, finding that none did, held that claims for post-petition attorneys' fees incurred in connection with federal bankruptcy litigation are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   disallowed under \u00a7 502.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553749\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/443/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553749\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/443/\">\n    at 449-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553749\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/443/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Second Circuit has explained, in rejecting the same argument that Faison raises here,\n   <em>\n    Travelers\n   </em>\n   \"proceeds along lines that, reasonably extended, would suggest ... that section 502(b) 's requirement-that the court 'shall determine the amount of such claim ... as of the date of the filing of the petition'-does not bar recovery of post-petition attorneys' fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Ogle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129989,3485935\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/143/\">\n    586 F.3d at 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, we think Faison's argument is inconsistent with the whole of \u00a7 502. If it were the case, as Faison contends, that a \"claim\" with no value on the petition date cannot be allowed under \u00a7 502(b) -or may be allowed only in the amount of zero-then there would be no need for \u00a7 502(b)(2), an enumerated exception to \u00a7 502(b) that specifically disallows claims for \"unmatured interest.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). Nor can Faison's position be squared with \u00a7 502(c), which expressly directs bankruptcy courts to \"estimate[ ] for purpose of allowance\" the value of claims that are contingent or unliquidated, to avoid undue delay in the administration of a bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 502(c). If, as Faison would have it, the value of a \"claim\" must be fixed as of the petition date, then there would be no need for such estimates. And, indeed, Faison concedes that the bankruptcy court could have used that very provision to estimate the attorneys' fees at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In sum, like our sister circuits, we can find nothing in \u00a7 502(b) that expressly disallows unsecured claims for post-petition attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ogle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129989,3485935\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/143/\">\n    586 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   147 ;\n   <em>\n    In re SNTL Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668992,4103369\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/826/\">\n    571 F.3d at 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Faison next contends that a different provision of the Code-\u00a7 506(b)-disallows SummitBridge's unsecured claim for post-petition attorneys' fees.

But \u00a7 506(b) does refer to attorneys' fees, providing that creditors with over-secured claims-that is, creditors with collateral that exceeds the amount of their claims-may add to their secured claims both interest and reasonable attorneys' fees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   To the extent that an allowed secured claim is secured by property the value of which ... is greater than the amount of such claim, there shall be allowed to the holder of such claim, interest on such claim, and any reasonable fees, costs, or charges provided for under the agreement or State statute under which such claim arose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). That \u00a7 506(b) expressly allows creditors with over-secured claims to add attorneys' fees to their claims, Faison argues, implies that creditors\n   who are unsecured or, as here, under-secured may\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   assert such claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The first problem with Faison's position is that this kind of argument by negative inference cannot carry the day under\n   <em>\n    Travelers\n   </em>\n   .

Faison focuses on SummitBridge's status as a\n   <em>\n    secured\n   </em>\n   creditor, guaranteed recovery on its principal. It would be unfair, Faison argues, to allow SummitBridge also to assert unsecured\n   claims for attorneys' fees, because those claims would reduce the pool of assets available to wholly unsecured creditors who have yet to recover any principal, let alone fees. And that result, Faison finishes, would be inconsistent with a central purpose of the Code, which is to secure equality among similarly situated creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As a threshold matter, we agree with the courts that have considered similar policy arguments for barring claims for post-petition attorneys' fees: Because the text of the \"Bankruptcy Code itself provides the answer to this issue (by not specifically disallowing post[-]petition fees),\" we must defer to Congress's chosen policy,\n   <em>\n    In re SNTL Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668992,4103369\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/826/\">\n    571 F.3d at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and may not reach \"a contrary result based on equitable considerations,\"\n   <em>\n    In re Welzel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9455961,9398188\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/275/1308/\">\n    275 F.3d at 1318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We add only that Faison's particular argument from fairness-that only unsecured creditors, and not secured (but under-secured) creditors like SummitBridge, should be allowed to assert unsecured claims for post-petition attorneys' fees-itself has no basis in the text of the relevant Code provisions. What matters under \u00a7 502 and \u00a7 506(b) is the status of a given claim, not the status of the creditor asserting it: Under \u00a7 502, it is a \"claim\" that is allowed or disallowed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (directing that a \"claim\" shall be allowed unless subject to an enumerated exception), and under \u00a7 506(b), an \"allowed secured claim\" will include reasonable attorneys' fees under specified circumstances,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 506(b). Faison's effort to differentiate between types of creditors, in other words, brings his policy argument not one but two steps away from the statutory text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   And in any event, the equitable considerations here are not as one-sided as Faison suggests. It is true, as Faison argues, that if otherwise secured creditors recover on unsecured claims for post-petition attorneys' fees, those payments may come at the expense of unsecured creditors' ability to recover fully on their claims to principal. But a basic tenet of bankruptcy law is that secured creditors are privileged over unsecured creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Welzel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9455961,9398188\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/275/1308/\">\n    275 F.3d at 1319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And Faison's rule would flip this privilege on its head: By allowing unsecured but not under-secured creditors to assert claims for post-petition attorneys' fees, it would put \"unsecured creditors ... in a\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   protected position than a group of secured creditors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9455961,9398188\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/275/1308/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Faison's policy argument also upsets a second basic principle of federal bankruptcy law: \"that state law governs the substance of claims, Congress having generally left the determination of property rights in the assets of a bankrupt's estate to state law,\"\n   <em>\n    Travelers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553749\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/443/\">\n    549 U.S. at 450-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553749\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/443/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Allowing creditors, like SummitBridge, who have bargained specifically for attorneys' fees under state law to enforce those rights in bankruptcy is fully consistent with that principle, even if it reduces the pool of assets otherwise available. Those creditors, it is presumed, \"gave value, in the form of a contract term favorable to the debtor ... in exchange for the [attorneys' fees] provision.\"\n   <em>\n    Ogle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129989,3485935\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/143/\">\n    586 F.3d at 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). So allowing them to assert unsecured claims for those fees, far from \"providing an undeserved bonus for one creditor at the expense of others,\" simply \"effectuates the bargained-for terms of the loan contract.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129989,3485935\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/143/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). And in the end, if there is any tension between this policy of vindicating contract rights enforceable under state law and other bankruptcy principles, \"it is the province of Congress,\" not the courts, to adjust accordingly.\n   <em>\n    In re SNTL Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668992,4103369\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/826/\">\n    571 F.3d at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Indeed, even before\n    <em>\n     Travelers\n    </em>\n    , courts of appeals had begun to converge on that result.

Instead, on Faison's reading of \u00a7 506(b), it appears that pre-petition as well as post-petition attorneys' fees would be excluded from the claims of all but over-secured creditors,\n    <em>\n     see\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668992,4103369\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/826/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    -a result that Faison neither acknowledges nor defends.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The text of \u00a7 506, like its title, makes clear that the role of \u00a7 506 is limited to classifying as secured or unsecured claims that already are presumed allowed. Under \u00a7 506(a), \"[a]n\n    <em>\n     allowed\n    </em>\n    claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property in which the estate has an interest ... is a\n    <em>\n     secured\n    </em>\n    claim to the extent of the value of such creditor's interest in the estate's interest in such property\" (emphasis added). And under \u00a7 506(b), the provision addressing over-secured claims on which Faison focuses, \"[t]o the extent that an\n    <em>\n     allowed\n    </em>\n    secured claim is secured by property the value of which ... is greater than the amount of such claim,\" the secured claim includes \"reasonable fees, costs, or charges\" (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    For that reason, we do not think it is the case, as the district court suggested and Faison echoes on appeal, that allowing \"SummitBridge's unsecured claim for post-petition fees under \u00a7 502 arguably renders the language of \u00a7 506(b) superfluous.\" J.A. 409. Section 506(b) does not speak to allowability, but it does serve a significant function by setting out the circumstances under which an allowed claim for attorneys' fees may be treated as secured.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
