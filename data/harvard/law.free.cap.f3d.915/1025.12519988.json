In light of\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court granted his petition and remanded the case to this court for further consideration. We granted a COA and obtained additional briefing from both parties to consider whether the state courts' rejection of Weathers's\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   claim was reasonable in light of\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2016, this court summarized the facts of this case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   After a crime spree involving a string of burglaries, theft, one murder, and one sexual assault of an elderly man over the course of just a few months, one evening in February, 2000, Weathers entered Pierce's Ice House, a tavern in San Antonio, Texas, wielding a handgun and concealing his face with a pillowcase with eyeholes cut out. Weathers informed the patrons that he intended to rob the ice house, but he told the three black men present to remain calm because he only wanted to rob the white individuals. Weathers robbed the white patrons, then ordered a waitress at gun point to empty the cash register. While the waitress was carrying the till to Weathers, she stumbled and Weathers pointed his gun at her head. At this time, one of the bar patrons, Ted Church ... swung at and grabbed Weathers. In the ensuing struggle, Weathers shot Church twice in the head and once in the abdomen. Weathers fled with over two-hundred dollars, but he was apprehended eleven days later and confessed to this and other crimes. Church was rushed to the hospital and underwent multiple surgeries, but he\n   died weeks later from irreparable damages to his pancreas caused by the gunshot wound.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Weathers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12147319\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/659/778/\">\n    659 F.

That opinion also examines the facts underlying his contention that the state court inappropriately credited the State's medical expert while discrediting Weathers's expert.
