Following the search, plaintiff returned home from work, and according to the officers, confronted, pointed a gun at, and then shot at them. The officers returned fire and arrested plaintiff. But that is not the version of the facts we have before us in this interlocutory appeal.

We affirm in part and dismiss in part for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The events leading to this lawsuit stem from the U.S. Marshals Service's efforts to apprehend a federal fugitive through its Detroit Fugitive Apprehension Team task force. On the evening of January 3, 2014, a task force comprised of City of Detroit Police Officers Damon Kimbrough and Michael Knox and Wayne County Sheriff's Office Deputies Raymon Alam and Dave Weinman-all deputized as Special Deputy U.S. Marshals-arrived at the Detroit residence of Javier Vargas, Sr., the brother of a fugitive. The officers entered the house, found three individuals (Vargas, Sr., Javier Vargas, Jr., and Michelle Dotson), but not the fugitive. They also swept the house's basement apartment, one leased by plaintiff Eduardo Jacobs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following the search, Knox and Weinman escorted Vargas, Sr. outside, and Alam and Kimbrough remained inside with Vargas, Jr. and Dotson. While Knox and Weinman were outside the house, Jacobs arrived. He entered his basement apartment through a back entrance and did not notice the officers' presence (although they were aware of his). Jacobs found a broken mirror leaned against a stairwell door leading to the house's dining room (designed to alert Jacobs to an unauthorized entry from the house) and, in his words, a \"ransacked\" living space-\"[a]ll the doors were on the floor, all the cabinets were on the floor, all the stuff was torn up, somebody [went] through everything.\" The parties hotly contest what happened next.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff's version is straightforward. He bounded up the stairs shouting \"who the f- - - went into my house?\" As he opened the door to the dining room, he saw an unidentified black male (Kimbrough) who was \"not supposed to be there,\" and \"spun to run at the same time. ... [He] reached for [his] pistol in [his] holster and as [he] turned [he] fell down the stairs and never got a chance to get the pistol out of [his] holster.\" At no time did plaintiff \"rack\" his\n   gun to chamber a live round, or point or fire his gun,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and no one informed him that they were police or gave him a police command. Contemporaneous with turning to flee and reaching for his holster, Jacobs fell down the steps and was shot three times-in the stomach, shoulder, and leg. The entire exchange lasted only a few seconds. Jacobs retreated to his apartment, learned that it was law enforcement officers who shot him, and eventually surrendered. He received medical treatment (including the removal of one bullet), and testing later determined that bullet came from Kimbrough's handgun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The officers involved in the shooting, Kimbrough and Alam, tell a remarkably different version. As Kimbrough recalled, he was interviewing Dotson and Vargas, Jr. in the dining room when he \"heard a loud bang behind\" him-Jacobs slamming the door open from the basement. Kimbrough rose, turned around and saw that Jacobs \"had a gun pointed at [Kimbrough's] face.\" Jacobs said, \"You're the mother f- - - - - that robbed me last week.\" Kimbrough instructed Jacobs three times to put the gun down and identified himself as a Detroit Police Officer. Instead, Jacobs fired his gun, and Kimbrough returned fire and sought cover. After exchanging several shots, Jacobs eventually \"obeyed the commands from where he was in the basement to come out\" after \"a few minutes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Alam's version is similar. He heard Jacobs slam the door open, and saw Jacobs enter the dining room from the basement with his \"gun raised at an eye level,\" pointed at Kimbrough. Alam heard Kimbrough say \"police, drop the weapon,\" \"heard two shots ... being fired and, at that time, ... returned fire.\" However, Alam did not witness who fired the shots, and stated he did not see Jacobs fire a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The other two individuals in the dining room, Dotson and Vargas, Jr., offer little else. They recalled sitting in the dining room, hearing \"a big boom\" and then Jacobs asking, \"who the f- - - broke into my house.\" They heard the officers identify themselves, heard gunshots and fled for safety. Contrary to defendants' assertions, neither Dotson nor Vargas, Jr. saw Jacobs hold or fire a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   One other person, Detroit Police Sergeant Joseph Abdella, provided testimony about the shooting. Abdella interviewed Jacobs at the Detroit Detention Center after Jacobs's arrest. Abdella testified at Jacobs's preliminary hearing that Jacobs made the following unsolicited statement about pointing a gun at Officer Kimbrough:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [Jacobs] told me that he could have shot the officer that was in the house, that he had a jump on him, more or less, that he got up there and had a gun right on him. He could have shot that man, but he did not. And that he was looking for some understand[ing]-you know, that he did not pull the trigger when he had the opportunity to.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Abdella's testimony at Jacobs's subsequent criminal trial was more specific:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [H]e told me when he went in to the house, ... that his room had been broken into in the basement. He told me that he got his gun and went upstairs to confront the people that broke into his house. ... He insisted that he did not pull the trigger or fire a shot ... [H]e said he had the gun, he pointed at them and he could've pulled the trigger, ... but he did not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Jacobs unequivocally denied telling Abdella that he pointed a gun at anyone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Wayne County Prosecuting Attorney's office brought eleven criminal charges against Jacobs for his role in the shooting: four counts of assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder, in violation of M.C.L. \u00a7 750.84 ; four counts of assault with a dangerous weapon, in violation of M.C.L. \u00a7 750.82 ; two counts of resisting and obstructing, in violation of M.C.L. \u00a7 750.81d ; and one count of possessing a firearm during the commission of a felony, in violation of M.C.L. \u00a7 750.227b. Following a preliminary examination at which defendants Alan and Kimbrough testified (among others), a state district court judge found probable cause existed to arrest and charge Jacobs and bound him over to circuit court for trial. A jury subsequently acquitted Jacobs on all charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Jacobs commenced this civil rights action thereafter. The operative complaint and claims relevant to this appeal are as follows. Jacobs alleges five\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   actions against Alam, Kimbrough, and Weinman: (1) excessive force against Alam and Kimbrough; (2) fabrication of evidence against Alam, Kimbrough, and Weinman; (3) civil conspiracy against Alam, Kimbrough, and Weinman; (4) false arrest against Alam and Kimbrough; and (5) malicious prosecution against Alam and Kimbrough. The district court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motions for summary judgment, holding they were not entitled to qualified immunity for these claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It then denied defendants' motions for reconsideration. Defendants timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We turn first to a threshold issue: whether plaintiff may proceed with his\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   actions in light of recent Supreme Court guidance. Recognizing that \"the Fourth Amendment does not in so many words provide for its enforcement by an award of money damages for the consequences of its violation,\" the Supreme Court's 1971 decision in\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   held that an implied damages remedy is available to redress Fourth Amendment injuries. 403 U.S. at 389, 396,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is a \"limited, implied cause of action against federal employees for particularly egregious violations of the Fourth Amendment in an unlawful search and seizure case brought by a private citizen.\"\n   <em>\n    Left Fork Min. Co. v. Hooker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055304\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/768/#p774\">\n    775 F.3d 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 774 (6th Cir. 2014). The \"core holding of\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   ,\" the Supreme Court later instructed, is \"recognizing in limited circumstances a claim for money damages against federal officers who abuse their constitutional authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107996\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/61/#p67\">\n    534 U.S. 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 67,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107996\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/61/#p67\">\n    122 S.Ct. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107996\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/61/#p67\">\n    151 L.Ed.2d 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). \"A\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy is available only if (1) there are no alternative, existing processes for protecting a constitutional interest and, (2) even in the absence of an\n   alternative, there are no special factors counselling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Haines v.

It has even suggested that the Court's\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   jurisprudence might have developed differently, if at all, if \"decided today,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1856, and has \"made clear that expanding the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy is now a 'disfavored' judicial activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1857 (citation omitted). Indeed, the Supreme Court has done so only in two other instances, the last being nearly forty years ago.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carlson v.

Since\n   <em>\n    Carlson\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court has \"consistently refused to extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   to any new context or new category of defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 1857 (citation omitted) (listing numerous cases declining to extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   ). The Court's clear preference for not expanding such implied remedies is rooted in separation of powers, for \"most often,\" Congress \"should decide\" whether to provide a damages remedy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1857-58. As the Court stated, \"[t]he Court's precedents now make clear that a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy will not be available if there are special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1857 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We deal here not with a request by plaintiff to extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , but rather with defendants' contention that we need to reexamine our\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   jurisprudence following the Supreme Court's two most recent\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   decisions-\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   .

Because we have not yet substantively examined this intervening authority, we now take the opportunity to decide what impact, if any, they have on our circuit law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   is a post-September 11 illegal-alien detention case, wherein federal detainees brought\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   actions against Department of Justice executives and wardens at the detention facility. 137 S.Ct. at 1853-54. The detainees essentially challenged two aspects of their detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   They claimed the government's detention policies subjected them to \"harsh pretrial conditions\" in violation of the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment's substantive due process and equal protection clauses, and the wardens knowingly allowed guards to abuse them in violation of the Fifth Amendment's substantive due process clause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1853-54. Before addressing whether the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy exists for these claims, the Court took great care to emphasize the \"continued force\" and \"necessity[ ] of\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   in the search-and-seizure context in which it arose.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1856.\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   is \"settled law,\" noted the Court, \"in th[e] common and recurrent sphere of law enforcement, and the undoubted reliance upon it as a fixed principle in the law, are powerful reasons to retain it in that sphere.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1857. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   is not about restricting the core of\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   ; it continues the Supreme Court's trend of cautioning against expanding its outer reaches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For our purposes,\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   clarifies the analytical framework for how courts must approach asserted\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims. The Court defined the \"proper test for determining whether a case presents a new\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   context.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1859. We must ask whether the case is \"different in a meaningful way from previous\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cases decided by [the Supreme] Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1859. The Court provided several examples for how a case might be meaningfully different:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A case might differ in a meaningful way because of the rank of the officers involved; the constitutional right at issue; the generality or specificity of the official action; the extent of judicial guidance as to how an officer should respond to the problem or emergency to be confronted; the statutory or other legal mandate under which the officer was operating; the risk of disruptive intrusion by the Judiciary into the functioning of other branches; or the presence of potential special factors that previous\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cases did not consider.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1860. Differing in a \"meaningful way,\" in the very least, means \"an extension\" of the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy, even if just a \"modest extension.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1864. Once a court determines a new\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim is being advanced, it must then look to the special factors analysis;\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   further clarified this analysis as \"concentrat[ing] on whether the Judiciary is well suited, absent congressional action or instruction, to consider and weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1857. The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   then detailed why the context of plaintiffs' claims were \"new\" and presented factors different from the Court's prior\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The detention policy claims \"challenge[d] the confinement conditions imposed on illegal aliens pursuant to a high-level executive policy created in the wake of a major terrorist attack on American soil.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1860. These claims, reasoned the Court, bore \"little resemblance\" to its prior cases, and thus differed in a meaningful way. Moreover, the policy claims implicated several special factors that dictated Congress provide a remedy. These factors included: (1) the claims were against high-level individuals seeking changes to executive-branch policies; (2) the claims \"challenge[d] more than standard 'law enforcement operations,' \" and instead raised a host of inquiries regarding national security policy-\"the prerogative of Congress and the President\"; and (3) the plaintiffs did not \"challenge individual instances of ... law enforcement overreach, which due to [its] very nature [is] difficult to address except by way of damages actions after the fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1861-62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As for the prisoner-abuse claim, the Court concluded it, too, represented a \"modest\" extension of\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1864. It did so even in light of the Court's\n   <em>\n    Carlson\n   </em>\n   decision, which authorized a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim for mistreating prisoners by failing to provide medical care under the Eighth Amendment. The Court distinguished\n   <em>\n    Carlson\n   </em>\n   , noting that the constitutional right in\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   was predicated upon a different amendment (Fifth) and that judicial guidance for the warden \"with respect to his supervisory duties, was less developed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, two other considerations weighed against plaintiffs: the availability of an alternative remedy (a writ of habeas corpus, for example), and Congress's choice \"not to extend the\n   <em>\n    Carlson\n   </em>\n   damages remedy to cases involving other types of prisoner mistreatment\" when it passed the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1865. The Court then remanded the case for consideration of whether the \"special factors\" warranted extending\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   to plaintiffs' prisoner abuse claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Supreme Court issued its\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   decision a week after\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   involved a cross-border shooting, in which a border patrol agent shot and killed a Mexican teenager standing in Mexico. 137 S.Ct. at 2005.
