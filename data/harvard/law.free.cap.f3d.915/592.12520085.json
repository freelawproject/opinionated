Shane Horton was arrested for slashing an acquaintance's car tire and taken to the local police department, where he was detained in a temporary holding cell. Left unattended for around half an hour while the officer in charge spoke to his mother and completed paperwork, Horton removed his belt, fed it through the cell door bars, and hanged himself, causing permanent and severe brain damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   With his mother acting as guardian ad litem, Horton brought suit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and California law. He contends that the City of Santa Maria, the Santa Maria Police Department, and several individual officers violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to be safeguarded from injury and his state law right to medical care while in custody. We reverse the district court's denial of qualified immunity on the \u00a7 1983 claims as to Officer Andrew Brice, conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of summary judgment on the \u00a7 1983 claims as to the municipal defendants, and affirm the district court's denial of summary judgment on the state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In the months leading up to his arrest, eighteen-year-old Horton had given his mother reason to be concerned. He used drugs, including marijuana, \"Molly\" (a pure form of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine), and phencyclidine (PCP), and contemplated suicide. On December 13, 2012, he took PCP and \"started freaking out.\" He extinguished cigarettes on his own face and hands, punched his fist through a window, tried to cut his wrist with a piece of broken glass, held a kitchen knife pointed at his throat, and, his mother understood, threatened to kill himself. That night, he was admitted to the emergency room, where he was initially held as a suicide risk. But he specifically denied to hospital staff any suicidal ideation, and the doctors came to suspect \"that [his problem] was mostly drugs.\" Horton was discharged the morning of December 14, 2012, after an emergency room physician and a member of the county's Crisis and Recovery Emergency Services (\"CARES\") team agreed that he was not suicidal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Approximately two weeks later, on the morning of December 29, 2012, Horton and his girlfriend became involved in a physical altercation. As his girlfriend was driving away with a friend, Horton pulled out a folding knife and slashed the tire of the friend's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Officers Andrew Brice and Duane Schneider soon arrived on the scene and found Horton. Horton admitted to slashing the tire, pointed the police to the knife, and remained calm and cooperative as the officers arrested him for misdemeanor vandalism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Officer Brice stayed to interview Horton's girlfriend. She disclosed that Horton had hit her several times in the past, chased her with a knife, and stabbed a friend in the leg. She also revealed that he had made comments about killing police and sympathizing with the suspects in recent mass homicides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While Officer Brice was speaking to Horton's girlfriend, Officer Schneider transported Horton to the police station, where he patted Horton down, confiscated his wallet and iPod, and placed him in a temporary holding cell. Officer Schneider did not remove Horton's jewelry or belt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As Officer Schneider prepared to leave, Horton said he was feeling anxious and \"would really like to speak to someone\" - \"not a therapist. Even you.\" As they talked, Horton explained to Officer Schneider that it had been \"a really, really, really rough three weeks straight.\" He described his recent drug use and the window-breaking incident, and said that he \"had the shit beat out of me fucking thousands of times.\" At one point, Officer Schneider asked if he had any medical problems; Horton responded, \"No, sir. Not that I know of. I'm real healthy as I'm aware. I'm just - besides feeling anxious right now and I hate being locked in a box .... I don't like being in a cell.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Eventually, Officer Schneider left, stating that he would \"[p]robably do a psych or something.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He instructed Horton to wave at the security camera if he needed anything. A few minutes later, another police officer asked Horton if he had any medical problems; Horton again said he did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Approximately an hour and a half later, Officer Brice returned to the police station. Officer Brice spoke to Horton privately in an interview room, explaining that Horton's girlfriend and her friend both said that Horton slapped the girlfriend, and reporting that she had a mark on her consistent with that allegation. Officer Brice said that Horton's girlfriend had been granted a restraining order against him for one week, that he would be charged with felony domestic violence, and that he had the option to post bail. At one point during the conversation, Officer Brice asked Horton if he had any medical conditions, and Horton once again replied, \"No, sir.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the end of the interview, Officer Brice brought Horton back to the holding cell and gave him the opportunity to call his mother, Yvonne Horton.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Horton told his mother, \"I'm in jail right now. I'm going to get booked and go to [the main county jail in] Goleta. You can choose to be there, get me out on bail or not. ... I would appreciate it [if you came to get me out on bail], but it is up to you.\" Yvonne apparently said she would not bail him out, and he ended the conversation by saying, \"It's okay, Mom. I'm sorry .... All right. I love you.\" Before hanging up, Yvonne requested to speak privately to Officer Brice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Officer Brice left Horton in the cell and, out of Horton's earshot, called Yvonne back. Officer Brice spoke with Yvonne for ten to fifteen minutes, during which time, she stated in her deposition, she relayed \"everything\" about the December 13, 2012 incident - Horton's use of drugs, the cigarette marks on his face and hands, the knife he held to his throat, his hospitalization with an initial \"5150\" hold for risk of suicide,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the CARES official's conclusion that he could be discharged because his conduct was due to drugs not suicidal ideation, and her disagreement with that conclusion. Yvonne testified that she also told Officer Brice that her son was depressed and suicidal, that she was really worried about him, and that she believed he could be helped in the judicial system. And she recounted that she instructed Officer Brice\n   to \"please, watch him, please look after him, please.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Officer Brice explained to Yvonne that he was getting ready to transport Horton to jail, which Yvonne understood to mean that they would be transporting him \"very shortly.\" In response to Yvonne's pleas to look after her son, Officer Brice reassured her that \"[h]e's safe here.\" When asked at deposition whether she ever told the police officer he had to go check on Horton immediately, she said, \"I didn't think that I would have to do that. ... I was under the impression, after I spoke to [him] in that way, that he would go back and check on him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Instead of going immediately back to the cell, Officer Brice first went to complete the paperwork necessary to transport Horton to jail and prepare the transport van. When Officer Brice went to get Horton, approximately 27 minutes after leaving him,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Brice discovered Horton hanging from the cell door, not moving. Officer Brice immediately called for assistance, administered CPR, and waited for the paramedics to arrive to transport him to the hospital. Horton survived the suicide attempt but suffered prolonged anoxia,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   resulting in severe and permanent brain damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   With his mother acting as guardian ad litem, Horton filed suit in October 2014 against the City of Santa Maria, the Santa Maria Police Department, Officer Brice, Officer Schneider, and other officers, claiming (1) negligence and (2) \u00a7 1983 liability on the part of the individual officer defendants, (3) liability on the part of the municipal defendants,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monell v.

As to Officer Brice, the district court held that there is a genuine issue of fact regarding whether Officer Brice acted with deliberate indifference to Horton's safety after speaking with his mother, and denied him qualified immunity. The court also denied summary judgment to the municipal defendants on Horton's \u00a7 1983 claim that those defendants failed to develop and adhere to a written policy regarding\n   suicide detection and prevention; failed to develop and adhere to written policies regarding the identification and evaluation of mentally disordered detainees; and failed adequately to train their officers on such policies. Finally, the district court denied summary judgment to Officer Brice and the municipal defendants on the claim under California Government Code \u00a7 845.6, but granted summary judgment on that claim to the other individual officers. Officer Brice and the municipal defendants timely appealed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.

Section 1983 Claim Against Officer Brice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The district court concluded that there is a genuine issue of fact regarding whether Officer Brice acted with deliberate indifference to Horton's safety after speaking with his mother, and denied the officer qualified immunity.

Officer Brice's interactions with Horton began with his initial arrest, during which Horton remained cooperative. Officer Brice also spoke with Horton's girlfriend, who informed him of Horton's previous violent episodes, but did not indicate any present suicidal intentions. At the jail, Officer Brice asked Horton if he was having any medical problems, to which Horton responded in the negative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Officer Brice did know that Horton, according to his mother, had been suicidal two weeks before the incident and that his mother thought he remained a suicide risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Based on these facts, which are taken in the light most favorable to Horton, a reasonable officer would not have known that failing to attend to Horton immediately would be unlawful under the law at the time of the incident. Horton did not attempt suicide in the presence of Officer Brice, as the detainee did in\n   <em>\n    Conn,\n   </em>\n   591 F.3d at 1102. Nor, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Clouthier\n   </em>\n   , had he attempted suicide multiple times and been deemed such a risk that medical specialists placed significant suicide prevention measures in place, measures removed by the defendant. 591 F.3d at 1245. In short, whether or not Officer Brice was in fact deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk that Horton would attempt suicide in the time before he was checked, there was no case law at the time of the incident clearly establishing that a reasonable officer should have perceived the substantial risk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In short, applying\n   <em>\n    Estate of Ford\n   </em>\n   , the case law at the time of Horton's attempted suicide was simply too sparse, and involved circumstances too distinct from those in\n   this case, to establish that a reasonable officer would perceive a substantial risk that Horton would imminently attempt suicide.

The department's policy manual indicated that arresting or booking officers \"should\" remove jackets, belts, and shoes. But, according to Officer Schneider, the \"should\" was understood to be optional\n   and, before December 29, 2012, when the incident occurred, the usual practice was not to remove belts. An independent audit of the Santa Maria Police Department, conducted shortly before the incident for unrelated reasons, confirmed that \"many SMPD members had only a passing knowledge of Department policies,\" and that custody practices were \"loose.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Second, a reasonable jury might find that the Police Department failed to assure proper monitoring of its security cameras.

I address each element in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Section 845.6 creates liability only for the failure to summon medical care rather than for all omissions by a public employee that cause injury to a person in his custody. Consider, for instance, a Sheriff's deputy who is tasked with assembling a new bunk bed in a cell at a county jail and does so negligently by failing to read the instructions and not using all provided parts. If the bed later collapses and consequently breaks its occupant's leg, \u00a7 845.6 would not expose the deputy to liability for that injury. The deputy might be liable under some other law, but not for violating \u00a7 845.6. Conversely, if a different deputy on duty witnessed the accident and took no action despite the prisoner's complaints of pain to his leg, this second deputy would likely be liable; he would not be immune from suit for any additional injury caused by the delay in summoning medical care to treat the leg.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jett v. Penner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"31322\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/439/1091/#p1099\">\n    439 F.3d 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1099 (9th Cir. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   A claim premised on suicidal ideation creates a particularly difficult question as to what types of omissions would constitute a failure to summon medical care. Even if an officer had knowledge that there was an imminent risk that the prisoner would make an attempt on his own life, it would be difficult to say that a failure to remove that prisoner's bedsheets and shoelaces would fall within this statute's ambit because it is not natural to describe the removal of such items as summoning medical care. The failure to remove them might violate some other provision of California law, but the omission is not an obvious violation of \u00a7 845.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Here, our analysis is complicated by the fact that Horton's complaint consists of a single conclusory allegation regarding what omissions purportedly violated \u00a7 845.6 : \"Defendants ... knew, or had reason to know, that Shane Horton was in need of immediate medical care, supervision and safeguarding and that he was suicidal and at risk of injuring himself, but failed to take reasonable action to summon such medical care ....\" Horton adds little clarity on appeal, merely highlighting the\n   fact that he was \"already slumped on the floor motionless when Officer Brice finished\" the call as evidence that he \"was in immediate need of medical attention.\" But the fact that Horton needed to be resuscitated once he had already hanged himself says nothing about what actions Officer Brice should have taken\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   he returned to Horton's cell and discovered the suicide attempt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, Horton's argument is circular; he implies that, because he was in need of medical care once he had hanged himself,\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   omission by Officer Brice constituted a failure to summon medical care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Ultimately, it is evident that Horton's state-law claim, like his \u00a7 1983 claim, is premised on his contention that \"the information communicated by ... Horton's mother\n   <em>\n    should have prompted [Officer Brice] to check on Horton promptly\n   </em>\n   and discover the need for immediate medical care.\" As addressed below, I do not believe Horton has provided any evidence that Officer Brice knew or should have known that Horton was in\n   <em>\n    immediate\n   </em>\n   danger of harming himself. But even assuming that this knowledge component is satisfied, the majority opinion does not address how Officer Brice's failure to check on Horton immediately after the phone call constitutes a failure to\n   <em>\n    summon medical care\n   </em>\n   . The majority has not explained why this statute even applies in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The California Court of Appeal emphasized this precise deficiency in\n   <em>\n    Lucas v. City of Long Beach\n   </em>\n   , where the decedent hanged himself in his cell after being arrested on a charge of being drunk and disorderly:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Plaintiff, [the decedent's mother] ... , offered\n   <em>\n    no evidence as to what kind of medical care she claims should have been provided\n   </em>\n   and more importantly she offered no evidence as to how such medical care could have prevented the death. [The decedent] was not in fact in need of immediate medical care and clearly lack of medical care did not \"cause\" the death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    True the continuous presence in the cell of a doctor, a nurse, or, for that matter, a\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    policeman probably would have prevented the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    suicide\n   </em>\n   . The jury apparently reasoned along these lines. Government Code section 845.6, however, in affixing liability for failure to summon \"immediate medical care\" for a person in need thereof envisions liability for injury resulting from the failure to treat the physical condition requiring treatment and\n   <em>\n    not for some other incidental injury\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    that might have been prevented by the mere presence of medical personnel\n   </em>\n   . The jury's findings that it was negligence not to provide medical treatment and that that failure was the \"cause\" of death are not supported by any evidence to be found in the record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4514955\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/60/341/\">\n    60 Cal.App.3d 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20470\">\n    131 Cal.Rptr. 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 475 (1976) (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    Lucas\n   </em>\n   thus demonstrates that, as discussed above, not all forms of omission give rise to liability under \u00a7 845.6. Although Officer Brice's presence in Horton's cell immediately after the call may have prevented Horton from suffering the degree of brain damage that he did, any failure to check on Horton sooner falls outside the statute's narrow exception to immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Rather than confronting this dispositive flaw in Horton's state-law claim,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the majority summarily asserts that the claim is \"not ... limited\" to \"Officer Brice's\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   failure to return immediately to Horton's cell ....\" Maj. Op. 607. Tellingly, the majority supports this conclusion by citing only to Horton's complaint, which, as seen above, does not allege a single specific action that Officer Brice failed to take.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . This is unsurprising. Nothing in Horton's briefing or the record indicates that his claim, as to Officer Brice, is premised on anything other than the officer not immediately checking on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Undeterred, the majority supplements Horton's claim for him, concluding that Officer Brice could have ordered a psychiatric evaluation for Horton-as Officer\n   <em>\n    Schneider\n   </em>\n   suggested earlier that day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . I have two objections. First, Horton has never contended that such an evaluation is the type of medical care that Officer Brice should have summoned after the call with his mother. It is improper for the majority to deny Officer Brice state-law immunity based on an argument that it manufactured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greenwood v. FAA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526741\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/28/971/#p977\">\n    28 F.3d 971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 977 (9th Cir. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   But second, even if properly before us, this new argument does not cure this claim. The majority's assertion that Officer Brice should have ordered a psychiatric evaluation is a circuitous attempt to argue that the officer or third-party medical personnel failed to furnish medical care and, in the process, could have more quickly discovered the suicide attempt. California cases have repeatedly rejected such claims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    Lucas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20470\">\n    131 Cal.Rptr. at 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[S]ection 845.6 ..., in affixing liability for failure to summon 'immediate medical care' for a person in need thereof envisions liability for injury resulting from the failure to treat the physical condition requiring treatment and not for some other incidental injury that might have been prevented by the mere presence of medical personnel.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Castaneda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20648\">\n    151 Cal.Rptr.3d at 663-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing \"[t]he distinction between failure to summon medical care-for which the State can be held liable under section 845.6-on the one hand, and negligence in providing care-for which the State is immune-on the other hand\");\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 664 n.10, 666 (repeating the point);\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=188%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20479\">\n    188 Cal.Rptr. at 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Failure of a practitioner to prescribe or provide necessary medication or treatment\n   ... is ... medical malpractice ... [but] cannot be characterized as a failure to summon medical care.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Moreover, the medical care that the majority insists upon would not have addressed Horton's medical needs-he had already hanged himself by the time that the call ended. There is also no evidence that ordering a psychiatric evaluation would have resulted in Officer Brice more quickly checking on Horton. Officer Brice could have ordered an evaluation-a paperwork or telephone request-without checking on Horton. It is likely that doing so would have required the officer to spend additional time on administrative tasks outside of Horton's presence, only further delaying his return to the cell. Accordingly, Horton has failed to show that any purported omission by Officer Brice falls within the scope of \u00a7 845.6 liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   By disregarding the statute's medical-care element, the majority opinion undermines California's intent to immunize its employees and to allow suit only when an employee has actual or constructive knowledge of an immediate medical need. The opinion has converted \u00a7 845.6 into a general negligence provision, ignoring \"[t]he limited nature of the duty to summon under section 845.6.\"\n   <em>\n    Castaneda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20648\">\n    151 Cal.Rptr.3d at 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Even if Horton could establish that any omission constituted a failure to summon medical care, he has separately failed to provide evidence that Officer Brice knew or should have known that there was an\n   <em>\n    immediate\n   </em>\n   danger that he would harm himself. In concluding that Horton has raised a triable issue, the opinion cites to\n   <em>\n    Zeilman v.

But even when the evidence here is taken in the light most favorable to Horton, I would hold that no reasonable jury could find that Officer Brice should have known that there was an\n   <em>\n    immediate\n   </em>\n   risk that Horton would harm himself and that the officer therefore needed to take immediate action. A person can suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts for years without ever harming himself. Indeed, the incident that Horton's mother described to Officer Brice occurred two weeks prior to the arrest, and she provided no evidence that Horton had made any attempts or threats on his life in the intervening period. Seeking\n   \"help[ ] in the judicial system\" is not close to a call for immediate assistance for someone who recently exhibited suicidal ideation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   This is not a case where Horton's parents had imposed an informal 24/7 suicide watch on him. His father had kicked him out of the house after the glass-breaking incident, so it appears Horton was living independently, without supervision for the two weeks preceding his arrest. Moreover, his mother did not rush down to the police station once she heard that her son had been arrested; rather, she had just told Horton that she would not bail him out. Horton's mother was certainly concerned about his well-being, but she never claims to have expressed to Officer Brice that Horton would likely make an attempt on his life if the officer did not take immediate action to ensure Horton was unable to do so-e.g., by removing his belt, moving him to a secured, padded cell, and monitoring him constantly. It would certainly have been prudent of Officer Brice to pass along the information Horton's mother claims to have given him to the officials at the county jail once Horton was transferred, but that falls far short of failing to recognize Horton's immediate need for medical care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Moreover, Horton's mother testified that she spoke to Officer Brice for ten to fifteen minutes-a substantial amount of time. Had she thought her son was in\n   <em>\n    immediate\n   </em>\n   danger of harming himself, she would have told Officer Brice to drop the phone and rush to Horton's cell. Indeed, if anything, the officer's patient call with Horton's mother would have reinforced that Horton needed a psychiatric evaluation-which was likely obtainable at the county jail rather than at the police station where Horton was being temporarily held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The majority does not address this absence of evidence. Nor does it attempt to reconcile its conclusion that Officer Brice, for the purpose of the state-law claim, should have known that Horton posed an immediate suicide risk with our holding regarding his \u00a7 1983 claim: \"Based on these facts, ... a reasonable officer would not have known that failing to attend to Horton immediately would be unlawful.\" Maj. Op. 601.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The majority instead summarily cites\n   <em>\n    Jett\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that the \"immediacy standard\" under \u00a7 845.6 is more \"relaxed\" than under \u00a7 1983 deliberate-indifference claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Maj. Op. 608. But this conclusion misconstrues\n   <em>\n    Jett\n   </em>\n   . There, the emergency-room doctor instructed the prisoner-plaintiff to follow-up with an orthopedic doctor \"early this week\" after he fractured his thumb.\n   <em>\n    Jett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"31322\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/439/1091/#p1099\">\n    439 F.3d at 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff saw a prison doctor three days later, but his hand was too swollen to be placed in a permanent cast.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Despite reports of pain and numerous requests to visit an orthopedist, it took an additional two months for the plaintiff to be seen even by another prison doctor.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . After four additional months, the plaintiff finally visited an orthopedic specialist, \"who determined [the plaintiff] should be referred to a hand specialist because the fracture had healed improperly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1095. The evidence demonstrated that the delay in seeing an orthopedist prevented the fracture from correctly aligning.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1098.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   We reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment on the plaintiff's deliberate-indifference claims, concluding that there was evidence that several prison officials\n   knew of but ignored the plaintiff's need to set his fracture.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In regard to his \u00a7 845.6 claim, we held that there was \"a triable issue of fact ... as to whether [the plaintiff] received immediate medical care for his diagnosed fractured thumb because the fracture was not set and placed in a cast.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1099. We reasoned that \"the need for 'immediate medical care' can arise more than once in relation to an\n   <em>\n    ongoing\n   </em>\n   serious medical condition\" and that this need \"arose as soon as [the plaintiff's] swelling subsided and his fracture could be reduced and a cast applied.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Jett\n   </em>\n   provides no insight into how immediate a medical need must be under \u00a7 845.6. The plaintiff's medical condition was ongoing and his need for care resurfaced as soon as his reduced swelling made the original prescribed treatment possible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the key point in\n   <em>\n    Jett\n   </em>\n   regarding both \u00a7 845.6 and deliberate indifference is that there was evidence that prison officials had actual knowledge that the plaintiff had a\n   <em>\n    time-sensitive\n   </em>\n   medical need and took no action for many months. The case does not support the majority's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In my view, Horton's claim fails because he has not provided evidence that Officer Brice should have known that Horton posed such a degree of suicide risk that the officer should have immediately rushed to his cell instead of spending twelve to seventeen minutes arranging to transfer Horton and another detainee to county jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   I sympathize deeply with Horton and his mother, but there is no basis under California law for subjecting Officer Brice to suit. Considered in the light most favorable to Horton, the events earlier that day and the phone call with his mother did not imbue Officer Brice with the actual or constructive knowledge that Horton would attempt suicide at any moment. And although it may have been prudent for Officer Brice to immediately check on Horton, his decision not to do so is not a failure to summon medical care. For these two independent reasons, I would reverse the district court's denial of summary judgment to Officer Brice on Horton's \u00a7 845.6 claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   I respectfully dissent as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Officer Schneider presumably meant that he was considering ordering a psychiatric evaluation of Horton.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    We use \"Yvonne\" in this opinion to distinguish the mother from her son.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    California Welfare and Institutions Code \u00a7 5150 authorizes qualified officers or clinicians to involuntarily take into custody a person who, \"as a result of a mental health disorder, is a danger to others, or to himself or herself, or gravely disabled.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205150\">\n     Cal.
