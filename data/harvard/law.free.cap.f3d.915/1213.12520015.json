The \"\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   claims\" alleged that DHS exceeded its statutory authority in working on the border barrier projects and issuing the related waivers, thus violating the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   .

The district court concluded that IIRIRA's jurisdictional bar,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 102(c)(2)(A), prevented it from hearing the non-constitutional claims. The district court went on to reject the constitutional claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   California, CBD, and the Coalition each appealed the district court's judgments as to the\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   and environmental claims, but not their constitutional claims.

JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The threshold question is whether we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal. The\n   answer depends on the scope of IIRIRA's jurisdictional bar and direct review provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We begin with the language of the statute, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear all causes or claims\n   <em>\n    arising from any action undertaken, or any decision made, by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to paragraph (1)\n   </em>\n   . A cause of action or claim may only be brought alleging a violation of the Constitution of the United States. The court shall not have jurisdiction to hear any claim not specified in this subparagraph.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00a7 102(c)(2)(A) (emphasis added). Paragraph (1), IIRIRA's waiver provision, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall have the authority to waive all legal requirements such Secretary, in such Secretary's sole discretion, determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this section. Any such decision by the Secretary shall be effective upon being published in the Federal Register.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00a7 102(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Section 102(c)(2)(C) provides for direct review of the district court's decision by the Supreme Court: \"An interlocutory or final judgment, decree, or order of the district court may be reviewed only upon petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The statutory directive is clear:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 IIRIRA vests district courts with exclusive jurisdiction to hear claims \"arising from\" actions undertaken or decisions made \"pursuant to\" the waiver provision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 This exclusive jurisdiction over claims \"arising from\" the waiver provision is limited to constitutional violations; there is no judicial review of non-constitutional claims \"arising from\" the waiver provision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 The direct review provision applies only to those claims subject to the district courts' exclusive jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The jurisdictional bar and direct review provisions cover only claims \"arising from\" paragraph (1)'s waiver provision. Interpreting their scope requires determining when a claim \"aris[es] from\" the waiver provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A claim does not \"aris[e] from\" the waiver provision simply because it is\n   <em>\n    related to\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    concerned with\n   </em>\n   the Secretary's waiver determinations. The language used in section 102(c)(2)(A) requires more. The Ninth Circuit has noted that a related phrase, \"arising out of,\" is \"ordinarily understood to mean 'originating from,' 'having its origin in,' 'growing out of' or 'flowing from' or in short, 'incident to, or having connection with.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Tristar Esperanza Props., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053090,4162340\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/492/\">\n    782 F.3d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 497 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Underwriters at Lloyd's of London v. Cordova Airlines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2009231\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/283/659/#p664\">\n    283 F.2d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 664 (9th Cir. 1960) ). Accordingly, a claim \"aris[es] from\" an \"action undertaken\" or \"decision made[ ] by the Secretary ... pursuant to\" the waiver provision only when the claim originates or stems from a section 102(c)(1) waiver determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether the jurisdictional bar applies to California and the environmental groups' claims requires us to assess whether each\n   claim \"aris[es] from\" the Secretary's waiver determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   One set of\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   claims alleges that the border barrier projects are not authorized by the grant of barrier- and road-building authority in sections 102(a) and 102(b). They challenge the scope of the Secretary's authority to build roads and walls under sections 102(a) and 102(b), not the scope of waiver authority under section 102(c). These claims thus \"aris[e] from\" sections 102(a) and 102(b), not section 102(c). Their origin is the initial decision to build the border barrier projects, not the later decision to issue a waiver related to those projects. In the absence of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   relationship between these claims and the waiver provision, there is no plausible interpretation of \"aris[es] from\" that brings these claims under the jurisdictional bar. On the other hand, a second set of\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   claims alleges the waivers themselves were not authorized by the Secretary's authority under section 102(c)(1).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Second Am. Compl. at 34-38,\n   <em>\n    In re:\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Border Infrastructure Envtl. Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG (S.D. Cal. Sept. 6, 2017). These claims do \"arise from\" the Secretary's waiver determination, so the district court correctly found that the jurisdictional bar applies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The environmental claims allege the planning and construction of the border barrier projects violated various environmental laws. To the extent these claims challenge either the merits of the waivers themselves, or the Secretary's authority to issue the waivers under section 102(c), they are subject to the jurisdictional bar. But, the analysis is different for the environmental claims that \"aris[e] from\" alleged violations of NEPA, CZMA, and the APA during the planning and construction of the border barrier projects. At least some of the environmental claims clearly fall into this latter category. For example, CBD raised NEPA and APA claims\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the Secretary published the San Diego or Calexico Waivers, meaning the waivers could not possibly have been the source of these claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Am. Compl. at 3-4, 23-32,\n   <em>\n    In re:\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Border Infrastructure Envtl. Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG (S.D. Cal. July 7, 2017). To be sure, a valid waiver of the relevant environmental laws under section 102(c) is an affirmative defense to all the environmental claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the fact that the waivers may be dispositive of the environmental claims does not make a waiver the origin of those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The black letter law of federal question jurisdiction illustrates why any other outcome would be at odds with well-accepted principles. Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , district courts have jurisdiction over all cases \"arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\" A case does not \"aris[e] under the\n   Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States\" just because a defendant invokes a federal defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. v.

For the same reason, the environmental claims do not \"aris[e] from\" the Secretary's waiver determinations merely because those waivers could provide the Secretary with a viable defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, the constitutional claims, which allege that the waiver determinations themselves violate the U.S. Constitution, do \"aris[e] from\" the waiver determinations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. at 23,\n   <em>\n    Defs. of Wildlife v.

Because these claims grow out of the waiver determinations, IIRIRA's jurisdictional bar applies. The district court had exclusive jurisdiction to hear those claims, and any appeal must be direct to the Supreme Court pursuant to section 102(c)(2)(C). It is no surprise that California and the environmental groups did not appeal the constitutional claims to the Ninth Circuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The jurisdictional bar and direct review provisions have no bearing on the\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   and environmental claims that do not \"aris[e] from\" the waiver determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court had jurisdiction to review these federal claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This is ample evidence of \"high illegal entry\" in these areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   California and the environmental groups nonetheless contend the San Diego and Calexico Projects are not authorized by section 102(a) because they are not \"in areas of high illegal entry into the United States.\" They do not dispute the evidence of \"illegal entry\" provided by DHS. Nor do they dispute that the number of undocumented immigrants apprehended and the amount of illegal narcotics seized are objectively \"high.\" Instead, they assert that the San Diego and El Centro statistics are not\n   <em>\n    comparably\n   </em>\n   \"high\" when measured against other sectors on the southwest border or the rates of illegal entry in these sectors in the past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   However, IIRIRA does not dictate that \"high illegal entry\" is a comparative determination. Absent qualification, \"high illegal entry\" means what it says. The fact that there are areas with \"high\n   <em>\n    er\n   </em>\n   illegal entry\" says nothing about whether the San Diego and El Centro sectors are \"areas of high illegal entry.\" Even assuming that \"areas of high illegal entry\" are identified relative to other border sectors, San Diego and El Centro are in the top 35% of border sectors with respect to the number of undocumented immigrants apprehended. Finally, to the extent the challenge targets the Secretary's discretion in selecting where to exercise her authority under section 102(a), such an inquiry is foreclosed by IIRIRA's bar on probing the merits of a waiver determination, \u00a7 102(c)(2), and the APA's bar on reviewing discretionary agency action,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Section 102(b) does not impose limits on Section 102(a)'s broad grant of authority.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Having determined that section 102(a)'s grant of authority encompasses the border barrier projects, we next consider whether section 102(b) imposes limits on that broad grant of authority. Section 102(b) provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (1) Additional fencing along southwest border.-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (A) Reinforced fencing.-In carrying out subsection (a), the Secretary of Homeland Security shall construct reinforced fencing along not less than 700 miles of the southwest border where fencing would be most practical and effective and provide for the installation of additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors to gain operational control of the southwest border.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (B) Priority areas.-In carrying out this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (i) identify the 370 miles, or other mileage determined by the Secretary, whose authority to determine other mileage shall expire on December 31, 2008, along the southwest border where fencing would be most practical and effective in deterring\n   smugglers and aliens attempting to gain illegal entry into the United States; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (ii) not later than December 31, 2008, complete construction of reinforced fencing along the miles identified under clause (i).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The question is whether the fencing requirements and deadlines in section 102(b) establish limits applicable to section 102(a). They do not. Section 102(b)'s provisions for priority projects do not swallow section 102(a)'s independent authorization to build \"additional physical barriers.\" Congress's alternative use of the phrases \"[i]n carrying out subsection (a)\" and \"this section\" indicates that section 102(b) applies to some but not all of the construction authorized by section 102(a). In other words, section 102(a) is most plausibly read as a broad grant of authority to build border infrastructure, while section 102(b) merely denotes certain priority projects Congress intended DHS to complete first. Limits on the priority projects apply to those projects alone, not the wider universe of construction authorized by section 102(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The \"general/specific canon\" of statutory construction does not require a different interpretation. That canon provides that when two conflicting provisions cannot be reconciled, the more specific provision should be treated as an exception to the general rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Gardner, Reading Law 183 (2012). Herein lies the rub. Sections 102(a) and 102(b) do not conflict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marx v. Gen.

If section 102(b) defines the entire scope of DHS's authority to build border infrastructure projects under section 102, section 102(a) would lack any independent effect. \"[W]e are hesitant to adopt an interpretation of a congressional enactment which renders superfluous another portion of that same law.\"\n   <em>\n    Mackey v.

Accordingly, I would dismiss these appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As noted by my colleagues, we begin with the language of the statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (c) Waiver.-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (1) In general.-Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall have the authority to waive all legal requirements such Secretary, in such Secretary's sole discretion, determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this section. Any such decision by the Secretary shall be effective upon being published in the Federal Register.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (2) Federal court review.-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   (A) In general.-The district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear all causes or claims arising from any action undertaken, or any decision made, by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to paragraph (1). A cause of action or claim may only be brought alleging a violation of the Constitution of the United States. The court shall not have jurisdiction to hear any claim not specified in this subparagraph.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (B) Time for filing of complaint. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (C) Ability to seek appellate review.-An interlocutory or final judgment, decree, or order of the district court may be reviewed only upon petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   IIRIRA \u00a7 102(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Section 102(c)(2)(A) first provides that district courts \"shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear all causes or claims arising from any action undertaken, or any decision made, by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to paragraph (1),\" and then states \"[a] cause of action or claim may only be brought alleging a violation of the Constitution of the United States.\" My colleagues do not think that the second clause modifies the district court's jurisdiction. Rather, the majority holds that the district court has jurisdiction to consider not just plaintiffs' constitutional claims, but also their\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   I have questions as to the majority's interpretation of the statute, but recognize that the presumption that Congress does not intend to deny all judicial review arguably\n   provides a basis for the district court considering the plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leedom v.

Section 102(c)(2)(C)'s direction is clear and unequivocal: \"An interlocutory or final judgment, decree, or order of the district court may be reviewed only upon petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States.\" It covers all conceivable decisions by a district court: orders, decrees, and interlocutory and final judgments. It states that review is \"only upon petition for a writ of certiorari.\" IIRIRA \u00a7 102(c)(2)(C). I read this subsection as requiring that for all actions filed in a district court that arise \"from any action undertaken, or any decision made, by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to paragraph (1),\" appellate review is limited to the Supreme Court. IIRIRA \u00a7 102(c)(1). Moreover, as Congress has provided for appellate review, there is no reason not to abide by the statute's plain intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flores-Miramontes v. I.N.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747609\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/1133/#p1136\">\n    212 F.3d 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1136 (9th Cir. 2000) (noting that if plaintiff \"can raise his claims elsewhere ... we need not read an exception into the jurisdiction-stripping provision at issue.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The majority circumvents the statute's restriction on appellate jurisdiction by arguing that the\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   claims do not \"arise out of\" the Secretary's waiver of legal requirements under \u00a7 102(c)(1). This ignores the obvious thrust of the plaintiffs' complaints, which challenge the Secretary's authority to \"waive all legal requirements\" on both constitutional and statutory grounds. Indeed, their claims under the National Environmental Policy Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204321\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et. seq., the Administrative Procedure Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et. seq., and the Coastal Zone Management Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201451\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et. seq., primarily assert that the Secretary cannot waive the procedural requirements of those statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   It is true that plaintiffs' assertions that the Secretary lacks any authority to construct border walls are arguably separate from plaintiffs' arguments concerning the Secretary's ability to waive legal requirements. But these are weak secondary arguments that the district court and the majority correctly reject. These are arguments that would be raised at different times, possibly in different fora, but for the Secretary's exercise of authority under \u00a7 102(c)(1). Moreover, the district court's rejection of collateral or secondary arguments in litigation that primarily challenge the Secretary's exercise of authority under \u00a7 102(c)(1) remains subject to the appellate restriction in \u00a7 102(c)(2)(C). One of the purposes of the restriction on appellate jurisdiction is to expedite appellate review and this purpose is compromised if the losing parties are allowed to seek review of some issues in the court of appeal and others in the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Accordingly, I dissent from the majority's opinion because \u00a7 102(c)(2)(C) restricts appellate review of the district court's decisions in these cases to the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
