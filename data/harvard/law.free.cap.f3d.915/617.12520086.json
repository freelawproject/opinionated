(Entertainment Studios), an African American-owned operator of television networks, sought to secure a carriage contract from Defendant-Appellant Charter Communications, Inc. (Charter). These efforts were unsuccessful, and Entertainment Studios, along with Plaintiff-Appellee National Association of African American-Owned Media (NAAAOM, and together with Entertainment Studios, Plaintiffs), claimed that Charter's refusal to enter into a carriage contract was racially motivated, and in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court, concluding that Plaintiffs' complaint sufficiently pleaded a \u00a7 1981 claim and that the First Amendment did not bar such an action, denied Charter's motion to dismiss. The court then certified that order for interlocutory appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Entertainment Studios is a full-service television and motion picture company owned by Byron Allen, an African-American actor, comedian, and entrepreneur. It serves as both a producer of television series and an operator of television networks, and currently operates seven channels and distributes thousands of hours of programming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Entertainment Studios relies on cable operators like Charter for \"carriage contracts\"; these operators, which range from local cable companies to nationwide enterprises, carry and distribute channels and programming to their television subscribers. Although Entertainment Studios managed to secure carriage contracts with more than 50 operators-including prominent distributors like Verizon, AT&amp;T, and DirecTV-it was unable to reach a similar agreement with Charter, the third-largest cable television-distribution company in the United States, despite efforts that began in 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   From 2011 to 2016, Charter's senior vice president of programming, Allan Singer, declined to meet with Entertainment Studios representatives or consider its channels for carriage. Plaintiffs alleged that, instead of engaging in a meaningful discussion regarding a potential carriage contract, Singer and Charter repeatedly refused, rescheduled, and postponed meetings, encouraging Entertainment Studios to exercise patience and proffering disingenuous explanations for its refusal to contract. Although Singer stated that Charter was not launching any new channels and that bandwidth and operational demands precluded carriage opportunities, Plaintiffs claimed that Charter nonetheless negotiated with other, white-owned networks during the same period, and also secured carriage agreements with The Walt Disney Company and Time Warner Cable Sports. Charter allegedly communicated that it did not have faith in Entertainment Studios' \"tracking model,\" despite contracting with other white-owned\n   media companies that used the same tracking model. Plaintiffs also asserted that Singer blocked a meeting between Entertainment Studios and Charter CEO Tom Rutledge because the latter \"does not meet with programmers,\" despite the fact that Rutledge regularly met with the CEOs of white-owned programmers, such as Viacom's Philippe Dauman. Singer was allegedly steadfast in his opposition to Entertainment Studios, saying, \"Even if you get support from management in the field, I will not approve the launch of your network.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs claimed that they finally managed to secure a meeting with Singer in July 2015. However, during the meeting at Charter's headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, Singer once again made clear that Entertainment Studios would not receive a carriage contract, citing a series of allegedly insincere explanations for this decision. For example, Singer informed Entertainment Studios that he wanted to wait and \"see what AT&amp;T does,\" despite the fact that AT&amp;T already carried one of Entertainment Studios' networks. Charter also mentioned its purported lack of bandwidth, even though at that time, it expanded the distribution of two lesser-known, white-owned channels into major media markets: RFD-TV, a network focused on rural and Western lifestyles, and CHILLER, a horror channel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In addition to recounting Entertainment Studios' failed negotiations with Charter, Plaintiffs' amended complaint also included direct evidence of racial bias. In one instance, Singer allegedly approached an African-American protest group outside Charter's headquarters, told them \"to get off of welfare,\" and accused them of looking for a \"handout.\" Plaintiffs asserted that, after informing Charter of these allegations, it announced that Singer was leaving the company. In another alleged instance, Entertainment Studios' owner, Allen, attempted to talk with Charter's CEO, Rutledge, at an industry event; Rutledge refused to engage, referring to Allen as \"Boy\" and telling Allen that he needed to change his behavior. Plaintiffs suggested that these incidents were illustrative of Charter's institutional racism, noting also that the cable operator had historically refused to carry African American-owned channels and, prior to its merger with Time Warner Cable, had a board of directors composed only of white men. The amended complaint further alleged that Charter's recently pronounced commitments to diversity were merely illusory efforts to placate the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs initiated this action on January 27, 2016, asserting both a claim against Charter under \u00a7 1981 and a claim against the FCC under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After learning of the derogatory racial comments allegedly made by Singer and Rutledge, Plaintiffs sought leave to file a first amended complaint (FAC), which the district court granted. The FAC alleged one claim against Charter for racial discrimination in contracting in violation of \u00a7 1981.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Charter moved to dismiss the FAC, arguing that it failed to plead that racial animus was the but-for cause of Charter's conduct and that the First Amendment barred a \u00a7 1981 claim based on a cable operator's editorial discretion. The district court denied the motion. It determined\n   that, under\n   <em>\n    Metoyer v. Chassman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2950717\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/919/\">\n    504 F.3d 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2007), Plaintiffs needed only to plead that racism was a\n   <em>\n    motivating factor\n   </em>\n   in Charter's decision, not the\n   <em>\n    but-for\n   </em>\n   cause-a requirement, the court concluded, that Plaintiffs satisfied. Addressing Charter's contention that\n   <em>\n    Metoyer\n   </em>\n   was no longer good law following two subsequent Supreme Court decisions, the district court concluded that \"if\n   <em>\n    Metoyer\n   </em>\n   is no longer good law on this point, [then] the Ninth Circuit [ ] should announce that conclusion.\" As for Charter's First Amendment challenge, the district court allowed that the cable operator's \"ultimate carriage/programming activity is entitled to some measure of First Amendment protection,\" but declined to apply strict scrutiny and bar the \u00a7 1981 claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Subsequently, Charter moved for certification of the district court's order under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), which the district court granted.

This is distinctive language, quite different from the language of the ADEA and Title VII's retaliation provision, both of which use the word \"because\" and therefore explicitly suggest but-for causation.

There, albeit in dicta and without formally resolving the issue, the court reasoned that \"[i]f race plays any role in a challenged decision by a defendant, the plain terms of the statutory text suggest the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case that section 1981 was violated because the plaintiff has not enjoyed 'the same right' as other similarly situated persons.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755233\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/175/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 182 n.5 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Ange v.

This, we conclude, is the most natural reading of \u00a7 1981. Therefore, unlike the ADEA or Title VII's retaliation provision, \u00a7 1981 's text permits an exception to the default but-for causation standard by virtue of \"an indication to the contrary in the statute itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Nassar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698471\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/338/#p362\">\n    570 U.S. at 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698471\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/338/#p362\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Accordingly, mixed-motive claims are cognizable under \u00a7 1981. Even if racial animus was not the but-for cause of a defendant's refusal to contract, a plaintiff can still prevail if she demonstrates that discriminatory intent was a factor in that decision such that she was denied the same right as a white citizen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Plausibility of Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1981 Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Having determined that a plaintiff in a \u00a7 1981 action need only prove that discriminatory intent was a factor in-and not necessarily the but-for cause of-a defendant's refusal to contract, we must now determine whether Plaintiffs pleaded a plausible claim for relief in their FAC. We conclude that they did. Plaintiffs' allegations regarding Charter's treatment of Entertainment Studios, and its differing treatment of white-owned companies, are sufficient to state a viable claim pursuant to \u00a7 1981.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Allegations of Disparate Treatment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs' FAC alleged various instances of contradictory, disingenuous, and disrespectful behavior on the part of Charter and its executives. These allegations include: a pattern of declining and delaying meetings with Entertainment Studios, combined with a refusal to contract despite presenting intimations to the contrary; the offering of \"provably false\" explanations for its reluctance to carry Entertainment Studios' channels; and Singer's repeated misleading and insulting communications with Entertainment Studios. We acknowledge that, even when considered in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, these claims alone would not constitute a plausible \u00a7 1981 claim. Corporate red tape, inconsistent decision-making among network leadership, and even boorish executives are not themselves necessarily indicative of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   However, Plaintiffs supplemented these claims by pleading that white-owned companies were not treated similarly. For example, the FAC stated that, although Charter informed Entertainment Studios that bandwidth and operational demands prevented carriage of the latter's channels, Charter secured contracts with \"white-owned, lesser-known\" networks during the same period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Charter also allegedly pointed\n   to Entertainment Studios' tracking model as a ground for refusing to contract, while simultaneously accepting white-owned channels that used the same model. Plaintiffs further alleged that Charter's CEO, Rutledge, refused to meet with Entertainment Studios' African-American owner, Allen, despite meeting with the heads of white-owned programmers during the same time period. We conclude that these allegations, when accepted as true and viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, are sufficient under \u00a7 1981 to plausibly claim that Charter denied Entertainment Studios the same right to contract as white-owned companies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Charter's Race-Neutral Explanations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Charter contends that we cannot ignore the legitimate, race-neutral explanations for its conduct that are, admittedly, present on the face of the FAC. These business justifications include limited bandwidth, timing concerns, and other operational considerations. However, at this stage, we are not permitted to weigh evidence and determine whether the explanations proffered by Plaintiffs or Charter are ultimately more persuasive. Instead, we have explained that \"[i]f there are two alternative explanations, one advanced by defendant and the other advanced by plaintiff, both of which are plausible, plaintiff's complaint survives a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). Plaintiff's complaint may be dismissed only when defendant's plausible alternative explanation is so convincing that plaintiff's explanation is\n   <em>\n    im\n   </em>\n   plausible.\"\n   <em>\n    Starr v. Baca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3759026\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/652/1202/#p1216\">\n    652 F.3d 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1216 (9th Cir. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Here, it is plausible that Charter's conduct was attributable wholly to legitimate, race-neutral considerations. But we cannot conclude, based only on the allegations in the FAC, construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, that those alternative explanations are so compelling as to render Plaintiffs' allegations of discriminatory intent\n   <em>\n    im\n   </em>\n   plausible. This is especially true given that Plaintiffs' allegations of disparate treatment and disingenuous statements suggest that Charter's race-neutral explanations lack credibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Desert Palace, Inc. v.

In short, we can infer from the allegations in the FAC that discriminatory intent played at least some role in Charter's refusal to contract with Entertainment Studios, thus denying the latter the same right to contract as a white-owned company.

A bookstore's choice of which books to stock on its shelves, or a theater owner's decision about which productions to stage, or a cable operator's selection of certain perspectives to air, are decisions based on content, and not necessarily on the racial identities of the parties with which they contract (or refuse to contract). Here, by contrast, Plaintiffs plausibly pleaded that Charter refused to contract with Entertainment Studios due to racial animus, and they must ultimately prove that Entertainment Studios' racial identity, separate and apart from the underlying content of its programming, was a factor in Charter's decision. Accordingly, our First Amendment analysis is limited to cases involving racially discriminatory contracting that incidentally impacts speech, and should not be construed as applying to cases where a refusal to contract is instead based solely on the viewpoint or substance of a plaintiff's content or message.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
