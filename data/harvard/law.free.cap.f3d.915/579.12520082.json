To support those conclusions, the PSR identified numerous predicate offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The PSR then recommended a sentence of 262 to 327 months' imprisonment. Darden objected to the PSR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the sentencing hearing, the district court sentenced Darden to 200 months for the drug count, 200 months for the firearm count, and 120 months for the drug-firearm count, all to run concurrently. The district court concluded he was an armed career criminal and a career offender. Following the hearing, Darden timely appealed his convictions and sentences, and we affirmed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Darden's First 2255 Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Two years later, Darden filed a motion to vacate the sentences under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"2014 motion\"). Among other things, he claimed he had received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney had not argued that the firearm and drug-firearm counts should be consolidated for sentencing purposes. The district court agreed that counsel was ineffective but found no prejudice because Darden had been sentenced to serve a concurrent 200 months on the drug count. Merging the firearm and the drug-firearm counts, the district court explained, would not have affected the length of his incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Darden appealed. Before we had the chance to decide the case, however, the government moved for a remand \"to enter\n   an amended judgment reflecting that Darden was convicted on [the drug count] ... and either [the firearm or the drug-firearm count].\" Darden did not object to the motion, but requested that counsel be appointed \"at the district court level for re-sentencing.\" Seeing that both parties desired a remand, we granted the motion, remanding the case \"for further proceedings and entry of an amended judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   While the appellate proceedings were ongoing and before we remanded, Darden amended his 2014 motion before the district court pro se. He claimed that his second-degree assault convictions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 2, were not violent felonies in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). The district court ordered the federal public defender's office to review Darden's amended motion and determine whether it would pursue Darden's arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A month later, we remanded, as mentioned previously, whereupon the district court ordered Darden to file a brief explaining why he was entitled to resentencing and not simply an amended judgment. Darden filed the brief in March 2016, and the government did not respond because it did not have a position on the issue. Shortly thereafter, the district court ordered a resentencing hearing and appointed Darden counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Probation Office then issued a PSR for resentencing. The report again concluded that Darden was an armed career criminal and a career offender based on the same predicate offenses that were cited in the 2011 PSR. The government filed a sentencing memorandum in support of the PSR. Darden thereafter objected to the PSR and filed a brief, arguing that his prior burglary and attempted assault convictions could not be considered violent felonies under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the resentencing hearing, the government dismissed the drug-firearm count and argued that Darden's attempted assault convictions were violent felonies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court allowed Darden to speak about his rehabilitation efforts. The district court also permitted Darden to present witnesses on his behalf. The district court then considered the arguments and sentenced Darden to 200 months on the drug count and a concurrent 200 months on the firearm count. The district court reasoned that Darden was still an armed career criminal and career offender because he had three predicate offenses: the 2003 conviction for marijuana possession and \"at least two\" of the 2004 convictions for attempted assaults on a law enforcement officer. The attempted assault convictions, the district court explained, were violent felonies based on this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Alexander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059897\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/1029/\">\n    809 F.3d 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2016). Contrary to Darden's wishes, his attorney did not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Darden's Second 2255 Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Darden's attorney's failure to appeal prompted Darden to file a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his 2016 sentences (the \"2017 motion\"). He alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court ordered a hearing on his motion, understanding that \"the sole purpose of th[e] hearing\" was to reimpose the 2016 sentences so that Darden could appeal them. At the hearing, the district court allowed Darden's attorney to present a brief argument and then allowed Darden to say a few words for himself. The district court then resentenced Darden\n   to two concurrent terms of 200 months so that he could appeal. As it did so, the district court stated that it believed it did not have the power to sentence Darden to a reduced sentence. The district court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   If I had the power, I would probably-I would have reduced your sentence to about 120 months. I didn't believe that I had the power [when you were here before], and I don't believe I have the power now to resentence you. If I did, I would sentence you to 120 months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Darden timely appealed, bringing the case before us. He now argues that: (1) under the \"sentencing package\" doctrine, the district court had the authority to conduct a plenary resentencing at the October 2017 hearing and should have done so; (2) his prior assault convictions were not \"violent felonies\" under the ACCA; (3) his 2004 assault convictions were all part of a continuous course of conduct that should be treated as one conviction; and (4) he was prejudiced by a change of attorneys after we remanded the case for further proceedings regarding the 2014 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural Correctness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Darden first asserts that the district court committed procedural error when it reinstated his 200-month sentence at the October 2017 hearing without conducting a \"plenary resentencing.\" The district court, Darden insists, \"had the authority to conduct a plenary resentencing on all counts\" under the \" 'sentencing package' doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gardiner v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"405245\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/114/734/#p736\">\n    114 F.3d 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 736 (8th Cir. 1997) (discussing the doctrine). The district court, therefore, \"plainly erred,\" Darden concludes, \"in failing to recognize the scope of its authority to impose a new sentence that reflected the concerns of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Both parties agree that plain-error review applies to this issue as Darden did not object to the procedure the district court followed at the second resentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ruiz-Salazar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183171\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/1270/#p1272\">\n    785 F.3d 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1272 (8th Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (noting that \"a claim of procedural error\" raised \"for the first time on appeal\" is reviewed under the \"plain-error standard\"). Under plain-error review, Darden\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   must show (1) an error; (2) that is plain; and (3) that affects substantial rights. An error affects a substantial right if it is prejudicial, meaning that there is a reasonable probability the defendant would have received a lighter sentence but for the error. Even if that showing is made, this court will correct such an error only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    United States v. Trung Dang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519049\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/907/561/#p564\">\n    907 F.3d 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 564 (8th Cir. 2018) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Here, the district court did not procedurally err when it resentenced Darden to 200 months in 2017. We have repeatedly said that \"[w]hen resentencing follows a successful \u00a7 2255 motion based on counsel's failure to appeal, 'the prescribed procedure is for the district court to vacate the sentence and then reimpose it.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The district court followed this clearly established procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Moreover, even if we were to now agree with Darden that the sentencing package doctrine or any other consideration should compel district courts to follow a different procedure, any error the district court committed here would not be \"plain\" in light of the long line of cases just cited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
