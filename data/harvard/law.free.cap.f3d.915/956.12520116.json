Based largely on the negative implications that can be drawn from a University policy that discusses salary increases but nowhere mentions salary decreases, McKinney argues that he has a property interest in the continued receipt of his base salary and that he was deprived of that interest without due process. The District Court agreed, granting summary judgment for McKinney. Because we conclude McKinney lacks a property interest in the entirety of his base salary, we will reverse and remand for entry of judgment in favor of the University.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When McKinney was hired in 1970 and granted tenure in 1974, the terms of his employment were not governed by a collective bargaining agreement or employment contract per se, but by University policies promulgated by the University Trustees. Those policies provide that tenured faculty can be terminated only \"for cause,\" App. 795, and they explicitly provide yearly salary raises for all faculty who perform satisfactorily or meritoriously. According to University Policy 07-09-01 (the \"Policy\"), \"[e]ach faculty or staff member performing satisfactorily will receive a percentage increase of the size determined for that year for maintenance of real salary,\" i.e., a salary increase to account for inflation. App. 1152-53. And for meritorious faculty, the Policy states that \"every faculty ... member whose performance is judged meritorious receives a merit increase in salary.\" App. 1153. Any salary increase for \"maintenance\" or merit \"become[s] part of [the faculty member's] base contract salary in subsequent years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   No explicit provisions govern salary decreases, but the Policy provides procedures to address complaints from faculty members dissatisfied with their salary decisions and requires that if a faculty member's performance is \"judged unsatisfactory,\" the faculty member \"must be informed of the specific reasons for that judgment.\" App. 1154.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Whether a given professor's performance is meritorious, satisfactory or unsatisfactory depends on three criteria: (1) teaching ability, (2) achievements in research and scholarship, and (3) service to the University and/or community. For McKinney, these criteria were assessed in an annual review process overseen by the Dean of the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs (the \"Grad School\"). To evaluate these criteria, the Dean invites input from the faculty members themselves and from their peers and students. That input is typically in the form of reports prepared by each faculty member, which summarize their activities and achievements for the year; evaluations provided by an elected committee of Grad School faculty members, which scores each faculty member on all three criteria; and student evaluations and enrollment data tracked by the University. Based on the submissions received, the Dean makes a final decision about faculty performance, rating each faculty member as meritorious, satisfactory, or unsatisfactory, and determines what salary a faculty member will receive the following year in accordance with the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   McKinney did not fare well in recent years in this review process. In McKinney's 2010 and 2011 reviews, John Keeler, the Dean of the Grad School for all relevant\n   periods, expressed concern about declining enrollment in McKinney's classes, poor student evaluations, and a stagnant research agenda, but nonetheless granted him the standard 2.0% and 1.5% maintenance increases which were budgeted respectively in those years for faculty with \"satisfactory\" performance. Despite the admonition from Dean Keeler, these same deficiencies persisted through the 2012 review, in which McKinney ranked last among the Grad School faculty and was given a performance rating of \"less than satisfactory.\" App. 231. At the conclusion of that review in August 2012, McKinney was advised that his salary would be increased by only 0.5%, and that if his \"performance d[id] not improve next year ... [Dean Keeler] w[ould] have no recourse but to give [McKinney] a 0.0% raise or even consider a salary reduction.\" App. 233.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Still, McKinney's performance showed no improvement. He was again ranked last in the 2013 review, prompting Dean Keeler to reduce his salary by 20%. In a face-to-face meeting with McKinney in September 2013, Dean Keeler advised McKinney of this decision and provided him a letter that laid out over the course of five pages the long-standing problems with McKinney's teaching and research that justified the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   McKinney then lodged a complaint directly with the University Provost. Although this was not consistent with the prescribed Grad School appeal process, the University investigated and ultimately concluded that McKinney's salary reduction was not improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At that point, McKinney filed a complaint in federal court alleging that the University unconstitutionally deprived him of his property interest in the entirety of his base salary. After discovery, the parties cross-filed for summary judgment, which the District Court granted in favor of McKinney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of his motion, McKinney argued that the University's \"tenure system, policies, and bylaws\" created a \"property right to his salary.\"\n   <em>\n    McKinney v.

Pa. June 5, 2017) (quoting ECF No. 25 at 5-6).

The University moved to stay the proceeding and filed for interlocutory appeal, which we granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, the University argues that McKinney does not have a property interest in his full salary because the Policy does not protect his base salary against reduction. McKinney also focuses exclusively on the Policy, arguing that the language of the Policy gives him a constitutionally protected property interest in his base salary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the Policy is insufficient to support a constitutionally protected property interest. Below, we first address what is needed to establish a property interest in this context and then explain why the Policy fails to meet that high bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Fourteenth Amendment protects against \"depriv[ation] of an individual interest [in] ... property\" without the \"due process of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

Core to the existence of an individual property interest is the requirement that the plaintiff have \"a legitimate claim of entitlement to\" the interest at issue that stems from \"an independent source such as state law\" or \"rules or understandings that secure certain benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v.

McKinney grounds his claim in a single line in the Policy: \"Each faculty or staff member performing satisfactorily will receive a percentage increase of the size determined for that year for maintenance of real salary.\" App. 1153. But measured against the yardstick of\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   and the case law of our sister circuits, this language is not sufficient to give McKinney a \"legitimate expectation\" in the continuance of his base salary. We reach this conclusion for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, the Policy by its terms speaks to a potential property interest in \"maintenance,\" i.e., an incremental annual adjustment to account for inflation, not a property interest in base salary. \"Maintenance\" is evaluated annually and thus relates to a benefit that has not yet been received. McKinney does not challenge the University's decision to not award him a maintenance increase; instead, he elides this prospective benefit with the continued receipt of an existing benefit: his last year's base salary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet the Policy refers not to base salaries but to maintenance increases, and thus, to the extent it creates any \"mutually explicit understanding,\" it is not one that supports the property interest that McKinney claims on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, we can hardly derive a \"mutually explicit understanding\" from the Policy when McKinney's entire argument is premised on a negative implication. His argument, after all, is that the phrase \"increase ... for maintenance of real salary,\" App. 1153, assumes-and therefore implicitly guarantees-the baseline of the prior year's salary.

And even assuming this language is sufficiently ambiguous to render McKinney's interpretation a reasonable one, the burden is on McKinney, as the plaintiff asserting a constitutionally protected property interest, to establish the converse: that a policy explicitly prohibits the reduction of base salary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330790\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/438/#p441\">\n    439 U.S. at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330790\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/438/#p441\">\n    99 S.Ct. 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring the plaintiffs to \"show[ ] the requisite mutual understanding\" (emphasis omitted));\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   , 408 U.S. at 579,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782964\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/564/#p577\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the plaintiff had \"not shown that he was deprived of ... property protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\"). This, he fails to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Third, any assurances the Policy gives, even as to increases for \"maintenance,\" are too \"detailed and conditional,\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10508765\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/6/290/#p294\">\n    6 F.3d at 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to support a property interest in the base salary. Indeed, the Policy expressly anticipates negative consequences for unsatisfactory performance in that it requires the Grad School to inform faculty members whose performance is \"judged unsatisfactory\" of the \"specific reasons for that judgment,\" App. 1154, and it specifies procedures a faculty member may invoke to seek reconsideration of salary decisions-a circumstance that can arise in the normal course not only with salary increases\n   that a faculty member may consider inadequate but also with salary decreases a faculty member may wish to contest. And the Policy's three-tiered rating structure (meritorious, satisfactory, unsatisfactory) itself reinforces the understanding that salary may be reduced as well as increased. Given that the Policy provides for salary increases beyond \"maintenance\" for those whose performance is deemed \"meritorious\" and an \"increase ... for maintenance of real salary,\" App. 1153, for those whose performance is deemed \"satisfactory,\" the logical implication is that those whose performance is \"less than satisfactory,\" App. 231, may be subject to salary reductions. In sum, both the appeal provisions and the three-tiered rating structure indicate that salaries are subject to \"possible annual adjustments,\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10508765\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/6/290/#p294\">\n    6 F.3d at 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that McKinney thus had no more than a \"unilateral expectation of receiving [his] full salary,\"\n   <em>\n    Ash\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1510671\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/699/822/#p826\">\n    699 F.2d at 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The \"circumstances of [McKinney's] service,\"\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   , 408 U.S. at 602,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782863\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/593/#p601\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , bolster that conclusion. There is evidence in the record that the University had reduced the salary of as many as twenty faculty members in the past, indicating that McKinney's salary reduction was not wholly unusual. Furthermore, McKinney was notified as early as August 2012 that if his \"performance d[id] not improve next year ... [Dean Keeler] w[ould] have no recourse but to give [McKinney] a 0.0% raise or even consider a salary reduction.\" App. 233. Yet McKinney offered no response, and at no point before his salary was actually reduced over a year later, in September 2013, did he express surprise or object to this prospect. In short, McKinney has failed to establish\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   explicit understanding-much less a \"mutually explicit understanding\"-that his salary was protected against reduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, we note that where, as here, a university policy is at best ambiguous in establishing a property interest, courts should refrain from constructing one. \"Judicial interposition in the operation of the public school system of the Nation raises problems requiring care and restraint....
