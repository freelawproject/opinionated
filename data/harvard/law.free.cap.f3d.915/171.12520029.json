For the reasons that follow we affirm as to both the appeal and the cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before we recount the facts of this case, we briefly discuss the legal trademark context in which it arises. Trademark law protects the goodwill represented by particular marks and serves the twin objectives of preventing consumer confusion between products and the sources of those products, on the one hand, and protecting the linguistic commons by preventing exclusive use of terms that represent their common meaning, on the other.\n   <em>\n    OBX-Stock, Inc. v. Bicast, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3361250\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/558/334/#p339\">\n    558 F.3d 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 339-40 (4th Cir. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In order to be protectable, marks must be \"distinctive.\" To determine whether a proposed mark is protectable, courts ascertain the strength of the mark by placing it into one of four categories of distinctiveness, in ascending order: (1) generic,\n   (2) descriptive, (3) suggestive, or (4) arbitrary or fanciful.\n   <em>\n    George &amp; Co. v. Imagination Entm't Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034111\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/383/#p393\">\n    575 F.3d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 393-94 (4th Cir. 2009). Marks falling into the latter two categories are deemed inherently distinctive and are entitled to protection because their intrinsic nature serves to identify the particular source of a product. In contrast, descriptive terms may be distinctive only upon certain showings, and generic terms are never distinctive. This dispute concerns only the first two of these four categories, with Booking.com arguing the mark is descriptive and the USPTO arguing it is generic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A term is generic if it is the \"common name of a product\" or \"the genus of which the particular product is a species,\" such as LITE BEER for light beer, or CONVENIENT STORE for convenience stores.\n   <em>\n    OBX-Stock, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3361250\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/558/334/#p339\">\n    558 F.3d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Generic terms do not contain source-identifying significance-they do not distinguish the particular product or service from other products or services on the market.\n   <em>\n    George &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034111\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/383/#p393\">\n    575 F.3d at 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, generic terms can never obtain trademark protection, as trademarking a generic term effectively grants the owner a monopoly over a term in common coinage. If protection were allowed, a competitor could not describe his goods or services as what they are.\n   <em>\n    CES Publ'g Corp. v.

Secondary meaning indicates that a term has become sufficiently distinctive to establish a mental association in the relevant public's minds between the proposed mark and the source of the product or service.\n   <em>\n    George &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034111\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/383/#p393\">\n    575 F.3d at 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Against this background, we consider the facts before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Booking.com operates a website on which customers can book travel and hotel accommodations. It has used the name BOOKING.COM since at least 2006. In 2011 and 2012, Booking.com filed four trademark applications for the use of BOOKING.COM as a word mark and for stylized versions of the mark with the USPTO. Booking.com sought registration for, inter alia, Class 43 services, which include online hotel reservation services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The USPTO examiner rejected Booking.com's applications, finding that the marks were not protectable because BOOKING.COM was generic as applied to the relevant services. In the alternative, the USPTO concluded that the marks were merely descriptive and that Booking.com had failed to establish that they had acquired secondary meaning as required for trademark protection. After the examiner denied Booking.com's motion for reconsideration, Booking.com appealed to\n   the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (the \"TTAB\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The TTAB affirmed the USPTO's four refusals of registration in three separate opinions. These opinions all concluded that BOOKING.COM was a generic term for the services offered, and therefore ineligible for trademark protection, because \"booking\" generically refers to \"a reservation or arrangement to buy a travel ticket or stay in a hotel room\" or \"the act of reserving such travel or accommodation\"; \".com\" indicates a commercial website; and consumers would understand the resulting composite BOOKING.COM to primarily refer to an online reservation service for travel, tours, and lodging, which are the services proposed in Booking.com's applications.\n   <em>\n    Booking.com B.V. v. Matal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273148\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/278/891/#p896\">\n    278 F.Supp.3d 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 896 (E.D. Va. 2017) (summarizing the TTAB's findings). In the alternative, the TTAB concluded that BOOKING.COM is merely descriptive of Booking.com's services and that Booking.com had failed to demonstrate that the mark had acquired secondary meaning, as required for trademark protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Booking.com appealed the TTAB's decisions by filing this civil action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201071\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) against the USPTO and the USPTO's director in the Eastern District of Virginia in April 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It argued that BOOKING.COM was a descriptive or suggestive mark eligible for protection. In support of its argument, Booking.com submitted new evidence to the district court. This evidence included a \"Teflon survey,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   indicating that 74.8% of consumers recognized BOOKING.COM as a brand rather than a generic service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court held that although \"booking\" was a generic term for the services identified, BOOKING.COM\n   <em>\n    as a whole\n   </em>\n   was nevertheless a descriptive mark. The district court further determined that Booking.com had met its burden of demonstrating that the proposed mark had acquired secondary meaning, and therefore was protectable, as to the hotel reservation services described in Class 43. The court therefore partially granted Booking.com's motion for summary judgment, ordering the USPTO to register two of the marks and remanded for further administrative proceedings as to the other two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The USPTO subsequently filed two motions. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), the USPTO sought to amend the court's order requiring the USPTO to register the two trademarks, requesting instead that the court remand for further administrative proceedings. It also filed a motion for expenses pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201071\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3), which would require Booking.com to pay $76,873.61 of the USPTO's expenses under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201071\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). These expenses included the salaries of the PTO's attorneys and paralegals that worked on the defense action. The district court denied the USPTO's motion to amend as to the two marks, reasoning that they were registerable as trademarks and that no further administrative proceedings were necessary. However, the district court granted the USPTO's motion for expenses. Both the USPTO and Booking.com appealed. The USPTO and Booking.com challenge, respectively, whether BOOKING.COM is protectable, and\n   whether Booking.com must pay the USPTO's attorneys fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We turn first to the USPTO's contention that the district court erred in concluding that BOOKING.COM is a protectable trademark. According to the USPTO, BOOKING.COM is a generic, not a descriptive, term that can never be protected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We review a district court's grant of summary judgment based on the conclusion that a mark is sufficiently distinctive to warrant trademark protection de novo.\n   <em>\n    Retail Servs. Inc. v. Freebies Publ'g\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9273436\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/364/535/#p541\">\n    364 F.3d 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 541-42 (4th Cir. 2004). The question of whether a proposed mark is generic is a question of fact that is subject to deferential review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swatch AG v. Beehive Wholesale, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4083785\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/739/150/#p155\">\n    739 F.3d 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 155 (4th Cir. 2014) (citing\n   <em>\n    Pizzeria Uno Corp. v. Temple\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"644286\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/747/1522/#p1533\">\n    747 F.2d 1522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1533 (4th Cir. 1984) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Critically to our analysis, the USPTO concedes that if BOOKING.COM may properly be deemed descriptive, the district court's finding that it has acquired secondary meaning was warranted. Rather, the USPTO only challenges the district court's determination that BOOKING.COM is not generic. Therefore, the limited question on appeal is whether the district court erred in finding that BOOKING.COM is not generic. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that there was no genuine issue of material fact on the issue of genericness and that, on these facts, BOOKING.COM is a protectable trademark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Before undertaking our analysis, two issues pertinent to the genericness inquiry bear further elaboration: first, who bears the burden of proving genericness, and second, the framework for determining whether a proposed mark is generic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We have never directly addressed the issue of which party bears the burden of proving genericness on appeal when registration of a mark is denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the Federal Circuit has long held, and we agree, that in registration proceedings, the USPTO \"always bears the burden\" of establishing that a proposed mark is generic.\n   <em>\n    In re Cordua Rests., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5916611\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/594/#p600\">\n    823 F.3d 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 600 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, and Smith, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747779\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/828/1567/#p1571\">\n    828 F.2d 1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (explaining that the burden of proving genericness \"\n   <em>\n    remains\n   </em>\n   with\" the PTO) (emphasis added). This is so because finding a mark to be generic carries significant consequence, as it forecloses an applicant from any rights over the mark-once a mark is determined to be generic, it can never receive trademark protection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2 J. Thomas McCarthy,\n   <em>\n    McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 12:12 (5th ed. 2018) (explaining that finding a mark to be generic is a \"fateful step\" as it may result in the \"loss of rights which could be valuable intellectual property\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We therefore hold here that the USPTO bears the burden of proving that\n   BOOKING.COM is generic in the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We next discuss the framework for determining whether a mark is generic. As we have discussed, generic terms are the \"common name of a product or service itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Sara Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650629\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/81/455/#p464\">\n    81 F.3d at 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To determine whether a term is generic, we follow a three-step test: (1) identify the class of product or service to which use of the mark is relevant; (2) identify the relevant consuming public; and (3) determine whether the primary significance of the mark to the relevant public is as an indication of the nature of the class of the product or services to which the mark relates, which suggests that it is generic, or an indication of the source or brand, which suggests that it is not generic.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Glover v.

Indeed, courts have explained that \"no matter how much money and effort the user of a generic term has poured into promoting the sale of its merchandise and what success it has achieved in securing public identification,\" that user cannot claim the exclusive right through trademark protection to call the product or service by its common name.\n   <em>\n    Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v.

Nor do\n   they disagree as to step two: that the relevant purchasing public consists of consumers who use hotel reservation services offered via the internet or in person. Instead, the dispute arises at the third step: the public's understanding of what the term BOOKING.COM primarily refers to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   To ascertain the public's understanding of a term, courts may look to \"purchaser testimony, consumer surveys, listings and dictionaries, trade journals, newspapers, and other publications.\"\n   <em>\n    Glover\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7622819\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/74/57/#p59\">\n    74 F.3d at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is true that some courts have found the use of a proposed mark in longer domain names to be evidence in support of finding that term generic.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Advertise.com, Inc. v.

We note, however, that although those courts recognized that the inclusion of the proposed mark in longer domain names was strong evidence of genericness, they nonetheless remained open to considering consumer surveys to determine the public's understanding of the proposed mark.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Hotels.com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048403\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/573/1300/#p1304\">\n    573 F.3d at 1304-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the TTAB did not err in determining that the term was generic, citing in part concerns arising from the methodology of the applicant's consumer survey). Moreover, using the characters \"booking.com\" or \"bookings.com\" in a longer domain name does not necessarily mean that BOOKING.COM is generic. Unlike \"hotels\" or \"lawyers,\" \"booking\" is used to describe a plethora of reservation services, including, for example, theatrical or musical engagements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Booking.com B.V.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273148\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/278/891/#p896\">\n    278 F.Supp.3d at 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Random House: Unabridged Dictionary (2d ed. 1993)).

Accordingly, where, as here, the district court found that the survey was methodologically sound, the survey is strong evidence that the public does not understand BOOKING.COM to refer to the proposed mark's generic meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On appeal, the USPTO does not contest the validity of the survey or its methodology. Instead, it relies on dicta in\n   <em>\n    Hunt Masters\n   </em>\n   to argue that the district court erred in considering the survey at all. 240 F.3d at 254-55. Its reliance is misplaced; our reasoning in that case does not apply here. In\n   <em>\n    Hunt Masters\n   </em>\n   , we considered whether the owners of \"the Charleston Crab House,\" who sought to enjoin a competitor from using the name \"The Crab House,\" had a protected proprietary interest in the term \"crab house.\" We declined to find such an interest because we determined that \"crab house\" was a generic term referring to a class of restaurants that serve crabs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 254. In so determining, we held that the district court did not err in declining to consider the plaintiff's consumer survey. We explained that there are two ways in which terms may be classified as generic-\"(1) where the term began life as a 'coined term' \" that had become generic through common usage, and \"(2) where the term was commonly used prior to its association with the products at issue\"-and that while consumer surveys are relevant to determining whether a term is generic in the former scenario, they are not in the latter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 254-55. Contrary to the USPTO's contention,\n   <em>\n    Hunt Masters\n   </em>\n   does not control where, as here, the district court determined based on the dearth of evidence in the record that the proposed mark was not commonly used. As such, the proposed mark does not fall within the category of terms for which survey evidence is irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Weighing the evidence before it, the district court did not err in finding that the USPTO did not satisfy its burden of showing that BOOKING.COM is generic. It is axiomatic that determinations regarding the relative weight of evidence are left for the trier of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hotels.com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048403\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/573/1300/#p1304\">\n    573 F.3d at 1305-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the trier of fact, the TTAB, could reasonably have given controlling weight to dictionary definitions\n   and similar uses of \"hotels\" with a .com suffix over a consumer survey with questionable methodology). Here, the district court, acting as the trier of fact in reviewing Booking.com's trademark application de novo, did not err in placing greater weight on the consumer survey over other evidence, like dictionary definitions, in assessing the primary significance to the public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mars Sales Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515834\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/987/975/#p982\">\n    987 F.2d at 982-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that direct consumer evidence, e.g., consumer surveys and testimony, \"is preferable to indirect forms of evidence\" like dictionaries and trade journals).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We therefore conclude that the district court did not err in finding that BOOKING.COM is a descriptive, rather than generic, mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   ii.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The USPTO nevertheless contends that adding the top-level domain \".com\" to a generic second-level domain like \"booking\" is\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   generic, and that the district court therefore erred in finding that BOOKING.COM was non-generic. The USPTO advances two theories as reasons for adopting a per se rule against protecting terms like BOOKING.COM. For the reasons that follow, we decline to adopt such an approach under either theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   First, the USPTO relies on an 1888 Supreme Court case to argue that, as a matter of law, adding .com to a generic SLD like booking can never be nongeneric. In\n   <em>\n    Goodyear's Rubber Mfg. Co. v. Goodyear Rubber Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3534215\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/128/598/#p602\">\n    128 U.S. 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 602-03,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3534215\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/128/598/#p602\">\n    9 S.Ct. 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3534215\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/128/598/#p602\">\n    32 L.Ed. 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1888), the Court held that the addition of commercial indicators such as \"Company\" to terms that merely describe classes of goods could not be trademarked, like \"Grain Company\" or, as the Dissent provides, \"The Grocery Store.\" According to the USPTO, \".com\" is analytically indistinct from \"company,\" as it is a generic identifier for an entity operating a commercial website, and therefore its addition to a generic term can never be protected. However,\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   was decided almost sixty years before the Lanham Act and, crucially, did not apply the primary significance test. No circuit has adopted the bright line rule for which the USPTO advocates-indeed, sister circuits have found that when \".com\" is added to a generic TLD, the mark may be protectable upon a sufficient showing of the public's understanding through consumer surveys or other evidence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Advertise.com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768365\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/974/#p980\">\n    616 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   982 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Hotels.com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048403\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/573/1300/#p1304\">\n    573 F.3d at 1304-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We similarly decline to do so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Second, the USPTO argues that the proposed mark is per se generic because it is nothing more than the sum of its component parts. It contends that \"booking\" is a generic term for hotel reservation services, that \".com\" is generic for an online company, and that when combined the resulting composite is generic for the online booking services at issue here because a member of the relevant public would understand BOOKING.COM to name an online booking website. Therefore, the USPTO contends, BOOKING.COM is generic. We disagree that it is necessarily so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We begin by discussing the genericness inquiry as it applies to compound terms. When confronted with a compound term like PRETZEL CRISPS, courts may consider as a first step the meaning of each of the term's component marks; but as we explained in\n   <em>\n    Hunt Masters\n   </em>\n   , the ultimate inquiry examines what the public primarily perceives the term\n   <em>\n    as a whole\n   </em>\n   to refer to. 240 F.3d at 254. For example, in determining whether PRETZEL CRISPS is generic, a court may first determine based on dictionary definitions and other competent sources that PRETZEL is primarily understood to refer to the genus of\n   pretzels, and that CRISPS would be understood as primarily referring to crackers.\n   <em>\n    Frito-Lay N. Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20U.S.P.Q.%202d%20%28BNA%29%201184\">\n    124 U.S.P.Q.2d 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4, 21. But the court must also consider evidence-such as use in newspaper articles or food blogs-to determine whether the term PRETZEL CRISPS is perceived primarily to refer to a crispy pretzel or to a particular source.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Where the proposed mark is a composite that includes .com, we clarify that, contrary to the district court's suggestion, .com does not itself have source-identifying significance when added to an SLD like booking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Hotels.com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048403\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/573/1300/#p1304\">\n    573 F.3d at 1304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the generic term \"hotels\" did not lose its generic character by placement in the domain name HOTELS.COM);\n   <em>\n    McCarthy on Trademarks\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 7:17.50 (explaining that a TLD like .com \"has no source indicating significance and cannot serve any trademark purpose\"). Merely appending .com to an SLD does not render the resulting domain name non-generic because the inquiry is whether the public primarily understands the term\n   <em>\n    as a whole\n   </em>\n   to refer to the source or the proffered service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   For the same reason, neither is it the case, as the USPTO would have it, that assuming booking and .com are each generic terms according to their respective dictionary definitions, and that together they describe the service provided, this necessarily ends the genericness inquiry. Within this inquiry, dictionary definitions, though \"relevant and sometimes persuasive\" to the genericness inquiry based on the assumption that such definitions generally reflect the public's perception of a word's meaning, are not necessarily dispositive or controlling.\n   <em>\n    Retail Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9273436\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/364/535/#p541\">\n    364 F.3d at 544-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, where, as here, the court found that the term was not previously commonly used, it may consider additional evidence like consumer surveys in making its genericness determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is particularly true where the mark involves a domain name. Unlike general terms such as \"crab house,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunt Masters\n   </em>\n   , 240 F.3d at 254-55, looking to the component parts of a domain name may not unambiguously represent the primary significance of the term as a whole given that the relevant public may recognize domain names to indicate specific locations\n   on the internet.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hotels.com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048403\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/573/1300/#p1304\">\n    573 F.3d at 1305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (acknowledging that \"consumers may automatically equate a domain name with a brand name\") (citation omitted). Thus, even where the domain-name-as-mark technically describes the service provided, it does not necessarily follow that the public commonly understands the mark to refer to the service broadly speaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We therefore decline to adopt a per se rule and conclude that when \".com\" is combined with an SLD, even a generic SLD, the resulting composite may be non-generic where evidence demonstrates that the mark's primary significance to the public as a whole is the source, not the product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   This approach comports with that taken by our sister circuits, who have similarly declined to adopt a per se rule against protecting domain names, even where they are formed by combining generic terms with TLDs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Advertise.com Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768365\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/974/#p980\">\n    616 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   978-79 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Steelbuilding.com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8948459\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/415/1293/#p1299\">\n    415 F.3d 1293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1299 (Fed.

For instance, in determining whether ADVERTISING.COM was generic, the Ninth Circuit explained that even though both \"advertising\" and \".com\" were generic, and that ADVERTISING.COM conveyed only the genus of the services offered, it was possible \"that\n   <em>\n    consumer surveys or other evidence\n   </em>\n   might ultimately demonstrate that [the] mark is valid and protectable.\"\n   <em>\n    Advertise.com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768365\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/974/#p980\">\n    616 F.3d at 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hotels.com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048403\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/573/1300/#p1304\">\n    573 F.3d at 1304-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (considering a consumer survey regarding the public's understanding of HOTELS.COM even though it determined that \"hotels\" and \".com\" were independently generic and that the combination did not produce new meaning). While these courts have generally found the resulting composite of adding \".com\" to certain SLDs to be generic,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   they have nonetheless acknowledged that on rare occasions such marks may be non-generic. Here, the district court did not err in determining that this case presents one such rare occasion where the record evidence supported a finding that the USPTO failed to meet its burden of proving that the public primarily understood BOOKING.COM to refer to the genus of online hotel reservation services, rather than the company or brand itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We are not unsympathetic to the USPTO's concerns that granting trademark protection over BOOKING.COM may prevent other companies\n   from using the mark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    OBX-Stock, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3361250\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/558/334/#p339\">\n    558 F.3d at 339-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting trademark law's twin concerns). However, these concerns are assuaged by two considerations. First, because trademarks only protect the relevant service-here, the district court granted protection as to hotel reservation services but not travel agency services-protection over BOOKING.COM would not necessarily preclude another company from using, for example, carbooking.com or flightbooking.com.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the purported overbreadth of the mark can be addressed in proceedings regarding the scope of the trademark's protection. To enforce a mark, a plaintiff must prove in a trademark infringement suit that there is a \"likelihood of confusion\"-that is, whether \"the defendant's actual practice is likely to produce confusion in the minds of consumers about the origin of the goods or services in question.\"\n   <em>\n    George &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034111\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/383/#p393\">\n    575 F.3d at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    Pizzeria Uno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"644286\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/747/1522/#p1533\">\n    747 F.2d at 1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Given that domain names are unique by nature and that the public may understand a domain name as indicating a single site, it may be more difficult for domain name plaintiffs to demonstrate a likelihood of confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In sum, adding \".com\" to an SLD can result in a non-generic, descriptive mark upon a showing of primary significance to the relevant public. This is one such case. Based on the record before it, the district court properly found that the USPTO did not meet its burden of proving that \"booking.com\" is generic. We therefore affirm the court's finding that BOOKING.COM is descriptive. Because the USPTO does not challenge the district court's finding that BOOKING.COM has acquired secondary meaning where the mark is deemed descriptive, we affirm the district court's partial grant of summary judgment finding that BOOKING.COM is protectable as a trademark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We turn now to Booking.com's contention that it should not be required to pay the USPTO's attorneys fees under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201071\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3).

Because trademark law does not protect generic terms, an online business, like Booking.com, has two options in choosing its domain name. On the one hand, it can choose to operate under a generic domain\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that describes the nature of the services it offers, and thereby attract the wealth of customers who simply search the web for that service. However, in electing that benefit, the entity accepts a trade-off. It must forego the ability to exclude competitors from using close variants of its domain name. On the other hand, the entity can choose to operate under a non-generic domain name-and thereby potentially limit, at least before it has built consumer awareness of its branding, the universe of potential customers who will find its business. Trademark law affords an entity that selects this latter option a special benefit. It can bar competitors from trading on any goodwill and recognition it generates in its domain name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Booking.com chose the former approach-to operate under a generic domain name and forego the ability to exclude competitors from using close variants of its domain name. But in the face of recognizing that \"booking\" is a generic term, the district court creatively decided that combining the generic term \"booking\" with the generic top-level domain \".com\" rendered it non-generic. In doing so, the district court's judgment-which the majority opinion concedes was grounded in legal error, but nonetheless declines to set aside-allows Booking.com to have its cake and eat it too. Booking.com gets to operate under a domain that merely describes the nature of its business\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   exclude its competitors from doing the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Booking.com maintains that such a result is warranted to prevent \"unscrupulous competitors [from] prey[ing] on its millions of loyal consumers,\" Appellee's Br. at 38. But to the extent Booking.com fears that its competitors are using the terms \"booking\" and \".com\" in ways that might confuse its customers, \"this is the peril of attempting to build a brand around a generic term.\"\n   <em>\n    Advertise.com, Inc. v.

For instance, a\n   website cataloguing and discussing romantic comedy movies of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s called \"rom.com\" might expand upon the ordinary meaning of the Top Level Domain, as it would both describe the commercial nature of the website, as well as convey the subject matter of the website.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The tennis.net and rom.com examples are readily distinguishable from the instant case. The district court did not find-nor has Booking.com ever argued-that the combination of \"booking\"-a generic term-and \".com\" amounts to a \"witty double entendre\" that expands the ordinary meanings of the proposed mark's component parts. Rather, BOOKING.COM is a run-of-the-mill combination of a generic term with a Top Level Domain that creates a composite mark concerning the subject or business encompassed by the generic term-precisely the type of mark that the courts in\n   <em>\n    Hotels.com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Reed Elsevier Properties\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    1800Mattress.com\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Advertise.com\n   </em>\n   found did not amount to the \"rare circumstance\" that warranted affording the domain name trademark protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   BOOKING.COM's mark differs substantially from the types of proposed marks fitting into the \"rare circumstances\" in which a generic Secondary Level Domain and a Top Level Domain are protectable. This provides further evidence that the district court's incorrect legal test tainted its ultimate factual determination. Because the district court erroneously believed that marks combining a generic Secondary Level Domain and Top Level Domain are presumptively protectable, it never examined-as it should have-whether BOOKING.COM amounted to one of the \"rare circumstances\" when such marks are protectable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The district court's incorrect legal test-the application of which my colleagues leave in place-upsets the careful balance the law has struck between assisting consumers to identify the source of goods and preserving the linguistic commons.

As the PTO argues, a grocery business called The Grocery Store would-and should-never receive trademark protection because the name is generic-regardless of whether consumers associated the name with a particular entity. However, under the district court's erroneous approach-the consequences of which the majority leaves in place-if enough consumers recognized an online grocery business called \"grocerystore.com,\" that business would be entitled to trademark protection. There is no basis in law or policy for drawing such a distinction.

Put simply, the majority opinion's judgment will directly disadvantage Booking.com's competitors by taking away their ability to use the term \"booking\" in their own website domain names. Indeed, any competitors that attempt to use the term \"booking\" will face the risk of a costly, protracted, and uncertain infringement lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Booking.com and the majority opinion assert that the potential harm to competitors-and therefore consumers-is minimal because: (1) the doctrine of descriptive fair use will prevent Booking.com from monopolizing the term; (2) the protection of BOOKING.COM extends only to\n   <em>\n    hotel\n   </em>\n   reservations, not to other reservation services; and (3) domain names are unique.

According to Booking.com, affording BOOKING.COM trademark protection will not adversely affect competition by depriving putative competitors from describing the nature of their business because such protection \"will have no effect on competitors' right to make descriptive fair use of the word 'Booking.com.' \" Appellee's Br. at 38. The district court agreed, noting that even if Booking.com were to successfully assert a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of trademark infringement by showing a likelihood of confusion between BOOKING.COM and a competitor's domain, the competitor could make use of the descriptive fair use doctrine to avoid liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   For several reasons, I fear that the doctrine of descriptive fair use will provide Booking.com's competitors cold comfort. I am not convinced that the descriptive fair use defense will provide significant protection to competitors using the term \"booking\" in their own domain names. As the Ninth Circuit has explained, \"granting trademark rights over a domain name composed of a generic term and a [Top Level Domain] grants the trademark holder rights over far more intellectual property than the domain name itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Advertise.com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768365\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/974/#p980\">\n    616 F.3d at 980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, notwithstanding the doctrine of descriptive fair use, a firm that obtains a trademark in a domain name that describes the service the firm provides, like Booking.com, may have the power \"to foreclose competitors from using a vast array of simple, easy to remember domain names and designations that describe [such] services.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768365\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/974/#p980\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Additionally, descriptive fair use is an affirmative defense, not an immunity from suit. Any online reservation business that chooses to include \"booking\" in its domain name will face the risk of defending an expensive infringement lawsuit. As a result, commercial competitors seeking to avoid litigation risk and expenses-even if they might ultimately prevail on descriptive fair use grounds-will be chilled from using the term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   My colleagues in the majority also emphasize that the district court awarded Booking.com protection for the mark\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   for Class 43 hotel services, not Class 39 travel agency services, meaning that \"protection over BOOKING.COM would not\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   preclude another company from using, for example, carbooking.com or flightbooking.com.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 187 (emphasis added).

In particular, I agree that\n    <em>\n     Shammas v.

Likewise, courts and commentators have long stated that a Top Level Domain is not protectable. For instance, the PTO has long stated that Top Level Domains \"generally serve no source-identifying function.\" TMEP \u00a7 1209.03(m) (5th ed. 2007). This position has been consistently held in federal courts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Advertise.com\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768365\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/974/#p980\">\n     616 F.3d at 978\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (finding that a Top Level Domain merely reflects an online commercial organization). Additionally, the leading treatise on trademark law has stated that a Top Level Domain has no ability to distinguish one source from another. 2 J. Thomas McCarthy,\n    <em>\n     McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 7:17.50 (5th ed. 2018) (\"The '.com' portion of the domain name has no trademark significance and is essentially the generic locator for all names in that top level domain.\"). In this way, a Top Level Domain is similar to other common web address components, such as \"http://www.\" and \".html.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768365\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/974/#p980\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Because all websites must contain some form of Top Level Domain, such as \".com\" or \".gov.,\" there is no unique source-identifying information. Similarly, in trademark infringement analyses, Top Level Domains have long been considered irrelevant to the strength of one's mark, as they only demonstrate,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , a website's commercial, governmental, or organizational nature.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Brookfield Commc'ns, Inc. v.

Although rom.com differs from tennis.net in that the Secondary Level Domain arguably is not a generic term, as \"rom\" is a shorthand reference for romantic, the domain name rom (dot) com is, as a composite term, both a generic descriptor and a \"witty\" play on that descriptor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Several hotel booking websites have domain names combining, in various ways, \"booking\" with \".com,\" including \"bookingcenter.com,\" \"ebookers.com,\" \"bookingwhiz.com,\" \"hotelbooking.com,\" \"bookit.com,\" and \"bookingbuddy.com.\" J.A. 337-39.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
