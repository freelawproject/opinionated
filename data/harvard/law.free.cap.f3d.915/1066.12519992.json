Saginaw is no different. Located in eastern Michigan, the city requires owners of vacant property to register their property with the city. The registration form says that owners must permit the city to enter their property if it \"becomes dangerous as defined by the City of Saginaw Dangerous Building Ordinance.\" R. 9-4 at 1. Several\n   owners of vacant property refused to register. Claiming they had no obligation to consent to unconstitutional searches of their property, they filed this lawsuit. Because the registration form and the ordinance, as implemented by the city, ask for something that the Fourth (and Fourteenth) Amendment already allows-a warrantless search of a building found to be dangerous-we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Rebekah C. Benjamin Trust owns vacant properties in Saginaw. James Benjamin is its trustee. The Saginaw law, formally known as the Unsupervised Properties Ordinance, requires owners of vacant properties to register with the city clerk. Saginaw, Mich., Code of Ordinances \u00a7 151.099(B) (2016). The registration form requires the property owner to \"agree that in the event my property becomes dangerous as defined by the City of Saginaw Dangerous Building Ordinance, State Law, or the City of Saginaw Housing Code, I give permission for the City, its agents, employees, or representatives, to enter and board the premises or do whatever necessary to make the property secure and safe.\" R. 9-4 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The city fined the trust for breaching the registration requirement. Saginaw, Mich., Code of Ordinances \u00a7 151.100(B). Benjamin sued John Stemple, Saginaw's chief inspector, and Janet Santos, the city clerk, on behalf of a potential class of owners of vacant properties for violating the owners' rights under the Fourth Amendment by imposing an unconstitutional condition on registration. Benjamin added a request for a preliminary injunction for good measure. Bobby and Sylvia Jones, whose trust also owns unoccupied property in Saginaw, intervened in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The district court granted the city officials' motion to dismiss the complaint and denied the motion for a preliminary injunction. The property owners appealed each ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   What looks like a complex unconstitutional conditions claim is a straightforward Fourth Amendment claim. The property owners refused to sign the registration form on the ground that it requires them to consent to a future search of their unoccupied properties if the city finds them dangerous. In this way, they say, the ordinance imposes an unconstitutional condition on registering their properties. But that argument works, or at least begins to work, only if the required consent surrenders cognizable Fourth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Think of it this way. What if the city, as a condition of registering unoccupied properties, had asked the owners to consent in the future to submit to a stop and frisk if there were reasonable suspicion they had committed a crime and were armed and dangerous,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

No one would tarry long over an unconstitutional conditions claim in these settings. That's because the consent form asked them to waive rights they do not have, as law enforcement officers may do each of these things with or without consent. In the absence of a constitutional right to resist searches in each of these settings, the consent form becomes a run-of-the-mine exercise of the city's police power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   What matters, then, is whether the property owners have a cognizable Fourth Amendment right to resist warrantless searches premised on a finding that their properties have become dangerous.

Under the ordinance, a building is not dangerous until a formal administrative process establishes that to be the case. The process kicks off when someone reports to the chief inspector that a building is unsafe or damaged. Saginaw, Mich., Code of Ordinances \u00a7 151.113.

They first challenge this construction of the registration form. As they read it, the form allows the city to enter property immediately after the chief inspector initially concludes that the building is dangerous. But the ordinance explains that the inspector's finding that a building is dangerous is a preliminary determination. Until the hearing officer finally decides that \"the building is a dangerous building,\" it is not, and thus no one may enter the property under the form. Saginaw, Mich., Code of Ordinances \u00a7 151.115(H).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   That can't be, the property owners respond; else the grant of permission would add nothing beyond what is already in the ordinance. Exactly so. Nor is this unusual. There's nothing surprising about a municipality in our litigious age that tries to minimize the risk of a lawsuit-even if it cannot eliminate that risk,\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   -by alerting property owners to their legal responsibilities and asking the owners to accept them ahead of time.

One, they say, is that the ordinance does not require the inspector to obtain a judicial warrant. But administrative searches like this one fall into an \"exception to the warrant requirement,\"\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590955\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2443/#p2452\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and Saginaw's adversarial hearing system at any rate provides far more protection to the property and privacy rights of owners than a one-sided warrant process ever could. Another problem, they say, is that the ordinance fails to provide neutral criteria to guide the hearing officer's decision making. But\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   says that the Fourth Amendment requires only \"precompliance review before a neutral decisionmaker.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590955\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2443/#p2452\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A third problem, they say, is that the ordinance does not authorize the hearing officer to issue a subpoena or other document to the inspector that explicitly permits him to search the owner's property. But\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   acknowledges that \"administrative subpoenas are only one way in which an opportunity for precompliance review can be made available.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590955\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2443/#p2452\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590955\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2443/#p2452\">\n    at 2454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Once the hearing officer determines that a building is dangerous, he issues an order directing the property owner to fix the problem. Saginaw, Mich., Code of Ordinances \u00a7 151.115(H). If the owner fails to comply, the ordinance directs the inspector to \"take all necessary action to enforce the order,\" and gives the owner a right to appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590955\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2443/#p2452\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 151.117(C), 151.118. The hearing process and the ordinance together put the property owner on notice that the inspector will enter his property to remediate the dangerous condition, making any additional documentary requirement superfluous. All in all, the hearing process provides adequate precompliance review for an administrative search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Because the district court properly dismissed the owners' complaint for failure to state a claim, it follows that it properly rejected the motion for a preliminary injunction. Failure of the one establishes dim prospects of success for the other.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGirr v.
