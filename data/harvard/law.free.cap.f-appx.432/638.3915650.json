The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to concurrent prison terms of 135 months on Counts 1-3 and 120 months on Count 4, and 8 years of supervised release. Finding that by these offenses Tiger had violated the terms of the supervised release he was already serving, the court also revoked the earlier imposed supervised release and sentenced him to 24 months in prison, to be served consecutively to the 135-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-23\">In these consolidated appeals, Tiger\u2019s counsel moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Tiger moved to have new counsel appointed. After we reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we granted counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, granted Tiger\u2019s motion for appointment of new counsel, and directed the parties to brief the issue of whether there was sufficient evidence to support the drug-conspiracy conviction. After careful review of the arguments advanced by both parties, and viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict and accepting all reasonable inferences that support the verdict, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the drug-conspiracy conviction. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number><em>States v.
