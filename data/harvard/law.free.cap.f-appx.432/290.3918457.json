He asserts on appeal that the district court erred in imposing a 16-level sentencing enhancement pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i) because the government failed to prove that a New York district court imposed a sentence in excess of 13 months for his prior conviction for conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute marijuana. The abuse-of-discretion standard applies to our review of sentencing decisions. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Charon, </em>442 F.3d 881, 887 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We have reviewed the record, including the documents obtained from the New York court regarding Jackson\u2019s sentencing for the prior offenses. These records show that Jackson\u2019s previous sentence was based on the marijuana conviction, rather than the racketeering conviction for which he was sentenced at the same time. Thus, the district court\u2019s finding that the 33-month sentence applied to the marijuana conviction \u201cis plausible in light of the record read as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Valdez, </em>453 F.3d 252, 262 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As a result, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the sentencing enhancement, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 46, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
