Ivonne Galdames, Jacqueline Gal-dames, and Guillermo Osorio (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) sued Defendants under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), alleging that they were not compensated for overtime work completed between 2005 and 2007. They sought just under $22,000. The district court granted Plaintiffs\u2019 partial summary judgment and then conducted a jury trial on the remaining issues. The jury awarded Plaintiffs approximately $14,000 in damages and found that Defendants either knowingly violated the FLSA or showed reckless indifference to the law. Based on the jury\u2019s latter finding, the district court awarded liquidated damages, resulting in an award of more than $28,000 for Plaintiffs. The district court also awarded Plaintiffs more than $100,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees as prevailing plaintiffs. After review of the extensive record and Defendants\u2019 brief, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-14\">The FLSA requires covered \u201cemployers\u201d to pay overtime wages once \u201cemployees\u201d exceed forty hours of work in a given week. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a). Except for the explicit exceptions within the statute, \u201cthe term \u2018employee\u2019 means any individual employed by an employer.\u201d \u00a7 203(e)(1). Either individual coverage or enterprise coverage can trigger the FLSA, but here we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>are only concerned with enterprise coverage. <em>Polycarpe v. E &amp; S Landscaping Serv., Inc., </em>616 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam). Enterprise coverage is triggered if an employer (1) \u201chas employees engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, or [] has employees handling, selling, or otherwise working on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for commerce by any person\u201d and (2) has at least $500,000 of \u201cannual gross volume of sales made or business done.\u201d \u00a7 203(s)(l)(A). The FLSA defines \u201ccommerce\u201d as \u201ctrade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or communication among the several States or between any State and any place outside thereof.\u201d \u00a7 203(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Defendants first contend that the district court committed reversible error in failing to grant their post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50. They believe that Plaintiffs are not \u201cemployees\u201d under the FLSA because they are illegal aliens. Defendants argue, <em>inter alia, </em>that we should ignore binding, on-point precedent, <em>Patel v. Quality Inn South, </em>846 F.2d 700 (11th Cir.1988).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They believe this is appropriate because (1) <em>Patel </em>conflicts with <em>Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>535 U.S. 137, 122 S.Ct. 1275, 152 L.Ed.2d 271 (2002), and (2) it was decided \u201cmore than twenty (20) years ago, where [sic] the problems with illegal immigration and employment of illegal immigrant workers had not reached the exceptional proportions that they are at now in 2011....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">Earlier holdings by panels of this Court are binding \u201cunless and until they are clearly overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court. While an intervening decision of the Supreme Court can overrule the decision of a prior panel of our court, the Supreme Court decision must be clearly on point.\u201d <em>Randall v. Scott, </em>610 F.3d 701, 707 (11th Cir.2010) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). A panel of this Court has previously determined that illegal aliens are covered \u201cemployees\u201d under the FLSA. <em>Patel, </em>846 F.2d at 706 (\u201cIn short, we hold that undocumented workers are \u2018employees\u2019 within the meaning of the FLSA....\u201d). Specifically, we concluded, after passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (\u201cIRCA\u201d), that illegal aliens were covered \u201cemployees\u201d under the FLSA and could sue for unpaid wages. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Hoffman Plastic </em>ruled that the National Labor Relations Board could not award backpay \u2014 for work never performed \u2014 to an illegal alien under the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d) after Congress passed the IRCA. 535 U.S. at 147-49, 122 S.Ct. 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number><em>Hoffman Plastic </em>is not \u201cclearly on point\u201d with <em>Patel. </em>First, <em>Patel </em>ruled on the FLSA and <em>Hoffman Plastic </em>ruled on the NLRA. Furthermore, in <em>Patel, </em>the illegal alien was \u201cnot attempting to recover back pay for being unlawfully deprived of a job. Rather, he simply [sought] to recover unpaid minimum wages and overtime for work <em>already </em>performed.\u201d 846 F.2d at 705. Conversely, the illegal alien in <em>Hoffman Plastic </em>sought backpay for being unlawfully deprived of his job after engaging in union organizing activities. 535 U.S. at 140-41, 122 S.Ct. 1275. Based on these distinctions, <em>Hoffman Plastic </em>did not clearly overrule <em>Patel. </em>Accordingly, we reiterate that illegal aliens are \u201cemployees\u201d covered by the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">\n<em>B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Defendants next argue that the district court committed error when it granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to \u201centerprise coverage.\u201d First, Defendants contend that the court mistakenly concluded that Defendants\u2019 annual sales exceeded the $500,000 threshold established by \u00a7 203(s)(1)(A)(ii). Second, Defendants argue that the district court incorrectly decided that they met \u00a7 203(s)(1)(A)(i)\u2019s interstate commerce requirement. We review grants of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standard as the district court. <em>Fogade v. ENB Revocable Trust, </em>263 F.3d 1274, 1287 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">We conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment. First, as to annual gross revenue, Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged \u201c10. Based upon information and belief, at all times material to this complaint Defendants had an annual gross volume of sales or business done of not less than $500,000.00, exclusive of excise taxes at the retail which are separately stated, and at least two employees engaged in interstate commerce.\u201d Defendants\u2019 answer stated \u201c10. Defendants admit that the annual gross revenue exceeds $500,000 per year; all other allegations contained in paragraph nine [sic] are denied.\u201d We hold Defendants to that admission. <em>Cooper v. Meridian Yachts, Ltd., </em>575 F.3d 1151, 1177-78 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201c[T]he general rule [is] that a party is bound by the admissions in his pleadings. Indeed, facts judicially admitted are facts established not only beyond the need of evidence to prove them, but beyond the power of evidence to controvert them.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">Second, after review of the entire record, we conclude that Defendants\u2019 satisfied \u00a7 203(s)(1)(A)(i)\u2019s interstate commerce requirement. Defendants seem to be attempting to resurrect the so-called \u201ccoming to rest\u201d doctrine, which we have explicitly rejected. <em>Polycarpe, </em>616 F.3d at 1221. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment on this issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">As prevailing parties, Plaintiffs filed a motion seeking approximately $120,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The district court eventually awarded $112,495. Defendants appeal that award, alleging (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for attorneys\u2019 fees was untimely, (2) the fees awarded were grossly excessive, and (3) any fee award should have been reduced because Plaintiffs only partially succeeded in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The district court entered final judgment on July 31, 2009. Defendants filed a number of timely post-trial motions, including, <em>inter alia, </em>a motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59. The district court did not rule on these motions until March 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">On October 8, 2009 \u2014 68 days after the district court entered judgment but before six months before it adjudicated post-trial motions \u2014 Plaintiffs moved for attorneys\u2019 fees. As prevailing parties, they requested more than $120,000 in fees and costs. Three attorneys worked on the case \u2014 Mr. Marban, Mr. Valaquez, and Mr. Diaz \u2014 and each submitted the number of hours worked and their requested hourly fee: $350, $300, and $295, respectively. The magistrate judge recommended that Plaintiffs be awarded $107,810 in attorneys\u2019 fees and $4,685 in costs. The district court adopted that recommendation and filed an order requiring Defendants to pay $112,495.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">\n<em>B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">Defendants first argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for attorneys\u2019 fees was untimely. At the relevant time, the local rules of the Southern District of Florida required that an attorneys\u2019 fees motion \u201cbe filed and served within thirty days of entry of a Final Judgment or other appealable order that gives rise to attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d S.D. Fla. Rule 7.3(A)(vii). It is undisputed that Plaintiffs filed their motion 68 days after the district court entered judgment. Accordingly, Defendants insist the motion is untimely and no fees should be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">A litigant\u2019s failure to file a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees within the prescribed period can result in denial of that motion. <em>See Clark v. Hous. Auth. of Alma, </em>971 F.2d 723, 727 (11th Cir.1992). Certain post-trial motions, however, \u201coperate[] to suspend the finality of the district court\u2019s judgment \u2018pending the court\u2019s further determination whether the judgment should be modified so as to alter its adjudication of the rights of the parties.\u2019\u201d <em>Members First Fed. Credit Union v. Members First Credit Union of Fla., </em>244 F.3d 806, 807 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 267, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978)) (holding that a Rule 59 motion to alter or amend judgment effectively tolls the time requirement for filing a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees). Therefore, judgments do not actually become \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes of an attorneys\u2019 fees motion until certain post-trial motions are adjudicated. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[T]he finality of a judgment is effectively postponed by the timely filing of a motion under Rule 59....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">While it is uncontested that Plaintiffs moved for attorneys\u2019 fees 68 days after the district court entered judgment, Defendants fail to appreciate that their timely Rule 59 motion extended Plaintiffs\u2019 deadline for requesting attorneys\u2019 fees. In other words, Plaintiffs could have filed a timely motion for attorneys\u2019 fees up to 30 days after the district court ruled on Defendants\u2019 new trial motion. As Plaintiffs filed their motion before the court\u2019s March 2010 denial of defendant\u2019s post-trial motion, it was necessarily timely. Accordingly, we reject Defendants\u2019 procedural challenge to the attorneys\u2019 fees award and address their substantive attacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">\n<em>C.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">Defendants next argue that the district court\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees award was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>grossly excessive. They allege that (1) the number of hours billed was excessive because it was double that of defense counsel, (2) the hourly rates sought are excessive, (3) the district court stated on the record \u2014 before trial \u2014 that it would never award $100,000 in fees for Plaintiffs\u2019 counsels\u2019 work to that point, and (4) Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel should have been estopped from receiving fees because they have taken inconsistent positions in unrelated FLSA litigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">We review the distinct court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees for an abuse of discretion, closely analyzing any legal conclusions reached during the fee determination. <em>Gray v. Lockheed Aeronautical Sys. Co., </em>125 F.3d 1387, 1389 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs if the judge fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making the determination, or bases an award upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>In re Red Carpet Corp. of Panama City Beach, </em>902 F.2d 883, 890 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cAlthough a district court has wide discretion in performing these calculations, the court\u2019s order on attorney fees must allow meaningful review \u2014 the district court must articulate the decisions it made, give principled reasons for those decisions, and show its calculation.\u201d <em>Am. Civil Liberties Union of Ga. v. Barnes, </em>168 F.3d 423, 427 (11th Cir.1999) (alterations omitted) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Generally, a prevailing plaintiff in a FLSA case is entitled to a reasonable award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b); <em>Sahyers v. Prugh, Holliday &amp; Karatinos, P.L., </em>560 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2009). Calculation of attorneys\u2019 fees involves multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended in litigating the claim and the customary fee charged for similar legal services in the relevant community (\u201clodestar amount\u201d). <em>See Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). A properly calculated lodestar amount \u201cis itself strongly presumed to be reasonable.\u201d <em>Resolution Trust Corp. v. Hallmark Builders, Inc., </em>996 F.2d 1144, 1150 (11th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (\u201cConsequently, the courts have severely limited the instances in which a lawfully found lodestar amount may be adjusted to a higher or lower level.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">The first step in determining the proper lodestar amount is calculating the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation. Prevailing plaintiffs attorneys \u201cmust exercise their own billing judgment to exclude any hours that are \u2018excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1149 (quoting <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 434, 103 S.Ct. 1933). Attorneys may bill adversaries for only the same hours they would bill a client. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, <em>\u201ca court </em>may reduce excessive, redundant or otherwise unnecessary hours in the exercise of billing judgment.\u201d <em>Perkins v. Mobile Hous. Bd., </em>847 F.2d 735, 738 (11th Cir.1988) (emphasis added). If the court concludes that the number of claimed hours is excessive, it may engage in \u201can across-the-board cut,\u201d so long as it provides adequate explanation for the decrease. <em>Bivins v. Wrap it Up, Inc., </em>548 F.3d 1348, 1350 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">Here, the magistrate judge began his hours-expended analysis by noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyjH\">[f]ollowing careful review of the submitted time records, the undersigned finds that most, but not all, of counsels\u2019 time entries are detailed, well documented and reflect a reasonable amount of time devoted to each listed task. In so finding, the undersigned has closely scruti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>nized the time entries specifically challenged by defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The magistrate judge spent the next three pages reviewing the reasonableness of the hours presented. Notably, he reduced the fees for Mr. Marban by 20% because \u201che describe[d] the work performed on numerous tasks with only one corresponding time entry.\u201d Then, in considering Mr. Marban\u2019s hours, the magistrate judge considered the same arguments raised here\u2014 such as taking excessive time to calculate damages, draft jury instructions, and generally familiarize himself with the case. Ultimately, the magistrate judge concluded that, after the 20% reduction, the number of hours Mr. Marban charged was reasonable under the circumstances. As to the other two attorneys, the magistrate judge concluded that their hours were reasonable because they clearly reflected the services performed and a reasonable number of hours in completing each. In conclusion, he stated that \u201c[w]hile [the attorneys\u2019 fees award] exceeds plaintiffs\u2019 cumulative award, <em>the undersigned, notes that excessive hours were expended by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel due to defendants\u2019 unnecessary litigation techniques which prolonged this litigation </em>.... \u201d (emphasis added). After review, we cannot conclude that the magistrate\u2019s recommendation, as adopted by the district court, demonstrated any abuse of discretion in determining reasonable hours expended.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Reasonable hourly rates are determined by comparing attorneys\u2019 requested rate with the \u201cprevailing market rates in the relevant community.\u201d <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 895, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984). The party applying for fees bears the burden of establishing the reasonableness of the proffered rate. <em>Duckworth v. Whisenant, </em>97 F.3d 1393, 1396 (11th Cir.1996) (per curiam). While previous hourly rate awards are not given controlling weight, they do provide some insight. <em>See Dillard v. City of Greensboro, </em>213 F.3d 1347, 1354-55 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam). They do not, however, trump the attorney\u2019s actual billing rate to other paying clients. <em>Id. </em>at 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Here, Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys submitted an affidavit from a board certified labor and employment law attorney, who concluded that the hourly rate for each of the attorneys was reasonable. Furthermore, Plaintiffs cited other district court cases awarding two of Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys the exact fees sought in this case. The magistrate judge cited these facts and noted that his \u201cfamiliarity with such litigation and attorney\u2019s fees in general\u201d supported the hourly rates requested by Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys. Defendants complain that Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys provided no evidence of their ordinary hourly rate, and they instead suggest that $100 per hour would be appropriate. However, Defendants provide no evidence for that hourly rate and only attack the credibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 expert by noting that he litigates similar cases. Nothing in Defendants\u2019 brief points to any error that could be considered an abuse of discretion in determining the appropriate hourly rate for Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">As we have determined that the number of hours expended and the hourly rates are appropriate, a strong presumption of reasonableness applies. <em>See Resolution Trust Corp., </em>996 F.2d at 1150. After review, we do not believe Defendants have demonstrated the district court abused its discretion in reaching the ultimate fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">\n<em>D.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">Finally, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs \u201cdid not achieve total success, as they received only 63.88% of the monies that they sought. Accordingly, the lodestar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>should have been reduced by at least that amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 success, or lack thereof, is an important consideration and can result in a conclusion that the lodestar amount must be reduced. <em>See Dillard, </em>213 F.3d at 1354-55. Here, however, Plaintiffs were successful on their sole claim and received a significant portion of the damages sought. After liquidated damages were accessed, Plaintiffs received more than the overtime salary they originally requested. As such, we do not think the district court abused its discretion in its ultimate determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Based on the foregoing discussion, we affirm the district court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-8\">. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to participate in oral argument is denied as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b827-7\">. Defendants present a number of other arguments under this heading as well. First, they believe a number of so-called \"practical and policy-based\u201d reasons justify the conclusion that illegal aliens are not covered by the FLSA. For example, coverage is not warranted because \"[t]he Plaintiffs, quite simply, are fugitives from justice, and should be dealt with the Court [sic] in that manner....\u201d Second, Defendants argue that the doctrine of <em>in pari delicto </em>applies and bars recovery since Plaintiffs, as illegal aliens, have entered the country in violation of the law and \"will tend to lie because they have no fear.\u201d Third, Defendants allege (1) that Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel committed a \u201cserious felony\u201d by representing illegal aliens and (2) that allowing illegal immigrants to bring suit \"makes everyone in the courtroom (if the appropriate action is not taken) complicit with assisting a known illegal immigrant because two lawyers, the Judge, and the Marshall's service will all know that Plaintiffs are fugitives from justice. ...\u201d As none of these arguments matter in light of <em>Patel, </em>we decline to discuss them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b828-8\">. Defendants raise two additional arguments regarding die trial proceedings. First, they argue that the district court erred in concluding that plaintiff Osorio did not qualify for the \"executive exemption\u201d to the FLSA. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.100. Second, Defendants contend that the district court abused its discretion by dedining to allow Defendants (1) to impeach Plaintiffs\u2019 credibility by referencing their status as illegal aliens, and (2) to call a rebuttal witness to impeach Plaintiffs. After review of Defendants\u2019 brief and the record, we conclude these claims have no merit and do not warrant further discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b830-6\">.
