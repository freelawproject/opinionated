The BIA deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>mined that Archaga-Ponce was not eligible for \u2022withholding of removal because she failed to demonstrate a nexus between any harm that she suffered or might suffer and a statutorily protected ground. Because substantial evidence supports that determination, we deny Archaga-Ponce\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Where the BIA issues its own opinion, we review only that opinion, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). We review the BIA\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>Under substantial evidence review, we consider \u201c \u2018the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351 (quoting <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc)). Therefore, we will reverse the agency\u2019s findings only if the evidence compels us to do so. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">\u201cTo obtain withholding of removal, an applicant must establish that her \u2018life or freedom would be threatened in [her country of removal] because of [her] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006) (second alteration in original) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A)). An applicant may satisfy her burden of proof in either of two ways: (1) by establishing past persecution in her country based on a protected ground; or (2) by establishing that it is more likely than not that she would be persecuted on account of a protected ground upon removal to that country. <em>Id. </em>A \u201cparticular social group\u201d refers to persons who share a common, immutable characteristic \u201cthat the members of the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\u201d <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1193, 1196 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted) (discussing and adopting the BIA\u2019s definition of \u201cparticular social group\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">Archaga-Ponce is a victim of domestic violence, and she claims that she and victims like her constitute a particular social group. She argues membership in this social group, in turn, establishes the required nexus between the harm she suffered or might suffer and a statutorily protected ground, such that withholding of removal is appropriate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we agree with the BIA\u2019s determination to the contrary and conclude that substantial evidence supported its order dismissing Archaga-Ponce\u2019s appeal. Accordingly, we deny her petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b965-7\">. On appeal, Archaga-Ponce does not contest the BIA\u2019s conclusion that her application for asylum was time-barred, nor she does dispute the denial of Convention Against Torture relief; therefore, she has abandoned those claims. <em>See Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1173 (11th Cir.2008). Even if Archaga-Ponce had preserved her asylum claim, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s conclusion that her untimely application for asylum was not excused. <em>See Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"Auv\">Additionally, although Archaga-Ponce focuses primarily on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination in her brief, we decline to review that finding because the BIA did not review it. <em>See Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007) (stating that this Court reviews only the BIA's findings and conclusions except those expressly adopted from the IJ\u2019s order). Similarly, we decline to address Archaga-Ponce's claim that she was harmed on account of her political opinion because she did not raised it before the IJ. <em>See Galindo-Del Valle v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>213 F.3d 594, 599 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam), <em>superseded on other grounds by statute as stated in, Balogun v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>425 F.3d 1356, 1359 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also In re R-S-H, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 629, 638 (B.I.A.2003) (holding an alien \"waived his opportunity to pursue [an] issue on appeal\u201d by not raising the issue at the hearing before the IJ).</p>\n<p id=\"A4-H\">Finally, we will not address ArchagaPonce\u2019s claim that the immigration proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>ings violated her right to due process, or her passing statement that her brother was killed in the United States and that his killers are now in Honduras, because these assertions are devoid of any argument and, as such, are insufficient to be considered on appeal. <em>See Lapaix v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 1138, 1145 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
