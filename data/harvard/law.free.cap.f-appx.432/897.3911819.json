In August 1997 after a jury convicted Edwards of possession and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base, the district court sentenced Edwards to life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and \u00a7 851 based on two prior Florida felony convictions. One of the prior convictions was for possession of cocaine, which Florida classified as a felony that was punishable by up to five years imprisonment. This Court affirmed Edwards\u2019 conviction and sentence in December 1998. <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>167 F.3d 539 (11th Cir.1998) (unpublished table decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-20\">In 2000 Edwards filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion attacking his sentence based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and a <em>Brady </em>violation. The district court entered an order denying his \u00a7 2255 motion in April 2003, and also denied Edwards\u2019 motion for a certificate of appealability for that order. In January 2006 Edwards filed a second 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion again attacking his sentence, but this time based on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>denied that motion in April 2006, and Edwards did not appeal. On April 4, 2007, Edwards filed a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The district court dismissed that motion on December 22, 2009, and this is Edwards\u2019 appeal from that dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Edwards contends that the district court erred in finding that he was ineligible for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause. He argues that three Supreme Court decisions establish that the district court erred by using his prior Florida state felony conviction for simple possession of cocaine to enhance his sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) because simple possession is not a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). In almost all cases, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). Under very limited circumstances, the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause may permit a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">There is no precedent in this circuit for applying the savings clause to sentence claims. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244-45. Since it does not affect the result, we will assume for purposes of this case only that the savings clause does extend to sentence claims in some circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">The first <em>Wofford </em>requirement a petitioner must meet in order to seek relief under \u00a7 2241 through \u00a7 2255(e) is that his \u201cclaim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision.\u201d <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244. The Supreme Court decision must be directly on point, because the savings clause does not apply if the petitioner \u201cis actually seeking ... an extension of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Flint v. Jordan, </em>514 F.3d 1165, 1167 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">Setting aside the question of retroactivity, Edwards has not presented a Supreme Court decision that directly applies to his claim. Two of the Supreme Court decisions on which Edwards relies, <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006) and <em>Salinas v. United States, </em>547 U.S. 188, 126 S.Ct. 1675, 164 L.Ed.2d 364 (2006), are not directly on point and would have to be extended to cover his case. The <em>Lopez </em>and <em>Salinas </em>decisions do not interpret the language of \u00a7 841 and could only apply to a conviction under that statute by analogy. <em>See Lopez, </em>549 U.S. at 52-53, 127 S.Ct. at 629 (interpreting \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act); <em>Salinas, </em>547 U.S. at 188, 126 S.Ct. at 1675 (interpreting \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)). More than analogous authority is required to satisfy the <em>Wofford </em>test. <em>See Flint, </em>514 F.3d at 1167.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">The other Supreme Court decision Edwards relies on, <em>Burgess v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 124, 128 S.Ct. 1572, 1577, 170 L.Ed.2d 478 (2008), involves \u00a7 841, but it does not support his argument that Florida\u2019s felony statute for simple possession of cocaine is a not a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d under \u00a7 841. <em>See id. </em>at 129, 128 S.Ct. at 1577 (holding that a South Carolina statute prohibiting simple possession of cocaine, which identified the offense as a misdemeanor, was a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d despite South Carolina\u2019s label because it was punishable by more than one year in prison). The holding in <em>Burgess </em>does not support Edwards\u2019 claim that Florida\u2019s felony simple possession statute, which is punishable by up to five years in prison, does not fit within the definition of \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d under \u00a7 841. <em>See id. </em>Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>Edwards has failed to present a Supreme Court decision that directly applies to his claim for habeas relief, we need not address whether any of the other <em>Wofford </em>requirements have been met. Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
