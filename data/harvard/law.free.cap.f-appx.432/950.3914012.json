On appeal, Jordan argues the district court\u2019s elevation of his sentence to the statutory maximum of 120 months was unreasonable. The district court imposed the statutory maximum based on an upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(a), and stated it would have imposed the same sentence under an upward variance. We affirm Jordan\u2019s sentence on the basis of an upward departure, and thus need not decide whether a variance was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(3), a district court may depart upward \u201cin an exceptional case, even though the circumstance that forms the basis for the departure is taken into consideration in determining the guideline range, if the court determines that such circumstance is present in the offense to a degree substantially in excess of ... that which ordinarily is involved in that kind of offense.\u201d A departure may also \u201cbe warranted in the exceptional case in which there is present a circumstance that the Commission has not identified in the guidelines but that nevertheless is relevant to determining the appropriate sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">We evaluate a district court\u2019s upward departure from the guidelines range using a three-step approach. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>78 F.3d 507, 509-10 (11th Cir.1996). \u201cFirst, we review de novo the decision as to whether the guidelines adequately consider a particular factor. Second, if the factor was not adequately considered, we examine whether consideration of this factor is consistent with the goals of the Sentencing Guidelines. Finally, we review the departure for reasonableness.\u201d Id. at 510 (internal citations omitted). \u201cWhen a sentencing court departs from the Guidelines, a reviewing court determines the reasonableness of the departure in light of the factors to be considered in imposing a sentence, as stated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, and the reasons the district court provided for departing from the .Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>187 F.3d 1316, 1322-23 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">The district court did not err in departing upward to the statutory maximum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, nothing in the guidelines contem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>plated the particular factor relied on by the district court \u2014 concealment of Jordan\u2019s membership in the military and his participation in a massacre to fraudulently obtain United States citizenship. As the district court explained, the case was \u201cwell beyond the heartland of the applicable guidelines,\u201d because \u201ca case with these particular facts is virtually unprecedented.\u201d <em>See Melvin, </em>187 F.3d at 1320 (\u201c[District courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts in determining whether a case is outside the heartland, and thus their decisions are entitled to substantial deference.\u201d). Second, \u201cconsideration of this factor is consistent with the goals of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>78 F.3d at 510.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have explained that upward departures under \u00a7 5K2.0(a) \u201care allowed for acts of misconduct not resulting in conviction, as long as those acts, whether or not relevant conduct in the section 1B1.3 sense, relate meaningfully to the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>419 F.3d 1189, 1193 n. 4 (11th Cir.2005) (citation and emphasis omitted). By concealing his role in the murders, Jordan was able to fraudulently obtain United States citizenship and a virtual safe-haven. Third, the upward departure was reasonable. <em>Melvin, </em>187 F.3d at 1322-23. The record indicates the court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining Jordan\u2019s sentence. The district court\u2019s explanation was also sufficient to support the degree of the departure, as it is difficult to imagine \u201cany more serious basis for immigration fraud than an individual\u2019s concealment of his prior participation in a mass murder of innocent civilians.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Because we conclude the district court did not err in imposing an upward departure to the statutory maximum, we affirm Jordan\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b975-15\">. Jordan does not argue that an upward departure of any degree was impermissible, and in fact seems to concede a 16-level upward departure would have been appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b976-5\">. \"A court should evaluate whether the departure is consistent with the goals of the guidelines, whether as part of the determination that the Commission adequately considered a factor, or as a second step.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
