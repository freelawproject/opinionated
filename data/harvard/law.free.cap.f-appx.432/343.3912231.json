We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Bowcock worked for Continental as a phot for 22 years. Pilots who fly for Continental are subject to a Collective Bargaining Agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d). On June 24, 2008, Continental offered pilots early retirement under a plan called the Early Retirement Window (\u201cERW\u201d). Bowcock was eligible for early retirement under the ERW. At this time, Bowcock also had an ongoing dispute with Continental regarding an alleged miscalculation of his pension. Bowcock alleges that Continental told him that he would have to abandon his pension claims against the company in order to take early retirement under the ERW. Bowcock alleges that he did not take early retirement under the plan because of Continental\u2019s representations. He instead retired a year later, on June 25, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">On July 10, 2010, Bowcock brought this suit in federal district court, alleging that Continental intentionally mislead him into believing that he would have to abandon his pension claims if he took early retirement. He claims that, by doing so, Continental breached its fiduciary duty under ERISA to provide \u201ctruthful and complete information in response to his question about an employee benefit plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Continental moved for dismissal of Bow-cock\u2019s claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing that the Railroad Labor Act (\u201cRLA\u201d), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-88, vested exclusive jurisdiction over \u201cminor disputes\u201d brought by airline employees such as Bowcock with regional adjustment boards. The district court granted Continental\u2019s motion, holding that Bowcock\u2019s fiduciary duty claim was a \u201cminor dispute\u201d involving the interpretation of a CBA and that Bowcock was an \u201cemployee\u201d under the RLA, notwithstanding the fact that he had retired before filing his claim. The court concluded that Bowcock\u2019s claim was subject to mandatory arbitration under the RLA and that it therefore lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. Bowcock appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">The sole issue on appeal before this court is whether Bowcock is an \u201cemployee\u201d under the RLA even though he was retired when he filed his federal lawsuit. We review a district court\u2019s rulings on questions of statutory interpretations <em>de novo. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Labuzan, </em>579 F.3d 533, 538 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">\u201cConcerned that labor disputes would lead to strikes bringing railroads to a halt, Congress enacted the ... RLA ... in 1926 to promote peaceful and efficient resolution of those disputes.\u201d <em>Union Pac. R.R. Co. v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng\u2019rs &amp; Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 584, 591, 175 L.Ed.2d 428 (2009). The RLA, as amended in 1934, requires railroad carriers and their union employees involved in \u201cminor\u201d labor disputes that cannot be resolved under CBA-provided grievance procedures to participate in mandatory arbitration before the National Railroad Adjustment Board (\u201cNRAB\u201d). <em>Id.; </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(i). An \u201cemployee\u201d is a \u201cperson in the service of a carrier (subject to its continuing authority to supervise and direct the manner of ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>dition of his service) who performs any work defined as that of an employee....\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151. A dispute is \u201cminor\u201d if \u201can existing agreement controls the controversy, i.e<em>., </em>the interpretation or application of a particular provision to a particular situation.\u201d <em>Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, Airline Dist. 146 v. Frontier Airlines, Inc., </em>664 F.2d 538, 540 (5th Cir.1981); <em>see Hawaiian Airlines v. Norris, </em>512 U.S. 246, 255-56, 114 S.Ct. 2239, 129 L.Ed.2d 203 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\u201cIn 1936, Congress extended the Railway Labor Act to cover the then small-but-growing air transportation industry.\u201d <em>Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists, AFL-CIO v. Cent. Airlines, Inc., </em>372 U.S. 682, 685, 83 S.Ct. 956, 10 L.Ed.2d 67 (1963). The 1936 amendment, codified at 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 181-88, made all of the provisions of the RLA applicable to the airlines with the exception of the section requiring mandatory arbitration before the NRAB.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Instead, Congress required air carriers and unions to create regional adjustment boards. <em>Id. </em>at 686, 83 S.Ct. 956; 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 184. Air carriers and their employees are required under the RLA to submit minor disputes that cannot be resolved under CBA-provided grievance procedures to these regional adjustment boards. <em>Id. </em>The mandatory arbitration language in \u00a7 184 is nearly identical to the mandatory arbitration language in \u00a7 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Central to our discussion is the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Day, </em>360 U.S. 548, 79 S.Ct. 1322, 3 L.Ed.2d 1422 (1959). In <em>Day, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether the NRAB had exclusive jurisdiction over a retired locomotive engineer\u2019s claim for additional pay. 360 U.S. at 551, 79 S.Ct. 1322. The Court held that it did, stating that \u201c[a]ll the considerations of legislative meaning and policy which have compelled the conclusion that an active employee must submit his claims to the Board, and may not resort to the courts in the first instance, are the same when the employee has retired and seeks compensation for work performed while he remained on active service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552, 79 S.Ct. 1322. The district court applied <em>Day </em>to Bowcock, holding that \u201cretired employees whose claims arose while they were \u2018in the service of a carrier\u2019 \u2014 whether it was an air carrier or a rail carrier \u2014 must arbitrate the claims pursuant to the requirements of the RLA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">Bowcock acknowledges the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Day </em>but raises three arguments as to why the district court erred in holding that he is an \u201cemployee\u201d under the RLA. His arguments fail to persuade. Bowcock first argues that <em>Day </em>is distinguishable because it involved arbitration with a rail carrier under \u00a7 153 and not arbitration with an air carrier under \u00a7 184. But \u00a7 181 explicitly extended \u201c[a]ll of the provisions of [the RLA] except section 153 ... to ... every common carrier by air....\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 181. This includes \u00a7 151, which contains the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d interpreted in <em>Day, </em>360 U.S. at 551, 79 S.Ct. 1322. Section 181 therefore plainly extends the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d used in the mandatory arbitration provisions of \u00a7 151 to the nearly identical mandatory arbitration provisions in \u00a7 184. It would defy logic to have the same statutory definition of \u201cemployee\u201d mean two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>different things based on whether the employer was a rail or air carrier. The fact that Bowcock worked for Continental and not a rail carrier is not a meaningful distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Bowcock next argues that <em>Day </em>is distinguishable because the plaintiff in <em>Day </em>filed his federal lawsuit before retiring, whereas Bowcock filed his claim after retiring. This is also not a meaningful distinction. <em>Day </em>explicitly concluded that \u201can active employee must submit his claims to the Board, and may not resort to the courts in the first instance,\u201d when \u201cthe employee has retired and seeks compensation for work performed while he remained on active service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552, 79 S.Ct. 1322. Otherwise, \u201c[r]etired employees would be allowed to bypass the Board specially constituted for hearing railroad disputes whenever they deemed it advantageous to do so, whereas all other employees would be required to present their claims to the Board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553, 79 S.Ct. 1322. Both the Court\u2019s holding and its reasoning apply with equal force regardless of whether the employee retires before or after he files his federal lawsuit, so long as he \u201cseeks compensation for work performed while he remained in active service.\u201d <em>See Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int'l v. Alaska Airlines, Inc., </em>735 F.2d 328, 329 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Bowcock finally argues that this court should not apply <em>Day </em>to airline retirees because <em>\u201cDay\u2019s </em>approach to statutory construction is outdated.\u201d In essence, Bow-cock argues that <em>Day </em>is wrongly decided and would be decided differently by today\u2019s Supreme Court. We are a strict <em>stare decisis </em>court. <em>FDIC v. Abraham, </em>137 F.3d 264, 268 (5th Cir.1998). The Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that \u201c[i]f a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.\u201d <em>Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., </em>490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989). Bowcock\u2019s assertion that \u201ctoday\u2019s Supreme Court\u201d would not adopt <em>Day\u2019s </em>reasoning is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">We therefore hold that, under <em>Pennsylvania v. Day, </em>retired employees of air carriers are \u201cemployees\u201d subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions of the RLA. In doing so, we are in accord with all other courts of appeal that have addressed this issue. <em>Bloemer v. Nw. Airlines, Inc., </em>401 F.3d 935, 939 (8th Cir.2005); <em>Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, </em>735 F.2d at 328. Because Bowcock was an \u201cemployee\u201d subject to the RLA\u2019s mandatory arbitration provisions, the district court correctly dismissed his case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Bowcock\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
