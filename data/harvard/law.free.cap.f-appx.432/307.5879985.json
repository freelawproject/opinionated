Crawley appeals the denial of release pending resolution of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceedings and moves this court for release pending resolution of his request for a certificate of appealability, which he admits he has not yet filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Crawley argues that he should have been granted bail based on his contention that his mail fraud and embezzlement convictions are invalid in light of <em>Skilling v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 177 L.Ed.2d 619 (2010), because they involved honest services fraud and that he has therefore served longer than the statutory maximum term of imprisonment. Alternatively, he argues that if only the embezzlement-of-union-funds conviction is invalid, he is eligible for immediate placement in a halfway house. We review the denial of bail for abuse of discretion unless the denial involves statutory interpretation, in which case we review <em>de novo. See United States v. Olis, </em>450 F.3d 583, 585 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">Release pending appeal of the denial of post-conviction relief should be granted \u201conly when the [movant] has raised substantial constitutional claims upon which he has a high probability of success, and also when extraordinary or exceptional circumstances exist which make the grant of bail necessary to make the [postconviction] remedy effective.\u201d <em>Calley v. Callaway, </em>496 F.2d 701, 702 (5th Cir.1974). Crawley has not met those requirements. Accordingly, the denial of bail is AFFIRMED, and Crawley\u2019s instant motion for bail is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
