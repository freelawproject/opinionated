The court granted Aetna\u2019s unopposed Motion for Summary Judgment against AIDCO International, Inc. (\u201cAIDCO\u201d), but denied Aetna\u2019s request for fees and expenses because Aetna submitted insufficient evidence for the court to determine the reasonableness of its request. Aetna now appeals, arguing the district court erred by denying attorney\u2019s fees based on an insufficient factual record without first allowing Aetna an opportunity to supplement the supporting affidavit and billing record.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-21\">We review the denial of attorney\u2019s fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Trinity Indus., Inc., </em>876 F.2d 1485, 1496 (11th Cir.1989). A fee applicant \u201cbears the burden of establishing entitlement and documenting the appropriate hours and hourly rates.... [And fee counsel must supply] the court with specific and detailed evidence from which the court can determine the reasonable hourly rate.\u201d <em>Norman v. Hous. Auth., </em>836 F.2d 1292, 1303 (11th Cir.1988). At a minimum, the party seeking attorney\u2019s fees must produce more than an affidavit from the attorney performing the work. <em>Id. </em>at 1299.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-22\">Aetna fell short of meeting this burden. However, we have held that \u201c[w]here documentation is inadequate, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>is not relieved of its obligation to award a reasonable fee ... the district court traditionally has had the power to make such an award without the need of further pleadings or an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1303; <em>see also Thompson v. Pharmacy Corp. of Am., </em>334 F.3d 1242, 1246 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (holding the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s conclusion that [the attorney] should receive <em>no compensation\u201d </em>was an abuse of discretion because \u201cwe are confident that <em>some </em>legitimate time was expended by [the attorney]\u201d). Thus, the district court should have given Aetna \u201can adequate opportunity to respond to the court\u2019s concerns regarding the fee application and to correct perceived inadequacies in that application before making its decision.\u201d <em>See NAACP v. City of Evergreen, </em>812 F.2d 1332, 1338 (11th Cir.1987) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed. On remand, the court should permit fee counsel to supplement its inadequate fee application.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
