Smith, a Florida state prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition. In his habeas petition, Smith raised sixteen grounds challenging the validity of three disciplinary reports on December 16 and 18, 2003, and on January 20, 2004, all of which resulted in the loss of gain time credits. Relevant to this appeal, Smith alleged that (1) he was denied due process when the written disciplinary decisions did not explain the reasons for finding the unsworn statements of prison officials more credible than Smith\u2019s testimony, and (2) the January 2004 disciplinary decision was legally insufficient because it failed to allege that Smith\u2019s actions affected the security and order of the prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">The magistrate judge consolidated Smith\u2019s sixteen grounds into five issues, including: (1) whether there was sufficient evidence to support the disciplinary actions, and (2) whether Smith was improperly denied the right to present evidence and witnesses. The magistrate judge considered the unsworn statements of prison officials and concluded that, even if challenged by Smith and uncorroborated by other evidence, the statements constituted \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the disciplinary actions. Accordingly, the magistrate judge found that there was no reason for the disciplinary team to explain why it had given more weight to these statements because \u201csome evidence\u201d was consistent with due process requirements. The magistrate judge further noted that, given the content of the allegations levied against Smith in the disciplinary actions, Smith had not shown that his request for witnesses and evidence would overcome the burden on prison staff and safety concerns. The magistrate judge then rejected any other claims not specifically addressed as lacking merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">After considering Smith\u2019s objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and denied Smith\u2019s habeas petition. Smith requested a certificate of appealability (COA), which the district court denied. We then granted a COA on the following issue only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-12\">Whether, in light of <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en banc), </em>the district court was required to address all of the claims raised in Smith\u2019s habeas corpus petition filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-13\">If so, whether the district court\u2019s order should be vacated and remanded because it failed to address Smith\u2019s claims that he was deprived of due process because the disciplinary hearing teams\u2019 written statements (1) failed to explain why the correctional officers\u2019 written statements were more credible than Smith\u2019s testimony and (2) failed to state that Smith\u2019s disrespectful remarks were made in a context that affected the security and order of the prison.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-14\">We review issues of law presented in a COA <em>de novo. Medberry v. Crosby, </em>351 F.3d 1049, 1053 (11th Cir.2003). Under <em>Clisby, </em>the district court must resolve all claims raised in a habeas corpus petition, whether relief is granted or denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 960 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>F.2d at 935-36. A \u201cclaim for relief\u2019 is defined as \u201cany allegation of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936. When a district court fails to address all of the claims in a habeas corpus petition, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Where a prison disciplinary hearing may result in the loss of good time credits, a prisoner is entitled to certain due process rights, including (1) a written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied upon and the reasons for the disciplinary action taken, and (2) an opportunity to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in defense, when to do so would not be unduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional goals. <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 563-66, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). Due process also requires a prison disciplinary team\u2019s decision to be supported by \u201csome evidence\u201d in the record. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst. v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454-55, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985). Thus, courts are not required to examine the entire record, independently assess witness credibility, or weigh the evidence. Rather, we will uphold the decision if there is any evidence in the record to support the conclusion reached by the disciplinary team. <em>Id. </em>at 455-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Reviewing the record here, we conclude that the district court complied with <em>Clisby. </em>The magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201csome evidence\u201d included unsworn statements by officers addressed Smith\u2019s fundamental argument concerning the disciplinary teams\u2019 explanation of the evidence it used to support their decisions. Additionally, the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that the disciplinary team\u2019s decision was supported by \u201csome evidence\u201d addressed Smith\u2019s fundamental argument that the team\u2019s decision was legally insufficient, as courts do not assess the sufficiency of the evidence. Finally, the magistrate judge considered the content of disciplinary reports and determined that Smith had not shown that his request to present witnesses was more pressing than the need to ensure prison security and safety. Accordingly, because the district court complied with <em>Clisby, </em>we affirm the denial of Smith\u2019s habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-9\">. Smith is in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court. Therefore, Smith's <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>\u00a7 2241 petition was subject to \u00a7 2254, and the district court was required to comply with <em>Clisby. See Rhode v.
