In May 2010, the BIA denied Zheng\u2019s original application for asylum, which sought relief based on China\u2019s family planning policy and the forced sterilization of his wife.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In August 2010, Zheng filed a timely motion to reopen, alleging that, after his hearing before the immigration judge, he adopted the spiritual practice of Falun Gong, for which he would face persecution if he returned to China. In support, he submitted affidavits demonstrating his association with Falun Gong, as well as background materials documenting China\u2019s coercive policy towards Falun Gong in 2007 and 2008. The BIA denied Zheng\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-12\">A motion to reopen \u201cmust be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation\u201d and \u201cshall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). To prove that the new evidence is \u201cmaterial,\u201d the alien must establish \u201cthat, if the proceedings were opened, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case.\u201d <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256-57 (11th Cir.2009). Thus, the BIA has the discretion to deny a motion to reopen for at least three reasons: \u201c1) failure to establish a prima facie case of eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal; 2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; and 3) a determination that despite the alien\u2019s statutory eligibility for relief, he or she is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Li v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 1371, 1374-75 (11th Cir.2007) (alterations and quotation marks omitted). We review the denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009). The moving party bears a \u201cheavy burden,\u201d and judicial review \u201cis limited to determining whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-13\">Zheng argues on appeal that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen because he submitted new and material evidence showing his adherence to Falun Gong and the Chinese government\u2019s persecution of Falun Gong practitioners. He also asserts that, contrary to the BIA\u2019s conclusion, he did in fact have an asylum application on file.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>On this record, we cannot say the BIA abused its discretion in denying Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen. First, we note that while Zheng did have an asylum application on file, this original application sought relief based solely on China\u2019s family planning policy, and Zheng failed to accompany his motion to reopen with a new asylum application based on his changed circumstances. Even if this alone was not a reason to deny Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen, the BIA did not clearly err in finding that none of the background evidence submitted by Zheng concerning China\u2019s country conditions was \u201cnew,\u201d as it was available at the time of his original hearing. Finally, the BIA did not clearly err in finding that the evidence Zheng submitted would be unlikely to change the result in this case, as it provided no information about the Chinese government\u2019s current policy towards Falun Gong, as necessary to establish a well-founded fear of persecution based on his status as a Falun Gong practitioner. Accordingly, we deny Zheng\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-11\">. While Zheng's motion to reopen was pending, we denied his petition for review of this ruling. <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>406 Fed.Appx. 464 (11th Cir.2010) (unpublished).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
