Those remaining Defendants-Appellees were dismissed for qualified immunity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>from which order Lockamy appealed in No. 10-10329. A jury held for Campos, from which verdict Lockamy appealed in No. 10-10644. We consolidated those appeals and address them now, beginning with Lockamy\u2019s appeal of the jury verdict in favor of Campos.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Lockamy argues that the verdict in his case against Campos was tainted by numerous trial errors. We review the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuses of discretion. <em>United States v. Clark, </em>577 F.3d 273, 287 (5th Cir.) (citing <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>556 F.3d 326, 341 (5th Cir.2009)), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 809, 175 L.Ed.2d 568 (2009). If we find an abuse of discretion, we then review the error under the harmless error doctrine. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>343 F.3d 511, 517 (5th Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">There is no merit to Lockamy\u2019s assertion that, because the evidence was irrelevant and highly prejudicial, the district court erred in allowing Campos to introduce evidence of Lockamy\u2019s prior mental health diagnoses, disciplinary issues, and history of causing self-inflicted injuries. The evidence was not unfairly prejudicial merely because it was adverse to Lockamy. <em>Learmonth v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>631 F.3d 724, 733 (5th Cir.2011) (citing <em>Baker v. Canadian Nat\u2019l/Ill. Cent. R.R., </em>536 F.3d 357, 369 (5th Cir.2008)). Moreover, the danger of any unfair prejudice did not substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">The exhibits were relevant to Campos\u2019s defense that he did not use excessive force and that Lockamy\u2019s complained of injuries were most likely old and self-inflicted. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 406 (providing that evidence of a person\u2019s habit is \u201crelevant to prove that the conduct of the person ... on a particular occasion was in conformity with the habit\u201d). In addition, Lockamy\u2019s own testimony and evidentiary submissions included much of the same evidence of which he now complains. Lockamy did not argue in the district court that the evidence was also inadmissible pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 406, 501, 608(b), and 611. Accordingly, he cannot prevail on these issues because he has not shown that the district court committed a plain error: a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights that, if left uncorrected, would seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Tompkins v. Cyr, </em>202 F.3d 770, 779 (5th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Rushing v. Kansas City S. Ry. Co., </em>185 F.3d 496, 506 (5th Cir.1999)). Indeed, the burden of proving these factors lies with the party asserting error. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 164 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">In addition, we review the following of Lockamy\u2019s arguments for plain error in light of his failure to object below: his asserted error regarding the court\u2019s (1) excluding the testimony of his listed witnesses; (2) denying his request for a polygraph exam; (3) potentially allowing his physical appearance to unfairly prejudice the jury; and (4) refusing to allow him to refer to documents not admitted into evidence during his closing arguments. With respect to Lockamy\u2019s contention regarding calling additional witnesses, at trial the district court stated that Lockamy\u2019s request for subpoenas\u2014provided to the court the week earlier\u2014had not afforded sufficient time to serve the witnesses. Since there had been previous testimony regarding Lockamy\u2019s injuries, the court concluded that the additional testimony would have been cumulative under Rule 403. In requesting that the court subpoena the potential witnesses, Lockamy stated that they would \u201cgive testimony concerning their entries in plaintiffs medical rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>ords of the injuries plaintiff suffered and any additional info[rmation] they may provide.\u201d Lockamy\u2019s medical records, however, were introduced into evidence at trial. Thus, we cannot say that district court plainly erred by concluding that this testimony \u2014 regarding the entries in Lockamy\u2019s medical records \u2014 would be cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Lockamy\u2019s other plain error evidentiary contentions are also unavailing. In his brief to this court Lockamy concedes that there is \u201cno substantial law binding courts to issue polygraph exams.\u201d Therefore the district court\u2019s denial of his polygraph request was not plain error. Lockamy additionally argues that his physical appearance unfairly prejudiced the jury. Lockamy concedes in his brief, however, that this \u201cwas not due to any error of the court.\u201d Similarly, the district court\u2019s refusing to allow Lockamy to refer to documents not in the record during his closing argument was not plain error since we have recognized that it is \u201c[a] particularly indefensible tactic\u201d to use \u201cclosing arguments to bring before the jury damaging facts not in evidence and never established.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>512 F.2d 276, 284 (5th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Lockamy did not move for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) during the trial or, after the verdict, file either a Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law or a Rule 59 motion for a new trial; we thus review his assertion that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict for plain error. <em>See Shepherd v. Dallas Cnty., </em>591 F.3d 445, 456 (5th Cir.2009). Lockamy cannot demonstrate plain error because there is at least some evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that Campos did not use objectively unreasonable force on Lockamy. <em>See id. </em>(noting that the question is whether there is \u201c <em>\u2018any </em>evidence\u2019 \u201d to support the jury\u2019s verdict (quoting <em>Polanco v. City of Austin, Tex., </em>78 F.3d 968, 974 (5th Cir.1996))).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Lockamy also argues that Campos submitted a false exhibit and that Campos altered the videotape of the incident. These arguments are inapposite. We have long recognized that \u201c \u2018[i]t is the function of the jury as the traditional finder of facts, and not the court, to weigh conflicting evidence and inferences....\u2019\u201d <em>Grizzle v. Travelers Health Network, Inc., </em>14 F.3d 261, 266 (5th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 374-75 (5th Cir.1969) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Furthermore, Lockamy\u2019s argument that he lacked the proper experience, skills, and resources to successfully present his case is equally unavailing. A district court may appoint counsel in a \u00a7 1983 case if exceptional circumstances exist. <em>Williams v. Ballard, </em>466 F.3d 330, 335 (5th Cir.2006) (per curiam). The existence of exceptional circumstances depends upon \u201cthe type and complexity of the case, the litigant\u2019s ability to investigate and present the case, and the level of skill required to present the evidence.\u201d <em>Baranowski v. Hart, </em>486 F.3d 112, 126 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). This court reviews the district court\u2019s denial of appointment of counsel for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>Lockamy\u2019s excessive force claim is not a particularly complex issue, and the record reflects that he was more than capable of competently proceeding without the assistance of counsel. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying his requests for appointment of counsel. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Castro Romero v. Becken, </em>256 F.3d 349, 354 (5th Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Lockamy also argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the remaining defendants be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>cause it did not properly consider his deliberate indifference claims; however, he fails to challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that those defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. Thus, Lockamy has waived any challenge to the district court\u2019s alternate basis for the grant of summary judgment. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993) (contentions not adequately argued in the body of the brief are deemed abandoned). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
