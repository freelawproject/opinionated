On November 19, 2010, the district court revoked Douze\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to prison for 18 months. He appeals his sentence, contending that it is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-21\">We review the sentence imposed upon the revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). A district court must impose a sentence that is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review the reasonableness of a sentence \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id., </em>552 U.S. at 41, 128 S.Ct. at 591. \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-22\">A sentence is substantively unreasonable if it \u201cfails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>When revoking a defendant\u2019s term of supervised release, the sentencing court must consider: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment; (6) the kinds of sentences and the Sentencing Guidelines sentencing range; (7) any pertinent policy statements; (8) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (9) the need to provide restitution to any victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), (a)(4)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">A district court abuses its discretion when it balances the \u00a7 3553(a) factors unreasonably or places unreasonable weight on a single factor. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). We remand a case for resentencing if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">Given the record before it, we conclude that district court did not impose a substantively unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
