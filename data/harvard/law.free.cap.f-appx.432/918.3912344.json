(\u201cGulf Coast\u201d), alleging violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, (FDCPA), Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692, and the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act (FCCPA), Florida Statutes Chapter 559. The alleged violations related to separate telephone calls that Gulf Coast made to Beeders in an attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>to collect a debt. Each of the telephone calls utilized the identical or nearly identical voice mail message, the content of which is not a matter of factual dispute. The transcribed message stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4F\">This message is intended for Eric H. Beeders. If you are not Eric H. Beeders please hang up or disconnect. If you are Eric H. Beeders please continue to listen to this message. By continuing to listen to this message you acknowledge that you are Eric H. Beeders. Please return this call to Roy Dillard from Gulf Coast Collection Bureau. Please call 877-827-4820 and ask for file number G31852.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">On appeal, Beeders argues that this message failed to comply with the applicable consumer protection regulations because it did not adequately satisfy the disclosure requirement in that it did not identify the nature of the calling company\u2019s business, the fact that the caller was a debt collector, and the fact that the call was being made with respect to collection of a debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination that, taking this message as a whole, even an unsophisticated consumer would not be misled as to the purpose of this call, as the message identified the name of the caller, which includes the term \u201cCollection Bureau,\u201d and specifically referenced a personal file number. Accordingly, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Gulf Coast satisfied the disclosure requirements of the FDCPA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-9\">. Because we find no error in the district court's determination that Gulf Coast satisfied the disclosure requirements of the FDCPA, we need not address Beeders' argument that the failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a <em>per se </em>violation of the FCCPA. Accordingly, we also affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Gulf Coast on Beeders' claims for violation of the FCCPA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
