The parties consented to entry of judgment by the magistrate judge. Buras has appealed the magistrate judge\u2019s order and judgment granting HCH\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-16\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Freeman v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Crim. Justice, </em>369 F.3d 854, 859 (5th Cir.2004). \u201c[S]ummary judgment is proper \u2018if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (citation omitted); <em>see also </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. Once the moving party carries its burden of showing that evidence in the record contains insufficient proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to present evidence showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. <em>Norwegian Bulk Transp. A/S v. International Marine, </em>520 F.3d 409, 412 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-17\">The magistrate judge correctly construed the complaint as asserting a claim under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd (EMTALA). <em>See Marshall ex rel. Marshall v. East Carroll Parish Hosp. Serv. Dist., </em>134 F.3d 319, 321 (5th Cir.1998). EMTALA provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-18\">In the case of a hospital that has a hospital emergency department, if any individual ... comes to the emergency department and a request is made on the individual\u2019s behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, the hospital must provide for an <em>appropriate </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number><em>medical screening examination </em>within the capability of the hospital\u2019s emergency department, including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition ... exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00a7 1395dd(a) (emphasis supplied). An \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d is defined to mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">(i) placing the health of the individual ... in serious jeopardy,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">(ii) serious impairment to bodily functions, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">(iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">\u00a7 1395dd(e)(l)(A). If the screening examination reveals that the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, the individual must be provided with stabilizing treatment; conditions are imposed on the transfer of the individual to another medical facility. \u00a7 1395dd(b) &amp; (c); <em>see also Battle ex rel. Battle v. Memorial Hasp. at Gulfport, </em>228 F.3d 544, 557-59 (5th Cir.2000) (discussing and applying EMTALA requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">EMTALA was enacted to prevent \u201c \u2018patient dumping,\u2019 which is the practice of refusing to treat patients who are unable to pay.\u201d <em>Marshall, </em>134 F.3d at 322. It \u201cwas not intended to be used as a federal malpractice statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAccordingly, an EMTALA \u2018appropriate medical screening examination\u2019 is not judged by its proficiency in accurately diagnosing the patient\u2019s illness, but rather by whether it was performed equitably in comparison to other patients with similar symptoms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). If an \u201cappropriate medical screening examination\u201d is provided and the claimant\u2019s condition is determined not to be an emergency, the hospital is not liable under EMTALA, even in the event of a misdiagnosis that would subject a provider to liability in a malpractice action brought under state law. <em>Id. </em>An \u201cappropriate medical screening examination\u201d is \u201ca screening examination that the hospital would have offered to any other patient in a similar condition with similar symptoms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">To avoid summary judgment, Buras had to present evidence showing that there was a genuine issue of material fact whether HCH had provided an EMTALA-appropriate medical examination. <em>See id. </em>Buras also had to show that HCH had actual knowledge that he was suffering from an emergency medical condition. <em>See Battle, </em>228 F.3d at 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">HCH presented summary judgment evidence that Buras received appropriate medical screening examinations on both of his visits to the HCH emergency department (ER). Buras failed to present any evidence rebutting HCH\u2019s evidence of this essential element of his EMTALA claim. <em>See Marshall, </em>134 F.3d at 324; <em>see also Norwegian Bulk Transp., </em>520 F.3d at 412. Moreover, HCH presented evidence that Buras did not have an emergency medical condition on either of his visits to the HCH Emergency Department. The fact that a physician at another hospital prescribed an antibiotic at the time of the first visit is not sufficient to create a genuine issue whether Buras received an inadequate medical screening and had an emergency medical condition on that date. <em>See Battle, </em>228 F.3d at 557-58; <em>Marshall, </em>134 F.3d at 324-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-15\">Buras contends in conclusional fashion that, by granting the motion for summary judgment, the magistrate judge denied his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>constitutional right to trial by jury and to confront adverse witnesses. This issue has not been briefed, it is waived. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">In asserting that he was treated disparately, Buras notes that he presented the same symptoms on both of his visits to HCH, but that he received a different treatment for his condition on the second visit. The question is not whether the treatment was different, but whether the same adequate medical screening examination was offered under similar circumstances. <em>See Battle, </em>228 F.3d at 557-58; <em>Marshall, </em>134 F.3d at 323-24. As Buras\u2019s condition was determined to be non-emergent, differences in the treatment rendered are not material to Buras\u2019s EMTALA claim. <em>See Marshall, </em>134 F.3d at 324-25; \u00a7 1395dd(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Buras also complains that summary judgment was granted before discovery was completed. A party may move for summary judgment \u201cat any time until 30 days after the close of all discovery.\u201d Fed. R.CivP. 56(b). Buras does not state what additional discovery was necessary or uncompleted. As there was no reason to believe that further discovery would have produced evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact, the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion by precluding further discovery before granting summary judgment. <em>See Resolution Trust Corp. v. Sharif-Munir-Davidson Dev. Corp., </em>992 F.2d 1398, 1401 (5th Cir.1993). The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
