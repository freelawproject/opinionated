In his application for asylum, Adof said that he was a Dominican of Haitian descent, that Dominicans of Haitian descent who live in the Dominican Republic are subject to \u201call kinds of mistreatment ] and abuses.\u201d He cited several examples of such, including his experiences while studying law in the Dominican Republic. He was doing well until he told his classmates that his parents were Haitians. This allegedly caused him to receive failing grades from two teachers, and the theft of his automobile a month or so before he was to deliver his law school thesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-17\">Before this court, he argues that he suffered past persecution in (1) the theft of his automobile, (2) the denial of his request for a copy of his birth certificate, (3) the receipt of threatening telephone calls, and (4) discrimination at the hands of his law school professors. Regarding future persecution, Adof argues that he will be killed if returned to the Dominican Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-18\">As an initial matter, we must point out that we lack jurisdiction to consider several issues raised by Adof in his brief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>Adof did not exhaust before the BIA his argument that the IJ erred by not addressing the political opinion aspect of his asylum claim. Thus, that argument is not properly before us. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (providing that we lack subject matter jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect thereto). Nor did he exhaust before the BIA his argument that he might qualify for Temporary Protected Status.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Where, as here, the BIA has issued a decision, we review that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). In this case, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision in dismissing Adofs appeal; hence, our review is of the BIA\u2019s decision alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">To qualify for asylum, an applicant must prove that he is a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of the INA. <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1006 (11th Cir.2008); INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). An alien must show, with specific and credible evidence, past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286-87 (11th Cir.2005); INA \u00a7 101(a)(42), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must show that if returned to his country, his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The burden of proof for withholding of removal is \u201cmore likely than not,\u201d and, thus, is more stringent than the standard for asylum relief. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">Likewise, to qualify for CAT relief, an applicant again must meet standards more stringent than those for asylum eligibility. <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 891 (11th Cir.2007). To qualify for CAT relief, an alien must \u201cdemonstrate a likelihood that he will be tortured at the acquiescence of the government, meaning that the government was aware of the torture, yet breached its responsibility to intervene.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">Persecution is not defined in the INA, but it is \u201can extreme concept,\u201d requiring more than mere harassment. <em>De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1008. In assessing persecution, we consider all the evidence of mistreatment as a whole, and are \u201crequired to consider the cumulative impact of the mistreatment the petitioner[] suffered.\u201d <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1258 (11th Cir.2007). Evidence showing that someone is merely a victim of criminal activity does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1258. Mere threats also do not constitute persecution. <em>See Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1237 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that a \u201ccondolence note\u201d and threatening phone calls, without more, were mere harassment, rather than persecution). Furthermore, discrimination ordinarily does not constitute persecution. <em>See Barreto-Claro v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>275 F.3d 1334, 1340 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that employment discrimination that stops short of depriving an individual of a means of earning a living, such as losing a desired job and being forced to take menial work instead, does not constitute persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">A showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>at 1257. Even if the applicant fails to demonstrate past persecution, he may still qualify for asylum based upon proof of a well-founded fear of future persecution, which may be demonstrated by a subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable fear of persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>An applicant can establish a well-founded fear of future persecution by \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he will be singled out for persecution\u201d on account of a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Adof did not suffer past persecution. Even assuming a nexus between a protected ground and the theft of his vehicle, and a nexus between a protected ground and the denial of his birth certificate, the theft and denial of the birth certificate, along with the threatening phone calls and the discrimination of Adofs law school professors, taken cumulatively, do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See e.g., Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that an asylum applicant had not suffered past persecution despite evidence that the restaurant at which she had worked was bombed, and she had received death threats); <em>see also Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1353 (11th Cir.2009) (concluding that no persecution existed where the petitioner was arrested for participating in a student demonstration, interrogated and beaten for five hours, detained for four days, and monitored by authorities after his release); <em>see also Barreto-Claro, </em>275 F.3d at 1340 (holding that employment discrimination that stops short of depriving an individual of a means of earning a living, such as losing a desired job and being forced to take menial work instead, does not constitute persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Adof does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. Even assuming that Adofs fear is subjectively genuine, Adofs account does not compel the conclusion that he has an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Thus, because he failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, Adof failed to qualify for asylum. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286-87. As he failed to establish his eligibility for asylum, he, by extension, failed to satisfy the more stringent burdens of establishing his eligibility for withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See id. </em>at 1288 n. 4 (noting that a failure to establish eligibility for asylum on the merits necessarily entails ineligibility for withholding of removal and CAT relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
