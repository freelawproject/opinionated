Duran-Garcia argues that the district court erred by applying the 16-level enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">In 1998 Duran-Garcia was convicted of the felony offense of assault with a firearm, in violation of Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 245(a)(2) (West 1998). The district court concluded that conviction qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines and applied a 16-level enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). Duran-Garcia argues that was error. \u2018We review <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s pri- or conviction qualifies as a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1326 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-14\">The Sentencing Guidelines impose a 16-level enhancement if an alien \u201cwas deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after ... a conviction for a felony that is ... a crime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) (Nov.2009). A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined as any of the following offenses under federal, state, or local law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-15\">murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses (including where consent to the conduct is not given or is not legally valid, such as where consent to the conduct is involuntary, incompetent, or coerced), statutory rape, sexual abuse of a minor, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, burglary of a dwelling, or any other offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-16\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. 1(B)(iii); <em>see also United States v. Searcy, </em>418 F.3d 1193, 1195 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (We treat the commentary in the Sentencing Guidelines Manual as authoritative.\u201d). The definition \u201cis disjunctive and we have held that a felony conviction qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2 if either (1) the defendant was convicted of one of the enumerated offenses; or (2) the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>was an element of the offense.\u201d <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">To determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as an enumerated offense, we use the \u201ccategorical approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330-31 (explaining that \u201cthe label a state attaches to an offense is not conclusive of whether a prior conviction qualifies as an enumerated offense under \u00a7 2L1.2\u201d). Under that approach, \u201cwe consider the offense generically, that is to say, we examine it in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion.\u201d <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 141, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 1584, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008) (citing <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2160, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990)); <em>see also Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1331. In <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>we held that \u201cthe generic offense of \u2018aggravated assault\u2019 under \u00a7 2L1.2 of the Guidelines involves a criminal assault accompanied by the aggravating factors of either the intent to cause serious bodily injury to the victim or the use of a deadly weapon.\u201d 606 F.3d at 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The California statute under which Duran-Garcia was convicted provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-6\">Any person who commits an assault upon the person of another with a firearm shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three, or four years, or in a county jail for not less than six months and not exceeding one year, or by both a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">CaLPenal Code \u00a7 245(a)(2) (West 1998). \u201cAssault\u201d is defined as \u201can unlawful attempt, coupled with a present ability, to commit a violent injury on the person of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 240. Although Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 245(a)(2) requires the use of a firearm, Duran-Garcia argues that his pri- or conviction does not qualify as generic aggravated assault because the terms \u201cfirearm\u201d and \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d are not synonymous under California law. Duran-Garcia points out that Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 245(a)(1) makes it unlawful to \u201ccommit[ ] an assault upon the person of another <em>with a deadly weapon or instrument other than a firearm </em>.... \u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 245(a)(1) criminalizes assault with a deadly weapon, Duran-Garcia argues that his conviction under \u00a7 245(a)(2) for assault with a firearm does not \u201cprohibit[ ] behavior that is ... within the generic, contemporary meaning of aggravated assault as it is used in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.\u201d <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1333 (quoting <em>United States v. Fierro-Reyna, </em>466 F.3d 324, 329-30 (5th Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">We disagree. Under California law, \u201cassault with a firearm is ... one type of assault with a deadly weapon.\u201d <em>People v. Maldonado, </em>134 Cal.App.4th 627, 36 Cal.Rptr.3d 117, 121-22 (2005); <em>see id. </em>(explaining that \u201c[s]ection 245 treats assault with a firearm as an aggravated subset of assault with a deadly weapon\u201d). Thus, because CaLPenal Code \u00a7 245(a)(2) requires the use of a deadly weapon, Duran-Garcia\u2019s prior conviction under that statute qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). <em>See Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1332. For that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>reason, the district court did not err in applying the 16-level enhancement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-8\">. Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 245(a)(1) provides in full: Any person who commits an assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon or instrument other than a firearm or by any means of force likely to produce great bodily injury shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three, or four years, or in a county jail for not exceeding one year, or by a fine not exceeding ten thousand ($10,000), or by both the fine and imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b877-18\">. Duran-Garcia also collaterally attacks the validity of his conviction under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 425(a)(2). However, because Duran-Garcia was represented by counsel when he pleaded no contest to assault with a firearm, he may not collaterally attack his conviction. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>120 F.3d 227, 231 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cCollateral attacks on prior convictions are allowed in federal sentencing proceedings in one narrow circumstance only: when the conviction was obtained in violation of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
