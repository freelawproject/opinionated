BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b944-28\">The Plaintiffs are foreign amateur athletes, primarily swimmers, who filed 1-140 petitions for preference visas, pursuant to Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 203(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(b)(1)(A), based on their extraordinary athletic ability. Because their claims arise out of the revocation of their previously approved I-140 petitions, we first outline the proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>dures for granting and revoking 1-140 visa petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">A. 1-140 Petition Procedures</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">The INA gives \u201c[a]liens with extraordinary ability\u201d work visa preference as \u201cpriority workers.\u201d INA \u00a7 203(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(b)(1)(A). An alien qualifies for this preference if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-7\">(i) the alien has extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics which has been demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim and whose achievements have been recognized in the field through extensive documentation,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-8\">(ii) the alien seeks to enter the United States to continue to work in the area of extraordinary ability, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-9\">(iii) the alien\u2019s entry into the United States will substantially benefit prospectively the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-10\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 203(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(b)(1)(A). An alien wanting classification as an alien of \u201cwith extraordinary ability\u201d files an 1-140 petition with the Attorney General. INA \u00a7 204(a)(1)(E), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(a)(1)(E); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.5(a), (h). The 1-140 petition \u201cmust be accompanied by evidence that the alien has sustained national or international acclaim and that his or her achievements have been recognized in the field of expertise.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.5(h)(3). The regulations: (1) list the kinds of evidence that demonstrates the requisite acclaim and achievements, and (2) provide that if that evidence does \u201cnot readily apply to the beneficiary\u2019s occupation,\u201d comparable evidence can be submitted. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.5(h)(4). Although the alien is not required to have an offer of employment, \u201cthe petition must be accompanied by clear evidence that the alien is coming to the United States to continue work in the area of expertise.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.5(h)(5). \u201cSuch evidence may include letter(s) from prospective employer(s), evidence of prearranged commitments such as contracts, or a statement from the beneficiary detailing plans on how he or she intends to continue his or her work in the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After investigation, the 1-140 petition is either approved or denied pursuant to INA \u00a7 204(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-15\">Once an 1-140 petition is granted, \u201cthe Secretary of Homeland Security may, at any time, for what he deems to be good and sufficient cause, revoke an application.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1155; <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.2(a). Before revoking an approved 1-140 petition, the USCIS officer must issue a notice of intent, and the alien is given an opportunity to offer evidence in support of the 1-140 petition and to oppose the grounds for revocation. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.2(b). After the decision to revoke the 1-140 petition is made, the alien is provided written notice explaining the reasons for the decision. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 205.2(c). The alien may appeal the revocation decision to the Associate Commissioner for Examinations. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 203.2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-16\">B. Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b945-17\">The Plaintiffs\u2019 1-140 petitions were initially approved but later revoked because the Plaintiffs did not provide evidence either (1) that their primary occupation and source of income in the United States would be in their respective sports or (2) that they had received national or interna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>tional acclaim or had achievements recognized in their sport.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">On May 12, 2009, the Plaintiffs filed this putative class action against the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (\u201cUSCIS\u201d), the division of DHS that processes immigrant visa applications, and several immigration officials at the USCIS\u2019s Texas Service Center who denied or revoked approval of the Plaintiffs\u2019 1-140 petitions. The Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendants used an irrational basis to revoke their 1-140 petitions because evidence that the Plaintiffs could earn their primary income in them sports \u201cdoes not exist in reality.\u201d The Plaintiffs provided to the immigration officials the expert opinion of Oussama Mellouli, an Olympic gold medalist in swimming, that competitive swimmers are not paid to compete and train and must hold other jobs to support themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">The Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to correct the Defendants\u2019 \u201cirrational acts and behavior\u201d and a temporary restraining order to bring the irrational acts \u201cto an immediate end.\u201d The complaint alleged that subject matter jurisdiction existed pursuant to INA \u00a7 279, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1329, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, the Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, and the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 555(b), and that the district court had supplemental jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a), over all other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">C. Dismissal Order</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">On August 12, 2009, the district court granted the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court concluded that none of the statutes alleged in the Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint provided subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">The district court also noted that the Plaintiffs\u2019 opposition brief contended they had asserted a claim under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). The district court explained that a new claim could not be raised in a brief, but advised the Plaintiffs that they were \u201cfree to file an amended complaint asserting any <em>Bivens </em>claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">D. Second Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">After the district court\u2019s order, the Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint alleging a <em>Bivens </em>claim. Specifically, the second amended complaint alleged that the individual Defendants, Officers 75, 301 and 1014 at the Texas Service Center and its director, David Roark, were unlawfully, irrationally and criminally \u201ctargeting\u201d the Plaintiffs\u2019 1-140 petitions for revocation in retaliation for earlier lawsuits, thereby violating the Plaintiffs\u2019 Fifth Amendment due process rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The second amended complaint reasserted the same jurisdictional bases \u2014 the INA (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1329), the Mandamus Act (23 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361), the APA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 555(b)), federal question jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331), and supplemental jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367) \u2014 and added that the district court also had \u201cjurisdiction under <em>Bivens </em>to correct the unlawful, irra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>tional and criminal acts and conduct\u201d of the individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">E. Second Dismissal Order</p>\n<p id=\"AMcb\">On May 28, 2010, the district court granted the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. The district court again concluded that, with the exception of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381, the statutes the Plaintiffs relied upon did not supply subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the district court found that the <em>Bivens </em>claim against the individual Defendants provided a basis for federal question jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331, that <em>Bivens </em>claim failed on the merits under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Specifically, the district court determined that: (1) an official\u2019s erroneous or irrational decision based on a presumptively valid statute does not constitute a constitutional violation; and (2) aliens do not have a constitutionally protected interest in discretionary immigration decisions. The district court dismissed the second amended complaint without prejudice and gave the Plaintiffs until June 9, 2010 to file a motion for leave to file a third amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">F. Denial of Motion for Leave To File Third Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">The Plaintiffs filed a timely motion for leave to file a third amended complaint and attached a proposed third amended complaint. The Plaintiffs\u2019 motion argued that the third amended complaint stated a proper <em>Bivens </em>claim because the individual Defendants\u2019 decisions to deny or revoke already approved 1-140 petitions was made without a rational explanation, departed from established policies and rested on an impermissible basis. The Plaintiffs cited recent decisions from the Administrative Appeals Office that a swimmer need only provide evidence that he or she would continue to participate in competitive swimming at the national or international level by swimming or coaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-13\">On November 2, 2010, the district court denied the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for leave to file a third amended complaint. The district court found that the proposed amendment would be futile and adopted and incorporated its prior May 28, 2010 dismissal order. With respect to the <em>Bivens </em>claim, the district court reiterated that: (1) there is no <em>Bivens </em>liability because the individual Defendants relied on a presumptively valid statute in denying or revoking the Plaintiffs\u2019 1-140 petitions; and (2) a visa does not constitute a liberty or property interest protected by the Fifth Amendment. On November 16, 2010, the Plaintiffs timely appealed as to the district court\u2019s November 2, 2010 order denying the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for leave to file a third amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b947-15\">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15, once amendment as a matter of course is no longer available, a party may amend a pleading \u201conly with the opposing party\u2019s written consent or the court\u2019s leave.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2). Although \u201c[t]he court should freely give leave when justice so requires,\u201d <em>id., </em>the court need not \u201callow an amendment ... [that] would be futile.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Dupree, </em>252 F.3d 1161, 1163 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-16\">\u201cWe generally review the denial of a motion to amend a complaint for an abuse of discretion, but we review questions of law <em>de novo.\u201d Coventry First, LLC v. McCarty, </em>605 F.3d 865, 869 (11th Cir.2010) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>(quotation marks omitted). Thus, we review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling that a particular amendment to a complaint would be futile. <em>Cockrell v. Sparks, </em>510 F.3d 1307, 1310 (11th Cir.2007). A proposed amendment is futile if the \u201c \u2018complaint as amended would still be properly-dismissed.\u2019\u201d <em>Coventry First, LLC, </em>605 F.3d at 870 (quoting <em>Cockrell, </em>510 F.3d at 1310).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">After review, we conclude that, in denying the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for leave to amend, the district court correctly determined that (1) it lacked jurisdiction under the INA to review of the revocation of the Plaintiffs\u2019 1-140 petitions; (2) the only proper basis for subject matter jurisdiction alleged in the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed third amended complaint was federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 for the Plaintiffs\u2019 <em>Bivens </em>claim; and (3) the Plaintiffs\u2019 third amended complaint failed to state a <em>Bivens </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">A. Jurisdiction under the INA</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 is not available if judicial review is precluded by statute. <em>See Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 107-108, 97 S.Ct. 980, 985, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977). Thus, we first address whether the INA, specifically \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), precludes judicial review of USCIS\u2019s revocation of previously approved 1-140 petitions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Under the INA, federal courts do not have jurisdiction to review denials of discretionary relief by the Attorney General or the Secretary of DHS, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-11\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory) ..., and except as provided in subparagraph (D), and regardless of whether the judgment, decision, or action is made in removal proceedings, no court shall have jurisdiction to review\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-12\">(ii) any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, other than the granting of relief under section 1158(a) of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The phrase \u201cunder this subchapter\u201d refers to Title 8, Chapter 12, Subchapter II, which encompasses 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1151 through 1381. <em>Kucana v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 827, 832 n. 3, 175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010). Furthermore, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) applies only to decisions made discretionary by the statutes in Subchapter II and does not apply to decisions made discretionary by regulation. <em>Kucana, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 130 S.Ct. at 836-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-19\">The USCIS revoked the approval of Plaintiffs\u2019 1-140 petitions pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>\u00a7 1155, which falls within Subchapter II.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Furthermore, the language of \u00a7 1155 explicitly gives the Secretary of Homeland Security broad discretion to revoke the approval of a visa petitions, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGf\">The Secretary of Homeland Security <em>may, at any time, for what he deems to be good and sufficient cause, </em>revoke the approval of any petition approved by him under section 1154 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1155 (emphasis added). Given the statutory discretion conferred upon the Secretary to revoke approved visa petitions, we agree with the other circuits that have concluded that \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) precludes judicial review of visa revocation decisions made pursuant to \u00a7 1155. <em>See, e.g., Green v. Napolitano, </em>627 F.3d 1341, 1344-46 (10th Cir.2010); <em>Abdelwahab v. Frazier, </em>578 F.3d 817, 821 (8th Cir.2009); <em>Ghanem v. Upchurch, </em>481 F.3d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Jilin Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Chertoff, </em>447 F.3d 196, 200-205 (3d Cir.2006). Accordingly, to the extent the Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed third amended complaint sought review of the agency\u2019s revocation of their approved 1-140 petitions, the district court properly denied leave to amend as futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">B. <em>Bivens </em>Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">The Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed <em>Bivens </em>claim alleges a violation of their Fifth Amendment due process rights. The gravamen of the claim was that \u201crogue\u201d immigration officials targeted their 1-140 petitions for revocation in retaliation for prior lawsuits filed by their attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">To state a due process claim, a plaintiff must allege a deprivation of a property or liberty interest protected by the Fifth Amendment. <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir.2000). In the immigration context, we have repeatedly concluded that where an alien seeks discretionary relief, there is no such constitutionally protected liberty or property interest. <em>See Scheerer v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.2008) (involving denial of motion to reopen removal proceedings so alien could apply for adjustment of status); <em>Garcia v. Att\u2019y Gen. of U.S., </em>329 F.3d 1217, 1223-24 (11th Cir.2003) (involving waiver of ex-cludability); <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1367 (11th Cir.2006) (involving denial of continuance of removal proceedings); <em>Tefel v. Reno, </em>180 F.3d 1286, 1299-1302 (11th Cir.1999) (involving denial of applications for suspension of deportation); <em>see also Knoetze v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of State, </em>634 F.2d 207, 211-12 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981) (rejecting due process claim involving Secretary of State\u2019s revocation of consular non-immigrant visa because revocation does not result in immediate deportation and deportation proceedings have \u201csignificant procedural safeguards\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">As discussed above, \u00a7 1155 does not limit the Secretary\u2019s discretion in making visa revocation decisions. As such, an alien\u2019s expectation that the approval of his or her 1-140 petition will not be revoked does not give rise to a liberty or property interest protected by the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>Plaintiffs had a constitutionally protected interest in retaining their work visas, agency regulations provide notice and an opportunity to be heard before work visas are revoked and an appeal process. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.2. The Plaintiffs do not allege that they were deprived of these procedural safeguards. Thus, the district court correctly concluded that Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed third amended complaint did not allege the violation of a Fifth Amendment due process right and thus failed to state a <em>Bivens </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b945-13\">. If the 1-140 petition is approved and a visa is available, the alien is given notice to file a Form 1-485 for adjustment to permanent residence if the alien has not already done so. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.5(n)(l). If the 1-140 petition is denied, the alien is given notice of the reasons for the denial and may appeal to the Associate Commissioner for Examinations. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 204.5(n)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b946-8\">. Many of the named Plaintiffs, represented by the same counsel, filed individual lawsuits against the Defendants challenging the denial or revocation of their 1-140 petitions. <em>See Bathazi v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., </em>667 F.Supp.2d 1375, 1377 n. 2, 1378-79 (S.D.Fla.2009) (listing ten cases and ordering Bathazi's counsel to show cause why he should not be subject to Rule 11 sanctions for persistently filing frivolous challenges to the 1-140 adjudication process). In addition, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel filed a mandamus action against DHS, which was dismissed for failure to state a claim. <em>See Sibley v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>No. 07-cv-21309 (S.D.Fla. July 24, 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b947-9\">.

Although the Plaintiffs' proposed third amended complaint alleges that 1-140 petitions were \"denied\u201d and \"revoked,\u201d a thorough reading of that proposed complaint indicates that all the named Plaintiffs\u2019 1-140 petitions were initially approved and the approvals were later revoked pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1155. Thus, we do not address whether \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) precludes review of initial denials of 1-140 petitions pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(b)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b948-20\">.
