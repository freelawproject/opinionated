He moves for leave to appeal in forma pauperis (IFP) from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to reduce sentence, identified as arising under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Silvas\u2019s arguments that he was entitled to a sentence reduction under Amendment 484 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 and the district court erred in calculating the drug quantity attributable to him are not cognizable under \u00a7 3582. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Silvas\u2019s motion was an unauthorized motion without a jurisdictional basis. <em>See Early, </em>27 F.3d at 142. Accordingly, Silvas\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
