Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir.2007). While we generally have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, the petition for review must be filed within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal. INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), (b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) and (b)(1). We have held that the period for filing a petition for review is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d and, thus, \u201cnot subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). Moreover, the filing of a motion for reconsideration does not affect the finality of a removal order and does not toll the 30-day period for petitioning for review of such an order. <em>Jaggernauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350-51 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">Because Medina Ramirez did not file his petition for review within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s December 4, 2009, removal order, we lack jurisdiction to review that original order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Accordingly, we dismiss Medina Ramirez\u2019s petition for review to the extent that it seek review of the BIA\u2019s underlying removal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b842-14\">With regard to his motion for reconsideration, Medina Ramirez contends on appeal that the BIA\u2019s denial of that motion was not consistent with its duty to render a reasoned and independent judgment. However, Medina Ramirez devotes the remainder of his brief to arguing that (1) the BIA did not properly scrutinize the IJ\u2019s decision before affirming it and (2) that both the IJ and the BIA erred when they concluded that he had not established past persecution on account of a protected ground or a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-15\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for an abuse of discretion. <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007). Appellate review of the denial of discretionary relief is limited to determining whether the BIA exercised its administrative discretion and whether the exercise of discretion was \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985) (motion to reopen). A motion to reconsider shall specify \u201cthe errors of fact or law\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>previous order and \u201cshall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). A motion to reconsider that merely restates the arguments that the BIA previously rejected provides no reason for the BIA to change its prior decision. <em>See Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329. Thus, an applicant does not specify errors of fact or law, as required by the regulation, where he merely reiterates previously rejected arguments. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Although the petition for review was timely with respect to the BIA\u2019s September 9, 2010, order denying Medina Ramirez\u2019s motion for reconsideration, Medina Ramirez waived any claims as to that reconsideration order because he failed to argue on petition for review that the BIA abused its discretion when it denied his motion. <em>See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989) (holding that issues not argued on appeal are deemed waived). Moreover, because Medina Ramirez merely reiterated previously rejected arguments in his motion for reconsideration, the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied his motion for reconsideration. <em>See Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329. Accordingly, we deny Medina Ramirez\u2019s petition to the extent that it seeks review of the BIA\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
