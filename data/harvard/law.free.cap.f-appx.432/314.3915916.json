Itie petitions this court to review the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ) decision denying his May 2008 motion to reopen his 1994 deportation proceedings. This court reviews the denial of a motion to reopen \u201cunder a highly deferential abuse-of-dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>cretion standard.\u201d <em>Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354, 358 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">For the first time before this court, Itie argues that Winston Udeh was not his \u201ccounsel of record\u201d during the 1994 deportation proceedings. He asserts \u201cthat the attorney-client relationship between Mr. Udeh and [himself] ended when the rescission matter was referred to the Immigration Court.\u201d As such, Itie contends that he cannot be charged with notice of the deportation proceedings based on the service of the order to show cause (OSC) to Winston Udeh. Because Itie failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to this particular argument, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In a footnote, Itie contends that the BIA did not address his argument \u201cthat even if Udeh were his \u2018counsel\u2019 for notice purposes, the OSC never identified the article number for the certified mail receipt.\u201d He asserts that \u201c[t]he mere fact that [his] certified mail receipt number was sequential to the one DHS produced as having been served on Udeh does not dispositively show that Udeh received an OSC because the number was not referenced on the OSC.\u201d Itie\u2019s argument is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The BIA did address the argument, finding that the documents in the record supported the IJ\u2019s finding that Itie\u2019s counsel was served with a copy of the OSC. The BIA further found the record supported the IJ\u2019s finding that several notices of the deportation hearing were mailed by certified mail to Itie\u2019s last known address and that this \u201ccreate[d] a strong presumption of effective delivery.\u201d The BIA\u2019s determination that Itie failed to overcome this presumption of delivery is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Maknojiya v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 588, 589 (5th Cir.2005). As such, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Itie\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Gomez-Palacios, </em>560 F.3d at 358. Itie\u2019s petition is therefore DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
