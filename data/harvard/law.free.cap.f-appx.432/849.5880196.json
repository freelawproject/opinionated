A motion to reconsider that merely reiterates arguments previously presented to the BIA does not specify errors of facts or law as required for a successful motion to reconsider. <em>Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329. Here, the BIA properly found that the motion for reconsideration reiterated Izyaguyev\u2019s previous arguments and failed to point out an error of law or fact with respect to the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen. Accordingly, we deny Izyaguyev\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-7\">. Although the government argues on appeal that there is no judicially manageable standard for reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reconsider, our case law provides that such motions are reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. Accordingly, as stated in our March 2, 2011, order, we have jurisdiction to review the BIA's denial of Izyaguyev\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
