On appeal, Bernadeu argues that: (1) the district court erred in not tolling the time between the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for rehearing of his Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.850 post-conviction motion and the date on which he filed a petition for belated appeal in state court; and (2) alternatively, the court erred in not granting him the benefit of equitable tolling during that time because he did not receive notice of the order denying his motion for rehearing until more than seven months after it was issued. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a \u00a7 2254 petition was time-barred. <em>Moore v. Crosby, </em>321 F.3d 1377, 1379 (11th Cir.2003). We review \u201ca district court\u2019s legal decision on equitable tolling <em>de novo \u201d </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Drew v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2002). \u201c[A] determination regarding a party\u2019s diligence is a finding of fact.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">A petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by a state prisoner is subject to a one-year statute of limitations. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The statute of limitations is statutorily tolled while a properly-filed state application for post-conviction or other collateral review is pending. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">In Florida, one form of collateral relief a prisoner may seek is a Rule 3.850 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct a sentence. Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.850. If this motion is denied and the petitioner does not file a notice of appeal within 30 days, the petitioner may later file a petition for belated appeal. <em>Id. </em>Rule 3.850(g); Fla.R.App.P. 9.141(c)(4)(A). Nonetheless, if a petition for belated appeal is filed after the \u00a7 2244 statute of limitations has expired, \u201cit does not reset or restart the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>321 F.3d at 1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">In addition to statutory tolling, equitable tolling may be applied in extraordinary cases where a petitioner acted diligently but nonetheless filed his petition for habeas corpus after the expiration of the statute of limitations due to \u201ccircumstances beyond his control.\u201d <em>Drew, </em>297 F.3d at 1286-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">In this case, the district court correctly dismissed Bernadeu\u2019s petition as time-barred because the statute of limitations expired on January 3, 2008, and Bernadeu did not file his petition until February 1, 2009. Despite Bernadeu\u2019s arguments to the contrary, it is irrelevant that the Florida state court deemed his March 25, 2008 belated appeal timely because, under <em>Moore, </em>a petition for belated appeal \u201cdoes not reset or restart the statute of limitations\u201d after it has expired. 321 F.3d at 1381. Contrary to Bernadeu\u2019s suggestion, <em>Moore </em>is still good law in this Court; the Supreme Court in <em>Carey v. Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002), explicitly limited its holding to California, and the Court in <em>Evans v. Chavis, </em>546 U.S. 189, 126 S.Ct. 846, 163 L.Ed.2d 684 (2006), merely applied <em>Carey </em>to a new set of facts in a different California case. <em>See Carey, </em>536 U.S. at 224-25, 122 S.Ct. 2134; <em>Evans, </em>546 U.S. at 192, 126 S.Ct. 846. Furthermore, Bernadeu\u2019s contention that the Supreme Court applied these cases to Florida\u2019s post-conviction scheme in <em>Lawrence v. Florida, </em>549 U.S. 327, 127 S.Ct. 1079, 166 L.Ed.2d 924 (2007), is without merit because there, the Court merely held that a post-conviction application is not pending following the final judgment in the state court even if the petitioner filed a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>at 329. Therefore, <em>Moore </em>remains binding on this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Because Bernadeu\u2019s federal petition for habeas corpus was not filed until after the expiration of the \u00a7 2244 statute of limitations, it was time-barred unless equitable tolling is applicable. However, Bernadeu took no action to learn the status of his state court case for more than seven months, during which time the statute of limitations expired. The district court thus did not err in finding that Bernadeu did not act diligently during this delay. <em>See Drew, </em>297 F.3d at 1286-87. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
