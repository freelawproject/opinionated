Wesley appeals following the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> adverse grant of summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>judgment in his employment-discrimination action, and the subsequent denial of his motion for reconsideration. Initially, we note that Wesley\u2019s notice of appeal is timely only as to the order denying reconsideration, <em>see Huggins v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., Inc., </em>566 F.3d 771, 773 (8th Cir.2009) (court is obligated to consider jurisdiction sua sponte when there is indication that it is lacking), because his motion was filed twenty-nine days after the entry of judgment, and thus did not toll the time to appeal the underlying grant of summary judgment, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4). Finding no abuse of discretion in the denial of reconsideration under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), <em>see Arnold v. Wood, </em>238 F.3d 992, 998 (8th Cir.2001) (Rule 60(b) movant must demonstrate exceptional circumstances justifying such relief), we affirm the district court. We also deny Wesley\u2019s motion for remand.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-32\">.
