She argues that the district court erred in denying her claim for lack of jurisdiction. She asserts that, in view of <em>United States v. Almany, </em>598 F.3d 238 (6th Cir.2010), she should not have received two mandatory minimum sentences for her convictions under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). If her brief is liberally construed, Newman contends that her claim may be raised under the savings clause contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; she asserts that her claim cannot be raised in a successive \u00a7 2255 motion because it is not based on newly discovered evidence or a new rule of constitutional law and, therefore, a \u00a7 2255 motion would be inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-21\">Because Newman is challenging the legality of her sentence, and not the manner in which her sentence is being executed, the district court did not err in concluding that her claim arises under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.2005). She has not shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>that her claim falls within \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause as she has not demonstrated that (1) her claim \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d; and (2) her claim \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Further, Newman\u2019s inability to meet the requirements for filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion does not make the \u00a7 2255 remedy inadequate. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Finally, Newman has not shown that the district court erred in determining that it lacked jurisdiction over a \u00a7 2255 motion. Newman was convicted and sentenced in the Eastern District of Tennessee, but she filed the instant petition in the Northern District of Texas. Therefore, the district court did not err in dismissing it for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(e); <em>see also Solsona v. Warden, F.C.I., </em>821 F.2d 1129, 1132 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
