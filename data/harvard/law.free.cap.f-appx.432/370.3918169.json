Dean argues that dismissal of his lawsuit without an evidentiary hearing or an opportunity to amend was error. He additionally contends that the district court erroneously dismissed his lawsuit for failure to exhaust when he in fact has exhausted the administrative remedies available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-23\">Dean misapprehends the basis for the district court\u2019s dismissal. His suit was dismissed not for failure to exhaust but as frivolous for failure to raise a constitutional claim. Dean has abandoned by failing to brief any argument challenging the district court\u2019s conclusion that his lawsuit did not implicate a constitutional claim. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Dean fails to brief any challenge the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his suit, he has abandoned the sole ground for appeal. <em>See id.; Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). The appeal is thus without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-24\">Both the dismissal of the instant appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint count as strikes for purposes of the in forma pauperis (IFP) provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Dean has at least two prior strikes. Accordingly, he has accumulated more than three strikes and is now barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-25\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
