She argues that there are two base offense levels associated with attempted murder and that it is \u201cimpossible to discern which base offense level to apply.\u201d According to Barnes, because \u201c[t]he application of the two base offense levels is a choice between the same conduct, with identical elements ... the rule of lenity should apply.\u201d Review of this issue is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Price, </em>516 F.3d 285, 286-87 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">Section 2A2.1 applies to two offenses: assault with intent to commit murder and attempted murder. The base offense level under that section is 33 if \u201cthe object of the offense would have constituted first degree murder,\u201d and 27 if \u201cotherwise.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 2A2.1(a)(1), (2). Section 2A2.1, comment. (n.1), references the definition of murder set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">Barnes does not dispute that she pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of, attempted murder. Additionally, she does not dispute that the object of her offense would have constituted first degree murder under \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(l) and \u00a7 1111. Finally, the record reflects that she acted with the requisite premeditation under \u00a7 1111. Thus, Barnes has failed to establish that the district court committed any error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
