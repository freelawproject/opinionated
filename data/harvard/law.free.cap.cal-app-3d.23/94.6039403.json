The documents included a general elementary teaching credential which authorized Comings to serve as a teacher in any public elementary school, or in grades 7 or 8 of any junior high school, in California. An accusation was filed with the board on August 21, 1968, alleging that Comings had been in possession of marijuana in San Diego on February 23, 1967; that he had consequently been arrested and convicted on a charge of violating Health and Safety Code section 11530; and that his cerification documents should be revoked because he had thereby committed \u201cacts involving immoral and unprofessional conduct,\u201d \u201cacts demonstrating his unfitness for service,\u201d and \u201can act or acts involving moral turpitude.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Comings demanded and received an administrative hearing, which was conducted pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 13203; Gov. Code, \u00a7 11500 et seq.) He appeared at the hearing through counsel only. No testimony was presented at the hearing, but opposing counsel (1) stipulated to the introduction of the evidence received at Comings\u2019 preliminary examination on the marijuana charge,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and of the minute-order record of his plea of guilty thereto in the Superior Court of San Diego County; and (2) stipulated that he was subsequently convicted on the charge in that court, and was granted probation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> None of the foregoing evidence was disputed, nor is it disputed on Comings\u2019 appeal: no other evidence was received at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The hearing officer proposed, and the board adopted, a decision revoking Comings\u2019 certification documents pursuant to Education Code sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>13202 and 13129,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which were cited in the decision: Comings thereupon sought a writ of mandate, in the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco, to compel the board to set aside its decision and to reinstate his certification documents. The cause was apparently submitted on the pleadings and the administrative record, without the introduction of any evidence. The superior court denied Comings\u2019 petition by minute order,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from which he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\">\n<em>The Jones Appeal (1 Civil 29573): Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">In and prior to 1969, appellant Selwyn Jones was a permanent, certificated employee of respondent Jefferson Union High School District, and taught in the art department of Westmoor High School in Daly City, San Mateo County. On August 22, 1969, while visiting Hawaii, Jones was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana in violation of the laws of that state. Pursuant to his plea of <em>nolo contendere, </em>he was thereafter convicted as charged, and granted probation and fined, in the Circuit Court of the Fifth District of Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">After Jones\u2019 return to- Westmoor High School in the fall of 1969, respondent school district\u2019s superintendent filed, with respondent district\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>governing board and pursuant to Education Code section 13404, a written statement of charges against him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The board commenced administrative proceedings directed to Jones\u2019 immediate suspension and dismissal. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 13408 et seq.) When he demanded a hearing, the board by resolution authorized the San Mateo County District Attorney to file an action for Jones\u2019 dismissal. <em>{Id., </em>\u00a7 13412, subd. (b).) The district attorney commenced such action in the Superior Court of San Mateo County on November 10, 1969, alleging the above-recited sequence in the \u201cComplaint for Dismissal.\u201d Jones having answered the complaint, the cause was tried before the court sitting without a jury. As plaintiff at the trial, respondent school district introduced testimony by Dennis Higashi and Margaret Riggs. Higashi, an officer in the police department of the County of Kauai, Hawaii, testified to the circumstances surrounding Jones\u2019 arrest, in which he (Higashi) had participated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Miss Margaret Riggs, vice-principal at Westmoor High School, testified as follows:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Jones\u2019 return to the school as a teacher would adversely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>affect its art department, its faculty at large, its student body generally, and the students\u2019 parents, because many of the persons involved had expressed \u201cdisapproval\u201d or \u201cconcern\u201d at the prospect of having a teacher on the campus who had been convicted of using marijuana or who had admitted its use. The effect of his return would \u201cnot be good,\u201d as to the students, because \u201cthe behavior of a faculty member who would have used marijuana would be . . . [an] . . . example in opposition to the instructions which we are giving ... [to the students] . . .\u201d in \u201ca campaign, instructional campaign, going on within our own school district ... on drug use and abuse.\u201d Directly asked for her \u201coverall opinion\u201d concerning Jones\u2019 \u201cfitness to teach after his conviction of marijuana possession and his admission to marijuana use,\u201d Miss Riggs testified that it \u201cwould not be a positive one,\u201d and \u201cwould, in fact, work against the total goals of our school,\u201d because it would not indicate to- the students \u201cthe kind of behavior which they are told to develop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Miss Riggs also- testified that her knowledge of Jones\u2019 arrest and conviction in Hawaii, and of his admissions to the use of marijuana (see fn. 7, <em>ante), </em>was based exclusively upon information she had received after Jones had been suspended in the course of the administrative proceedings' commenced against him in October 1969. Jones, however, called at the trial in his own behalf, testified in effect that his 1969 arrest and conviction had been reported in the San Francisco Chronicle.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (He also denied having made the oral admissions attributed to him by Officer Higashi, and testified to the general effect that he could have successfully defended the Hawaii prosecution, but pleaded <em>nolo contendere </em>therein as a matter of convenience.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Upon the foregoing evidence, the trial court made findings of fact which in effect dismissed some of the original charges against Jones but, sustaining others, found cause for his dismissal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Jones appeals from the judgment, next duly entered, authorizing his dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number> Challenging the administrative determination and the trial court\u2019s action in each of the cases before us, appellants contend (1) that, as a matter of law, possession of marijuana, or conviction for the crime thereof, cannot amount to \u201cimmoral or unprofessional conduct,\u201d or to an act or crime \u201cinvolving moral turpitude\u201d or demonstrating \u201cevident unfitness for service,\u201d within the meanings of these terms as used in Education Code sections 13202, 13129, subdivision (e) and 13403; and (2) that, as a matter of proof, the contrary conclusion reached by the trial court, in each of the present cases respectively, is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">The first argument rests upon the propositions assertedly advanced in selected scientific and other authorities, cited in appellants\u2019 briefs, to the effect that the use of marijuana is medically harmless and (although illegal) commonplace among students and adults in California and elsewhere.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If these propositions were accepted as true (and we are requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>to take judicial notice of their truth), appellants argue that, as a matter of law, possession of marijuana cannot be \u201cimmoral,\u201d or an \u201cact involving moral turpitude\u201d as such terms have been defined by the courts. (Appellants cite, <em>e.g., Board of Education v. Weiland </em>(1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 808, 811 [4 Cal.Rptr. 286], and <em>Palo Verde etc. Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Hensey </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 967, 971-972 [88 Cal.Rptr. 570] [\u201cimmoral\u201d]; <em>Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 67, 73 [64 Cal. Rptr. 785, 435 P.2d 553] [\u201cmoral turpitude\u201d].) We do not accept\u2014because we do not reach\u2014the dubious pTemise that a criminal act cannot be characterized as. \u201cimmoral\u201d if it is medically harmless or commonly committed; appellants\u2019 argument to this effect fails for other reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">In the first place, we cannot judicially notice the <em>truth </em>of the stated propositions that the use of marijuana is harmless or commonplace. The authorities cited to both effects (see fn. 10, <em>ante </em>[first paragraph]) were mentioned in a brief submitted by Comings in his trial court, but it does not appear that judicial notice of the truth of their asserted conclusions (i.e., that marijuana was harmless and that its use was common) was \u201crequested\u201d in that court (Evid. Code, \u00a7 455, subd. (a)) or taken by it with advance notice to the opposite party. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).) In all events, the accuracy of the matters asserted, in either proposition, is the subject of intense scientific and popular controversy; actual judicial knowledge of the relevant truths is limited; and there is no evidence, in either record on appeal, supporting a conclusion either way. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the \u201cpropositions\u201d stated in the cited authorities are of \u201cgeneralized knowledge\u201d or \u201ccommon knowledge,\u201d and are not reasonably subject to \u201cdispute,\u201d so as to permit their being judicially noticed as true. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 451, subd. (f); <em>id., </em>\u00a7 452, subds. (g), (h). Cf. <em>Rosas </em>v. <em>Montgomery </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 77, 87 [88 CalRptr. 907] and authorities cited; Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) \u00a7\u00a7 178-179, pp. 164-165.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>More significantly, appellants\u2019 first argument misses the mark because it amounts to semantic preoccupation with the statutory terms \u201cimmoral,\u201d and the like, as criteria for analyzing the conduct of public school teachers for disciplinary purposes. This approach is incorrect. As bases for administrative sanctions against persons who hold govemmentally issued credentials which qualify them for employment, the statutory terms \u201cconstitute only lingual abstractions until applied to a specific occupation and given content by reference to fitness for the performance of that vocation.\u201d <em>(Morrison </em>v. <em>State Board of Education </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 214, 239 [82 Cal.Rptr. 175, 461 P.2d 375].<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Perrine </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 656, 665 [97 Cal.Rptr. 320, 488 P.2d 648].) In a disciplinary proceeding against a public school teacher, the administrative agency cannot \u201cabstractly characterize\u201d his conduct in the statutory language (i.e., as \u201cimmoral\u201d and so on) unless that conduct indicates his unfitness to teach. <em>(Morrison </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, supra, </em>at p. 229. Cf. <em>Palo Verde etc. Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Hensey, supra, 9 </em>Cal.App.3d 967 at p. 972; <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Stubblefield </em>(1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 820, 825-826 [94 Cal. Rptr. 318]; <em>Governing Board </em>v. <em>Brennan </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 396, 402 [95 Cal.Rptr. 712]; <em>Blodgett </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 183, 191 [97 Cal.Rptr. 406], See Louisell and Sinclair, <em>The Supreme Court of California 1969-1970 </em>(1971) 59 Cal.L.Rev. 30, 58 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\">Education Code section 13202 may be construed as constitutional only when so interpreted. <em>(Morrison </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, supra, </em>1 Cal. 3d 214 at pp. 218, 230, 235; <em>Governing Board </em>v. <em>Brennan, supra, </em>18 Cal. App.3d 396 at pp. 400-401; Louisell and Sinclair, <em>op cit. supra, </em>59 Cal.L.Rev. 30 at pp. 58, 63.) The <em>Morrison </em>test, however, applies in administrative proceedings directed to dismissal of a teacher under Education Code sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>tion 13403, as well as revocation of certification documents under section 13202. <em>(Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Stubblefield, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.3d 820 at p. 826.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">To be valid in either case, the imposition of discipline must be supported by <em>evidence </em>of the person\u2019s unfitness to teach. <em>(Morrison </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, supra, </em>at pp. 218, 236-237; <em>Governing Board </em>v. <em>Brennan, supra, </em>at p. 402.) This may include evidence that his conduct indicates a potential for adverse school relationships in the future, or has achieved such notoriety as to impair those in which he is already involved. <em>(Morrison </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, supra, </em>at pp. 235, 237;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Stubblefield, supra, </em>at p. 826.) For all these reasons, we are necessarily remitted to the second question raised by appellants: i.e., whether there is substantial evidence, in either record on appeal, of the respective subject\u2019s unfitness, to teach.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\n<em>The Comings Appeal (1 Civil 29298): Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The Comings record (1 Civil 29298) shows the bare facts of his February 1967, arrest in San Diego for possession of marijuana, the circumstances immediately attending it (see fn. 1, <em>ante), </em>his subsequent prosecution for violating Health and Safety Code section 11530, and his conviction. He was convicted in or about June 1967 (see fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>but the accusation against him was not filed with the State Board of Education until August 1968; a degree of \u201cremoteness in time of the conduct\u201d (see fn. 13, <em>ante) </em>was thus suggested, but not analyzed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Whether Comings\u2019 conduct \u201cadversely affected students or fellow teachers,\u201d or in what \u201cdegree\u201d (see fn. 13, <em>ante), </em>is not even suggested by the record; the latter, in fact, does not show whether or where he taught in a California public school at any time, thus precluding any inference as to the relevant notoriety of his conduct. No inquiry was made into \u201cextenuating or aggravating circumstances, if any, surrounding the conduct,\u201d the likelihood of its recurrence, or Comings\u2019 motives. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The record con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>tains even less evidence of his \u201cunfitness to teach\u201d than appeared in the record held insufficient in Morrison; it thus falls short of the showing required, under the <em>Morrison, </em>test, to support revocation of his certification documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">While we must therefore reverse the judgment in 1 Civil 29298 (as to Comings), we here paraphrase (as to him and his conduct) some relevant language by the <em>Morrison </em>court: \u201cOur conclusion affords no guarantee that [Comings\u2019 certification documents] cannot be revoked. If the Board of Education believes that [he] is unfit to' teach, it can reopen its inquiry into the circumstances surrounding and the implications of the [1967] incident .... The board also has at its disposal ample means to discipline [him] for future misconduct. [Par.] Finally, we do not, of course, hold that [marijuana offenders] must be permitted to teach in the public schools of California.  As we have explained, the relevant statutes, as well as the applicable principles of constitutional law, require only that the board properly find, pursuant to the precepts set forth in this opinion, that an individual is not fit to- teach. Whenever disciplinary action rests upon such grounds and has been confirmed by the judgment of a superior court following an independent review of the evidence, this court will uphold the result.\u201d <em>(Morrison </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 214 at pp. 239-240 [fns. omitted].)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\n<em>The Jones Appeal (1 Civil 29573): Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">We reach an opposite result upon Jones\u2019 appeal (1 Civil 29573) from the superior court\u2019s judgment authorizing his dismissal as a permanent, certificated employee of respondent Jefferson Union High School District. Margaret Riggs testified at length to her opinions concerning Jones; her qualifications to do so, as vice-principal of the school where he was employed in and prior to 1969, appear in the record and are unchallenged on the appeal. Many of her opinions were directed to the adverse effect of Jones\u2019 \u201creturn\u201d to the school, which is not entirely relevant to the question whether he was justifiably dismissed from it. She nevertheless testified directly to Jones\u2019 \u201cfitness to teach,\u201d and her opinion can only be read (1) to\u00a1 the effect that he was unfit and (2) as stating valid reasons for this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">It is also true that Miss Riggs learned of Jones\u2019 conduct in Hawaii only after respondent school district\u2019s governing board had suspended him in consequence thereof. The conduct itself, however, and the other pertinent events in Hawaii, were reported in the San Francisco Chronicle. (See fn. 8, <em>ante, </em>and accompanying text.) As it may reasonably be inferred that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>salient facts thus reached the attention of many persons in Daly City, it may also be inferred that Jones\u2019 conduct attained a degree of timely notoriety among persons\u2014students, teachers, parents, and others\u2014interested in Westmoor High School. (See <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 214 at p. 237; <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Stubblefield, supra, </em>16 Cal. App.3d 820 at p. 826.) Overall, we find substantial evidence of Jones\u2019 \u201cunfitness to teach,\u201d at relevant times and places, as required by the <em>Morrison </em>test. The judgment in 1 Civil 29573 must therefore stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\">The judgment in 1 Civil 29298 is reversed. The judgment in 1 Civil 29573 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Devine, P. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">A petition for a rehearing in No. 29573 was denied February 24, 1972, and the petitions of appellant Jones and respondent Board for a hearing by the Supreme Court were denied March 30, 1972.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-8\"> According to the transcript of the preliminary examination, Comings was arrested on February 23, 1967, at a Mexican border station in San Diego, after various quantities of marijuana and related debris were found in police searches of his automobile and of his person. The evidence was directed only to his possession of the marijuana; none of it indicated that he used it or admitted using it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-9\">The record shows that Comings entered his guilty plea in May 1967, but neither it nor counsel\u2019s stipulation indicates the date he was granted probation. As the record suggests that the probation officer\u2019s report was returnable to the San Diego court in June 1967, we infer that Comings was granted probation in that month.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b110-6\">As pertinent, Education Code section 13202 provides that the State Board of Education \u201cshall revoke or suspend\u201d certification documents \u201cfor immoral or unprofessional conduct, ... or for any cause which would have warranted the denial of an application for a certification document or the renewal thereof, or for evident unfitness for service, . . .\u201d Section 13129 permits denial or renewal of a certification document for commission of \u201cany act involving moral turpitude.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The board\u2019s decision included findings that Comings had been in possession of marijuana, and had been arrested and convicted thereof, as alleged in the accusation. Its full content, however, indicates that his certification documents were revoked upon the theory that the possession alone constituted \u201cimmoral or unprofessional conduct,\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 13202), an \u201cact involving moral turpitude\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 13129, subd. (e)) and \u201cevident unfitness for service\" <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 13202): i.e., that his conviction was considered as evidence of his conduct, but not as a ground for revocation in itself. This reading of the decision is consistent with the facts (1) that conviction of a marijuana offense is not a ground for permissive revocation of certification documents under Education Code sections 13202 and 13129, and (2) that a violation of Health and Safety Code section 11530 is not a \u201cnarcotics offense\" of which conviction is a ground for mandatory revocation. (See Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13130, subd. (c), 12912.5, subds. (a), (b).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The superior court made no findings of fact, which were presumably waived. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 632, subd. 1.) We may therefore infer that the court found substantial evidence, in the administrative record, that Comings was in possession of marijuana on February 23, 1967, in San Diego, and that this constituted \u201cimmoral or unprofessional conduct\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 13202), an \u201cact involving moral turpitude\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 13129, subd. (e)), and \u201cevident unfitness for service.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 13202.) We infer such findings in support of the judgment. (4 Witkin, Cal.

[T]he conviction of the crime above set forth constitutes the conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">\u201c. . . [T]he above described acts and conduct on the part of said respondent [Jones] constitute reasonable cause of his immediate suspension without pay and for his dismissal as provided in Sections 13403 <em>et seq. </em>of the Education Code.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b111-13\">Officer Higashi\u2019s testimony in this regard was as follows: He and other officers went to Jones\u2019 hotel room with a search warrant. They served it upon Jones (who was present with another person), conducted a search of the room, and found two sacks containing marijuana cigarettes. After having been advised of his rights, Jones admitted ownership of one of the sacks, and told the officers \u201cWe smoke pot, but only a little bit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b111-14\"> Although Miss Riggs\u2019 opinion testimony concerning Jones was admitted over continuing objection by his trial counsel, he challenges none of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Jones\u2019 testimony to this effect was given in the following dialog: \u201cQ. [By his counsel] Did you, between the time you returned and resumed your teaching [after the arrest and conviction] to the time you were suspended, discuss with any faculty, administration or students your conviction? A. No. Q. Do you know whether or not they found out about it? A. I didn\u2019t know anything until I was called in and told I was suspended. Q. Do you know how the public found out about your arrest and conviction? A. I don\u2019t know. Q. Did you see any newspaper reports about this? A. I saw the San Francisco paper, San Francisco Chronicle. Q. Did that have your name in it? A. Right, it did.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The court found and concluded as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">\u201c1. That on or about August 19, 1969, in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit, State of Hawaii, . . . [Jones] . . . was convicted of the unlawful possession or control of marihuana in violation of . . . [Hawaii law] . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">\u201c2. That at the time of his arrest on said charges . . . [Jones] . . . admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>that he smoked marihuana and further stated that a package of marihuana found in the room occupied by the defendant and a companion was his;</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\u201c3. That the charges filed by the Superintendent of the plaintiff school district, i.e., for immoral conduct, evident unfitness for service and conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude are sustained;</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u201c4. That it has not been established that the offense of which . . . [Jones] . . . was convicted is a felony;</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">\u201c5. That the charge of dishonesty has not been sustained;</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">\u201c6. That conviction of a crime equal to a violation of Section 11530 of the Health and Safety Code is not a cause for dismissal under Educational Code Section 13403;</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">\u201c7. That the charges sustained adversely affect . . . [Jones\u2019] . . . fitness as a teacher;</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">\u201c8. That . . . [respondent school district] ... is authorized to dismiss . . . [Jones] . . . from his position as a permanent, certificated employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">It thus appears (from finding No. 3) that the trial court found cause to dismiss Jones for \u201cimmoral or unprofessional conduct\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 13403, subd. (a)) and \u201cevident unfitness for service\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd.
