After exhausting state post-conviction remedies, Sharpe petitioned for habeas corpus in federal court, claiming that his conviction was unconstitutional because it resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel. Although he had procedurally defaulted on this claim, the district court held that Sharpe had come forward with new evidence of \u201cactual innocence\u201d suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>cient to excuse his default. The district court then ruled in Sharpe\u2019s favor on the merits of his constitutional claim. Yet in reaching its conclusions, the district court ignored the several state post-conviction proceedings which had determined that the evidence Sharpe presented was not credible and that his constitutional claim was without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Such a <em>de novo </em>do-over was impermissible under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). Sharpe would have us substitute our own judgment for the state court\u2019s credibility determinations, disregard the fact that the state courts soundly assessed each of his contentions, and unfairly hindsight the performance of his own trial counsel. Such an approach undermines the principles of comity and federalism that the Supreme Court and Congress have set forth in the context of federal habeas review. We therefore reverse and remand with directions to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Dontae Sharpe was charged with killing a man named George Radcliffe, who was shot to death on the night of February 11, 1994, in downtown Greenville, North Carolina. Radcliffe\u2019s body was found inside his pickup truck on a grassy lot, just off a downtown street. Inside the truck, police officers found Radcliffe\u2019s wallet, which contained fifty-three dollars, and a coat later identified as belonging to one Wilbur Mercer.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">At trial, the state offered the testimony of two purported eyewitnesses to the killing. Beatrice Stokes, twenty-seven years old, and Charlene Johnson, fifteen years old, both testified that Sharpe sold drugs with a man named Mark Joyner and was a leading drug dealer in the neighborhood where Radeliffe\u2019s body was found. Both testified that on the night of the murder, they saw Sharpe, Joyner, and Radcliffe standing in the street next to Radcliffe\u2019s pickup truck, that an argument broke out, and that Sharpe shot Radcliffe. Both stated that Wilbur Mercer was also at the scene, and Stokes noted the presence of several others.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Stokes testified that she immediately fled and called the police when the shot went off. Johnson testified that she watched Sharpe and Joyner load Radcliffe\u2019s body into the truck and drive it into the lot where it was found. Johnson admitted that she had received a reward for coming forward. Stokes testified that she had not received a reward but admitted that she was probably using drugs at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">A third eyewitness, Alonzo Vines, lived in a house adjacent to the lot where Radcliffe\u2019s truck was found. He testified that he was in his house on the night of the murder when he heard a loud noise, looked out his window, and saw that a pickup truck had been driven into the lot. He stated that he saw the truck\u2019s door was open and that two or three people were standing next to it. He could not identify them, however, because his view was blocked by dust on his windows. Seven other witnesses testified for the state. The state\u2019s medical examiner testified as to the trajectory of the bullet and opined that Radcliffe could have remained conscious after the shooting for no more than 10 seconds. Police officers investigating the murder testified that local residents appeared to be afraid to get involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">In his defense, Sharpe offered the testimony of his aunt and her neighbor, who offered partial alibis, and of two witnesses who testified that Stokes was untrustworthy. Sharpe also attempted to introduce further testimony from one of these witnesses, a woman named Tracy Highsmith. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>On voir dire, Highsmith stated that her boyfriend, Damien Smith, had come home on the night of the murder and confessed to shooting a man, presumed to be Radcliffe, whom he had attempted to rob. According to Highsmith, Smith repeated comments to this effect several times over the next three weeks. Smith committed suicide twenty-seven days after the murder, and while Highsmith asserted that he had become increasingly agitated after Radcliffe was killed, she also admitted that he had repeatedly threatened suicide before Radcliffe\u2019s death. Although Sharpe\u2019s attorney argued that Highsmith\u2019s testimony should be admitted under the dying declaration and state of mind exceptions to the bar on hearsay evidence, the court held that the testimony was inadmissible. A jury found Sharpe guilty on July 24, 1995, and the North Carolina Supreme Court sustained his conviction on appeal. <em>State v. Sharpe, </em>344 N.C. 190, 473 S.E.2d 3 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">On the day Sharpe was first arrested for the murder, Charlene Johnson had been beaten and stabbed by a group of women for being a \u201csnitch.\u201d Sharpe\u2019s mother and aunt had followed behind the women as they set out for Johnson\u2019s home and rescued Johnson from the attack. In the course of taking her to the emergency room, they told her, in Johnson\u2019s words, that the \u201cword on the street\u201d was that Johnson was \u201cthe one that said something about Dontae murdering Mr. Radcliffe.\u201d For safety reasons, Johnson went to live outside of Greenville, but her mother could not come with her, and she returned after a few weeks. Johnson came to form a relationship with Sharpe\u2019s family, and eventually with Sharpe himself, visiting him in prison at least twice. Not long after his conviction, Johnson recanted her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In February 1997, Sharpe filed a motion for appropriate relief (\u201cMAR\u201d) in North Carolina Superior Court, alleging that the recantation entitled him to a new trial and raising, for the first time, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The MAR court held an evidentiary hearing and determined that Johnson\u2019s recantation was not credible. It also held that the ineffective assistance of counsel claim had been defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Sharpe then filed for habeas corpus in federal court, and the district court scheduled an evidentiary hearing on his claims. Just prior to the hearing, a man named Dearl Powell came forward, claiming to have witnessed the shooting and identifying Smith as Radcliffe\u2019s killer. In Powell\u2019s account, Radcliffe was in the driver seat of the truck and Wilbur Mercer was in the passenger seat when Smith shot Radcliffe through the driver side window. According to Powell, after being shot, Radcliffe drove the truck off. Powell began to testify at the habeas hearing, but the district court cut him off before he could be cross-examined and ordered that his evidence be presented first in North Carolina court.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Sharpe filed another MAR in November 2001, seeking a new trial under North Carolina law on the basis of newly discovered evidence of actual innocence and renewing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. A second evidentiary hearing was held before the same judge who had considered Sharpe\u2019s earlier MAR. After listening to Powell and considering the entire evidentiary record, the court concluded that his testimony was not credible and denied Sharpe\u2019s actual innocence claim. In addition, the court held that Sharpe\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not only defaulted, as it had done previously, but also that it would fail on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Sharpe then returned to federal court. Without holding an evidentiary hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>the district court concluded that Sharpe had sufficiently made out a claim of \u201cactual innocence\u201d under <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995), to justify setting aside his procedural default under North Carolina law. <em>Sharpe v. Bell, </em>571 F.Supp.2d 675, 681 (E.D.N.C.2008). It also rejected the state\u2019s statute-of-limitations defense. <em>Id. </em>at 680. The district court then concluded that the failure of Sharpe\u2019s counsel to argue for the admission of Highsmith\u2019s testimony under the hearsay exceptions identified in Sharpe\u2019s habeas petition violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Sharpe v. Bell, </em>595 F.Supp.2d 636, 644-45 (E.D.N.C.2009). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">We begin with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Sharpe\u2019s procedural default in raising his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be excused.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In general, \u201ca federal habeas court may not review constitutional claims when a state court has declined to consider their merits on the basis of an adequate and independent state procedural rule.\u201d <em>Burket v. Angelone, </em>208 F.3d 172, 183 (4th Cir.2000); <em>see also Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 87-91, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). The MAR court held that Sharpe had procedurally defaulted under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1419(a)(3), a statute we have repeatedly held to be both adequate and independent. <em>Lawrence v. Branker, </em>517 F.3d 700, 714 (4th Cir.2008) (citations omitted). A federal habeas court \u201cdoes not have license to question a state court\u2019s finding of procedural default\u201d or to question \u201cwhether the state court properly applied its own law.\u201d <em>Barnes v. Thompson, </em>58 F.3d 971, 974 n. 2 (4th Cir.1995) (citations omitted). Nor is a procedural default waived when a state court reaches the merits of a federal claim as an alternative basis for dismissal. <em>Harris v. Reed, </em>489 U.S. 255, 264 n. 10, 109 S.Ct. 1038, 103 L.Ed.2d 308 (1989); <em>Ashe v. Styles, </em>39 F.3d 80, 86 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">Although the doctrine of procedural default limits federal habeas review of state convictions, it does not provide an absolute bar. In order to \u201cbalance the societal interests in finality, comity, and conservation of scarce judicial resources with the individual interest in justice that arises in the extraordinary case,\u201d the Supreme Court has recognized an exception for situations in which a petitioner\u2019s incarceration represents a \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 324, 115 S.Ct. 851. This exception excuses a procedural default where \u201ca constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.\u201d <em>Murray v. Carrier, ATI </em>U.S. 478, 496, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986). If a petitioner presents \u201cnew reliable evidence\u201d supporting a claim of actual innocence, the habeas court must determine whether \u201cit is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 324, 327-28, 115 S.Ct. 851. This assessment is based on a review of \u201call the evidence, old and new, incriminating and exculpatory, without regard to whether it would necessarily be admitted under rules of admissibility that would govern at trial.\u201d <em>House v. Bell, </em>547 U.S. 518, 538, 126 S.Ct. 2064, 165 L.Ed.2d 1 (2006) (internal quota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>tion marks omitted) (citing <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 327-28, 115 S.Ct. 851).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Whether and to what extent AED-PA applies to <em>Schlup </em>claims is the threshold question. One of the most significant changes wrought by AEDPA was to provide that, with certain limited exceptions, a petition for federal habeas must be denied if it is founded on a \u201cclaim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). With respect to a <em>Schlup </em>claim of actual innocence, however, we do not believe that this provision applies. State courts have no occasion to adjudicate a <em>Schlup </em>claim as such and \u201cthe MAR court\u2019s primary holding\u2014that the [ineffective assistance of counsel] claim was procedurally barred'\u2014was not an \u2018adjudication on the merits\u2019 under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\u201d <em>Stephens v. Branker, </em>570 F.3d 198, 208 (4th Cir.2009); <em>but see Cooper v. Brown, </em>565 F.3d 581, 638 (9th Cir.2009) (Rymer, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">But while a state court does not adjudicate a <em>Schlup </em>claim, it may well decide matters relevant to one, quite possibly in the course of deciding highly similar issues of state or federal law. In addition to Section 2254(d), AEDPA also provides that in a habeas proceeding challenging a state conviction, \u201ca determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). The habeas petitioner bears \u201cthe burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While Section 2254(d) thus has no application in the context of a <em>Schlup </em>claim because it pertains only to a \u201cclaim that was adjudicated\u201d in state court, Section 2254(e)(1) does come into play because it refers to the \u201cdetermination of a factual issue\u201d\u2014that is, to a state court\u2019s findings of fact, rather than its conclusions of federal law. <em>See Appel v. Horn, </em>250 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir.2001); <em>see also Goldblum v. Klem, </em>510 F.3d 204, 212, 221 n. 13 (3d Cir.2007) (applying presumption of correctness under Section 2254(e)(1) in resolving <em>Schlup </em>claim). This conclusion is generally consistent with the pre-AEDPA standard of review for factual matters, which recognized the need to defer to state court fact-finding as a matter of comity and federalism. <em>See Marshall v. Lonberger, </em>459 U.S. 422, 432, 103 S.Ct. 843, 74 L.Ed.2d 646 (1983); <em>Sumner v. Mata, </em>449 U.S. 539, 546-47,101 S.Ct. 764, 66 L.Ed.2d 722, (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">AEDPA does not make deference to state court fact-finding dependent on the adequacy of the procedures followed by the state court. <em>Teti v. Bender, </em>507 F.3d 50, 59 (1st Cir.2007); <em>Valdez v. Cockrell, </em>274 F.3d, 941, 951 &amp; n. 17 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Mendiola v. Schomig, </em>224 F.3d 589, 592 (7th Cir.2000). Nonetheless, the character of the process upon which the state court based its conclusion may have some bearing on whether a petitioner\u2019s showing amounts to \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence that the state court erred. <em>Mendiola, </em>224 F.3d at 592. Where the state court conducted an evidentiary hearing and explained its reasoning with some care, it should be particularly difficult to establish clear and convincing evidence of error on the state court\u2019s part. This is especially so when the court resolved issues like witness credibility, which are \u201cfactual determinations\u201d for purposes of Section 2254(e)(1). <em>Wilson v. Ozmint, </em>352 F.3d 847, 858 (4th Cir.2003). \u201c[F]or a federal habeas court to overturn a state court\u2019s credibility judgments, the state court\u2019s error must be stark and clear.\u201d <em>Cagle v. Branker, </em>520 F.3d 320, 324-25 (4th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Lonberger, </em>459 U.S. at 434, 103 S.Ct. 843); <em>see also Miller v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number><em>Fenton, </em>474 U.S. 104, 114, 106 S.Ct. 445, 88 L.Ed.2d 405 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">This all makes sense in the general scheme of things. AEDPA in general and Section 2254(e) in particular were designed \u201cto further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 420, 436, 120 S.Ct. 1479, 146 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Section 2254(e)(1) plainly seeks to conserve judicial resources and reflects Congress\u2019s view that there is no reason for a do-over in federal court when it comes to facts already resolved by state tribunals. That section also reflects Congress\u2019s respect for principles of federalism, recognizing that a decision to set aside state court factual findings intrudes on the state\u2019s interest in administering its criminal law. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 340, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). The deference Section 2254(e)(1) requires has particular salience when a state court\u2019s determinations closely track the legal issues before the federal habeas court. Where a state court looks at the same body of relevant evidence and applies essentially the same legal standard to that evidence that the federal court does under <em>Schlup, </em>Section 2254(e)(1) requires that the state court\u2019s findings of fact not be casually cast aside. <em>See Miller, </em>474 U.S. at 113, 106 S.Ct. 445 (citation omitted). Indeed, the cavalier treatment of such findings in federal <em>Schlup </em>proceedings would contravene the course of federal-state relations set by the Congress and the Supreme Court with great consistency over a very considerable period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">In considering Sharpe\u2019s petition, the district court found that the combination of Sharpe\u2019s two alibi witnesses, Johnson\u2019s recantation, an absence of physical evidence linking Sharpe to the crime, and the testimony of Highsmith and Powell amounted to \u201ca strong showing\u201d under <em>Schlup, </em>and that Sharpe\u2019s procedural default on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim should therefore be excused. <em>Sharpe, </em>571 F.Supp.2d at 681. Yet the MAR court considered all this evidence and more, and specifically found that Powell\u2019s testimony, Highsmith\u2019s hearsay testimony, and Johnson\u2019s recantation were not credible and that Johnson\u2019s original testimony at trial was. Unless Sharpe could present clear and convincing evidence that those findings were unwarranted, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1), the district court was obliged to respect them in ruling on Sharpe\u2019s <em>Schlup </em>claim. The district court, however, did not so much as acknowledge the MAR court\u2019s efforts, other than to note in passing that the motion based on Powell\u2019s testimony had been rejected. <em>Sharpe, </em>571 F.Supp.2d at 678. Nowhere in its discussion of Sharpe\u2019s actual innocence claim did it so much as mention the MAR court\u2019s having probed and assessed the evidence that was the basis for the claim. <em>See id. </em>at 680-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">The court\u2019s failure to do so was error. At the outset, we note that the MAR court provided a much more substantial fact-finding process than the district court and was far better positioned to decide the sorts of factual matters that the district court opted to decide for itself. The MAR court heard from nineteen witnesses altogether. The transcripts of the MAR evidentiary hearings total more than three hundred pages. Lest there be any doubt, the MAR court repeatedly alluded to its impressions of the demeanor and comportment of various witnesses and made it clear that its judgments were informed by those observations. The district court, by contrast, held only a truncated evidentiary hearing and made no findings of fact or assessments of credibility. Where, for ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>ample, the MAR court concluded that Johnson\u2019s recantation was untrustworthy after hearing from a dozen different witnesses on the matter, the district court credited Johnson\u2019s recantation without hearing even from Johnson, let alone anyone else who could speak to the veracity of her statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">We also note that the MAR court was tasked with an inquiry similar to that required of the district court. It considered Sharpe\u2019s claim for a new trial under North Carolina law based on new evidence of actual innocence. The claim was rejected after considering Powell\u2019s testimony in light of a holistic examination of the entire record, including both Johnson\u2019s recantation and Highsmith\u2019s story of Smith\u2019s confession. The court\u2019s decision was based on a preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>See State v. Beaver, </em>291 N.C. 137, 229 S.E.2d 179, 183 (1976). The only appreciable respect in which the state court\u2019s legal analysis differed from <em>Schlwp </em>was that the court itself evaluated the evidence, rather than attempting to predict the reaction of hypothetical jurors to that evidence. <em>See Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 329, 115 S.Ct. 851 (actual innocence is based upon \u201ca probabilistic determination\u201d that \u201cno juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to find [petitioner] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d). Given the similarity of the state proceedings to petitioner\u2019s habeas claims under <em>Schlup, </em>the state court\u2019s factual determinations should have exerted a heavy pull on the habeas court\u2019s adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Turning to the reasoning of the MAR court\u2019s opinion, we note that the explanations it provided were commendably thorough. The district court\u2019s explanation of its <em>Schlup </em>ruling consisted of five sentences. <em>See Sharpe, </em>571 F.Supp.2d at 681. By contrast, the MAR court\u2019s analysis on the single issue of Powell\u2019s credibility took up eleven pages. And in terms of substance, we find the MAR court\u2019s conclusions to be plainly reasonable and certainly uncontradicted by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">In determining that Dearl Powell\u2019s testimony \u201centirely lacks credibility,\u201d the MAR court exhaustively catalogued the problems with it. We touch only a few of those problems here. Powell\u2019s account did not square with the medical examiner\u2019s testimony as to the bullet\u2019s trajectory. It was also inconsistent with the fact that Wilbur Mercer and Damien Smith were like father and son and Mercer had been at Smith\u2019s bedside when life support was turned off, yet in Powell\u2019s account, Mercer was sitting next to Radcliffe in the truck when Smith fired the fatal shot. No explanation was provided for why Smith would \u201cendanger someone so close to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">Powell\u2019s claim that Radcliffe drove the car into Vines\u2019s lot was inconsistent with the medical examiner\u2019s opinion that Radcliffe would have lost all consciousness within seconds of being shot. Powell\u2019s claim that Smith had robbed Radcliffe was inconsistent with the fact that money was found in Radcliffe\u2019s wallet. Powell\u2019s account, in which Joyner \u201cplays no part,\u201d was inconsistent with the fact that Joyner pled guilty as an accessory. Powell denied that the shooting had taken place in Sharpe drug-selling territory, contradicting the testimony of multiple witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">The MAR court also noted reasons to doubt Powell\u2019s motive in testifying and his general trustworthiness. Powell claimed that he was moved to come forward because he did not want to see an innocent man go to jail, yet somehow Powell did not come forward for six years and thereby \u201callowed not just one, but two men, the Defendant and Mark Joyner, to serve prison sentences for a crime they did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>commit.\u201d The court noted that Powell adopted a \u201cbelligerent[ ]\u201d attitude on the stand inconsistent with his claim that it was his conscience that prompted him to come forward. The court expressed skepticism at Powell\u2019s suggestion that it was simply a \u201c \u2018 coincidence\u2019 \u201d he came forward just in time for Sharpe\u2019s federal habeas hearing, and it noted that Powell sat with Sharpe\u2019s family and supporters throughout the MAR proceedings. It also took account of Powell\u2019s own criminal record and the fact that he too was a drug dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In contrast, the MAR court found that Johnson\u2019s and Stokes\u2019s original trial testimony was believable. That testimony was consistent with the rest of the evidentiary record in every way that Powell\u2019s testimony was not. Furthermore, Johnson and Stokes \u201cindependently and separately\u201d came forward soon after Radcliffe\u2019s shooting and gave accounts that were consistent with one another. Both Stokes and Johnson were subjected to rigorous cross-examination, but neither wavered in her testimony. The truthfulness of Johnson\u2019s original testimony was also corroborated by numerous witnesses who testified that Johnson consistently gave the same account before trial, even though she had been \u201cseverely\u201d beaten for having identified Sharpe to the police. Both Stokes and Johnson \u201chad to have known that it was very dangerous to spread a lie, if it was one, about Dontae Sharpe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The MAR court also found reasons to question the credibility of Johnson\u2019s recantation and Highsmith\u2019s hearsay testimony. Johnson was \u201cyoung and lonely\u201d and only recanted after having befriended Sharpe and his family. Highsmith\u2019s story was particularly dubious in light of the fact that, although the police had originally suspected her of murdering Smith, she somehow never told them what would have been an exculpatory story of Smith\u2019s confession and his subsequent emotional turmoil and suicide. And despite the reward that was being offered for information about the killing, Highsmith did not tell anyone her story until the eve of trial. The court also took account of Highsmith\u2019s criminal record. Furthermore, even if Highsmith was telling the truth, the court noted reasons to doubt the veracity of Smith\u2019s supposed confession. Smith was a drug user and was emotionally disturbed, as evidenced by his suicide. Any confession would also need to be discounted as hearsay, uttered entirely in private, rather than offered under oath in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Finally, the MAR court noted that investigators could not find witnesses and that \u201c[pjeople behaved as though they were afraid to speak.\u201d That finding was consistent with the killer being a live drug dealer, capable of striking fear into the heart of the community, rather than a dead man, who could strike fear into no one. And the MAR court recognized that Highsmith\u2019s story may well have formed a \u201cnucleus\u201d around which to build a story implicating Smith, who by then was \u201cconveniently dead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Based on all of these considerations, the state court concluded that Sharpe had not established by a preponderance of the evidence that Johnson\u2019s and Stokes\u2019s trial testimony had been called into any real doubt. That conclusion and the subsidiary determinations on which it rested should have been taken into account in the district court\u2019s analysis of the requirements set out in <em>Sehlup. </em>Even without the deference that AEDPA mandates, there is little basis for concluding that Sharpe had successfully made out his <em>Sehlup </em>claim. But when the requirements of Section 2254(e)(1) are factored in, the appropriate course for the district court was apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Sharpe\u2019s flawed <em>Schlup </em>claim is not the only problem with his habeas petition. Even if the procedural default could somehow be excused, Sharpe\u2019s ineffective assistance argument has its own deficiencies. Sharpe\u2019s ineffectiveness claim centers on the proposed testimony of Tracy Highsmith, who, as noted, was prepared to tell the jury that her boyfriend Damien Smith had confessed to the murder prior to his suicide three weeks later. Sharpe argues that his attorney\u2019s failure to argue for the admission of Highsmith\u2019s testimony at trial either as a statement against penal interest under North Carolina evidentiary law or under the due process principle established in <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973), denied him the right to effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">To make out such a claim, Sharpe must show (1) \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient,\u201d and (2) \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). With respect to the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, Sharpe \u201cmust show that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance \u201cmust be highly deferential,\u201d and a reviewing court must avoid the biases of hindsight. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Under the second prong of the test, Sharpe must establish that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694,104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">It should be obvious that the failure of Sharpe\u2019s gateway actual innocence claim under <em>Schlup </em>makes it less likely that Sharpe\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim would succeed on the merits. First, unlike the <em>Schlup </em>claim, Sharpe\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was rejected in the state court proceedings, and the state courts\u2019 disposition of that claim is entitled to the full measure of AEDPA deference. Second, the range of materials favorable to Sharpe\u2019s case that are relevant to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim is more restricted than those relevant to his actual innocence claim. Newly discovered post-trial evidence\u2014Powell\u2019s testimony and Charlene Johnson\u2019s recantation\u2014would have no bearing on Sharpe\u2019s particular Sixth Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">As discussed, Section 2254(d) ordinarily bars federal habeas relief for \u201cany claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,\u201d and the MAR court rejected Sharpe\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim on substantive, as well as procedural, grounds. Despite Sharpe\u2019s contention to the contrary, a state court\u2019s alternative holding on the merits of a constitutional claim qualifies for deference under Section 2254(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Stephens, </em>570 F.3d at 208; <em>accord Brooks v. Bagley, </em>513 F.3d 618, 624 (6th Cir.2008); <em>see also Harris, </em>489 U.S. at 264 n. 10, 109 S.Ct. 1038. In order to win relief, Sharpe would therefore need to show that the MAR court\u2019s adjudication on the merits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>either \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or was \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). Furthermore, under Section 2254(e)(1), factual findings must be taken as correct unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. <em>Miller-El v. Dretke, </em>545 U.S. 231, 240, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">In this case, the MAR court found that Sharpe failed both prongs of <em>Strickland </em>because Highsmith\u2019s testimony would not have been admissible under the hearsay exceptions Sharpe claims his attorney should have invoked. The court reasoned that since the testimony would not have been admissible, Sharpe\u2019s counsel was not ineffective in failing to argue for its introduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Certainly, the MAR court did not reach a result \u201ccontrary to\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>since it relied on the case and correctly articulated its holding. Nor did it unreasonably apply <em>Strickland </em>in concluding that, since Highsmith\u2019s testimony was inadmissible, it was neither objectively unreasonable nor prejudicial to Sharpe\u2019s case to refrain from seeking its admission. \u201cCounsel is not required to engage in the filing of futile motions.\u201d <em>Moody v. Polk, </em>408 F.3d 141, 151 (4th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). Therefore, the only question is whether the MAR court\u2019s conclusion that the testimony would not have been admissible was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The North Carolina Rules of Evidence allow a person\u2019s statement that would otherwise be excluded as hearsay to be admitted in a criminal trial if, <em>inter alia, </em>the statement \u201cso far tended to subject him to civil or criminal liability ... that a reasonable man in his position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true\u201d and if \u201ccorroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d N.C.G.S. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 804(b)(3). The MAR court concluded that a confession by Smith made at home and only to his live-in girlfriend was not one that would tend to subject Smith to criminal liability. It also held that the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement indicated that the statement was <em>not </em>trustworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">The district court cast aside this conclusion, arguing that there was no North Carolina authority for the proposition that a statement made only to a live-in girlfriend could not constitute a statement against penal interest. <em>See Sharpe, </em>595 F.Supp.2d at 643. It is beyond the mandate of federal habeas courts, however, to correct the interpretation by state courts of a state\u2019s own laws. <em>Cagle, </em>520 F.3d at 324 (citing <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991)). To do so only on the basis of an absence of authority to support the state court\u2019s conclusion, rather than the presence of contrary authority, is particularly misguided.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Thus, Sharpe\u2019s entire Sixth Amendment claim, and the correctness of the result reached by the district court, hinges on establishing that it was unreasonable for the MAR court to conclude that the due process interpretation given in <em>Chambers, </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297, would not have supported the introduction of Highsmith\u2019s testimony. <em>Chambers </em>required that a defendant be allowed to introduce evidence that a third party had confessed to the crime of which the defendant stood accused. <em>Id. </em>at 302, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>93 S.Ct. 1038. In <em>Chambers, </em>however, the third party confessed in writing, orally confessed to three different people, and was available to testify at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 297, 93 S.Ct. 1038. The MAR court noted that the deceased Smith\u2019s alleged oral confession only to his girlfriend differed in every respect from the situation in <em>Chambers, </em>and that, according to the Supreme Court, <em>Chambers </em>\u201cspecifically confined its holding to the \u2018facts and circumstances\u2019 presented in that case.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 316, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998) (plurality) (quoting <em>Chambers, </em>410 U.S. at 303, 93 S.Ct. 1038).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">In addition, the result in <em>Chambers </em>was predicated on the existence of \u201cpersuasive assurances of trustworthiness,\u201d <em>Chambers, </em>410 U.S. at 302, 93 S.Ct. 1038, and the MAR court provided numerous reasons to consider the Highsmith hearsay untrustworthy. These included Highsmith\u2019s criminal record, the fact that she never came forward with her testimony until the eve of trial, the fact that Smith was obviously emotionally disturbed, the fact that Smith allegedly claimed to have robbed the victim when Radcliffe\u2019s wallet was found in the truck with fifty three dollars in it, and the fact that no evidence in the record at the time of trial corroborated Highsmith\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">As it had done with the MAR court\u2019s North Carolina Rules of Evidence ruling, the district court rejected the MAR court\u2019s conclusion on <em>Chambers. </em>It never once considered the differences noted by the MAR court between the Highsmith hearsay and the facts of <em>Chambers. </em>Instead, it offered a smattering of reasons to credit Highsmith\u2019s testimony, including Johnson\u2019s post-trial recantation. <em>Sharpe, </em>595 F.Supp.2d at 644. And it took issue with the MAR court\u2019s reasoning that the money in Radcliffe\u2019s wallet undermined Highsmith\u2019s story, since Radcliffe might have been robbed without losing all of his cash. <em>Id. </em>at 644-45. The court ignored all the other indications of untrustworthiness cited by the MAR court.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Furthermore, in assessing Sharpe\u2019s <em>Strickland </em>claim, the district court also erred in taking into account Johnson\u2019s recantation. Johnson\u2019s recantation occurred after Sharpe\u2019s conviction, and it cannot be used to suggest that it was more likely that the Highsmith hearsay would have been admitted, since neither Sharpe\u2019s counsel nor the trial judge could possibly have been aware of it. Nor can Johnson\u2019s recantation be used to suggest that Sharpe might not have been convicted if Highsmith\u2019s testimony had been introduced, since the jury would not have known of it either. \u201c[A] court deciding an actual ineffectiveness claim must judge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, viewed <em>as of the time </em>of counsel\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (emphasis added). The North Carolina courts were certainly reasonable in determining that the difficulties in Sharpe\u2019s case lay not in any deficiency of counsel but in the understandable reluctance of the state system to buy a belated and contrived attempt to pin Radcliffe\u2019s murder on someone who was all-too-conveniently deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">There is little left to say as to Sharpe\u2019s petition except that it overlooks the state courts\u2019 efforts at every turn and in every way. Quite aside from the damage inflicted on AEDPA and dual sovereignty, a ruling in Sharpe\u2019s favor would fail to recognize the dedicated manner in which the state court system went about its work. The encouragement of capable and conscientious judging on the part of states is what comity is all about. The state courts did their job well here and this case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>accordingly remanded with directions that the federal habeas petition be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\">. In light of the district court's conclusion that the timeliness of Sharpe\u2019s federal habeas petition has been established as law of the case, we decline the state\u2019s invitation to consider anew whether Sharpe's second petition was time-barred under AEDPA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-7\">. Sharpe also asserts that the MAR court rejected his ineffective assistance of counsel claim \"without any substantive analysis,\u201d but that allegation is plainly untrue. The MAR court's discussion of Sharpe's claim was extensive, and Sharpe himself takes issue with various points in the court's reasoning. At any rate, \u00a7 2254(d) applies to a state court\u2019s rejection of a constitutional claim even where the court \"did not articulate the rationale underlying its rejection\u201d of the claim. <em>Bell v.
