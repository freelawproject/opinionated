We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On March 21,1994, the victim, Amenophis Morris, was shot and killed while standing on the porch of his home on Exchange Street in New Haven. Earlier that day, the defendant had had a confrontation with Jeffrey Dolphin, with whom the defendant sold drugs. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>defendant believed Dolphin was responsible for a third party\u2019s loss of certain drugs. After the confrontation, Jermaine Harris, Trent Butler and Terrence Stevenson arrived, and the defendant told them that Dolphin was responsible for losing the drugs. Stevenson and Dolphin went to look for the drugs but were unsuccessful. Thereafter, Dolphin and Stevenson reunited with Harris, Butler and the defendant. Harris pulled a gun on Dolphin and stated, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we make this asshole do it?\u201d Stevenson asked Dolphin if he had ever killed anyone, to which Dolphin replied that he had not. Stevenson told Dolphin that there was someone he wanted Dolphin to kill. Then, Stevenson forced Dolphin into the defendant\u2019s car, and all five men drove off. Dolphin heard the name \u201cAmenophis\u201d and heard a reference to money that was owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The defendant drove to Exchange Street and parked the car. Harris and Stevenson got out of the car and walked up to the victim, who was standing on his porch. Harris was carrying a gun and was wearing a black army fatigue jacket and a mask. The defendant and Butler got out of the car and stood in front of it. Dolphin heard five to eight shots and observed the victim fall. Thereafter, the men jumped into the car, and Harris said, \u201cI got that bastard.\u201d Eventually, the men let Dolphin out of the car. Before doing so, however, Butler told Dolphin, \u201cI know where your mother and sister live,\u201d and, \u201cThey\u2019ve been finding bodies in Bridgeport.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The victim\u2019s neighbor, Luis Deleon, observed the shooting from his porch across the street. He saw a person wearing a black mask and an army jacket walk toward the victim\u2019s residence, pull out a gun and fire six shots. He saw the victim fall to the ground, and he saw the assailant flee.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court violated his constitutional right to present a defense under the sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>amendment to the United States constitution and violated his right to a fair trial under the fifth amendment to the United States constitution by precluding him from inquiring into the identity of a police informant. The defendant argues that the state is required to disclose the identity of an informant when that information is critical to the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. The defendant argues that disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity was necessary to determine the source of exculpatory information. He contends that the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit this inquiry adversely impacted his sixth amendment right to present a defense, namely, that a third party was responsible for the murder. The defendant also argues that the state did not adequately assert its claim of privilege and that consequently, the trial court did not properly weigh the applicable competing interests in its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The facts relevant to this claim are as follows. During its case-in-chief, the state called as a witness Detective Hilden Wright of the New Haven police department. Duiing cross-examination, the defendant asked Wright if he had received information that someone by the name of \u201cRa-Ra\u201d Diaz was responsible for killing the victim. The state objected to that question, and a hearing was held outside of the presence of the jury. The defendant stated that Wright\u2019s police report indicated that Wright had received information from an anonymous informant that two individuals known as Ra-Ra Diaz and Jose \u201cLittle\u201d Melendez had killed the victim because the victim failed to carry out a murder ordered by the Latin Kings gang. The court sustained the state\u2019s objection on the ground that the question was outside the scope of direct examination. The court informed the defendant that he could call Wright in his case-in-chief if he wanted to pursue this line of inquiry. Rather than subpoena Wright at a later time, however, the defendant requested the court\u2019s permission to present an offer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>proof. The defendant asked Wright for the name of the person who had told him that Ra-Ra was responsible for the victim\u2019s death. The state objected on the ground that the defendant was requesting information regarding the informant\u2019s identity. The court sustained the objection. Upon further questioning by the defendant, Wright testified that the informant stated that someone had told him that Ra-Ra killed the victim, but the informant did not tell Wright who had told him. Furthermore, Wright stated that the person who told the informant that Ra-Ra was responsible for the murder had heard it from someone else, whom the informant did not identify. On the basis of that voir dire, the trial court refused to allow the defendant to present evidence that a third party killed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u201c \u2018What is usually referred to as the informer\u2019s privilege is in reality the Government\u2019s privilege to withhold from disclosure the identity of persons who furnish information of violations of law to officers charged with enforcement of that law. . . . The purpose of the privilege is the furtherance and protection of the public interest in effective law enforcement. The privilege recognizes the obligation of citizens to communicate their knowledge of the commission of crimes to law-enforcement officials and, by preserving their anonymity, encourages them to perform that obligation.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>204 Conn. 654, 657-58, 529 A.2d 1236 (1987), quoting <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 59, 77 S. Ct. 623, 1 L. Ed. 2d 639 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\"><em>\u201cRoviaro </em>established a test for assessing challenges to the applicability of the informant\u2019s privilege. This test involves the balancing of two competing interests: (1) the preservation of the \u2018underlying purpose\u2019 of the privilege; and (2) the \u2018fundamental requirements of fairness.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>239 Conn. 629, 632, 687 A.2d 485 (1997), quoting <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 353 U.S. 60. \u201cThe fundamental requirements of fairness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>comprise the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, including the right to obtain information relevant and helpful to a defense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 632-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u201cWhile an informant\u2019s or government\u2019s privilege exists, it must yield where it would interfere with a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. \u2018Where the disclosure of an informer\u2019s identity ... is relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused, or is essential to a fair determination of a cause, the privilege must give way.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 658, quoting <em>Rovi-aro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 353 U.S. 60-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s determination to apply the privilege is reviewed for abuse of discretion. . . . [W]e will disturb the trial court\u2019s findings only when those findings are clearly erroneous as where there is no evidence in the record to support such findings.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 634-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u201cBefore a court will compel disclosure, the informant typically must be a participant in the alleged crime or an eyewitness thereto.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>30 Conn. App. 470, 479, 620 A.2d 1303 (1993), aff'd, 229 Conn. 60, 640 A.2d 553 (1994); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 636-37 (disclosure of informant\u2019s identity essential to defense \u201cwhere \u2018the informant is a key witness or participant in the crime charged, someone whose testimony would be significant in determining guilt or innocence\u2019 \u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>178 Conn. 444, 445, 423 A.2d 117 (1979) (no requirement that identity of informer, who was not actual participant in or witness to drug sale, be disclosed); <em>State </em>v. <em>McDaniel, </em>176 Conn. 131, 134, 405 A.2d 68 (1978) (in absence of information that informant was actual participant in or witness to offense charged, trial court did not improperly deny request for identity).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>McDaniel, </em>supra, 176 Conn. 131, our Supreme Court did not compel disclosure of an informant\u2019s identity where the information supplied by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>informant to the police was based on hearsay. In that case, \u201cthe informer\u2019s knowledge was limited to what he had heard was about to occur and ... it was that hearsay information which he passed on to the authorities.\u201d Id., 133. The <em>McDaniel court </em>rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that he had an absolute right to disclosure of the identity of an informant because the informant\u2019s testimony may have been relevant to the defense. Id., 134; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 663 (\u201c[m]ere speculation that the informant\u2019s information will be helpful to the defense is not sufficient to mandate disclosure\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>supra, 178 Conn. 446 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">In the present case, it is undisputed that the informant was not a participant in or a witness to the crime. Wright stated that the information he received from the informant was based on hearsay.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the defendant\u2019s assertion that the informant provided direct evidence of the identity of the shooters that would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>material to the outcome of the trial is meritless. The informant\u2019s information was based on hearsay, which is insufficient to support a conclusion that disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity was essential to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">We find no merit in the defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court did not have before it sufficient facts to render its decision. The defendant\u2019s voir dire of Wright established that the informant\u2019s information was based on hearsay. The defendant\u2019s contention that the testimony of a state\u2019s witness, Alton Williams, that the victim was involved in a dispute with the Latin Kings gang and that Puerto Rican men in a red car were repeatedly driving around the victim\u2019s neighborhood on the day of the shooting was sufficient to demonstrate his need for disclosure of the identity of the informer does not change the nature of the information the informant provided to Wright.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s request for disclosure of the identity of the informant, and that the defendant\u2019s rights to a fair trial and to present a defense were not violated thereby.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly refused to allow him to produce evidence that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>third party was responsible for the victim\u2019s death. This argument is linked to the defendant\u2019s first claim because the defendant contends that he was precluded from discovering evidence of third party culpability because he did not have access to the identity of the informant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">As previously noted, the defendant made an offer of proof in which he questioned Wright about whether he had information that the individuals known as Ra-Ra and Little were responsible for killing the victim. In refusing to allow the defendant to question Wright on this point, the court told the defense counsel that \u201cyou seem to have already put the cart before the horse and elevated what the officer was told by this person as evidence of third party guilt. All I\u2019ve heard so far is third or fourth hand hearsay from unidentified sources that simply does not establish the kind of third party guilt evidence that is properly admissible in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The defendant also sought to question Williams on the issue of third party culpability. Williams testified on direct examination by the state that he was standing on the porch with the victim prior to the shooting. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Williams stepped from the porch, he heard gunshots and saw the victim fall. During cross-examination, the defendant asked Williams whether he was aware of the victim\u2019s \u201chaving some problems with anybody else.\u201d The state objected, and a hearing was held outside of the presence of the jury. The defendant stated that he wanted to present evidence through Williams that a third party committed the murder. In an offer of proof, Williams testified that at the time of the shooting, the victim told him that he had a \u201cbeef\u2019 with a member of the Latin Kangs gang. Williams also testified that on the day of the shooting, he observed several Puerto Rican men driving around the victim\u2019s neighborhood in a red car. After the shooting, he saw the red car parked near the victim\u2019s residence with its ignition on and later saw the police tow the car away. The court refused to allow the defendant to present this evidence. The court stated: \u201cAt this point, to the extent that [the defendant] has renewed his offer of proof with respect to third party guilt, clearly . . . there is nothing more than a . . . miasma of speculation that in no way amounts to the kind of direct connection that the case law suggests is required before third party evidence can be introduced in front of the jury. So, to the extent you have renewed your request to pursue that line of inquiry with Mr. Williams, based on what you have offered me today, it is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u201cIt is well established that a defendant has a right to introduce evidence that another person committed the offense with which the defendant is charged.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sauris, </em>227 Conn. 389, 401, 631 A.2d 238 (1993). The defendant must, however, present evidence that directly connects the third party to the crime. Id. \u201c \u2018It is not enough ... to show that another had the motive to commit the crime . . . nor is it enough to raise a bare suspicion that some other person may have committed the crime of which the defendant is accused.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Id., quoting <em>State </em>v. Hernandez, 224 Conn. 196, 202, 618 A.2d 494 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u201cThe admissibility of evidence of third party culpability is governed by the rules relating to relevancy.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>223 Conn. 535, 549, 613 A.2d 770 (1992). Relevancy is an evidentiary question, and \u201c[e]videntiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>219 Conn. 93, 114, 591 A.2d 1246 (1991). \u201cIn determining relevancy, [t]he court must determine whether the proffered evidence is corroborative or coincidental, whether it is probative or tends to obfuscate, and whether it clarifies or obscures. In arriving at its conclusion, the trial court is in the best position to view the evidence in the context of the entire case, and we will not intervene unless there is a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>30 Conn. App. 164, 178, 619 A.2d 872 (1993), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 229 Conn. 10, 639 A.2d 1007 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">We conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in determining that the proffered evidence was insufficient to connect a third party to the crime. The evidence presented in the defendant\u2019s offer of proof indicated only that the victim and a member of the Latin Kings gang had a disagreement and that persons who might have been members of that gang were in the victim\u2019s neighborhood on the day of the shooting. While the proffered evidence might provide a basis to suspect that a member of the gang was responsible for the shooting, that evidence is too tenuous to be considered relevant. The defendant\u2019s claim that the proffered evidence \u201cdirectly points\u201d to a \u201cspecific third party as a culprit\u201d is without merit. Evidence regarding the Latin Kings gang and the red car was inadmissible because there was no evidence that directly connected a mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>ber of that gang or an occupant of that vehicle to the crime with which the defendant was charged. \u201cUnless that direct connection exists it is within the sound discretion of the trial court to refuse to admit such evidence when it simply affords a possible ground of possible suspicion against another person.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 549-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim that Wright had relevant information connecting a third party to the crime is equally unavailing. As noted previously, the defendant sought to introduce evidence that two individuals known as Ra-Ra and Little killed the victim. The defendant could not establish a direct connection between those individuals and the crime because the information the informant gave to Wright was based on hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\"><em>In State v. Alvarez, </em>216 Conn. 301, 579 A.2d 515 (1990), the defendant attempted to introduce evidence that a third party was responsible for shooting the victim. The defendant argued that the trial court should have allowed a police officer to testify to a statement made to him by an eyewitness to the shooting incident. In an offer of proof made out of the presence of the jury, the officer testified that the eyewitness told him that he thought he saw a person named Rasheem shoot the victim. Our Supreme Court explained that while this evidence directly connected Rasheem with the crime and, thus, was relevant, it would be admissible only if the evidence \u201cwas not excluded by some other rule or principle of law.\u201d Id., 305. The court noted, however, that the police officer\u2019s statement was hearsay that did not fall within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule. Thus, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit the statement. As in <em>Alvarez, </em>the evidence offered by the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>in this case, namely that Ra-Ra and Little killed the victim, was based on hearsay and was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b289-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 provides in relevant part: \u201cCriminal liability for acts of another, (a) A person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b289-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of conspiracy when, with intent that conduct constituting a crime be performed, he agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct, and any one of them commits an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b294-5\"> The defendant asked the following questions and elicited the following responses during his voir dire of Wright:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">\u201cQ.

Although the record in this case does not reveal the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision, \u201c[w]e do not presume error; the trial court\u2019s ruling is entitled to the reasonable presumption that it is correct unless the party challenging the ruling has satisfied its burden demonstrating the contrary.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crumpton, </em>202 Conn, 224, 231, 520 A.2d 226 (1987). The defendant has failed to meet this burden. The defendant could have requested an articulation of the trial court\u2019s decision if he believed that the trial court did not properly balance the parties\u2019 competing interests in sustaining the state\u2019s objection to the defendant\u2019s inquiry regarding the identity of the informant. \u201c [A] claim of error cannot be predicated on an assumption that the trial court acted erroneously.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

Ed. 2d 215 (1963), and thereby prevented him from fully exercising his right to present a defense under the fifth amendment. \u201cIn order to prove a <em>Brady </em>violation, the defendant must show: (1) that the prosecution suppressed evidence after a request by the defense; (2) that the evidence was favorable to the defense; and (3) that the evidence was material.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>225 Conn. 55, 90, 621 A.2d 728 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion for discovery, requesting that the state provide him with exculpatory information. In response, the state provided the defendant with Wright\u2019s police report, which included the information from the informant that Ra-Ra and Little shot the victim. In his brief, the defendant admits that the state did not suppress this exculpatory information. The defendant contends that the state improperly suppressed the identity of the informant, which deprived the defendant of the means by which to investigate the exculpatory information. For those reasons, the defendant was not entitled to disclosure of the identity of the informant. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim of a <em>Brady </em>violation is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
