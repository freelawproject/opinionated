Mattegat and Melanie Mattegat, appeal from the judgment, rendered after a trial to the court, finding the defendant DUBL M. Enterprises, Inc., doing business as Housemaster of America (Housemaster),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> negligent in the performance of a property inspection contract and awarding damages to the plaintiffs. On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly (1) held that the recovery of damages for Housemaster\u2019s negligence was limited to those damages that were reasonably foreseeable, (2) employed the cost to repair the property, rather than the diminution in the property\u2019s fair market value, as the measure of damages and (3) concluded that the cost to repair the property was $17,000. Housemaster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>cross appeals, claiming that the trial court improperly failed to restrict the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery of damages to the amount of the inspection fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The following facts are relevant. The plaintiffs executed a contract with Housemaster to perform an inspection of the premises at 154 South Main Street in Newtown prior to the plaintiffs\u2019 purchase of that property. On March 15, 1993, Richard Warren, an agent of Housemaster, performed the inspection, which included a probe for wood destroying insect infestation. The plaintiffs signed the contract, titled, \u201cInspection Order Agreement\u201d (agreement), in which they opted for a \u201cLimited-Time Inspection\u201d with no warranty,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rather than an \u201cExtended-Time Inspection\u201d with a six month warranty. The agreement contained a clause that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>is at the center of the parties\u2019 dispute. Housemaster claims that this clause limited its liability for any postinspection claims to the amount of the inspection fee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties did not discuss this clause prior to the plaintiffs\u2019 signing of the contract. The agreement was signed on the day of and at the site of the inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">In his inspection report, Warren stated, under the headings \u201cInfestation Status\u201d and \u201cTreatment or Damage Indications,\u201d that he found no visible evidence of past or current wood destroying insect infestation and no visible evidence or prior treatment for wood destroying insects. Under the heading \u201cLimitations or Conducive Conditions,\u201d his report stated that there were conditions conducive to wood destroying insect infestation in the form of rot and decay. Warren also testified at trial that he did not observe any termite \u201cmud tubes\u201d or any destruction due to termite infestation. Warren indicated in his report that he was unable to inspect visually the entire premises because of snow and inaccessible crawl spaces. He further noted that certain areas of the premises showed signs of rot and that such conditions were conducive to infestation.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">On the basis of Warren\u2019s inspection report, the plaintiffs purchased the property without further inspection for wood destroying insects. Immediately after closing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>the purchase, the plaintiffs began renovations on the property and soon discovered swarms of insects in the structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Mark Moore, a licensed exterminator, and Ronald Rennert, a consulting structural engineer, testified at trial as expert witnesses for the plaintiffs. Both Moore and Rennert were hired to view and examine the premises in June, 1993. They each testified that there was extensive <em>visible </em>evidence of wood destroying insect infestation in the building and that Warren had not exercised proper care in performing his inspection. Rennert immediately noticed a termite mud tube and testified that other mud tubes were readily observable without disruption of any of the building\u2019s timbers. Ren-nert, after viewing the premises, advised the plaintiffs that the damage was so extensive that the building was structurally unsound and should be razed. The plaintiffs notified Housemaster of the insect problem, and Housemaster offered to refund the plaintiffs\u2019 inspection fee, which the plaintiffs refused. The plaintifflater razed the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The trial court found that Housemaster was negligent because of its failure to use reasonable care in inspecting and evaluating the premises for visible damage and infestation. The court specifically concluded that Housemaster had failed to identify overt structural defects caused by infestation and visible signs of infestation. The court held that damages resulting from Housemaster\u2019s negligence were limited to those that were reasonably foreseeable and awarded the plaintiffs $775 for permits and renovation work, $2090 for the services of the structural engineer and $17,000 for the cost to repair the premises. The damage award amounted to $19,865, reduced by $11,000, which the plaintiffs had recovered previously from the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>real estate agent,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> leaving $8965 to be paid by Housemaster.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">We first address Housemaster\u2019s cross appeal, which contends that a clause in the parties\u2019 contract limits the plaintiffs\u2019 damages to $225, the amount of the inspection fee. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">It is unclear whether Housemaster is claiming that paragraph six of the parties\u2019 contract is a liquidated damages clause or a disclaimer of liability clause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We will address both possibilities. The clause states in part: \u201cCOMPANY LIABILITY. The Company\u2019s liability for any Client post-inspection (Limited-Time) claims is limited to a maximum of the inspection fee paid unless an inspection warranty was purchased by the Client.\u201d We first turn to the question of whether the clause constitutes an enforceable liquidated damages provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\u201c[A] provision which allows liquidated damages for breach of contract is enforceable if certain conditions are satisfied. . . . The requisite three conditions are that: (1) the damage which was to be expected as a result of a breach of contract was uncertain in amount or difficult to prove; (2) there was an intent on the part of the parties to liquidate damages in advance; and (3) the amount stipulated was reasonable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>CMG Realty of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Colonnade One Ltd. Partnership, </em>36 Conn. App. 653, 667, 653 A.2d 207 (1995). Our review of the record and briefs indicates that these three requirements have not been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Housemaster offered no explanation of why damages would be uncertain in amount or difficult to prove. In fact, the plaintiff was able to prove $19,865 in damages to the trial court\u2019s satisfaction. Housemaster also failed to demonstrate an intent on behalf of the parties to liquidate damages in advance. Although the record indicates that the plaintiff Louis J. Mattegat had an opportunity to read the contract before signing it, the parties never discussed the liability clause and no effort was made by Housemaster to explain the extent of its obligation to the plaintiffs. The sole fact even remotely related to the intent of the parties is that the plaintiffs signed the preprinted agreement. That fact, standing alone, is not sufficient to establish an intent to liquidate damages in advance. Finally, the requirement that the \u201cstipulated\u201d amount be reasonable has not been satisfied. The inspection fee of $225 falls so far short of the damages claimed by the plaintiffs and of the trial court\u2019s award of reasonably foreseeable damages that the unreasonableness of the \u201cstipulated\u201d amount is apparent. We conclude that the clause at issue is not an enforceable liquidated damages clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We now turn to the question of whether the clause is an enforceable disclaimer of liability for negligence. A disclaimer is a \u201crefusal to recognize the existence of an obligation.\u201d Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d Ed. 1969). \u201cThe law does not favor contract provisions which relieve a person from his own negligence. See generally 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 195, comment b; 17 Am. Jur. 2d, Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 188, 189; 78 Am. Jur. 2d, Warehouses \u00a7 232; 8 Am. Jur. 2d, Bailments \u00a7\u00a7 139-141.\u201d <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Nationwide Moving &amp; Storage Co., </em>187 Conn. 405, 413, 446 A.2d 799 (1982); see also <em>Malone v. Santora, </em>135 Conn. 286, 293, 64 A.2d 51 (1949). The contract in this case was a preprinted form. Courts have shown a tendency to hold contracts of this type against public policy when entered into by professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>service providers in the course of dealing with the general public. See <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Nationwide Moving &amp; Storage Co., </em>supra, 413. Such provisions have been upheld, however, under appropriate conditions, such as the assent of both parties. There was no assent here to limit the service provider\u2019s liability. See id., 413-14. Housemaster has failed to demonstrate that the contract contained an enforceable disclaimer provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">We now turn to the plaintiffs\u2019 three claims on appeal, all of which relate to the amount of damages awarded to the plaintiffs by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 first claim is that the trial court improperly limited their recovery to those damages that were reasonably foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">This case seeks damages for the negligent performance of a contract, rather than for breach of contract. The trial court found as a fact that Housemaster was negligent in its performance of the termite inspection required by the parties\u2019 contract. This finding of negligence was amply supported by the evidence and cannot be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">The plaintiff is \u201centitled to recover all damages proximately caused by the [defendant\u2019s] negligent performance of the contract whether or not the results were reasonably to be anticipated.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Flammia, </em>169 Conn. 491, 499, 363 A.2d 1048 (1975); see also <em>Neiditz </em>v. <em>Morton S. Fine &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>199 Conn. 683, 689 n.3, 508 A.2d 438 (1986). The trial court\u2019s test for assessing damages in the present case was whether they were \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We must determine whether the court\u2019s test comports with that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number><em>Johnson </em>and <em>Neiditz. </em>There is a paucity of cases in Connecticut that discuss the test for measuring damages for negligent performance of a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">In <em>Neiditz, </em>the defendant was a professional corporation engaged in the business of land surveying and civil engineering that negligently prepared a map that it knew would be used by the plaintiffs in seeking a zone change. The trial court awarded damages to the plaintiffs for the increased costs of developing their property, which arose because of the defendant\u2019s negligence in preparing the map, including the cost of complying with conditions imposed by the zoning board that would not otherwise have been necessary. The Supreme Court upheld that award of damages. It stated that \u201ca party is liable only for those damages which are the proximate result of his negligence.\u201d <em>Neiditz </em>v. <em>Morton S. Fine &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 199 Conn. 689. The court distinguished the test of <em>Johnson </em>from that required in a breach of contract case, where damages are limited to those the defendant had reason to foresee as the probable result of the breach at the time the contract was executed. Id., 689 n.3, citing 3 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 351 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Neiditz </em>cases indicate that the proximate cause test for negligence applies when assessing damages for negligent performance of a contract. The requirement of proximate cause is a less severe limitation of liability than the requirement of anticipation or foreseeability in breach of contract cases. A proximate cause is \u201c[a]n actual cause that is a substantial factor in the resulting harm . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Abrahams </em>v. <em>Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., </em>240 Conn. 300, 306, 692 A.2d 709 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Although the trial court did not use the words \u201cproximate cause,\u201d the test used by the court comports with the proximate cause test of <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Neiditz. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>fundamental inquiry in all proximate cause questions is whether the harm that occurred was of the same general nature as the foreseeable risk created by the defendant\u2019s negligence. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manheimer, </em>212 Conn. 748, 758, 563 A.2d 699 (1989). The trial court did not confine its test to what damages Housemaster, at the time of contracting, may have anticipated or foreseen as a probable result of a breach; rather, the corut\u2019s test reflected the proximate cause query of what damages were reasonably foreseeable because they were within scope of the risk created by Housemaster\u2019s negligence. See id., 759. We therefore conclude that the trial court applied the proper causation standard for awarding damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 second damages claim is that the trial court improperly concluded that the measure of damages for Housemaster\u2019s negligence was the cost to repair the properly rather than the diminution in its fair market value. When proximate cause exists for damage to real estate, \u201c[t]he basic measure of damages for injury to real property is the resultant diminution in its value.\u201d <em>Ferri v. Pyramid Construction Co., </em>186 Corn. 682, 689, 443 A.2d 478 (1982). Such diminution in value may be determined, however, by the cost of repairing the damage as long as that cost does not exceed the former value of the property and the repairs do not enhance the value of the property over what it was prior to the damage. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The plaintiffs in the present case presented evidence at trial that the diminution in the value of the property amounted to $36,179. Evidence was also introduced at trial that the estimated cost to repair the damage to the property was between $15,000 and $17,000. The estimated cost of repairs here could not possibly exceed the former value of the property when the repair cost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>is less than the diminution in value. There was no evidence at trial that the repairs would enhance the value of the property over what it was prior to the damage. A trial court in these circumstances has the discretion to select the repair measure of damages, limited only by the two provisos, which are not present here. Id. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly applied the cost to repair the property as the measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">We further note that this measure of damages was proper as it relates to the proximate cause question discussed previously. Housemaster, as did the defendant in <em>Neiditz, </em>knew of the intended use of its report. Thus, the scope of the risk created by Housemaster\u2019s negligent performance of the inspection included the circumstances that the plaintiffs would buy the house based on a favorable report, and that the existence of extensive termite damage and infestation would require substantial repairs to the property. The estimated repair costs were proximately caused by Housemaster\u2019s negligence because they were within the scope of the risk created by that negligence and, as such, were reasonably foreseeable to Housemaster.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The razing of the building, however, was not proximately caused by Housemaster\u2019s negligence because it was not within the scope of the risks created by that negligence. Housemaster was never notified that the building was going to be razed and, thus, never had an opportunity to remedy the problem. In other words, the razing of the building did not follow in a natural continuum from the negligence involved in failing to detect the termite damage. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manheimer, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 757-58; <em>Mourison </em>v. <em>Hansen, </em>128 Conn. 62, 66, 20 A.2d 84 (1941). Furthermore, as the trial court noted, \u201cThere appears to have been a rush to raze the building without the determination of what could be done to save the structure.\u201d We conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the estimated repair costs used by the trial court to determine damages, rather than the diminution in value, is the appropriate measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final claim is that the trial court\u2019s factual finding that the cost to repair the property amounted to $17,000 was clearly erroneous. The factual finding of a trial court is reversible only if it is clearly erroneous. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, formerly \u00a7 4061; <em>Barszck </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>46 Conn. App. 112, 117, 698 A.2d 358 (1997). \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it . . . or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Shaw-mut Bank </em>v. <em>Brooks Development Corp., </em>46 Conn. App. 399, 405, 699 A.2d 283 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">There is evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the cost to repair the property would have been $17,000. Through the plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness, Mark Moore, Housemaster entered into evidence an inspection report that included an estimate of the cost to repair the insect damage. The repair estimate was prepared by Barry Zanoni, a colleague of Moore who had inspected the property with him. According to the estimate, the damage that had been uncovered as of June 10,1993, could be repaired at a cost of $15,000 to $17,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The trial court acted well within its discretion when it relied on the estimated cost to repair rather than the estimated diminution in value for purposes of determining damages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On the basis of all of the evidence presented, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>the amount of the cost to repair was not clearly improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-11\"> The plaintiffs recovered $11,000 from the named defendant, John I\u00fcopfenstein, and withdrew the action as to him. Klopfenstein was the listing real estate agent of the property that is the subject of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b119-5\"> Paragraph one of the agreement provides: \u201cINSPECTION OPTIONS.
