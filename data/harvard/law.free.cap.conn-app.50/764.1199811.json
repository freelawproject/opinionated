On October 21, 1996, the named defendant was defaulted for failure to appear, and on February 28,1997, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $10,062.95 plus costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>The named defendant\u2019s motion to open the judgment was denied from the bench by the trial court on May 19, 1997. The court denied the motion because it was not verified by the oath of the named defendant or its attorney, nor did it state in general terms the nature of the defense or show reasonable cause, or that a good defense existed at the time of the entry of the judgment. In addition, the named defendant failed to show that it was prevented by mistake, accident or other reasonable cause from defending the action, all of which are required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-212<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 17-43.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant now claims that the trial court improperly refused to open the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Connecticut courts have frequently refused to open judgments because of a delict in compliance with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>statute or rules of practice. We have previously held that when a defendant fails to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 52-212 and Practice Book \u00a7 17-43, the trial court properly may refuse to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to open the judgment by default. <em>Rocklen\u2019s Auto Parts &amp; Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rakiec, </em>6 Conn.
