In <em>State </em>v. <em>Amado, </em>42 Conn. App. 348, 363, 680 A.2d 974 (1996), we concluded that the defendant\u2019s two felony murder convictions were proper and that they provided a sufficient predicate for his capital felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>241 Conn. 702, 721, 699 A.2d 57 (1997), our Supreme Court reversed a capital felony conviction where felony murder was the predicate. The <em>Johnson </em>court relied on <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>238 Conn. 828, 839, 681 A.2d 944 (1996), for the proposition that \u201cthe term \u2018murder\u2019 in the capital felony statute [General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b] may be applied only to intentional murder.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Amado, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 348, was remanded to us for reconsideration in light of <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 702. We now reverse the judgment of the trial court on the capital felony count as well as on the intentional murder counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">The defendant, Eric Amado, appealed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from a judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of capital felony in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (8),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> two counts of intentional murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>(a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and two counts of felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court merged the defendant\u2019s felony murder and intentional murder convictions into the capital felony conviction pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Chicano, </em>216 Conn. 699, 725, 584 A.2d 425 (1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1254, 111 S. Ct. 2898, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1062 (1991) (defendant\u2019s double jeopardy rights violated by conviction of and sentencing for two homicide offenses where legislature intended only one punishment).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The defendant asserts that (1) his convictions on the two felony murder counts are not sufficient to support a capital felony conviction, (2) the trial court improperly charged the jury that self-defense was inapplicable to felony murder and (3) the jury was improperly charged on the elements of self-defense,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>thereby rendering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>invalid his convictions on the two counts of intentional murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">On reconsideration of the first issue, in light of the <em>Johnson </em>court\u2019s determination that a felony murder conviction cannot constitute the predicate for a capital felony conviction, we conclude that only the intentional murder convictions in this case could support the defendant\u2019s capital felony conviction. Consequently, we vacate our earlier determination affirming the capital felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Amado, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 348, we concluded that self-defense is <em>not </em>available as a defense to a charge of felony murder and, therefore, we did not address the claims of improper self-defense instructions. Although we decline the defendant\u2019s invitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>to revisit this issue with respect to the felony murder convictions, our vacating the capital felony conviction requires us now to address whether the jury was improperly charged on the issue of self-defense with respect to the intentional murder counts. The two felony murder convictions stand, as set forth in our original opinion. Those charges were not affected by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, which limited its finding and certified issue to the capital murder and felony murder counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s instructions on self-defense misled the jury because the court (1) improperly instructed the jury on the duty to retreat, (2) improperly focused on the victims\u2019 rights to use reasonable force in defense of their premises,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (3) improperly instructed the jury on the definition of reasonable force as that term applied to the defendant and (4) improperly defined how the jury should determine who was the initial aggressor. We agree with the defendant that the instructions on both the duty to retreat and the victims\u2019 rights to use reasonable force were improper and may have misled the jury in its consideration of the intentional murder counts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>A Ml exposition of the facts that the jury reasonably could have found is recited in <em>State </em>v. <em>Amado, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 348. A summary of those facts will suffice here.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The defendant, accompanied by several other people, went to the home of Anthony Young in Bridgeport after the defendant received information that Young had taken a quantity of cocaine from the defendant\u2019s West Haven apartment. As the defendant stood on the porch of Young\u2019s home, Young opened the door. After accusing Young of having his cocaine, the defendant pulled out his gun and fired five shots, wounding both Young and Peter Hall, who was standing behind Young. Both men were alive when emergency medical personnel arrived at the house. Young was clutching a fully loaded magazine for an automatic weapon, and Hall was holding a small automatic pistol. Both men later died.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The defendant testified that as Young was denying complicity in the theft of the defendant\u2019s cocaine, Hall reached for the waistband of his trousers and started to draw a gun. The defendant claimed that he pulled his gun and fired into the house in self-defense only after Young had taken a step toward him and Hall had started to draw a gun from his waistband.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">We agree with the state that except for his claim regarding the definition of \u201cinitial aggressor,\u201d the defendant did not properly preserve the claims of improper instruction that he now raises on appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant, however, that we should review his claims pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The record is adequate for review and \u201c[bjecause jury instructions that misstate the statutory defense of self-defense violate a defendant\u2019s fourteenth amendment right to establish a defense . . . the defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable under the precepts of <em>[Golding].\u201d </em>(Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pearsall, </em>44 Conn. App. 62, 67, 687 A.2d 1301, cert. denied, 240 Conn. 910, 689 A.2d 473 (1997); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 284, 664 A.2d 743 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">It is well settled that \u201ca defendant charged with a crime must be afforded the opportunity to establish a defense. . . . This fundamental constitutional right includes proper jury instructions on the elements of self-defense so that the jury may ascertain whether the state has met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the assault was not justified. . . . [T]he standard of review to be applied to the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result. . . . While the instructions need not be exhaustive, perfect or technically accurate, they must be correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>of the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>47 Conn. App. 91, 95, 702 A.2d 906 (1997), cert. denied, 243 Conn. 960, 705 A.2d 552 (1998), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>43 Conn. App. 488, 491-92, 684 A.2d 725 (1996), cert. denied, 239 Conn. 956, 688 A.2d 329 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Moreover, our Supreme Court has stated that \u201ca defendant may prevail on an unpreserved constitutional claim of instructional error only if, considering the substance of the charge rather than the form of what was said, it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>227 Conn. 32, 65, 630 A.2d 990 (1993). We must now determine whether the trial court\u2019s instructions on self-defense, considered as a whole, were such that it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled and the defendant was deprived of his constitutional right to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Because the court\u2019s instructions and the defendant\u2019s claims regarding both the duty to retreat and the victims\u2019 rights to use reasonable force in defense of their premises are so intertwined, we will discuss them together. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>231 Conn. 484, 499, 651 A.2d 247 (1994), our Supreme Court held that a trial court\u2019s instructions regarding the self-defense statute<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> incorrectly suggested to the jury that the statute permits the jury to measure a defendant\u2019s knowledge of his ability to retreat according to an objective standard of reasonableness rather than the subjective standard of his actual knowledge. Even though the trial court initially gave a correct instruction on the duty to retreat, the <em>Ash </em>court concluded that the trial court\u2019s subsequent misstatements of the law on the duty to retreat made it reasonably possible that the jury was misled and was not, therefore, harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. According to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (b), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>\u201ca person is not justified in using deadly physical force upon another person if he knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety (1) by retreating, except that the actor shall not be required to retreat if he is in his dwelling . . . .\u201d This section of the self-defense statute refers specifically to the duty to retreat <em>as it applies to a person\u2019s right to engage in self-defense. </em>Moreover, \u201c[t]he statute requires <em>both </em>that a retreat in complete safety be available <em>and </em>that the defendant know of it.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Ash, supra, 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Here, the trial court did, in fact, refer to the necessity for the defendant to have actual knowledge that he could have retreated in complete safety.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On the other hand, the trial court instructed the jury that \u201cthe defendant would not have been justified in standing his ground against the threatened attack to fend it off if he could with complete safety avoid the confrontation by retreating. However, in considering whether the defendant could have retreated in safety the element of practicality must be considered.\u201d There was no mention of the actual knowledge requirement. In response to a note from the jury with questions regarding the elements of self-defense,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the court reinstructed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>as to the duty to retreat, \u201c[t]he first obligation is to consider, \u2018Is it possible to retreat?\u2019 ...\u201d This instruction refers only to the objective possibility of retreat and not to the defendant\u2019s knowledge of an available means of safe retreat. At a later point in the reinstruction on the elements of self-defense, the court again referenced whether the defendant \u201cknows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by, one, retreating . . . .\u201d In the court\u2019s original charge, it gave the jury one instruction regarding retreat that incorporated the actual knowledge requirement, and several pages later a retreat instruction was given that did not mention actual knowledge. During its reinstruction on retreat, the court again gave an instruction that failed to mention the defendant\u2019s actual knowledge and instead referred only to the possibility of retreat. That instruction was followed shortly thereafter by an instruction that did, in fact, incorporate the actual knowledge requirement. Pursuant to the reasoning in <em>Ash, </em>we conclude that it was reasonably possible that this mixture of correct and incorrect instructions misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The defendant also asserts that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury regarding the duty to retreat improperly addressed the victims\u2019 rights not to retreat from <em>their </em>dwelling within the context of defining the defendant\u2019s right to engage in self-defense. While we previously stated that we must consider the court\u2019s charge as a whole and that such instructions need not be perfect or technically accurate, the charge nonetheless must be sufficiently clear to guide the jury in properly viewing the circumstances solely from the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>perspective because the defendant is the person who is asserting self-defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>194 Conn. 376, 389 n.13, 481 A.2d 1277 (1984); <em>State </em>v. Corchado, 188 Conn. 653, 663, 453 A.2d 427 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">In the course of its original charge, the court instructed the jury: \u201cNow, we all understand that we are here for the trial of [the defendant]. But the trial involves two people who are dead as well, so we have to take a look at both positions. . . . [The victims had] a right to be in that home and as such the law protects them from intruders, invaders, trespassers or anybody coming into the home that they do not want into that home even to the extent of using force to repel the persons attempting to come there. . . . The statute reads as follows: \u2018A person in possession or control of premises or a person who is licensed to be on those premises is justified in using reasonable physical force upon another person when and to the extent that he reasonably believes such to be necessary to prevent or terminate the commission ... of a criminal trespass by [another] person.\u2019 \u201d The court did add, however, that its foregoing discussion constituted only the perspective of the victims and did not relate to the defense of self-defense, which applied only to the defendant. Notwithstanding, we are persuaded that the jury was sufficiently misled into believing that it needed to consider the victims\u2019 rights to engage in defense of their premises within the context of evaluating the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim. Significantly, one of the several issues that the jury asked the trial court to clarify after its initial instructions involved the rights that would be available to lawful residents of the house. Because the right to engage in self-defense should properly center on only the defendant and his state of mind, and should not be confused with the rights of the victims, this request for clarification from the jury further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>illustrates what we conclude was a misguided focus regarding the jury\u2019s evaluation of the self-defense claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The dwelling exception to the duty to retreat would have been relevant to the jury\u2019s consideration only if the dwelling had belonged to the defendant. Notwithstanding, the trial court improperly discussed the victims\u2019 self-defense rights with respect to <em>their </em>dwelling while it continued to charge the jury on the defendant\u2019s right to engage in self-defense. The defendant correctly asserts that \u201cthe jury never once heard an explanation of self-defense which did not contain [a] long elaboration on the rights of the victims, intertwined with the possibility of the defendant\u2019s rights.\u201d Because the court improperly interjected instructions as to the victims\u2019 rights to defend their premises,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we conclude that it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled as to the proper method by which it should have evaluated the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim; that is, by considering solely the defendant\u2019s perspective concerning the circumstances. <em>See State v. DeJesus, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly instructed the juiy on the definition of reasonable force as that term applied to the defendant. Specifically, the defendant maintains that the court\u2019s charge impermissi-bly required the jury to evaluate whether the defendant engaged in reasonable force by a solely objective standard when the requisite standard in Connecticut is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>subjective-objective standard. First, the jury must determine whether the defendant did, in fact, reasonably believe that deadly force was necessary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Prio-leau, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 284. If the jury so finds, it must then determine whether that subjective belief was objectively reasonable. Id. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">It is well established that \u201cthe correct standard regarding the test for the degree of force in self-defense is the subjective-objective one set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra [188 Conn. 663]. In <em>Corchado </em>[our Supreme Court] noted that \u00a7 53a-19 focuses on the person, here the defendant . . . claiming self-defense. It focuses on what he reasonably believes under the circumstances and presents a question of fact .... This statutory emphasis upon the defendant further demonstrates the function of the jury in their evaluation of the self-defense claim.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>227 Conn. 518, 533, 631 A.2d 1149 (1993). Further, our Supreme Court has concluded that \u201c [t]he jury must view the situation from the perspective of the defendant. . . . [T]he defendant\u2019s belief ultimately must be found to be reasonable.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 389 n.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Here, the defendant argues that the court impermissi-bly substituted an objective standard for the subjective-objective standard by instructing the jury that the amount of force that is permissible in self-defense is \u201cthat which reasonably appears necessary.\u201d In the court\u2019s original instruction on the issue of reasonable force, it included the following language: \u201cA person is justified in using reasonable physical force upon another person, that is [the defendant] against the others, to defend himself from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of . . . force . . . and he may use such degree of force which he reasonably believes to be necessary for that purpose except [that] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>deadly physical force may not be used unless the actor, [the defendant], reasonably believes that such other person is one, using or about to use deadly physical force or, two, inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm . . . .\u201d One page later in the instructions, the court charged the jury that \u201cthe law is clear that the issue is what the defendant reasonably believed under the circumstances <em>as he saw them </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Immediately after that statement, the court emphasized the necessity for the jury to consider \u201cwhat the defendant reasonably believes at the time of the incident . . . what he reasonably believed under the circumstances as he saw them [and] . . . not the actual danger, but what reasonably appeared to . . . the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">On reinstruction, the court charged: \u201cThe force that one may use in seli-defense is that which reasonably appears necessary in view of all the circumstances of the case to prevent the impending injury and the heat of conflict .... The permissible degree of force used in self-defense depends upon that which is necessary under all the circumstances to prevent an impending injury. \u201d The defendant claims that this instruction possibly misled the jury into applying a solely objective test in considering reasonable force. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The challenged instruction concluded the court\u2019s charge in response to the jury\u2019s request for clarification of the elements of self-defense. It was preceded by instruction that self-defense does not apply until \u201c[self-defense] comes into the mind of an actor . . . because of conduct that he perceives.\u201d The court went on to charge, as to self-defense, that \u201c[y]ou have to believe that from his point of view\u201d and that self-defense \u201chas to do with the perspective of the defendant on the porch.\u201d The court again stated that the jury should assess \u201cwhat [the defendant] reasonably believes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Although the challenged instruction, in isolation, could be construed as dictating a solely objective standard, our review of the charge, as a whole, persuades us that the trial court sufficiently instructed the jury with respect to reasonable force to consider what the <em>defendant </em>believed under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The defendant finally claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the definition of \u201cinitial aggressor\u201d by limiting the jury to determining who was the first to use physical force.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant challenges the following portion of the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury on the issue of \u201cinitial aggressor\u201d: \u201cThe law further provides that the accused was not justified in using deadly physical force if ... he was the initial aggressor. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary [defines] aggressor [as] one who first employs hostile force. The party who first offers violence or offense. He who begins a quarrel or dispute either by threatening or striking another. The law provides that the accused was not justified in using deadly physical force if . . . he was the initial aggressor unless he withdrew from the dispute and communicated that to the victims and [the victims] continued to press his use of physical force. These are factual questions for you to decide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>228 Conn. 335, 341, 636 A.2d 782 (1994), our Supreme Court determined that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the initial aggressor exception to the law of self-defense when it defined the initial aggressor as the first actor to use physical force. Specifically, the <em>Jimenez </em>court observed that \u201c[r]ead according to its plain language, and as a whole, doubtlessly \u00a7 53a-19 contemplates that a person may respond with physical force to a reasonably perceived threat of physical force without becoming the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>initial aggressor and forfeiting the defense of self-defense. Otherwise, in order to avoid being labeled the aggressor, a person would have to stand by meekly and wait until an assailant struck the first blow before responding. . . . Such a bizarre result could not have been intended by the legislature. The law favors a rational statutory construction and we presume that the legislature intended a sensible result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Cartagena, </em>47 Conn. App. 317, 321, 708 A.2d 964 (1997), cert. denied, 244 Conn. 904, 714 A.2d 3 (1998),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we concluded that the trial court\u2019s isolated reference to the defendant as the \u201cinitial attacker or aggressor\u201d did not make it reasonably possible that the jury was misled because the court properly instructed the jury, in the course of its charge on self-defense, that \u201c \u2018[t]he use of self-defense does not imply the right of attack in the first instance or in mere retaliation. By definition, self-defense means the use of defensive force. Therefore, a person claiming this right must act honestly and conscientiously and not from anger, malice or revenge. He must not provoke or intentionally bring the attack upon himself in order to provide an excuse to use force against another person.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Immediately before reading the dictionary definition of \u201caggressor,\u201d the trial court here instructed the juiy that \u201c[i]t is not necessary for the assailant to have actually struck a blow if it appears an attack is imminent to trigger the doctrine of self-defense.\u201d The court had earlier stated that \u201cthe claim of self-defense is not necessarily defeated if ... in connection with such a demonstration of force as will induce a well-founded belief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>in the mind of a reasonable person that his adversary is on the eve of executing a threat and that his only means of escape from death or great bodily injury [is] to immediately defend himself against the <em>impending danger </em>[by] the use of whatever force is necessary to avert the <em>threatened peril. </em>If the accused believed the victims were . . . <em>about </em>to use physical force against him ... or that [the victims] were <em>about </em>to inflict great bodily harm upon him, [the defendant] was justified in using deadly force.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Unlike in <em>Jimenez, </em>where the trial court instructed that the initial aggressor was defined as the first person to use physical force, we are persuaded from our review of the charge, as a whole, that the court\u2019s instruction on the initial aggressor issue here was not so limited. The court explained that one could react to both impending peril and the threat of harm without becoming an initial aggressor, and the instructions that were given did not preclude the jury from finding that the defendant was not the initial aggressor.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">In summary, we conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s instructions that referenced both the victims\u2019 rights to defend their dwelling and the defendant\u2019s right to engage in self-defense.

App. 348, 680 A.2d 974 (1996). The felony murder convictions were not a subject of the Supreme Court\u2019s remand, which was limited to a reconsideration of the defendant\u2019s felony murder convictions serving as the predicate murder for a capital felony conviction in light of its decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>241 Conn. 702, 699 A.2d 57 (1997).

As to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s interjection of the victims\u2019 rights to defense of premises in the instruction on self-defense misled the jury, I disagree with the majority that the issue is reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). While the record is adequate for review, the claim is not truly of constitutional magnitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>The majority, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Pearsall, </em>44 Conn.

The claim raised by the defendant is that the trial court in its instruction on self-defense interjected an instruction on the victims\u2019 right to defend their property. The claim is not that the trial court misstated the statutory defense of self-defense, but that the court added to it and, in so doing, somehow misled the jury. The victims\u2019 right to defend their property is not an element of self-defense. Because the trial court instructed the jury on the elements of self-defense, I would conclude that this claim is not of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right and, therefore, not reviewable under <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Even if I were to assume that the claim satisfies the first two prongs of <em>Golding </em>and is reviewable, I would conclude that the claim fails under the third and fourth prongs of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">\u201cIn examining a challenge to a trial court\u2019s instructions to a jury, we will look at the charge as a whole rather than consider particular language in isolation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>206 Conn. 40, 46, 536 A.2d 936 (1988). \u2018It is well established that individual jury instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge. <em>Cupp </em>v. <em>Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 146-47, 94 S.

Ed. 2d 368 (1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Silano, </em>204 Conn. 769, 773, 529 A.2d 1283 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>195 Conn. 444, 451, 488 A.2d 812, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 833, 106 S.

Thus, we consider the defendant\u2019s assertions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>the trial court\u2019s instructions were improper in light of the entire charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">\u201cA jury charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the jury in guiding it to a proper verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>13 Conn. App. 139, 145, 535 A.2d 371 (1987). The court\u2019s instruction should give the jury a clear understanding of the issues presented, under the offenses charged and on the evidence presented. Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Villafane, </em>45 Conn. App. 110, 115, 694 A.2d 802 [cert. denied, 241 Conn. 926, 697 A.2d 362] (1997).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>46 Conn. App. 661, 679, 701 A. 2d 663, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 940, 702 A.2d 645 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The defendant argues that \u201c[t]he court\u2019s instructions repeatedly misled the jury by removing its focus from the defendant and instead causing it to contrast the victims\u2019 certain rights with rights the defendant may have had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">In its instruction on self-defense, the trial court began by instructing the jury that self-defense is a valid legal defense. The trial court then instructed the jury that while this trial involves the defendant, it also involves the two victims. The trial court stated that the evidence showed that the victims had a right to be in the home and then instructed the jury on the use of physical force in defense of premises tracking General Statutes \u00a7 53a-20. At the conclusion of that instruction, the trial court was careful to clarify to the jury that the \u00a7 53a-20 instruction applied to the victims and not to the defendant and that it was not self-defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court then specifically stated that in this case, self-defense is the claim of the defendant and then proceeded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>instruct the jury on self-defense tracking General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The jury sent the trial court a note seeking clarification on parts of the charge on self-defense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In rein-structing the jury, the trial court again instructed on the victims\u2019 right to defend the premises in response to the jury\u2019s question. It should be noted that the defendant submitted his own request to charge on the substance of \u00a7 53a-20 in response to the jury\u2019s question and, therefore, contributed to the charge that he now claims improper.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court continued in its reinstruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>and charged the jury on self-defense according to \u00a7 53a-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The trial court\u2019s charge correctly set forth the law regarding the use of force in defense of premises. The trial court was careful to tell the jury, both in its initial charge and in its reinstruction, that the principles involved in \u00a7 53a-20 apply to the victims, while self-defense concerned the defendant. I agree with the state that the trial court\u2019s charge did not \u201cenlarge or diminish the jury\u2019s understanding of the defendant\u2019s prerogative to use force,\u201d nor, as the defendant claims, did it leave the jury with the impression that a trespasser has no right of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">I do not believe that the jury\u2019s knowledge of the victims\u2019 right to defend the premises in any way diminished their understanding of the defendant\u2019s right to self-defense. As I have noted, the trial court was careful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>to specify that the instruction on the right to defend property applied to the victims and that the instruction on self-defense applied to the defendant and, more importantly, that the jury in this case was concerned with the defendant. Furthermore, the trial court delivered the instructions separate and apart from each other, not intermingled. The trial court\u2019s instruction and reinstruction did not confuse the jury or have an adverse impact on the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the defendant\u2019s duty to retreat. Specifically, the defendant claims that the correct statutory language was \u201csandwiched between incorrect instructions,\u201d and that the charge \u201cfailed to place what the defendant did perceive before the jury, and rather allowed it to reject the claim of self-defense based upon a finding that he could have perceived an ability to retreat, or even to avoid the incident entirely, with complete safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">In its initial charge to the jury, the trial court instructed the jury on self-defense according to \u00a7 53a-19, including a proper instruction on the duty to retreat, indicating that the defendant would not be justified in using deadly force if he knew he could avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety. Later in the initial charge, the trial court repeated the duty to retreat instruction and failed to include the actual knowledge requirement. In its reinstruction, however, the trial court delivered a proper instruction on the duty to retreat.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">The majority states that the trial court\u2019s reinstruction on retreat failed to include the defendant\u2019s actual knowledge, but then the court delivered a proper instruction on retreat. The majority claims that the following was an instruction on retreat: \u201cThe first obligation is to consider, \u2018Is it possible to retreat?\u2019 . . .\u201d I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>disagree that the trial court was delivering an instruction on retreat because the remainder of the trial court\u2019s sentence was, \u201cand I will go through that for you again here this morning.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court was merely telling the jury that it would deliver an instruction on the duty to retreat later in the course of its reinstruction. The trial court then did so, properly instructing the jury as required by \u00a7 53a~19 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The majority relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>231 Conn. 484, 651 A.2d 247 (1994), in concluding that it was reasonably possible that the juiy in this case was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions on the duty to retreat. <em>Ash </em>is distinguishable from this case. In <em>Ash, </em>the trial court first stated the statutory language on the duty to retreat correctly. The trial court then made improper references to an objective standard and \u201cby further instructing the jury to consider what avenues of retreat the defendant <em>\u2018could </em>perceive\u2019 . . . rather than directing them to consider what the defendant <em>did </em>perceive, the trial court, at best, further muddied the jury\u2019s understanding of the proper subjective standard and, at worst, suggested to the jury that it could reject the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense if it found he could have perceived, but did not actually <em>know, </em>that he could have avoided using deadly physical force in complete safety by retreating.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 496. There was no reinstruction given in <em>Ash.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">In this case, the trial court delivered a reinstruction to the jury that included a proper charge on the duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>to retreat and did not include, although the majority claims otherwise, an improper charge. Thus, any confusion that may have existed after the initial charge was clarified by the trial court\u2019s proper charge in its reins-truction.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Considering the jury charge from the standpoint of its effect on the jury in guiding it to a proper verdict, I cannot conclude that it was reasonably possible that the jury was misled or that an injustice resulted due to the charge. The trial court\u2019s instruction gave the jury a proper understanding of the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim under the circumstances of this case on the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-11\"> I agree with the majority that the trial court properly instructed the jury on 1he definitions of reasonable force and initial aggressor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b647-9\"> The trial court instructed: \u201cNow, that applies to them (the victims).
