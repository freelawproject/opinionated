We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On August 2,1992, the defendant attended a picnic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>at Globe Hollow Pond in Manchester with the victim, N, age three, her mother, her father and her brother. N referred to the defendant, her godfather, as Uncle Ronnie. N testified that while she and the defendant were swimming, the defendant put his hand underneath N\u2019s bathing suit and touched her \u201cinside\u201d her \u201ccrotch\u201d with his index finger. The touching caused pain and N screamed. After N screamed, the defendant told her not to tell anyone about the touching. When N started crying, her father took her out of the water and brought her to her mother. While she was crying, N said \u201cbad Uncle Ronnie\u201d several times. Physical examinations by physicians shortly thereafter revealed two scrapes on the inside fold of the labia majora that were typical of recent sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The first count of the original information alleged that the defendant \u201cpenetrated the vagina\u201d of the victim with his finger or fingers. During the trial, the state amended the first count of the information to allege that the defendant committed sexual assault by penetrating \u201cthe labia majora of the genitalia of a three (3) year old girl with his finger or fingers.\u201d The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts of the information and, after denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal, the trial court imposed sentence. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">The defendant\u2019s principal contention is that the conviction cannot stand<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because \u00a7 53a-65 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>(2)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> defines sexual intercourse as, inter alia, \u201cvaginal intercourse . ...\u201d He asserts that the information does not charge, nor does the evidence prove, vaginal intercourse. Whether digital penetration that is alleged and proven to have occurred between the folds of the labia majora, but not into the vagina, constitutes vaginal sexual intercourse pursuant to \u00a7 53a-65 (2) presents a question of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The defendant claims that no interpretation is necessary because the clear wording of the statute requires that vaginal penetration be alleged and proven to support a conviction. We are aware of the rule of statutory interpretation that where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, no construction is necessary and a court simply applies the statute as its words direct. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubus, </em>216 Conn. 402, 407, 581 A.2d 1045 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mattioli, </em>210 Conn. 573, 576, 556 A.2d 584 (1989). We conclude that \u00a7 53a-65 (2) is facially ambiguous because it is not clear whether digital penetration of the genital opening is sufficient to complete sexual intercourse or whether such penetration must be into the vagina. Because of this ambiguity, we must turn to recognized principles of statutory construction to ascertain the meaning of the term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in the context of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">\u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New </em>Haven, 240 Conn. 422, 431, 692 A.2d 742 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">We first address the principle that a statute that imposes criminal liability should be strictly construed and ambiguities normally resolved in favor of the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>238 Conn. 828, 832, 681 A.2d 944 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 151, 460 A.2d 26 (1983). Such strict construction, according to the defendant, precludes us from construing vaginal intercourse as including penetration of the labia majora.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Although the defendant asserts that the doctrine of strict construction is dispositive, that doctrine \u201cis only one of the aids which is to be used in the construction of penal statutes. . . . Other aids include such things as the statutory language itself, legislative history where available, the furthering of the policy and purposes fairly apparent from the statute which include the mischief sought to be proscribed and related statutes.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Singh </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>213 Conn. 637, 646-47, 569 A.2d 1112 (1990). The <em>Singh </em>court also stated that \u201c[n]o rule of construction, however, requires that a penal statute be strained and distorted in order to exclude conduct clearly intended to be within its scope .... It is sufficient if the words are given their fair meaning in accord with the evident intent of [the legislature].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 646. Even where a criminal statute is at issue, our Supreme Court has shown its \u201cdisinclination to interpret statutes in a vacuum. . . . Where a court possesses clues to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>the meaning of a statute, there certainly can be no rule of law which forbids [their] use, however clear the words may appear on superficial examination.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golino, </em>201 Conn. 435, 442, 518 A.2d 57 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Our search for the meaning of the superficially clear words \u201cvaginal intercourse\u201d and \u201cpenetration\u201d is not constrained by the doctrine of strict construction because the law surrounding the crime of rape does not exist in a vacuum, but has a long history that we may consult in aid of our interpretation. As a starting point, we focus on the words \u201c[p]enetration, however slight,\u201d because that phrase links \u00a7 53a-65 (2) to its statutory and case law antecedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">We first encounter the notion that the least penetration is sufficient to complete the crime of rape in <em>State </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>45 Conn. 256 (1877). The defendant requested that the trial court charge the jury that \u201cto constitute rape actual penetration of the body of the woman by the insertion into her of the private parts of the accused is absolutely necessary.\u201d Id., 259. After charging as requested, the court added, \u201c \u2018but the least penetration is sufficient . . . \u201d Id. Our Supreme Court affirmed the charge as correct. Id., 263. That was the first charge regarding penetration challenged in the Connecticut courts, and the concept of minimal penetration has been a part of our law prohibiting sex offenses ever since. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dubina, </em>164 Conn. 95, 97, 318 A.2d 95 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>23 Conn. App. 712, 714, 584 A.2d 473, cert. denied, 217 Conn. 809, 585 A.2d 1233, cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1252, 111 S. Ct. 2894, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1058 (1991). We have found no cases, and the defendant cites none, in which our Supreme Court or this court has construed the least penetration doctrine as requiring penetration of the vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Prior to our adoption of the Penal Code in 1971, General Statutes (Rev. to 1968) \u00a7 53-238 provided in relevant part: \u201cAny person who commits the crime of rape upon any female shall be imprisoned .... Any person who carnally knows any female under the age of sixteen years shall be guilty of rape . . . .\u201d In addition to enunciating the slightest penetration rule, the Supreme Court defined \u201ccarnal knowledge\u201d as sexual intercourse. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dubina, </em>supra, 164 Conn. 97; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferris, </em>81 Conn. 97, 99, 70 A. 587 (1908). Sexual intercourse always had its ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Public Acts 1969, No. 828, \u00a7 66, which went into effect in October, 1971, and was codified in 1972 as General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65, provided in relevant part: \u201c(1) \u2018Sexual intercourse\u2019 has its ordinary meaning and occurs upon any penetration, however slight. . . .\u201d For the first time, the least penetration rule was made a part of a statute that defined sexual intercourse. There was a separate subsection in \u00a7 53a-65 that defined \u201cdeviate sexual intercourse\u201d as \u201csexual contact . . . consisting of contact between the penis and the anus, the mouth and the penis, or the mouth and the vulva . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 53a-65 (2). The commission comment to \u00a7 53a-65 noted that these specific sexual acts were \u201cintended to replace the archaic and ambiguous terms of \u2018carnal knowledge\u2019 and \u2018indecent assault.\u2019 \u201d Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Penal Code Comments, Connecticut General Statutes (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The amendments to \u00a7 53a-65 in 1975, Public Acts 1975, No. 75-619, \u00a7 1, eliminated the words \u201chas its ordinary meaning\u201d as part of the definition of sexual intercourse and inserted the word \u201cvaginal. \u201d The legislature also eliminated the word \u201cdeviate\u201d and placed all of the definitions of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in subsection (2). In addition, the legislature added the sentence: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>\u201cPenetration may be committed by an object manipulated by the actor into the genital or anal opening of the victim\u2019s body. . . .\u201d Public Acts 1975, No. 75-619, \u00a7 1 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">During the hearings on the amendments to the sexual offense statutes, Senator Betty Hudson remarked: \u201cThe present statute defines sexual assault only in terms of rape, ordinary intercourse. ... It doesn\u2019t talk about all kinds of assault that can be done sexually on a person. The statute before you does explicitly . . . .\u201d 18 S. Proc., Pt. 7, 1975 Sess., pp. 3222-23. Kay Bergin, executive director of the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, testified: \u201cIt is an omnibus bill and it has many sections. One of the other things that the task force discovered when it did its work was that there were a number of statutes overlapping, confusing and so on that had come into use over many years, and this really is an attempt to straighten out and organize the various statutes and bring them up to date and pick up some [of] the areas which were really no longer useful or were contradictory. So the beginning of this bill has to do with the definitions of the act, sexual intercourse, what it really means. And I won\u2019t go into all of this, deviate sexual intercourse is considered to be unnecessary at this point and so this was removed.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Human Rights and Opportunities, 1975 Sess., p. 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Although the word \u201cvaginal\u201d appeared in a sexual offense statute for the first time in 1975, the aforementioned testimony supports a conclusion that the definitions section of \u00a7 53a-65 was not intended to affect the ordinary meaning of the words \u201csexual intercourse,\u201d except as to the language regarding penetration by an object. With respect to the change in \u00a7 53a-65 (2), we have stated: \u201cThe legislative history reveals that the purpose of changing the definition of sexual intercourse from having its ordinary meaning was to include anal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Siering, 35 Conn. App. 173, 181-82, 644 A.2d 958, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 914, 648 A.2d 158 (1994). We are persuaded that the legislature did not intend to change the ordinary meaning of the words \u201csexual intercourse.\u201d The words \u201cvaginal intercourse\u201d were intended to be descriptive so as to differentiate sexual intercourse in its ordinary meaning from what were previously considered to be the deviate forms of sexual intercourse: fellatio, cunnilingus and anal intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Our conclusion is buttressed by our Supreme Court\u2019s statement: \u201cThe rule of statutory construction is that [a] statute should not be construed as altering the common law rule, farther than the words of the statute import, and should not be construed as making any innovation upon the common law which the statute does not fairly express.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>186 Conn. 757, 764, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982). Sexual intercourse had previously been defined in the common law as having its ordinary meaning. The \u201c[p]enetration, however slight,\u201d language of the statute is a common-law carryover that was designed to eliminate precisely the kind of claim that is made here. The common-law construction of rape was designed to punish the fact, not the degree, of penetration. Nothing in the legislative history of the 1975 amendment that introduced the word \u201cvaginal\u201d into the definitions and nothing in the circumstances surrounding the statute\u2019s enactment suggests that the legislature intended a more restrictive definition of sexual intercourse. On the contrary, the meaning of sexual intercourse was expanded to include the manipulation of an object into the genital opening of the victim\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Although we ordinarily accept specific definitions in legislation, we may depart from that rule when a literal reading would produce results that are inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>with the intent of the legislature. <em>Vernon Village, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>217 Conn. 130, 139, 585 A.2d 76 (1991); <em>Sienkiewicz </em>v. <em>Sienkiewicz, </em>178 Conn. 675, 683, 425 A.2d 116 (1979); <em>Leach </em>v. <em>Florkosky, </em>145 Conn. 490, 497, 144 A.2d 334 (1958). This case presents such an occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Obviously, one of the purposes of the statute is to protect children from sexual assault. That purpose can be carried out by construing the statute to preclude behavior such as the defendant\u2019s without doing violence to any principle of statutory construction. The defendant\u2019s act of putting his index finger between the labia majora of a three year old girl falls squarely within the statute\u2019s proscription against penetration \u201cby an object manipulated by the actor into the genital . . . opening of the victim\u2019s body . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-65 (2). A finger is considered an \u201cobject\u201d that can be manipulated into a genital opening. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>33 Conn. App. 133, 139-41, 634 A.2d 1181 (1993). By construing the word vaginal as descriptive to distinguish it from the other forms of intercourse, the phrase \u201c[p]enetration, however slight,\u201d retains its accepted meaning. In doing so, we also follow that principle of statutory construction that requires us to reconcile and harmonize the parts of a statute to the extent possible. <em>Marangio </em>v. <em>Shop Rite Supermarkets, Inc., </em>11 Conn. App. 156, 160, 525 A.2d 1389, cert. denied, 204 Conn. 809, 528 A.2d 1155 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Over one-half century ago, our Supreme Court reconciled the doctrines of strict construction and legislative intent. \u201cIt is a false humanity which would protect offenders, either by stifling detection and prosecution, or by affording facilities to escape conviction, by unnecessary and artificial technicalities in the administration of the law. The purpose of the rule of strict construction is not to enable a person to avoid the clear import of a law through some mere technicality, but to enable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>the people of the State to know clearly and precisely what acts the legislature has forbidden under a penalty, that they may govern their conduct accordingly, and to make sure that no act which the legislature did not intend to include will be held by the courts within the penalty of the law. ... To enforce the rule beyond its purpose would be to exalt technicalities above substance.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Faro, </em>118 Conn. 267, 274, 171 A. 660 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The <em>Faro </em>rationale underlies the rule that criminal statutes must be strictly construed. \u201cThe rule of strict construction, however, does not require that the most narrow, technical and exact meaning be given to the language of a statute in frustration of an obvious legislative intent. . . . Common sense should be applied to the language of a penal statute, particularly if otherwise absurdity or frustration of the evident design of the legislature results.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Morelli, </em>25 Conn. App. 605, 609, 595 A.2d 932 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">For us to direct a judgment of acquittal here, as the defendant contends we must, we would have to strain and distort the words of the statute to reach an absurd and bizarre result. The defendant\u2019s abhorrent act of putting his index finger between the labia of a three year old girl is conduct that is clearly intended to be within the scope of the statute because such penetration is sufficient under the least penetration doctrine. If we were to adopt the construction that is proffered by the defendant, we would set the stage for drawn out battles over the degree, rather than the fact, of penetration. By applying the least penetration doctrine with respect to the genital opening, we preclude such disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The defendant argues that even if we conclude that the information properly charges a violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2), the evidence was not sufficient to convict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>him because the labia majora is not an opening, but a \u201cstructure\u201d that cannot be digitally penetrated. He also claims that there was no evidence that the defendant did anything more than place his hand on top of the victim\u2019s labia majora. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">First, the expert testimony at trial established that the labia majora consist of two folds between which a finger or other object can pass. The defendant\u2019s claim that penetration in the context of both the information and the court\u2019s charge means <em>through </em>the skin and tissue of a labium is strained and illogical. Penetration, in the context of the statute, obviously means intrusion through an opening and not penetration through skin and tissue. Second, the defendant dismisses the victim\u2019s direct testimony that the defendant put his finger \u201cinside\u201d her \u201ccrotch.\u201d He claims that this testimony was ambiguous because N had earlier testified that the defendant placed his hand inside her bathing suit. It is axiomatic that this was grist for the jury\u2019s mill. Authority abounds that we do not sit as a seventh juror or retiy the facts, but rather we determine whether any rational jury could have so found. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>46 Conn. App. 321, 326, 699 A.2d 262 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ketchum, </em>45 Conn. App. 270, 281, 696 A.2d 987, cert. denied, 242 Conn. 910, 697 A.2d 368 (1997). We conclude, therefore, that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">The defendant makes one last claim with respect to the issue of penetration. He asserts that the trial court\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d interpretation of sexual intercourse as penetration of the genital opening would eliminate any distinction between sexual assault in the first degree and the less serious offenses of sexual assault in the third and fourth degree by way of \u201csexual contact.\u201d General Statutes 53a-65 (3) defines sexual contact as, inter alia, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>contact with the \u201cintimate parts of a person . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (8) defines intimate parts as, inter alia, the \u201cgenital area . . . .\u201d The defendant makes much of the fact that the trial court, in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal, stated that the words \u201cgenital or anal opening\u201d in \u00a7 53a-65 (2) meant genital <em>area </em>or anal opening. For the reasons that we have previously discussed, we conclude that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. We may affirm a trial court\u2019s decision that reaches the right result, albeit for the wrong reason.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Flagg Energy Development Corp. </em>v. <em>General Motors </em>Corp., 244 Conn. 126, 151, 709 A.2d 1075 (1998); <em>Herr-mann </em>v. <em>Summer Plaza Corp., </em>201 Conn. 263, 274, 513 A.2d 1211 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The trial court instructed the jury that \u201csexual intercourse means penetration into the genital opening .... Our law provides that penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete sexual intercourse and does not require the emission of semen. Our law further provides that penetration may be committed digitally, that is, by the finger or fingers into the genital opening of the victim\u2019s body.\u201d The court also instructed the jury: \u201cYou may consider the labia majora as an anatomical part of a woman\u2019s genital opening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">There was medical testimony to the effect that the labia majora are part of the genital area of a female, acting as a \u201cflap\u201d that covers the labia minora and the vagina. There was also medical testimony that a finger could be inserted between \u201cthe two labia majora\u201d and could reach the vagina.

Specifically, the defendant relies on Conter\u2019s statement that \u201cN\u2019s mother has been sexually molested, and her own experiences impact her reactions to N\u2019s experiences and can negatively impact any intervention\u201d in support of the proposition that S may have influenced N\u2019s disclosures in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s determination that S\u2019s prior sexual molestation lacked relevance and that the pursuit of that line of questioning would, in effect, have required a trial within a trial, the defendant argues that his cross-examination of both S and Conter was improperly restricted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He claims a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>violation of his sixth amendment rights to confrontation, to present a defense and to due process because N\u2019s allegations \u201cwere a product of her mother\u2019s creation and influence,\u201d and Conter had expressed concern about that possibility.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">With respect to S, the defendant claims that he was improperly restricted from questioning her about her past history of sexual molestation because her history \u201cmay have played a key role in N\u2019s subsequent disclosures, and in particular, S\u2019s bias and motives both as a witness and as a key factor in N\u2019s testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant made no offer of proof as to why the statement at issue shows bias or a motive on the part of S to influence her daughter to \u201cmanufacture\u201d a charge against the defendant. The statement refers only to how S <em>reacted </em>to N\u2019s molestation and how this reaction could negatively affect Conter\u2019s efforts to treat N. S\u2019s reaction to the molestation of her daughter and the subsequent treatment could have arisen only after there had been a determination that the molestation had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that [a] defendant is entitled fairly and fully to confront and to cross-examine the witnesses against him. . . . The confrontation clause does not, however, suspend the rules of evidence to give the defendant the right to engage in unrestricted cross-examination. . . .

Because I agree with the defendant\u2019s first three claims, which rest on his assertion that the trial court improperly limited the interpretation of the term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d to the mere penetration of the labia majora<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, therefore, improperly allowed the state to amend the information, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">If the trial court\u2019s interpretation was improper, the defendant claims that (1) the trial court should have granted his motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case because the state failed to present evidence from which a jury could find vaginal penetration, as required by General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-65 (2) and General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2), (2) the jury charge on sexual intercourse was improper and (3) there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction. The defendant does not argue that the facts charged could not constitute a crime, but rather that they cannot support a conviction of first degree sexual assault. Therefore, the trial court improperly allowed the state to amend the information and denied the motion for judgment of acquittal. I believe that because the trial court improperly interpreted the term sexual intercourse, the defendant\u2019s conviction of first degree sexual assault must be reversed. In addition, because the trial court predicated the conviction of risk of injury to a child on a conviction of sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>assault in the first degree, the conviction of risk of injury to a child must be reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The defendant was charged by an amended long form information with first degree sexual assault. The information stated in relevant part that \u201con or about August 2, 1992, in Manchester, Connecticut, Ronald Joseph Albert engaged in sexual intercourse with a child under thirteen (13) years of age, to wit: he penetrated the labia majora of the genitalia of a three (3) year old girl with his finger or fingers, in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2).\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-65 (2) provides that \u201c \u2018[sjexual intercourse\u2019 means vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio or cunnilingus . . . .\u201d The state did not allege anal intercourse, fellatio or cunnilingus in the amended information. Therefore, the dispositive issue was whether penetration of the labia majora alone constitutes vaginal intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">In support of its interpretation, the trial court relied on \u00a7 53a-65 (2), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[pjenetration may be committed by an object manipulated by the actor into the genital or anal opening of the victim\u2019s body . . . .\u201d The trial court interpreted the phrase to mean genital <em>area </em>or anal opening. It is important to note that the court stated, when it ruled on the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal and again in its charge to the jury, that it was undisputed that <em>no penetration of the victim\u2019s vagina occurred.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">The court improperly interpreted the phrase \u201cinto the genital or anal opening\u201d as meaning into the genital <em>area </em>or anal opening. The term genital, as used in \u00a7 53a-65 (2), is an adjective, not a noun, and to expand the meaning of it to include the genital area is nonsensical. The legislature did not use the noun \u201cgenitals,\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>would have supported the trial court\u2019s interpretation. The adjectives \u201cgenital\u201d and \u201canal\u201d both modify the noun \u201copening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The majority opinion holds that vaginal intercourse can be committed by the penetration of the labia majora alone. Vaginal intercourse, however, requires more than penetration of the labia majora; <em>it requires penetration of the vagina. </em>Of the four alternative definitions of sexual intercourse provided in \u00a7 53a-65 (2), cunnilingus is the only theory that does not require penetration for the commission of the offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>186 Conn. 757, 764, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982). \u201c \u2018Cunnilingus is sexual stimulation of the clitoris or vulva by the lips or tongue.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Storlazzi, </em>191 Conn. 453, 463, 464 A.2d 829 (1983), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>supra, 764. The clitoris is enclosed by the labia majora. H. Gray, Anatomy of the Human Body (29th Ed. Goss 1973), p. 1330. The labia majora must necessarily be penetrated or passed through to reach the clitoris. Therefore, because penetration of the genital opening is not required for cunnilingus but is required for vaginal intercourse, penetration of the genital opening must require more than the penetration of the labia majora alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Moreover, the majority\u2019s interpretation of vaginal intercourse is antithetical to its common meaning. \u201cIn the absence of special circumstances, the words of a statute are to be accorded their common meaning. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 [a]; <em>Hardware Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Premo, </em>153 Conn. 465, 474, 217 A.2d 698 [1966].\u201d <em>Torrington Water Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>168 Conn. 319, 323, 362 A.2d 866 (1975). Furthermore, it is a well established rule that \u201cpenal statutes are to be strictly construed\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>25 Conn. App. 624, 626, 595 A.2d 941, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 925, 598 A.2d 366 (1991); and \u201care to be interpreted strictly <em>against </em>the state.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Desimone, </em>241 Conn. 439, 455, 696 A.2d 1235 (1997). These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>principles underlie \u201cthe general rule of statutory interpretation that the intent of the legislature is to be found not in what it meant to say, but in what it did say. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 150, 460 A.2d 26 (1983), quoting <em>Gomeau </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>176 Conn. 523, 526, 409 A.2d 1006 (1979). In ascertaining that intent, [i]f the words are clear and unambiguous, it is assumed that [they] express the intention of the legislature . . . and we need inquire no further. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubus, </em>216 Conn. 402, 407, 581 A.2d 1045 (1990), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Mattioli, </em>[210 Conn. 573, 576, 556 A.2d 584 (1989)]. Further, interpretation of a penal statute must accord with common sense and commonly approved usage of the language. <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>201 Conn. 125, 132, 513 A.2d 669 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>supra, 151.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>supra, 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The term vaginal is an adjective and means \u201cof ... a vagina.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. The majority\u2019s conclusion that vaginal intercourse can be committed by the penetration of the labia majora, when the state concedes that no vaginal penetration occurred, is contrary to common sense and the commonly approved usage of the term. I believe that penetration of the vagina, however slight, is required to commit vaginal intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The majority\u2019s reliance on the long history of the language, \u201c[p]enetration, however slight,\u201d is misplaced and does not advance the discussion. The resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim requires us to determine <em>what </em>must be penetrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">The linchpin of the majority\u2019s argument is that \u201cthe legislature did not intend to change the ordinary meaning of the words \u2018sexual intercourse.\u2019 The words \u2018vaginal intercourse\u2019 were intended to be descriptive so as to differentiate sexual intercourse in its ordinary meaning from what were previously considered to be the deviate forms of sexual intercourse: fellatio, cunnilingus and</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>anal intercourse.\u201d The majority fails to recognize, however, that the ordinary meaning of sexual intercourse <em>always </em>required penetration of the vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">First, as the majority correctly points out, the concept of minimal penetration was first used in the rape context. <em>State </em>v. Shields, 45 Conn. 256 (1877). In <em>Shields, </em>however, the examining physician testified that \u201c \u2018penetration had taken place as far as the internal organs of generation, whether further or not I cannot from my examination say ....\u2019\u201d Id., 258. The defendant, in essence, requested that the court instruct the jury that <em>complete </em>penetration was required to constitute rape. Id., 259. The court instructed the juiy that penetration was absolutely necessary, but that \u201c \u2018the least penetration is sufficient\u2019 \u201d .... Id. Vaginal penetration was not disputed, only <em>the degree </em>of vaginal penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Second, \u201c[p]rior to 1975, sexual intercourse was defined by General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-65 as having \u2018its ordinary meaning and occurs upon any penetration ....\u2019\u201d <em>State </em>v. Siering, 35 Conn. App. 173, 180, 644 A.2d 958, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 914, 648 A.2d 158 (1994). \u201c[T]he \u2018ordinary meaning\u2019 of sexual intercourse contemplates a continuous act of penetration ....\u2019\u201d Id., 181. It is clear that the ordinary definition of sexual intercourse prior to 1975 involved penetration of the vagina. \u201cPublic Act 75-619 changed the definition in part to provide: \u2018Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal intercourse ....\u2019\u201d Id., 180-SI. This court has held that the amendment did not change the ordinary meaning of sexual intercourse, but rather construed \u201cthe statutory reference to penetration as establishing the minimum amount of evidence necessary to prove that intercourse has taken place.\u201d Id., 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">\u201cIt is a basic principle of law that common sense is not to be left at the courtroom door; <em>State </em>v. <em>Zayas, </em>195 Conn. 611, 620, 490 A.2d 68 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>10 Conn.

The state had the burden to prove, therefore, that the defendant engaged in sexual intercourse, namely vaginal intercourse, by penetrating the labia majora. Under \u00a7 53a-65 (2), however, penetration of the labia majora <em>alone </em>cannot constitute vaginal intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The facts charged in the amended information cannot, even if proved, constitute vaginal intercourse, which is required to support the defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2). The pivotal issue is not whether the act allegedly committed by the defendant could constitute a crime under this section if properly charged, but whether the facts <em>as charged </em>constitute a crime under this statutory section. Therefore, the trial court improperly allowed the state to amend the information to allege that penetration of the labia majora alone constituted sexual intercourse and improperly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">I would reverse the judgment and remand the case with direction to render judgment of not guilty on the charge of first degree sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The defendant was also charged with risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53-21.1 believe that this conviction must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">In its charge to the jury, the trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cNow you may return a verdict of guilty on both counts or a verdict of not guilty on both counts. If you return a verdict of not guilty on the first count, that is sexual assault in the first degree, you ought to return a verdict of not guilty on the second count because the second count is triggered based on the evidence submitted on behalf of the first count. If, however, you find the defendant guilty on the first count, you are not required to find him guilty on the second count. That is, you may find him, if you so choose, guilty on the first count and not guilty on the second count.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">In essence, the trial court predicated a conviction of risk of injury to a minor on a conviction of first degree sexual assault. \u201cIn the absence of a clear indication to the contrary, juries are presumed to follow the instructions that they are given. <em>State </em>v. <em>Guess, </em>39 Conn. App. 224, 235, 665 A.2d 126, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 924, 666 A.2d 1187 (1995).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>44 Conn. App. 338, 350, 689 A.2d 517, cert. denied, 240 Conn. 929, 693 A.2d 301 (1997). We must presume that the finding of guilty of risk of injury to a child is in part based on the finding of guilty of first degree sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">I also believe that the trial court improperly restricted the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of S regarding her prior history of sexual molestation as a child. It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>more than one year after the incident, on November 30,1993, that N disclosed, for the first time to someone other than her mother, that \u201ca bad man\u201d had touched her and that the \u201cbad man\u201d was her Uncle Ronnie. In addition, S purchased a book for children dealing with good and bad touching. S testified that she read this book many times to N. The defendant argued that S\u2019s past history was relevant to motive and bias because for more than one year, N told only S that the defendant touched her. The defendant sought to cross-examine S as to whether her own experience could have influenced N\u2019s recollection of the events and identification of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">\u201c[I]t is axiomatic that [a] defendant is entitled fairly and fully to confront and to cross-examine the witnesses against him. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>243 Conn. 282, 307, 705 A.2d 181 (1997). Moreover, [i]t is true that the scope and extent of cross-examination generally rest within the sound discretion of the trial court. . . . This discretion arises, however, only after the defendant has been permitted cross-examination and impeachment of a witness sufficient to satisfy the sixth amendment. . . . [A]n important function of cross-examination is the exposure [of] a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying. . . . Cross-examination to elicit facts tending to show motive, interest, bias and prejudice is a matter of right and may not be unduly restricted. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>45 Conn. App. 390, 397-98, 696 A.2d 993, cert. granted, 243 Conn. 904, 701 A.2d 336 (1997).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>48 Conn. App. 19, 24, 708 A.2d 969, cert. denied, 245 Conn. 901, 719 A.2d 1164 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Because I believe that the motion for a judgment of acquittal should have been granted as to the first degree sexual assault count and that the jury should not have been allowed to reach that count, or, in the alternative, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>that the trial court improperly restricted the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of S, I would reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction of risk of injury to a child and remand the case for a new trial on that count.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-10\"> The labia majora axe the two outer folds of skin that enclose the external genital organs of the female.
