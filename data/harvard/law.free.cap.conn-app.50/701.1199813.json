Co. of America </em>v. <em>Powers, Bolles, Houlihan &amp; Hartline, Inc., </em>38 Conn. App. 290, 660 A.2d 369, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 904, 665 A.2d 901 (1995). The defendant, Powers, Bolles, Houlihan and Hartline, Inc., appeals from the judgment of the trial court rendered in favor of the plaintiff, General Accident Insurance Company of America (General Accident), in the amount of $105,904.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) concluded that its insurance application was deficient as a matter of law for the purpose of electing a lesser amount of uninsrired-underinsured motorist coverage, and (2) failed to hold that the proper measure of damages was the difference between the premium that was actually charged to the policyholder for the coverage and the premium that would have been charged for the higher amount of coverage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>The following relevant facts and procedural history are recited in <em>General Accident Ins. Co. of America </em>v. <em>Powers, Bolles, Houlihan &amp; Hartline, Inc., </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 290. \u201cOn January 19, 1990, the plaintiff and the defendant were parties to an insurance agency agreement. At that time, the defendant processed an application from Barbara Zakrzewski to the plaintiff, requesting automobile insurance for each of two automobiles owned by Zakrzewski. The application form utilized by the plaintiff was entitled the \u2018Acord Personal Automobile Application.\u2019 This form was completed by the defendant and signed by Zakrzewski. It requested $100,000 of liability coverage and $40,000 of uninsured-underinsured motorist coverage for each of her two automobiles. At the time of Zakrzewski\u2019s application for automobile insurance, General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175c (now \u00a7 38a-336)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> required that every automobile liability insurance policy \u2018issued or renewed on and after July 1, 1984\u2019 was to have uninsured motorist coverage equal to the liability coverage of the policy \u2018unless the insured requests in writing a lesser amount.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">\u201cOn July 19, 1990, Zakrzewski\u2019s son, John Sliwka, was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident when the car in which he was a passenger went off the road and overturned. Sliwka filed a claim against the operator\u2019s insurance carrier, which paid its policy limit of $20,000. Sliwka then filed a claim against the plaintiff for underinsured motorist coverage under Zakrzewski\u2019s policy. Sliwka alleged that there had been no written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>request by Zakrzewski for uninsured-underinsured motorist coverage in an amount less than the liability coverage, as required under \u00a7 38a-336. Because the policy provided for $100,000 of liability coverage, Sliwka filed a claim based on $100,000 of uninsured-underin-sured motorist coverage for each of two vehicles. Sliw-ka\u2019s claim was for $180,000.\u00ae</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">\u201cAfter determining that the Acord application signed by Zakrzewski did not fulfill the statutory requirement of a written request for a lower limit of uninsured-underinsured motorist coverage, the plaintiff concluded that it owed Sliwka up to $200,000 in uninsured-underin-sured motorist coverage. The plaintiff subsequently settled the claim with Sliwka for $160,904.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">\u201cThereafter, the plaintiff filed a two count complaint against the defendant, alleging both breach of contract and negligence. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant was liable for failing to obtain a written request from Zakrzewski for unmsured-underinsured motorist coverage in an amount less than the liability coverage. The plaintiff claimed damages of $105,530, the amount by which the plaintiffs payment to Sliwka exceeded the intended coverage under the policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">\u201cThe focal point of the evidence during trial was the Acord application form, which had been filled out by the defendant and signed by Zakrzewski on January 19, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>1990. The primary liability issue was whether that Acord application satisfied the written request requirement imposed by \u00a7 38a-336. The defendant conceded that it had a duty to obtain a sufficient written request to comply with the statute, but it argued that the Acord application satisfied that statutory requirement. The plaintiff argued that the Acord application did not satisfy the statute and that the defendant should have utilized a separate, supplemental application form which the plaintiff had prescribed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on the breach of contract count, awarding $20 in damages,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and in favor of the defendant on the negligence count. The verdict was accepted and recorded on September 21,1993.\u201d <em>General Accident Ins. Co. of America </em>v. <em>Powers, Bolles, Houli-han &amp; Hartline, Inc., </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 291-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">Both parties appealed to this court, claiming that the trial court improperly instructed the jury. We determined in the first appeal that the trial court\u2019s charge with respect to \u00a7 38a-336 was inadequate to guide the jury on issues of fact and impermissibly forced the jury to decide a material question of law. Id., 298. We remanded the case for a new trial. Id. Thereafter, the parties submitted the case to the trial court, first, for a determination of liability on the basis of summary judgment and, second, for a determination of the appropriate measure of damages if liability was found. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>plaintiff as to liability. Subsequently, the trial court directed the jury to return a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $105,904. Additional relevant facts will be recited where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The defendant claims that the trial court, in ruling on the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment, improperly concluded that the Acord application was deficient as a matter of law for the purpose of electing a lesser amount of uninsured motorist coverage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the trial court improperly interpreted the following phrase in General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336: \u201cunless the insured requests in writing a lesser amount.\u201d The defendant argues that the trial court, after concluding that the phrase was unambiguous, improperly went on to consider the legislative history of the statute and to consider as \u201cclarification\u201d the elaborate new requirements contained in \u00a7 2 of No. 93-297 of the 1993 Public Acts (P.A. 93-297),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which was enacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>subsequent to the transactions that occurred in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant contends that in so doing, the trial court ignored the plain language of the statute in determining that the Acord Personal Automobile Application was deficient as a matter of law for the purpose of electing a lesser amount of uninsured-underin-sured coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">The plaintiff argues that the trial court properly considered the legislative history of \u00a7 38a-336 and the language of P.A. 93-297 in determining that the Acord application did not constitute a request in writing for lesser coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">\u201cOur standard of review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment is well established.\u201d <em>Zichichi </em>v. <em>Middlesex Memorial Hospital, </em>204 Conn. 399, 402, 528 A.2d 805 (1987). Practice Book \u00a7 17-49, formerly \u00a7 384, requires that \u201c[t]he judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d \u201cIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The test is whether a party would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>omitted.) <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Colwell, </em>214 Conn. 242, 246-47, 571 A.2d 116 (1990). A motion for summary judgment \u201cis properly granted if it raises at least one legally sufficient defense that would bar the plaintiffs claim and involves no triable issue of fact.\u201d <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhat-tan-Europe, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 543, 494 A.2d 555 (1985). Because this appeal involves questions of statutory construction, it presents a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>232 Conn. 311, 317, 654 A.2d 1221 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">In addressing the issues in this case, we are initially guided by well defined principles of statutory interpretation. The court\u2019s \u201cfundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Edelstein </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Health &amp; Addiction Services, </em>240 Conn. 658, 664, 692 A.2d 803 (1997), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994). Moreover, principles of statutory construction require the court to construe a statute in a manner that will not frustrate its intended purpose or lead to an absurd result. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>219 Conn. 703, 712, 595 A.2d 297 (1991). The court \u201cmust avoid a construction that fails to attain a rational and sensible result that bears directly on the purpose the legislature sought to achieve.\u201d Id., 713. \u201cWhen ... we are confronted with ambiguity in a statute, we look to its legislative history, its language, the purpose it is to serve, and the circumstances surrounding its enactment to determine the legislative intent. <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Sivertsen, </em>188 Conn. 213, 221, 448 A.2d 1344 (1982).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pasi\u00f3n, </em>219 Conn. 764, 769, 594 A.2d 468 (1991). \u201cWhere the legislative intent is clear there is no room for statutory construction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kelemen </em>v. <em>Rimrock Corp., </em>207 Conn. 599, 606, 542 A.2d 720 (1988). \u201c[W]hen the language of a statute is plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>204 Conn. 410, 421, 528 A.2d 811 (1987); <em>Beloff v. Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>203 Conn. 45, [54], 523 A.2d 477 (1987).\u201d <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">The trial court determined that application of the principles of statutory interpretation to the phrase \u201crequests in writing a lesser amount\u201d required \u201ca finding that the legislature intended to require a more exacting writing [than] an insurance application, filled out by the insurance agent, signed by the insured, containing no conspicuous notice of the insured\u2019s right to the statutory amount of coverage or specified alternatives, or of the effect of making the election.\u201d The trial court found that the phrase was unambiguous and that \u201cthe words themselves express the intent of the legislature.\u201d The trial court reached its conclusion primarily based on its interpretation of the common usage of the terms in the phrase in question. In addition, however, the trial court went on to examine P.A. 93-297 and determined that the public act clarified the earlier law. As we have noted, P.A. 93-297 enacted specific requirements including the signing of an informed consent form before an insured\u2019s election of a lesser amount of insurance coverage would be effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">We believe that the trial court was correct in concluding that the phrase \u201crequests in writing a lesser amount\u201d is unambiguous and that accordingly, resort to legislative history is unnecessary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> According to the <em>plain </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number><em>meaning of the statute, </em>the requirement is fully satisfied by the written application for insurance that was signed by the insured. The plaintiff notes in its brief that \u201c[t]he application signed by Ms. Zakrzewski requested $100,000 liability and $40,000 uninsured motorist/under-insured motorist coverage for each of two automobiles.\u201d That statement plainly indicates the plaintiffs acknowledgement that Zakrzewski requested in writing an amount of uninsured motorist coverage in a lesser amount than the liability coverage. There is no requirement that the plaintiff personally produce the writing. That requirement is satisfied by the Acord application. The Acord application includes reference to both the greater amount of liability coverage and the lesser amount of uninsured coverage. The difference is unmistakable. There was no requirement at the time of the insured\u2019s application that the writing must specifically use the term \u201clesser\u201d in requesting the uninsured coverage. The difference in amounts of coverage requested informs the insured that the uninsured coverage was requested in a lesser amount than the liability coverage. Thus, the plain language of the statute is satisfied. Section 38a-336 required nothing further of the insured in order effectively to waive the uninsured coverage in an amount equal to the liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The trial court stated that \u201c[t]here is no evidence in the writing that the alleged election to purchase less uninsured motorist coverage than the statute would have prescribed was informed, conscious or reflective.\u201d The language of \u00a7 38a-336 provided no requirement that the writing contain such evidence. The statute required only that the insured \u201crequests in writing a lesser amount.\u201d We note, however, that the trial court had in its possession, when it ruled on the summary judgment motions, undisputed evidence in the affidavit of Arthur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>B. Powers, an officer of the defendant, stating facts to support a determination that the insured\u2019s decision was informed, conscious and reflective.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">Our analysis of the statutory language of \u00a7 38a-336 is in accord with the line of cases decided by our Supreme Court governing this subject. See <em>Harlach </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Properly &amp; Liability Ins. Co., </em>221 Conn. 185, 602 A.2d 1007 (1992); <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pasion, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 764; <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Malec, </em>215 Conn. 399, 576 A.2d 485 (1990). <em>In Malee, </em>the Supreme Court, addressing \u00a7 38-175c, now \u00a7 38a-336, stated: \u201cWe have no doubt that the General Assembly contemplated that an insured should make a purposeful and knowing decision to request a lesser amount of [uninsured motorist] coverage.\u201d <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Malee, </em>supra, 403. The court examined the legislative history in the course of concluding that the insured\u2019s rejection in that case did not satisfy the statutory requirement because it was a past, not present, rejection of the coverage. Id., 402-404. The court, in referring to the statutory language \u201cunless the insured requests in writing a lesser amount,\u201d did not hold that any specific language or procedure was necessary in order to constitute an effective request. Id., 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In <em>Harlach, </em>which upheld an election of lesser coverage pursuant to \u00a7 38-175c, now \u00a7 38a-336, our Supreme Court stated: \u201cAlthough the word \u2018waiver\u2019 nowhere appears in the statute, even if we assume, arguendo, that the waiver doctrine was applicable to the circumstances here, application of its principles would not support the plaintiffs position. \u2018Waiver is the voluntary relinquishment of a known right. It involves the idea of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>assent, and assent is an act of understanding. This presupposes that the person to be affected has knowledge of his rights, but does not wish to assert them. Intention to relinquish must appear, but acts and conduct . . . inconsistent with intention to terminate the contract are sufficient. The rule is applicable that no one shall be permitted to deny that he intended the natural consequences of his acts and conduct.\u2019 . . . <em>MacKay </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>118 Conn. 538, 547-48, 173 A. 783 (1934). \u2018In order to waive a claim of law it is not necessary . . . that a party be certain of the correctness of the claim and its legal efficacy. It is enough if he knows of the existence of the claim and of its reasonably possible efficacy.\u2019 <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>152 Conn. 249, 257-58, 205 A.2d 780 (1964). The plaintiff knew that he was selecting less coverage than that to which he was entitled. The notice made it very clear that increased amounts of coverage were available at a higher premium and that an election to accept less would reduce both the amount of coverage and the policy premium.\u201d <em>Harlach </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability Ins. Co., </em>supra, 221 Conn. 192-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Finally, in <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 219 Conn. 771, in deciding that the signature of one insured could not bind another, our Supreme Court referred to a \u201cconscious choice\u201d being necessary to elect lesser coverage. As in <em>Malee, </em>the court in <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. </em>did not prescribe any specific language as nec-essaiy for an insured to make the election effectively. Id., 770-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">We turn next to the relevance, if any, to the present case of P.A. 93-297. There is no doubt that the legislature, in 1993, enacted more elaborate requirements for the insured\u2019s waiver. The issue is whether that public act qualifies as an amendment that clarifies the language of \u00a7 38-175c at issue in this case. See <em>Daly </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>225 Conn. 499, 511, 624 A.2d 876 (1993) (subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>amendment to existing statute may clarify legislature\u2019s original intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">The guidelines for determining whether an amendment can be applied retroactively as a clarifying act are well known. \u201cWhether to apply a statute retroactively or prospectively depends upon the intent of the legislature in enacting the statute. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>204 Conn. 259, 284, 528 A.2d 760 (1987). In order to determine the legislative intent, we utilize well established rules of statutory construction. Our point of departure is General Statutes \u00a7 55-3, which states: No provision of the general statutes, not previously contained in the statutes of the state, which imposes any new obligation on any person or corporation, shall be construed to have retrospective effect. The obligations referred to in the statute are those of substantive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">. . . Thus, we have uniformly interpreted \u00a7 55-3 as a rule of presumed legislative intent that statutes affecting substantive rights shall apply prospectively only. <em>Coley </em>v. <em>Camden Associates , Inc., </em>243 Conn. 311, 316, 702 A.2d 1180 (1997). This presumption in favor of prospective applicability, however, may be rebutted when the legislature clearly and unequivocally expresses its intent that the legislation shall apply retrospectively. <em>In re Daniel H., </em>237 Conn. 364, 372, 678 A.2d 462 (1996); accord <em>Bayusik </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>233 Conn. 474, 483-84, 659 A.2d 1188 (1995); <em>Miano </em>v. <em>Thorne, </em>218 Conn. 170, 175, 588 A.2d 189 (1991). Where an amendment is intended to clarify the original intent of an earlier statute, it necessarily has retroactive effect. . . . <em>Toise </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>243 Conn. 623, 628, 707 A.2d 25 (1998). We generally look to the statutory language and the pertinent legislative histoiy to ascertain whether the legislature intended that the amendment be given retrospective effect. See, <em>e.g., Reliance Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American Casualty Co. of Reading, Pennsylvania, </em>238 Conn. 285, 290, 679 A.2d 925 (1996); <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Vermilyn Brown, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number><em>Inc., 232 </em>Conn. 780, 787, 657 A.2d 616 (1995).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bryant, 245 </em>Conn. 710, 718-19, 714 A.2d 1209 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">There is no doubt that P.A. 93-297 addresses the same subject matter as the statute that it was enacted to amend. That coincidence, however, does not mean that the later act was intended to clarify the earlier. The trial court construed P.A. 93-297 as a clarification of \u00a7 38a-336, and the plaintiff urges us to so construe the act. Neither the trial court nor the plaintiff, however, has offered any analysis of the pertinent factors necessary to support such a construction of the act. The plaintiff points to no judicial interpretation to which the legislature was responding. No controversies are cited that the act was supposedly designed to resolve. The legislative history pertaining to P.A. 93-297 makes no mention of whether the act was intended to clarify the language at issue in \u00a7 38a-336. There is no indication in the language of P.A. 93-297, its legislative history or the surrounding circumstances that the legislature intended the act to clarify the existing law. Rather than a clarification of existing law, in response to a controversy created by a judicial interpretation, P.A. 93-297 represents a decision by the legislature to change the law by adding elaborate and stringent requirements before an insured could be deemed to waive a lesser amount of uninsured motorist coverage. <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 722-23 (P.A. 93-297 change, not clarification, of existing law with respect to whether any named insured may elect less uninsured motorist coverage on behalf of all insureds). In the absence of evidence that P.A. 93-297 was intended to clarify existing law, the newly created stringent requirements may not be applied retroactively to the facts of this case. The defendant\u2019s conduct must be measured according to the language of the statute then in effect, General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175c. On the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>of the plain language of that statute, we conclude that the Acord Personal Automobile Application signed by the insured fulfilled the statutory requirement of a request by the insured in writing for a lesser amount of uninsured motorist coverage. As a result, the trial court improperly rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b722-9\"> Our determination of the first issue on appeal malees resolution of this issue unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b723-5\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2) provides in relevant part: \u201cNotwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, every such policy issued or renewed on and alter July 1, 1984, shall provide uninsured motorist coverage with limits for bodily injury and death equal to those purchased to protect against loss resulting from the liability imposed by law unless the insured requests in writing a lesser amount, but not less than the limits specified in subsection (a) of section 14-112. . . .\u201d Section 38-175 (a.)

This was to be reduced by the $20,000 Sliwka received from the operator\u2019s insurance carrier and $5000 in basic reparations paid, leaving a total of $55,000.
