See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuessen-ich, </em>50 Conn. App. 187, 717 A.2d 801 (1998) (AC 16605), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>and <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuessenich, </em>50 Conn. App. 199, 714 A.2d 728 (1998) (AC 16487).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly granted the state\u2019s motion to modify the conditions of probation. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuessenich, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 187, we concluded that the defendant\u2019s probation officer properly included drug testing as a condition of probation because the trial court could have originally imposed the condition under the circumstances of the case. Because the probation officer properly added the drug testing condition, modification or enlargement is no longer necessary. This appeal is therefore moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
