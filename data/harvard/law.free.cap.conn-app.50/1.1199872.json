We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. This case arises out of a reverse sting operation that the Hartford police department conducted on January 14, 1995, at the Bellevue Square housing project in Hartford.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Officer Reginald Allen posed as a drug dealer while Officers Mark Castagna and David Kardys awaited Allen\u2019s signal in a nearby building. Lieutenant Michael Fallon watched the scene from a van on the same street.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">At approximately 11:32 a.m., the defendant and a female companion approached Allen in a Chrysler New Yorker automobile. The defendant asked Allen if he \u201chad anything\u201d and said that he wanted heroin. After speaking to his passenger, the defendant told Allen that he wanted five bags of heroin. The defendant had money in his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">At that point, Allen signaled the other officers and identified himself to the defendant as a police officer. The defendant said, \u201cOh, shit,\u201d and the passenger said, \u201cGo, go, go.\u201d The defendant then sped down the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Castagna and Kardys appeared, identified themselves as police officers and ordered the defendant to stop. Both officers were wearing clothing clearly identifying them as police officers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Castagna drew his gun as he ordered the car to stop. The defendant veered his car onto the sidewalk, hitting Castagna and Kardys.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">As the defendant continued down the street, Fallon blocked the defendant\u2019s car with his vehicle. Kardys, Allen and Fallon surrounded the car, identified themselves as police officers, and ordered the defendant to shut off the engine and get out of the car. When the defendant did not comply, the officers forcibly removed the defendant from the car and arrested him. The officers then arrested the defendant\u2019s companion.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">A jury convicted the defendant of first degree assault, interfering with a police officer, attempted possession of narcotics, and attempted possession of narcotics within 1500 feet of a school. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly excluded as irrelevant the cross-examinations of Castagna and Kardys on their settlements with the defendant\u2019s insurance company and improperly excluded extrinsic evidence of those settlements offered to impeach the witnesses\u2019 credibility. The defendant argues that this ruling violated his constitutional rights to confrontation and to due process. Because the settlements of the injury claims are not relevant to the officers\u2019 credibility, this court finds no impropriety in the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-10\">The right to confrontation, which includes the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses, is guaranteed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and by article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, but it is not an absolute and unbounded right. <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, 191 </em>Conn. 146, 148, 463 A.2d 611 (1983). A court may, in the exercise of its discretion, limit the extent of cross-examination, especially with respect to credibility. C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 3.4.3, pp. 43-44. We traditionally apply a two part analysis to determine whether a party has been deprived of effective cross-examination. \u201cFirst, we determine whether the defendant received the minimum opportunity for cross-examination of adverse witnesses required by the constitution. ... If so, we then consider whether the trial court\u2019s restriction of cross-examination amounted to an abuse of discretion under the rules of evidence. ... To establish an abuse of discretion, [the defendant] must show that the restrictions imposed upon the cross-examination were clearly prejudicial. ... If, however, the defendant is denied the right of effective cross-examination, there would be constitutional error of the first magnitude and no amount of showing of want of prejudice would cure it.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Plaskonka, </em>22 Conn. App. 207, 214, 577 A.2d 729, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 812, 580 A.2d 65 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">As to the first part, the defendant does not assert that he was denied the minimum opportunity for cross-examining the witnesses. Although the defendant largely limited his cross-examination of Castagna to the settlement issue, the defendant cross-examined Kardys more widely with no restriction from the court except as to the settlement issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, the trial court\u2019s decision did not unduly restrict the defendant\u2019s questioning so as to violate his right effectively to cross-examine the -witnesses against him or to present a defense. Effective cross-examination does not include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>eliciting or presenting evidence that is immaterial or irrelevant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>232 Conn. 740, 746, 657 A.2d 611 (1995). When the trial court properly excludes evidence as irrelevant, it does not abuse its discretion in limiting cross-examination as to the excluded evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>43 Conn. App. 667, 676-77, 685 A.2d 677 (1996), cert. denied, 240 Conn. 923, 692 A.2d 819 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">On cross-examination, Castagna testified that the defendant intentionally hit him with his car. Prior to his court appearance, Castagna had settled a personal injury claim with the defendant\u2019s insurer pursuant to a policy that excludes intentional torts from its coverage. At trial, the defendant asserted that the settlement constituted conduct equivalent to a prior inconsistent statement and sought to impeach Castagna by eliciting testimony and introducing extrinsic evidence in the form of a signed general release of liability. The defendant also wanted to introduce similar evidence with respect to Kardys. The trial court limited the cross-examination about the settlement and excluded the extrinsic evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>The trial court\u2019s ruling was proper because the settlement evidence was not relevant to impeach Castagna and Kardys. A defendant may introduce prior inconsistent statements to impeach a witness. <em>State </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>151 Conn. 592, 597, 200 A.2d 724 (1964), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Joseph </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>379 U.S. 963, 85 S. Ct. 654, 13 L. Ed. 2d 557 (1965); C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, supra, \u00a7 7.24.3, p. 207. The trial court must determine, however, whether the statement or conduct is, in fact, sufficiently contrary to the position asserted at trial to justify its introduction as a prior inconsistent statement. <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 710, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The relevancy issue, therefore, hinges on whether the mere settlement of a potential tort claim permits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>the imputation to a settling party of a position sufficient to constitute an inconsistent statement. Specifically, the defendant argues that by settling civil claims where intentionality would bar recovery, Castagna and Kardys essentially admitted that the defendant did not act intentionally. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Signing a general release of liability does not necessarily constitute an assertion of any particular theory of liability. That the insurer settled the claims on a negligence basis does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that this representation was made to the insurer or that the witnesses\u2019 counsel in those matters did not present alternate theories. A prior inconsistent statement must be \u201csufficiently inconsistent.\u201d Id., 711. On the basis of the facts and assertions in the record here, we cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Moreover, the settlement does not serve as an indicia of financial incentive, motive or bias. Neither Castagna nor Kardys had any personal interest in the outcome of the criminal trial. Although a pending claim or civil suit by one of the witnesses might suggest evidence of bias or interest because the outcome of the criminal trial would bear directly on the success of the civil action, there was no such pending action here.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">We do not go so far as to say that representations made in a settlement or complaint will never constitute statements or admissions. In this case, however, they do not and, thus, we conclude that the trial court properly excluded the settlement evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury with respect to the first degree assault charge. Specifically, the defendant claims that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the trial court failed to comment on the evidence and inadequately defined \u201csubstantial and unjustifiable risk\u201d when instructing on reckless assault in the first degree. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13). We address these two claims separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">We first note that at the conclusion of the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury, the defendant requested that the trial court amend its instructions to define \u201csubstantial and unjustifiable risk.\u201d When the trial court declined his request, the defendant excepted to the instructions. This portion of the defendant\u2019s second claim, therefore, was properly preserved for appeal. We disagree, however, that the trial court\u2019s instructions on reckless assault in the first degree were inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">The standard of review of jury instructions is well established. \u201cA charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected nor are individual instructions to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Taylor, 196 Conn. 225, 231, 492 A.2d 155 (1985). \u201cIn reviewing a challenge to jury instructions, we must examine the charge in its entirety. . . . While the instructions need not be exhaustive, perfect or technically accurate, they must be correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury. . . . The court is under no duty at any time to charge in the exact language requested. . . . Failure to charge precisely as proposed by a [party] is not error where the point is fairly covered in the charge.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barrenechea </em>v. <em>Lamonica, </em>44 Conn. App. 389, 395, 689 A.2d 1137 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">Here, in its instructions on reckless assault in the first degree, the trial court explained the terms \u201crecklessly\u201d and \u201csubstantial and unjustifiable risk\u201d to the jury as follows: \u201cNow, second, the state must prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt that under the circumstances as described, the defendant recklessly engaged in conduct that created a risk of death to another person. How does a person act recklessly? A person acts recklessly with respect to a result under circumstances described by the statute as defining an offense when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur and that such circumstances exist. <em>The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregarding it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a, reasonable person would observe in the situation. </em>The standard of conduct of a reasonable person in the same situation as the defendant is the doing of something that a reasonably prudent person would do under the circumstances or omitting to do what a reasonably prudent person would not do under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u201cNow, a gross deviation is a great or substantial deviation, not just a slight or moderate deviation. There must be a great or substantial indifference between, on the one hand, the defendant\u2019s conduct in disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk and, on the other hand, what a reasonable person would have done under the circumstances. Whether a risk is substantial and unjustifiable is a question of fact for you to determine under all the circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Considering the trial court\u2019s instructions on reckless assault in the first degree as a whole, we do not believe that the jury could have been misled by the trial court\u2019s explanation of a \u201csubstantial and unjustifiable risk.\u201d We conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions on this issue were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">The defendant\u2019s claim regarding the trial court\u2019s failure to comment on the evidence during its charge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the jury was not properly preserved at trial. He now seeks review under the standards of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">A constitutional claim not properly preserved for appeal may nonetheless be successful. Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d Id., 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\u201cIn reviewing a constitutional challenge to the trial court\u2019s instructions, we must consider the jury charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the instruction misled the jury. . . . The test is whether the charge as a whole presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result. . . . We will reverse a conviction only if, in the context of the whole, there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict. . . . In assessing whether a jury reasonably could have been misled by the court\u2019s instructions ... it is always proper to consider whether the issues in the case are complicated.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>41 Conn. App. 701, 713-14, 679 A.2d 19, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 906, 682 A.2d 1011 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>233 Conn. 502, 512, 659 A.2d 1194 (1995), our Supreme Court concluded that \u201creview of or comment on the evidence is not constitutionally mandated where the trial court, in the exercise of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>sound discretion, determines that such commentary is not necessary and that the jury would be properly instructed and not misled in its absence.\u201d In reaching that conclusion, the Supreme Court noted that \u201c[i]t has long been established that [i]n properly instructing the juiy it may or may not be necessary for the court to recall the attention of the jury to the evidence and to the facts which the State and the accused respectively claim to have established, or to comment upon the evidence or express an opinion as to its weight, or as to what verdict would be proper if the jury should find certain facts to have been proved. The charge should be so framed that the jury may clearly understand the matters which are submitted to them. . . . It is within the province, and may be within the duty, of the trial judge to not only call attention to the evidence adduced, but to state to the jury in the charge his own opinion of the nature, bearing and force of such evidence. . . . <em>It is not necessarily error to omit all comment upon the bearing and weight of </em>evidence; and generally the extent to which the court should discuss the evidence in submitting a case to the jury is, so long as in criminal cases the jury [is] not directed how to find [its] verdict, within the discretion of the trial judge. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, 72 </em>Conn. 39, 43, 43 A. 493 (1899).\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lem-oine, </em>supra, 510-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Here, as in <em>Lemoine, </em>the trial court, after the close of the evidence and final arguments of counsel, instructed the jury as to the law applicable to all of the charges against the defendant. The trial court then instructed the jury as to the elements the state must prove as to each of the crimes charged in the information in order to convict the defendant. The trial court\u2019s instructions specified the victims to which the various charges against the defendant applied, and the jury had the information during deliberations. Further, the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>presented were narrow and uncomplicated, and the elements of the crimes with which the defendant was charged, the claims of the parties and the evidence presented were not difficult to understand.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Moreover, as in <em>Lemoine, </em>the final arguments of counsel thoroughly reviewed the testimony given by the witnesses. We conclude, on the basis of the foregoing, that it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions and that no injustice to the defendant resulted by reason of the court\u2019s instructions. See id., 516; see also <em>State </em>v. Glover, 40 Conn. App. 387, 393-94, 671 A.2d 384, cert. denied, 236 Conn. 918, 673 A.2d 1145 (1996). The defendant\u2019s claim fails to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court\u2019s instruction on the narcotics charges was inadequate and misleading. Specifically, the defendant maintains that the jury instruction should have made clear that \u201cpossession,\u201d an essential element of the crime of attempted possession of narcotics, denotes \u201cexclusive control and dominion.\u201d This claim was not raised at trial and was thus not properly preserved for appeal. The defendant now seeks review of it under the standards of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. We will review the defendant\u2019s claim as the record is adequate for review and the alleged violation is of constitutional magnitude involving the defendant\u2019s constitutional due process rights to proper jury instructions on the essential element of a crime. See <em>State v. Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 308, 630 A.2d 593 (1993). We conclude, however, that the defendant has failed to show that the alleged violation clearly exists and clearly deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">This court has stated that \u201c[a]s long as the jury charge provides the jury with a clear understanding of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>elements of the crime and guidance for proper determination of whether those elements were present, the charge is constitutionally adequate.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>40 Conn. App. 601, 607, 672 A.2d 969, cert. denied, 237 Conn. 918, 676 A.2d 1374 (1996). Here, the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury on the charge of attempted possession of narcotics was almost four pages long. As to the essential element of possession, the trial court stated, \u201cFirst, I will discuss the elements of the underlying crime of possession of narcotics. Now, under our statutes a person is charged with violating Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-279 (a), which, as it pertains to this case, provides as follows. Any person who possesses any quantity of any narcotic substance, except as authorized, shall be punished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The defendant asserts that the trial court\u2019s failure to explain that possession indicates exclusive control or dominion rendered the jury instructions inadequate. Under the facts of this case, however, it was not necessary for the trial court to instruct on exclusive control and dominion. Exclusive control or dominion by a defendant becomes critical only where a defendant\u2019s mere presence near the contraband is the sole factor supporting an inference of possession. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>28 Conn. App. 575, 580, 611 A.2d 457 (1992). The defendant did not suggest at trial that he may have served as a mere conduit of the drags to his companion. The state presented evidence to show that the defendant did attempt to possess the narcotics. The defense presented evidence intended to show that the defendant merely asked Allen for directions and fled when he thought he was being attacked by armed robbers. Given the evidence presented and the arguments made at trial, the jury had the choice of either concluding beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant attempted to possess drugs or concluding that the state had not met its burden. The jury instructions made that clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Reading the instructions as a whole, we conclude that the jury was properly instructed on the crime of attempted possession of narcotics. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 40 Conn. App. 606. The defendant\u2019s claim, therefore, fails the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly concluded that there was sufficient evidence to sustain a guilty verdict with respect to the charge of first degree <em>assault. </em>The defendant failed to preserve this claim properly at trial because he failed to make a motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the evidence pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 42-42, formerly \u00a7 885, or to claim that the evidence was insufficient in any way. We review this claim under <em>State v. Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 233, because it is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>225 Conn. 270, 275-76 n.3, 623 A.2d 42 (1993); and the record is adequate to permit review.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Our Supreme Court has held that the mere possibility that a jury could have found otherwise is not ground for upsetting a verdict. A verdict must be sustained unless the jury could not have reasonably or logically inferred guilt beyond a reasonable doubt from the evidence presented at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>230 Conn. 686, 692-93, 646 A.2d 147 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">The review of a claim of insufficient evidence involves a two part analysis. In making the assessment, the court must first \u201cconstrue the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>38 Conn. App. 481, 488, 662 A.2d 799 (1995), cert. denied, 237 Conn. 902, 674 A.2d 1333 (1996). Second, the court must determine \u201cwhether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ... In this process of review, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The evidence presented by the state and accepted by the juiy tended to show that the defendant sped rapidly down the street away from Allen, that he veered onto the sidewalk and struck Castagna and Kardys, and that he continued down the road until a police van blocked his path. Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, we are satisfied that the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant \u201crecklessly engage [d] in conduct [that created] a risk of death to another person, and thereby cause[d] serious physical injury to another person.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). The defendant\u2019s claim fails to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">The defendant\u2019s final claim, which was not preserved at trial, is that his convictions for both attempted possession of narcotics and attempted possession of narcotics within 1500 feet of a school violate the protections against double jeopardy provided under the state and federal constitutions. Because the record is adequate to review this alleged claim of error and the claim is of constitutional magnitude, we conclude that the first two prongs of <em>Golding </em>are met and that the claim is reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">\u201cThe double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides: [N]or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb. The double jeopardy clause is applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L.

This constitutional guarantee prohibits not only multiple trials for the same offense, but also multiple punishments for the same offense in a single trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Patrick, </em>42 Conn. App. 640, 644, 681 A.2d 380 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u201cDouble jeopardy analysis in the context of a single trial is a two-step process. First, the charges must arise out of the same act or transaction. Second, it must be determined whether the charged crimes are the same offense. Multiple punishments are forbidden only if both conditions are met.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>216 Conn. 282, 290-91, 579 A.2d 84 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">. In the present case, both charges undisputedly arise from the same act or transaction because \u201cit is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>180 Conn. 599, 601, 430 A.2d 1297 (1980). Specifically, the defendant could not have been guilty of violating \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and 21a-279 (d), attempted possession of narcotics within 1500 feet of a school, without having first committed the crime of attempted possession of narcotics as defined by \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and 21-279 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">In analyzing whether two offenses constitute the same offense, the United States Supreme Court has stated that \u201cwhere the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether <em>each </em>provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>U.S. 299, 304, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932). In the present case, the two offenses constitute the \u201csame offense\u201d under <em>Blockburger </em>analysis, because only <em>one </em>of the offenses requires proof of an additional fact that the other does not, that fact being that the defendant was within 1500 feet of a school when he attempted to sell narcotics. The analysis, however, does not end here.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u201c[T]he <em>Blockburger </em>test is not a conclusive presumption of law; <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>471 U.S. 773, 779, 105 S. Ct. 2407, 85 L. Ed. 2d 764 (1985); but is a rule of statutoiy construction and should not be controlling where there is a clear indication of contrary legislative intent. <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 367, 103 S. Ct. 673, 74 L. Ed. 2d 535 (1983). As a rule of statutory construction, the <em>Blockburger </em>test \u2018does no more than create a rebuttable presumption.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>19 Conn. App. 245, 251-52, 562 A.2d 539 (1989). The determinative question is whether the legislature intended the offenses to be separate. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smart, </em>37 Conn. App. 360, 365, 656 A.2d 677 [cert. denied, 233 Conn. 914, 659 A.2d 187] (1995).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Braswell, </em>42 Conn. App. 264, 269, 679 A.2d 407 (1996), appeal dismissed, 243 Conn. 248, 701 A.2d 1057 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court has held that \u2018where ... a legislature specifically authorizes cumulative punishment under two statutes, regardless of whether those two statutes proscribe the \u201csame\u201d conduct under <em>Blockburger, </em>a court\u2019s task of statutory construction is at an end and the prosecutor may seek and the trial court or juiy may impose cumulative punishment under such statutes in a single trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Patrick, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 648. This court has concluded that legislative intent to authorize cumulative punishment is evidenced by \u201cthe language, structure and legislative history of a statute . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>We conclude that the language of \u00a7 21a-279 (d) manifests the legislature\u2019s clear intent to impose cumulative punishment for violating \u00a7 21a-279 (a) within 1500 feet of aschool. Section 21a-279 (d) provides that possession within 1500 feet of a school be punished by imprisonment \u201cfor a term of two years, which shall not be suspended and shall be <em>in addition and consecutive to any term of imprisonment imposed for violation of subsection (a), (b) or (c) of this </em>section.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 21a-279 (d) demonstrates that in enacting \u00a7 21a-279 (d), the legislators intended to impose cumulative punishment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> During the Senate hearings on Public Acts 1989, No. 89-256, Senator John Atkin stated, \u201cThe previous law only required the extra sentence for the sale of and now we\u2019re adding possession. I think this will go a long way to keep these drugs away from our children.\u201d 32 S. Proc., Pt. 10,1989 Sess., p. 3606. Representative Chiistel Truglia expressed similar sentiments in the General Assembly: \u201cI rise in support of this bill to increase penalties for illegal sale or possession of drugs near school grounds. The drug problem is one of the most serious issues facing our cities, state and country. . . . The message here is that the state will not tolerate the corruption of our youth. Our criminal justice system\u2019s ability to fight the war on drugs is enhanced by this bill to a great extent.\u201d 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 11, 1989 Sess., pp. 3863-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Because we conclude that the legislature intended and authorized cumulative punishments for violations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>of \u00a7 21a-279 (a) and (d), we hold that the defendant\u2019s convictions of both do not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b23-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when . . .

It\u2019s not necessary for me to get the amount of the money in the settlement, but I think I should be allowed to ask him if he didn\u2019t sign a piece of paper or release involving this case in which he signed a paper for an accident or occurrence.
