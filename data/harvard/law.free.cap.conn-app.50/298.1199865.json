Anna and Philip were adjudicated neglected on April 5,1991, and placed under the protective supervision of the petitioner for six months.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Anna and Philip have two half-brothers, Franklin and Arthur.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court found that \u201cthe twins\u2019 oldest half-brother, Franklin B., Jr., is [at the time of the hearing] 22 years of age. He is mentally retarded and has a documented history of multiple instances of sexually inappropriate behavior with children outside the family, which resulted in his arrest and a referral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>to a program for mentally retarded sex offenders in 1992. He was adjudicated not competent to stand trial for an alleged sexual offense as a juvenile.\u201d The twins\u2019 other half-brother, Arthur, was twenty years of age at the time of the hearing. The trial court found that \u201c[h]is negative, impulsive aggressive behavior has resulted in out of home placements . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The trial court found that \u201c[in] February, 1993, Anna, age three and one-half, disclosed to various responsible adults, including a social worker at the Yale Sexual Abuse Clinic, that her brother, Franklin B., Jr., age seventeen and one-half, had been sexually abusing her . . . [that] her twin brother, Philip, had been genitally fondled by Franklin and, that the half-brother, Arthur, then age sixteen, had participated in the sexually inappropriate behavior with the twins.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">In March, 1993, the petitioner placed the twins in foster care, where they have since remained. The trial court set expectations, which included the removal of Franklin from the respondent\u2019s home. The petitioner was willing to consider returning Anna and Philip to their mother if Franklin was placed out of the home. The trial court found, however, that Anna and Philip were not returned because Franklin\u2019s removal did not occur. The petitioner filed a petition for the termination of parental rights in April, 1996, which the trial court granted on August 22, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The trial court stated that \u201c[t]he parents were waiting for the department of mental retardation to find a placement for Franklin. The respondent made no other efforts to place Franklin, then nearly age eighteen, so that they could be reunited with the four year old twins, this despite the fact that, according to a witness for the mother, Franklin was \u2018able to care for himself.\u2019 As between promptly relocating Franklin, even temporarily while waiting for a department of mental retardation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>placement, and leaving the twins in foster care, the parents elected to leave the twins in foster care.\u201d The trial court further found that \u201cnotwithstanding the impressive prior history of Franklin as a sexual exploiter of children, [the respondent] did not believe Anna and did nothing to protect her from further abuse. . . . Anna was victimized by a male family member, victimized by her own mother\u2019s disbelief and victimized by a removal from her family, a move compelled by [the respondent\u2019s] failure to protect her. More than four years later, [the respondent] remains in denial, has been unimproved by therapy and has profound unresolved parenting limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The children began to fear their mother\u2019s outbursts at visitation periods with her. Anna and Philip bonded with their foster family, and neither child wanted to see their mother and her husband again. The trial court found that there is \u201can extensive history of neglect and poor parenting,\u201d and that the respondent\u2019s \u201csocial history is replete with references to the mother\u2019s poor personal hygiene and, more importantly, her volatile and inappropriate behavior.\u201d The court further found that the mother \u201cstill refuses to acknowledge\u201d the sexual victimization of the twins.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">With respect to the statutory grounds for termination of parental rights, the trial court found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the children were previously found to be neglected. It found that the respondent \u201chas failed to achieve such a degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the children, she could assume a responsible position in the life of these children\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, further, that \u201cthe children have been denied, by reason of an act of commission or omission, the care, guidance or control necessary for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>their physical, educational or emotional well-being, i.e., the mother has failed to protect her children from sexual abuse.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court found that the grounds had existed for more than one year and made the mandatory findings required by \u00a7 17a-112 (e).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court then concluded that it was in the best interest of the children to terminate the respondent\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u201cOur statutes define the termination of parental rights as the complete severance by court order of the legal relationship, with all its rights and responsibilities, between the child and his parent .... It is a most serious and sensitive realm of judicial action. ... To justify the termination of parental rights in the absence of consent, one or more of the grounds set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 [17a-112 (c) (3)] must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u201cSection [17a-112 (c) (3)] carefully sets out . . . [the] situations that, in the judgment of the legislature, constitute countervailing interests sufficiently powerful to justify the termination of parental rights in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>absence of consent. [The commissioner of the department of children and families], in petitioning to terminate those rights, must allege and prove [by clear and convincing evidence] one or more of the statutory grounds. In contrast to custody proceedings, in which the best interests of the child are always the paramount consideration and in fact usually dictate the outcome, in termination proceedings the statutory criteria must be met before termination can be accomplished and adoption proceedings begun. No all-encompassing best interests standard vitiates the requirement of compliance with the statutory criteria.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Michael M., </em>29 Conn. App. 112, 117-18, 614 A.2d 832 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Initially, the respondent mounts a two-pronged challenge to the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling permitting the admission into evidence, over objection on hearsay and statutory grounds, of written social studies that had been prepared at prior stages of the commitment and termination proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The petitioner claims that the evidence was properly admitted and that even if the admission was improper, the evidence was admitted through other sources and, thus, was not harmful. Without deciding whether the report or the statements contained within the report fit within any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule or case law; see, e.g., <em>In re Tabitha P., </em>39 Conn. App. 353, 368, 664 A.2d 1168 (1995); we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>conclude that the admission of the report, even if improper, was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The respondent claims that the following findings by the trial court were based on its review of the inadmissible studies: (1) that the children\u2019s brother, Franklin B., Jr., had a history of sexually inappropriate activity with other children, (2) that the other brother, Arthur, was placed out of the home as a result of aggressive behavior and (3) that the respondent herself came from tragic circumstances with a history of neglect and poor parenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">All of this contested information was admitted, without objection, through a December 2, 1996 report submitted by David Mantell, a clinical psychologist, who testified at the hearing and was subject to cross-examination. Mantell\u2019s report states that the respondent told Mantell that her son, Franklin, had to be removed from the home because of his inapproprite sexual behavior with other children. She stated that his teachers told her this. The respondent stated that her other son, Arthur, was placed out of the home for one and one-half years in 1989 when he was twelve and \u201cgiving the school a lot of trouble.\u201d The respondent also told Mantell about the tragic circumstances that surrounded her biological family, and that her mother had abandoned her at a young age and that she had left school after the eighth grade. In addition, Mantell testified, without objection, that the various court-related documents revealed poor conditions in the home and poor parenting practices by the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Because the evidence contained in the challenged social studies was merely cumulative, the admission of those studies as full exhibits was harmless. \u201cIt is well recognized that any error in the admission of evidence does not require reversal of the resulting judgment if the improperly admitted evidence is merely cumulative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>of other validly admitted testimony. . . . Even if we were to presume that the [trial court improperly admitted the report] . . . the [respondent] would need to prove that that [report] more probably than not affected the result.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fink </em>v. <em>Golenbock, </em>238 Conn. 183, 211, 680 A.2d 1243 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">We conclude that because the social studies were merely cumulative of Mantell\u2019s testimony and report, and because the respondent offered no proof that the result would have been different had the studies not been admitted, their admission, even if improper, was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The respondent next claims that the petitioner failed to provide clear and convincing evidence that the respondent had failed to achieve such a degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time she could assume a responsible position in the lives of the children,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that the children were denied the care, guidance or control necessary for their physical, educational or emotional well-being,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that the petitioner was unsuccessful in making any meaningful attempt to adjust her circumstances to facilitate reunification.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">These claims necessarily involve a challenge to the trial court\u2019s findings of facts and their application to its definition of the words of the statute. See <em>In re Rayna M., </em>13 Conn. App. 23, 36, 534 A.2d 897 (1987). \u201cWe cannot retry the facts. <em>In re Noel M., </em>23 Conn. App. 410, 418, 580 A.2d 996 (1990). On appeal, our function is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>legally correct and factually supported.\u201d <em>In re Michael M., </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The trial court\u2019s conclusions were legally correct and were factually supported by the record. Anna and Philip recounted the inappropriate sexual behavior of both of their half-brothers, Franklin and Arthur. The trial court recognized that the respondent provided appropriate medical care for the children when they were in her care and that she received therapy. The trial court found, however, that the respondent had not benefited from the therapy and social services. The trial court credited the testimony of Mantell and found that the respondent had poor parenting skills, intellectual limitations and a personality disorder. As a result, the family\u2019s situation was \u201cmarginal, at best, for the children <em>without </em>the sexual abuse concern.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court further agreed with Mantell that the case essentially revolved around the pivotal issue of the respondent\u2019s failure to accept the sexual victimization of Anna and Philip. The trial court found that the respondent \u201cstill refuses to acknowledge this problem.\u201d There was ample evidence in the record to support this conclusion. Essentially, the respondent does not claim that there is insufficient evidence in the record for the trial court\u2019s findings, but rather that she would prefer that this court rely solely on certain specified portions of evidence and her interpretation thereof. This we will not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Superior Court, upon hearing and notice . . . may grant a petition filed pursuant to this section if it finds by clear and convincing evidence ...

(B) the parent of a child who has been found by the Superior Court to have been neglected or uncared for in a prior proceeding has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child; [or] (C) the child has been denied, by reason of an act or acts of parental commission or omission, the care, guidance or control necessary for his physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being.

All children assumed that they had a common mother and father. During the termination proceedings, however, it was determined, by DNA testing, that Randy S., the nephew of the respondent husband, was the father of Anna B. and Philip B. The petitioner amended the petition to reflect Randy S. as the father. Randy S. consented to the termination of his parental rights in July, 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\"> See footnote 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b323-6\"> See footnote 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\"> The trial court\u2019s findings can be summarized as follows: (1) the petitioner offered parental, psychological and psychiatric services, visitation and foster care that were \u201cadequate, available, accessible and relevant\u201d; (2) the petitioner made reasonable efforts to reunite the family, and the respondent continues to fail to recognize \u201cher need for therapy or acknowledge that sexually inappropriate conduct was occurring to her infant twins\u201d; (3) the respondent did not fully comply with the expectations; (4) the children are bonded to their foster family, and no existing emotional bonds will be broken upon termination of the respondent\u2019s rights; (5) the children were eight years old at the time of trial; (6) the respondent has been \u201cunsuccessful in making any meaningful attempt to adjust her circumstances, conduct or condition to facilitate reunification\u201d; and (7) \u201cthere [had] been nothing to prevent the parents from maintaining a meaningful relationship with the children except the mother\u2019s volatile, aggressive and inappropriate behavior during visitation. There was no unreasonable conduct noted on the part of [the department of children and families]. The children\u2019s reaction to the visitation robustly indicated that continued visitation was not appropriate. The mother has not seen her children in nearly two years. The children do not wish to see her.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\"> The respondent argues that the applicable statute for termination of parental rights, General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112, does not mention social studies or their admission into evidence. She contends that because termination of parental rights is a statutory cause of action and not one founded in the common law, strict compliance with the statutory criteria is necessary before terminating parental rights. The respondent asserts that Practice Book \u00a7 33-5, formerly \u00a7 1043.1, allows the mandated social study to be made an exhibit for dispositional purposes, but there is no statutory language or rule of practice that permits these studies to be allowed as evidence for acljudieation purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b326-10\"> See footnote 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b326-11\"> See footnote 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b326-12\"> See footnote 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
