We agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The following facts and procedural histoiy are relevant to this appeal. On July 11, 1995, the defendant pleaded guilty to three counts of tampering with evidence in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-l 15.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was sentenced to four years imprisonment with execution suspended and three years probation. The trial court issued a probation order that provided in relevant part: \u201cIt is ordered and adjudged that . . . [s]aid defendant during the probationary term fixed shall abide by the written statement of the conditions of probation furnished by the probation officer and the instructions given regarding the same.\u201d Thereafter, the defendant was assigned a probation officer. Upon meeting with the defendant the following day, the probation officer required the defendant to sign a form that advised the defendant of his rights and duties with respect to his probation, as well as the conditions of his probation. The written statement contained a drug testing condition that was included by the probation officer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>condition was not expressly included by the trial court as a condition of the defendant\u2019s probation. The next day, the clerk of the court issued a probation order requiring the defendant to \u201cabide by the written statement of the conditions of probation furnished by the probation officer and the instructions given regarding the same.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s probation officer thereafter required the defendant to provide a specimen for urinalysis. This specimen tested positive for cocaine on August 14, 1995. The probation officer then obtained an arrest warrant for the defendant for the alleged violation of the conditions of his probation. Specifically, the probation officer alleged that the defendant tested positive for cocaine use in violation of his probation condition that he \u201cnot violate any criminal law.\u201d The defendant was then charged with violating the terms of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the violation of probation charge and to exclude evidence of the test results. In his motion, he asserted that the probation officer exceeded his statutory authority, and violated both the defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights by requiring him to submit to urinalysis. The defendant also claimed that because there was no evidence in the sentencing record relating to drug use or abuse by the defendant, the urinalysis condition is not otherwise reasonably related to the tampering with evidence conviction. He further argued that the requirement that he submit to random drug testing therefore violated his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures as provided in the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>and 20, of the constitution of Connecticut. After the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s probation revocation hearing, the trial court, <em>Pickett, J., </em>suppressed the urinalysis results, relying on Practice Book \u00a7 821, now \u00a7 41-12, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 156, 579 A.2d 58 (1990). The trial court concluded that \u201cthe evidence against the defendant was obtained in excess of statutoiy authority and in violation of his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizure under article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut.\u201d Thereafter, the state represented that it had no other evidence and the trial court, <em>Walsh, J., </em>dismissed the violation of probation charge. The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion for permission to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">We first address the jurisdictional question of whether a probation revocation hearing is a criminal case that can be appealed to this court pursuant to \u00a7 54-96.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state claims that a probation revocation hearing is a continuing consequence of the original criminal conviction that sufficiently relates back to the original criminal proceeding so as to make this a criminal case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[t]he element of \u2018punishment\u2019 in probation revocation of [a] defendant is attributable to the crime for which he was originally convicted and sentenced. Thus, any sentence [the] defendant had to serve as the result of the violation of the special condition was \u2018punishment\u2019 for the crime of which he had originally been convicted. Revocation is a continuing consequence of the original conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>from which probation was granted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 178, 540 A.2d 679 (1988). \u201cBecause [r]evocation is a continuing consequence of the original conviction from which probation was granted . . . and the inherent authority to convict and sentence a defendant flows from the authority to adjudicate a criminal cause of action, the subject matter jurisdiction over a probation revocation proceeding derives from the original presentment of the information.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>222 Conn. 299, 306, 610 A.2d 1147 (1992); see also <em>Liistro </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>170 Conn. 116, 128, 365 A.2d 109 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of a court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 304; 1 Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7 11 (1982). \u201cJurisdiction involves the power in a court to hear and determine the cause of action presented to it and its source is the constitutional and statutory provisions by which it is created. <em>Andrew Ansaldi Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>207 Conn. 67, 73, 540 A.2d 59 (1988) <em>(Shea, J., </em>concurring), quoting <em>Connecticut State Employees Association, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Personnel Policy Board, </em>165 Conn. 448, 456, 334 A.2d 909 (1973).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>supra, 305. Furthermore, article fifth, \u00a7 1, of the constitution of Connecticut provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he powers and jurisdiction of [the] courts shall be defined by law.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 51-164s provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he superior court shall be the sole court of original jurisdiction for all causes of action, except such actions over which the courts of probate have original jurisdiction, as provided by statute. . . .\u201d Moreover, \u201c[t]he question of whether the court has such jurisdiction . . . must be informed by the established principle that every presumption is to be indulged in favor of jurisdiction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ted.) <em>State v. Carey, </em>supra, 305, quoting <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 455, 460, 600 A.2d 310 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">We conclude that while this case is not a criminal prosecution, it is, nonetheless, a criminal case. This court, therefore, has jurisdiction to consider the appeal pursuant to \u00a7 54-96.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">The state next claims that the trial court improperly determined that the defendant\u2019s probation officer exceeded his authority in requiring the defendant to submit to urinalysis as a condition of probation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The state specifically contends that requiring the defendant to submit to urinalysis under the circumstances of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>case was reasonable and that in doing so, the probation officer was acting within his statutory authority pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-30 (b).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Specifically, \u00a7 53a-30 (b) provides that \u201c[w]hen a defendant has been sentenced to a period of probation, the Office of Adult Probation may require that the defendant comply with any or all conditions which the court <em>could have imposed </em>under subsection (a) which are not inconsistent with any condition actually imposed by the court.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Additionally, our Supreme Court has noted that \u00a7 53a-30 (b) expressly allows either the judge or the probation office to impose reasonable conditions of probation, and such an imposition is not an illegal delegation of the judicial function. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberson, </em>165 Conn. 73, 76 n.1, 327 A.2d 556 (1973). Moreover, \u201c[statutes authorizing probation, while setting parameters for doing so, have been very often construed to give the court broad discretion in imposing conditions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pieger, </em>240 Conn. 639, 647, 692 A.2d 1273 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 167. \u201c[I]n determining whether a condition of probation [is proper], a reviewing court should evaluate the condition imposed under our Adult Probation Act in the following context: The conditions must be reasonably related to the purposes of the [Probation] Act. Consideration of three factors is required to determine whether a reasonable relationship exists: (1) the purposes sought to be served by probation; (2) the extent to which constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>rights enjoyed by law-abiding citizens should be accorded to probationers; and (3) the legitimate needs of law enforcement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Here, the state maintains that urinalysis is a reasonable condition of probation because its purpose is to ensure that the defendant is complying with the terms of his probation. Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[s]ince probation is, first and foremost, a penal alternative to incarceration\u2014its objectives are to foster the offender\u2019s reformation and to preserve the public\u2019s safety\u2014a sentencing court must have the discretion to fashion those conditions of probation it deems necessary to ensure that the individual successfully completes the terms of probation.\u201d Id., 168-69; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>787 F.2d 1182, 1185 (7th Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">With respect to the extent that constitutional rights should be accorded to probationers, our Supreme Court has recognized that probationers have a diminished expectation of privacy because of their probationary status. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 174. \u201cAs with parolees, it may be crucial to the success of a probation program for a probation officer to have access to some information that a probationer may be unwilling to divulge and so a probation officer needs to be able to act in a manner that could not be tolerated if done by a policeman or other agent of the state with respect to an ordinary citizen under the fourth amendment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">\u201cAlthough the fourth amendment generally requires a warrant based on probable cause before a search occurs, exceptions exist to this requirement when a legitimate governmental purpose makes the intrusion into one\u2019s privacy reasonable. . . . This is consistent with the diminished expectation of privacy that a probationer ... is to expect in this governmental program <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>to normalize his relations with society.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 174; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>678 F.2d 32 (5th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Regarding the legitimate needs of law enforcement, our Supreme Court has stated that \u201cthe state has a legitimate interest in accurate [fact-finding] in probation revocation proceedings. This interest is clearly furthered by the admission of all rehable evidence, even that which is arguably obtained in violation of the fourth amendment. In addition, the state has an interest in deterring illegal searches and seizures. This interest, however, is not served by the exclusion of illegally seized evidence in probation revocation proceedings when the offending officer was unaware of the suspect\u2019s probationary status. We conclude that failure to apply the exclusionary rule in such circumstances is rationally related to legitimate state interests. \u201d <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>207 Conn. 565, 574-75, 541 A.2d 504, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 898, 109 S. Ct. 242, 102 L. Ed. 2d 230 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">On the basis of our review of the record in this case, and our analysis of the factors in <em>Smith </em>that are requisite to determining whether the conditions of a defendant\u2019s probation are reasonable, we conclude that the urinalysis in this case was a reasonable condition of the defendant\u2019s probation and was, therefore, improperly suppressed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">The state finally argues that the trial court improperly suppressed the defendant\u2019s urinalysis results in the probation revocation hearing and, as a result, improperly dismissed the violation of probation charge. Specifically, the state maintains that because the exclusionary rule does not apply to probation revocation proceedings, the test results were not illegally obtained and were, therefore, improperly suppressed by the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Our analysis here is guided by our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 565, where the court determined that the exclusionary rule did not apply to probation revocation hearings. In <em>Payne, </em>the probationer was stopped in his automobile by a police officer<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> who had information from a complainant that the probationer had threatened the complainant with a gun. While performing a warrantless search of the probationer\u2019s car, the officer found a loaded revolver under the driver\u2019s seat. The officer arrested the probationer on charges of threatening in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62 and of carrying a dangerous weapon in a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-38. The probationer was subsequently charged with violating the conditions of his probation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 (b).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The <em>Payne </em>court observed that \u201c[t]he purpose of probation revocation proceedings is to determine whether a probationer is complying with the conditions of his probation. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Winsett, </em>518 F.2d 51, 55 (9th Cir. 1975) .... In such proceedings, the government has an interest in accurate [fact-finding] that is likely to be impaired when otherwise reliable and relevant evidence is excluded from the proceeding. . . . Against this interest, we must balance the deterrent effect that may result from applying the exclusionary rule to probation hearings under the facts of this case. We conclude that application of the rule would at best achieve only a marginal deterrent effect.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (Citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>omitted.) <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 571; <em>State v. Jacobs, </em>229 Conn. 385, 391, 641 A.2d 1351 (1994). The <em>Payne </em>court noted that \u201c[t]he purpose of the exclusionary rule is not to redress the injury to the privacy of the search victim .... Instead, the rule\u2019s prime purpose is to deter future unlawful police conduct and thereby effectuate the guarantee of the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures .... Application of the rule is thus appropriate in circumstances in which this purpose is likely to be furthered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 570; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 347, 94 S. Ct. 613, 38 L. Ed. 2d 561 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Here, it was not a police officer, but, rather, the defendant\u2019s probation officer who required the defendant to submit a urine sample for drug testing. The fact that the probation officer obviously knew of the defendant\u2019s probationary status does not make this case analogous to that of a police officer who is aware that a person is on probation. There was no police participation in requiring the defendant to submit to urinalysis, and the probation officer was acting in accordance with conditions to which the defendant had agreed at the initial meeting of the defendant and the probation officer. Probation officers act under the auspices of the judicial branch in requiring the defendant to submit to conditions of probation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 393. \u201cIndeed, as <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith </em>. . . makes clear, the probation process operates as an arm of the judiciary, not of the police or prosecution.\u201d (Citation omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ted.) <em>States. Jacobs, </em>supra, 393. Thus, when a probation officer demands a probationer\u2019s compliance with a condition of probation, he or she is acting as a representative of the judicial branch and not as a police officer. Applying the exclusionary rule to probation revocation hearings would make it more difficult for probation officers to perform properly their job of helping to ensure the rehabilitation of offenders. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The purpose of the exclusionary rule, to discourage improper police procedure, would not be furthered by applying the exclusionary rule to probation revocation hearings and is inapplicable to the present case. Because <em>Payne </em>instructs that the exclusionary rule does not apply to probation revocation hearings, the trial court\u2019s suppression of the urinalysis results was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new probation revocation hearing at which the urinalysis results will be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-15\"> This appeal has been consolidated with both the state\u2019s civil appeal from the same judgment (AC 16487) and the defendant\u2019s appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment modifying and enlarging the conditions of his probation to include a drug testing provision (AC 16486). Decisions on those appeals have been published separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 <em>54-96 </em>provides: \u201cAppeals from the rulings and decisions of the Superior Court, upon all questions of law arising on the trial of criminal cases, may be taken by the state, with the permission of the presiding judge, to the Supreme Court or to the Appellate Court, in the same manner and to the same effect as if made by the accused.\u201d This court, in response to the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss both of the state\u2019s appeals, ordered the parties to brief the issue of whether this is a criminal or civil case for appeal purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b209-14\"> The defendant originally was charged with murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a.

The defendant claimed that the appeal was moot because his probationary term expired and he was released from probation on July 11, 1998. We denied the motions because, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-31 (b), the period of the sentence had been stayed. Section 53a-31 (b) provides in relevant part that the \u201c[issuance of a warrant or notice to appear for violation pursuant to section 53a-32, shall interrupt the period of the sentence as of the date of such issuance until a final determination as to the violation has been made by the court. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b213-10\"> At trial, the defendant argued that the probation officer exceeded his statutory authority by imposing a condition of urinalysis that the trial court could not have imposed. This contention is without merit because drug testing could have been originally imposed by the trial court. Our Supreme Court, has stated that \u201crestrictions [on a probationer] are meant to assure that, the probation serves as a period of genuine rehabilitation and that, the community [not be harmed] by the probationer's being at large. . . . Moreover, had the trial court [imposed a condition of drug testing], it would not have unduly intruded on any constitutionally protected right to which the defendant would have been entitled.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Smith, supra, 207 Conn. 170. The defendant also maintains that he was coerced into signing the probation form and accepting all the conditions of probation. This contention also fails, however, because our Supreme Court has stated that \u201cwhile a potential probationer may reject the offer of probation, if he accepts it, he must accept all the conditions sought and cannot accept some and reject others.\u201d Id., 169, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Oppenheimer, </em>236 Cal.

If illegally obtained evidence was admissible in such circumstances, the police officer might very well discount the fact that such evidence was inadmissible at a criminal trial, believing that incarceration of the probationer would instead be achieved through the revocation of his probation.
