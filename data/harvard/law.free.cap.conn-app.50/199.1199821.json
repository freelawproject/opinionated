The state filed this civil appeal in the event that the trial court failed to grant the state\u2019s request for permission to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuessenich, </em>50 Conn. App. 187, 717 A.2d 801 (1998), we addressed the question of whether a violation of probation proceeding was a criminal or civil case. We concluded that a violation of probation proceeding is a criminal case and an appeal could be taken pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-96.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-96 provides: \u201cAppeals from the rulings and decisions of the Superior Court, upon all questions of law arising on the trial of criminal cases, may be taken by the state, with the permission of the presiding judge, to the Supreme Court or to the Appellate Court, in the same manner and to the same effect as if made by the accused.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
