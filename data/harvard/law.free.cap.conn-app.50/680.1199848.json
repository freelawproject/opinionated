On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly determined that res judicata bars this second action when both the Connecticut legislature and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>the Supreme Court have changed and clarified the law that denied him recovery in the first action to enable him now to recover against his employer\u2019s motor vehicle insurer. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On September 21,1991, the plaintiff, while in the course of his employment for Brewmaster Services, Inc., (Brewmaster) was injured in an automobile accident. Brewmaster maintained uninsured-under-insured motorist coverage with the defendant. The plaintiff settled his claim against the driver of the other automobile involved in the accident for $50,000, the policy limit of the other driver\u2019s coverage. Having exhausted the limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s policy, the plaintiff claimed additional underinsured motorist coverage from the defendant. The claim was denied, and in 1993 the plaintiff brought an action (first action) against the defendant seeking his employer\u2019s underinsured motorist benefits. In that proceeding, the trial court struck the plaintiff\u2019s complaint on the basis of <em>CNA Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Colman, </em>222 Conn. 769, 774, 610 A.2d 1257 (1992), which held that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act prohibits an injured employee from collecting uninsured motorist benefits from his employer\u2019s insurer. The plaintiff failed to replead pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 157, now \u00a7 10-44, and, as a result, judgment entered in the defendant\u2019s favor on April 11, 1994. The plaintiff took no appeal from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">On January 1, 1994, No. 93-297 of the 1993 Public Acts (P.A. 93-297)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> became effective. That act, which amended General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336, allows an injured employee to collect uninsured motorist benefits despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>having received workers\u2019 compensation benefits. In <em>Reliance Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American Casualty Co. of Reading, Pennsylvania, </em>238 Conn. 285, 291, 679 A.2d 925 (1996), our Supreme Court held that P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 1 (f), was to be given retroactive effect. The <em>Reliance Ins. Co. </em>court based its decision on the theory that that statute clarified existing law and was a \u201cdeclaration of the legislature\u2019s original intent regarding the interplay of the exclusivity provision of the workers\u2019 compensation laws and the uninsured motorist laws.\u201d Id., 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">On the basis of <em>Reliance Ins. Co., </em>the plaintiff brought the present action (second action) in December, 1996. The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiffs second action was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint alleging, in the first count, the claim for underinsured motorist benefits and, in the second count, a claim under the accidental failure of suit statute, General Statutes \u00a7 52-592.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff filed an opposition to the summary judgment motion. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that the second action was barred by res judicata and that the accidental failure of suit statute is inapplicable because the first action was not terminated for any of the reasons designated in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Before turning to the merits of this appeal, we note that our standard of review of a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is well established and is set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 17-49.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bruttomesso </em>v. <em>Northeastern Connecticut Sexual Assault Crisis Services, Inc., </em>242 Conn. 1, 5, 698 A.2d 795 (1997); <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>235 Conn. 185, 202, 663 A.2d 1001 (1995). \u201cThe test is whether a party would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts. <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Colwell, </em>214 Conn. 242, [247], 571 A.2d 116 (1990).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Beebe </em>v. <em>East Haddam, </em>48 Conn. App. 60, 64, 708 A.2d 231 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">\u201cA motion <em>for </em>summary judgment \u2018is properly granted if it raises at least one legally sufficient defense that would bar the plaintiffs claim and involves no triable issue of fact.\u2019 <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 543, 494 A.2d 555 (1985).\u201d <em>Beebe </em>v. <em>East Haddam, </em>supra, 48 Conn. App. 64. As this appeal involves questions regarding the applicability of res judicata, it presents a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Bulaong, </em>218 Conn. 51, 58, 588 A.2d 138 (1991); <em>Schratwieser v. Hartford Casualty Ins. Co., </em>44 Conn. App. 754, 757, 692 A.2d 1283, cert. denied, 241 Conn. 915, 696 A.2d 340 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The plaintiff concedes that the trial court in the first action correctly decided the motion to strike against the plaintiff based on <em>CNA Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Colman, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 769, which was the existing authority at that time. The plaintiff acknowledges, however, that had he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>waited until after the <em>Reliance Ins. Co. </em>decision, he might have prevailed on his claim. The plaintiff argues that because <em>Reliance Ins. Co. </em>declared that P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 1 (f), clarified existing law, he should have the benefit of what was deemed to be existing law, despite the adverse decision in the first action. The plaintiff argues in essence for an exception to the doctrine of res judicata for a situation where a change in the law occurs by virtue of a clarifying act of the legislature. In support of his position, the plaintiff cites primarily federal and sibling state case law and <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>68 Conn. 273, 36 A. 55 (1896). The defendant argues that no such exception to the doctrine of res judicata exists under our law and that the accidental failure of suit statute is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">\u201c \u2018[T]he doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, [provides that] a former judgment on a claim, if rendered on the merits, is an absolute bar to a subsequent action on the same claim. A judgment is final not only as to every matter which was offered to sustain the claim, but also as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose. <em>Cromwell </em>v. <em>County of Sac, </em>94 U.S. 351, 352-53, 24 L. Ed. 195 (1876); 1 Restatement (Second), [Judgments] \u00a7\u00a7 19, 25 [1982]; James &amp; Hazard, Civil Procedure (2d Ed.) \u00a7 11.3.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>189 Conn. 416, 423-24, 456 A.2d 279, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 124, 78 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1983). The rule of claim preclusion prevents reassertion of the same claim regardless of what additional or different evidence or legal theories might be advanced in support of it.\u201d <em>Delahunty </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>236 Conn. 582, 589, 674 A.2d 1290 (1996). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he judicial doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel are based on the public policy that a party should not be able to relitigate a matter which it already has had an opportunity to litigate. . . . Stability in judgments grants to parties and others the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>certainty in the management of their affairs which results when a controversy is finally laid to rest. . . . The conservation of judicial resources is of paramount importance as our trial dockets are deluged with new cases daily. We further emphasize that where a party has fully and fairly litigated his claims, he may be barred from future actions on matters not raised in the prior proceeding. But the scope of matters precluded necessarily depends on what has occurred in the former adjudication.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>197 Conn. 436, 466-67, 497 A.2d 974 (1985), on appeal after remand sub nom. <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>213 Conn. 388, 567 A.2d 1221 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">\u201cThe fact that a prior judicial determination may be flawed ... is ordinarily insufficient, in and of itself, to overcome a claim that otherwise applicable principles of res judicata preclude it from being collaterally attacked. ... If the judgment [in the prior action] is erroneous, the unsuccessful party\u2019s remedy is to have it set aside or reversed in the original proceedings.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>CFM of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chowdhury, </em>239 Conn. 375, 395, 685 A.2d 1108 (1996); see also <em>Deposit Bank </em>v. <em>Frankfort, </em>191 U.S. 499, 24 S. Ct. 154, 48 L. Ed. 276 (1903); <em>Ellentuck </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>570 F.2d 414 (2d Cir. 1978); 1 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 17, comment (d), p. 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Each of the elements of res judicata is satisfied in this case. The identity of the parties to the actions are the same: Tirozzi was the sole plaintiff, and Shelby Insurance Company was the sole defendant in both actions. The same claim, demand or cause of action is at issue: In both actions the plaintiff sought damages under his employer\u2019s underinsured motorist coverage. The judgment in the first action was rendered \u201con the merits\u201d by a court of competent jurisdiction. The motion to strike required the trial court to decide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>merits of the plaintiffs claim. The parties had the opportunity to fully litigate the matter. The motion to strike was contested, and both parties participated in oral argument. The plaintiff argued to the trial court that P.A. 93-297, which had been adopted at the time of argument, overruled the decision in <em>Colman </em>and, therefore, he should be allowed to recover underinsured motorist benefits from his employer\u2019s insurer for his accident, which occurred prior to the effective date of the public act. After the trial court granted the motion to strike, the plaintiff neither repleaded pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 10-44 nor took an appeal. The plaintiff, therefore, had an adequate opportunity to litigate the matter in the first action and to seek appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Connecticut law provides no exception to res judicata for erroneous decisions. <em>CFM of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chowdhury, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 395. We recognize, further, that in this case the trial court\u2019s decision complied with the then existing law and that any error in its application of <em>Colman </em>to this situation resulted solely from a recognition by our Supreme Court that the law had been changed by virtue of legislative clarification in P.A. 93-297. Nonetheless, neither this court nor our Supreme Court has recognized an exception to res judi-cata for situations where there is a change in the law by clarification. To the contrary, although not binding on this court, the United States Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe res judicata consequences of a final, unap-pealed judgment on the merits [are not] altered by the fact that the judgment may have been wrong or rested on a legal principle subsequently overruled in another case.\u201d <em>Federated Dept. Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Moitie, </em>452 U.S. 394, 398, 101 S. Ct. 2424, 69 L. Ed. 2d 103 (1981). We conclude that the plaintiff is barred from relitigating the claims in this second action.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">\u201cOur rules of res judicata are based on the public policy that a party should not be allowed to relitigate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>a matter which it already has had an opportunity to litigate.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Duhaime </em>v. <em>American Reserve Life Ins. Co., </em>200 Conn. 360, 363-64, 511 A.2d 333 (1986). The trial court correctly determined that the judgment in the first action was preclusive and, by failing to replead or take an appeal, the plaintiff abandoned his opportunities to avoid res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The plaintiff also argues that the accidental failure of suit statute, \u00a7 52-592, saves his cause of action. That statute \u201cis designed to prevent a miscarriage of justice if the plaintiffs fail to get a proper day in court due to the various enumerated procedural problems. It is not a device for avoiding our well-settled rules of res judi-cata.\u201d <em>Legassey </em>v. <em>Shulansky, </em>28 Conn. App. 653, 659, 611 A.2d 930 (1992). The first action was decided on the merits, not on any of the categories enumerated in \u00a7 52-592, and therefore that statute is not applicable here. In addition, we note that the second action was not brought within the one year time period prescribed by the accidental failure of suit statute. For those reasons, the plaintiff cannot prevail on this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-7\"> Public <em>Act </em>93-297, \u00a7 1 (f), which is currently codified at General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (f), provides: \u201cNotwithstanding subsection (a) of section 31-284, an employee of a named insured injured while occupying a covered motor vehicle in the course of employment shall be covered by such insured\u2019s otherwise applicable uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b703-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-592 (a) provides: \u201cIf any action, commenced within the time limited by law, has failed one or more times to be tried on its merits because of insufficient service or return of the writ due to unavoidable accident or the default or neglect of the officer to whom it was committed, or because the action has been dismissed for want of jurisdiction, or the action has been otherwise avoided or defeated by the death of a party or for any matter of form; or if, in any such action after a verdict for the plaintiff, the judgment has been set aside, or if a judgment of nonsuit has been rendered or a judgment for the plaintiff reversed, the plaintiff, or, if the plaintiff is dead and the action by law survives, his executor or administrator, may commence a new action, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, for the same cause at any time within one year after the determination of the original action or after the reversal of the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b704-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides: \u201cThe judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
