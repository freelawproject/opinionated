The central issue in this appeal is the extent to which that liability shield protects the interest of a member of a limited liability company against a judgment creditor when the basis for the judgment is an obligation unrelated to the activities of the company. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that it raises no barrier to the satisfaction of such a judgment from the member\u2019s interest in the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>After obtaining a deficiency judgment resulting from a mortgage foreclosure against the defendants, Edward J. Botwick, David J. Kurzawa and DEM II Properties,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the plaintiff, PB Real Estate, Inc., applied, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 34-66 (l),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for a charging order directed to Botwick &amp; Kurzawa, LLC, a limited liability company (LLC) engaged in the practice of law. The plaintiff was attempting to satisfy the judgment from any payments becoming due to the individual defendants, each of whom owns one half of the LLC. The trial court granted the application and directed the LLC to pay to the plaintiff \u201cpresent and future shares of any and all distributions, credits, drawings or payments due<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to the defendant [s] . . . until the judgment is satisfied in full . . . .\u201d The order also directed the LLC to furnish to the plaintiff for examination a copy of the LLC agreement and various financial information.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-356b (b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiff applied for a turnover order, claiming that the LLC had not fully complied with the charging order because the 1996 profit and loss statement indicated that a portion of the item designated on the statement as \u201clegal staff\u2019 expense appeared to have been paid to the defendants, contrary to the directive in the charging order that all distributions should be paid to the plaintiff. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court granted the application for a turnover order. The LLC appeals from that order and raises two issues: (1) whether certain payments it made to the defendants, the sole owners, managers and members of the LLC, were properly the subject of a turnover order; and (2) whether the turnover order exceeds the scope of the statute authorizing such orders with respect to an LLC. We resolve both issues against the LLC and affirm the order of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The trial court found that since the date of the charging order, the LLC had paid approximately $28,000 to each of two defendants. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 claim that those payments were merely compensation for their services to the LLC as lawyers and were similar to the wages paid to other employees of the firm. The payments to the defendants were not shown in the \u201csalary\u201d column of the business record where payments to employees of the law firm are recorded, but were listed separately under their initials. The 1996 tax returns of the individual defendants indicated that they received little or no wages, but they reported significant earnings from self-employment. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>concluded that the payments made by the law firm to the defendants were \u201cdistributions\u201d that were subject to the charging order.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The LLC does not dispute the underlying facts on which the trial court relied in reaching that conclusion. Even without such a concession, we conclude that the court\u2019s evidence adequately supports the facts set forth in the court\u2019s memorandum of decision. The LLC contends, nevertheless, that several provisions of the Connecticut Limited Liability Company Act preclude the conclusion that the challenged payments were distributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">The LLC claims that the trial court incorrectly failed to limit the turnover order to the \u201crights of an assignee of the member\u2019s limited liability company interest,\u201d as provided by General Statutes \u00a7 34-171<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in defining the rights of a judgment creditor. That statute provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]o the extent so charged, the judgment creditor has only the rights of an assignee of the member\u2019s limited liability company interest . . . .\u201d The phrase, \u201climited liability company membership interest,\u201d is defined by General Statutes \u00a7 34-101 (10)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to mean \u201ca member\u2019s share of the profits and losses of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>the limited liability company and a member\u2019s right to receive distributions of the limited liability company\u2019s assets, unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement.\u201d The operating agreement for the LLC provides that \u201call distributions . . . shall be made at such time as determined by the Manager,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> who consists solely of the two owners. They maintain that they have authorized no distributions and, therefore, the court\u2019s finding that the $28,000 each of them has received was a distribution is contrary to General Statutes \u00a7 34-158, which provides in part that \u201c[a] member is entitled to receive distributions . . . from a limited liability company to the extent and at the times or upon the happening of the events specified in the operating agreement or at the times determined by the members or managers pursuant to section 34-142. \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">It defies common sense for the defendants, who jointly comprise the \u201cManager,\u201d to contend that the payments they made to themselves from the assets of their LLC do not constitute distributions simply because they never voted to order such distributions. The operating agreement requires that distributions \u201cshall be made at such time as determined by the Manager,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>but does not specify any formal procedure for authorizing distributions. General Statutes \u00a7 34-142 (a) requires \u201cthe affirmative vote, approval or consent of . . . more than one-half by number of the managers\u201d to decide matters connected with the LLC, but these are alternatives. The defendants can hardly deny that they approved or consented to the payments they received from the LLC, which they own and control. Neither \u00a7 34-142 (a) nor \u00a7 34-158,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which authorizes distributions \u201cat the times determined by the members or managers pursuant to section 34-142,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> raises any barrier to the finding of the court that the payments to the defendants constituted distributions subject to the charging order they have disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Furthermore, the definition in \u00a7 34-101 (10) of a member\u2019s limited liability company interest, which \u00a7 34-171 makes available for satisfaction of a judgment, includes \u201ca member\u2019s share of the profits and losses\u201d of the company as well as \u201cdistributions of the . . . company\u2019s assets . . . .\u201d Although the defendants at trial presented a profit and loss statement for 1996 showing a net profit of only $23.44, that result was achieved only by treating the payments of $28,000 to each of them as expenses for wages. If those payments were neither distributions, as the defendants contend, nor wages, as the trial court found, they would have to be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>profits. The plaintiff claims that as an assignee of the defendants\u2019 shares thereof, it would be entitled to satisfy its deficiency judgment from those profits even if the payments made to the defendants had not been approved in accordance with the operating agreement. The defendants contend, however, that General Statutes \u00a7 34-170 (a) (2), providing that \u201can assignment entitles the assignee to receive, to the extent assigned, only the distributions to which the assignor would be entitled\u201d indicates otherwise. The trial court did not consider the issue of a possible inconsistency between that provision and the definition of a member\u2019s interest in \u00a7 34-101 (10), nor shall we do so in view of our agreement with the court\u2019s conclusion that the payments received by the defendants were distributions subject to the charging order.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The judgment issuing the turnover order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-5\"> The named defendant, DEM II Properties, is named as an appellant, in the docketing statement filed with this appeal. See Practice Book \u00a7 63-4 (a) (4). There is no indication, however, that it is aggrieved by the issuance of the turnover order, which is the subject of this appeal. No brief has been filed on behalf of this defendant. We refer in this opinion to Edward J. Botwick and David J. Kurzawa as the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b763-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 34-66 (1) provides: \u201cOn due application to a competent court by any judgment creditor of apartner, the court which entered the judgment, order, or decree, or any other court, may charge the interest of the debtor partner with payment of the unsatisfied amount of such judgment debt with interest thereon; and may then or later appoint a receiver of his share of the profits, and of any other money due or to fall due to him in respect of the partnership, and make all other orders, directions, accounts and inquiries which the debtor partner might have made, or which the circumstances of the case may require.\" This provision was repealed by No. 95-341 of the 1995 Public Acts, which became effective on July 1, 1997.
