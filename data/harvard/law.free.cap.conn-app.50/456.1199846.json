On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly dismissed the appeal on the grounds of (1) insufficient process because the appeal from probate was made returnable to the Superior Court on Monday, July 1, 1996, instead of on a Tuesday in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-48, and (2) improper venue because although the appeal was actually returned to the Superior Court in the judicial district of New London, certain appeal documents with which the defendant, Victoria Haigh, was \u201cserved\u201d directed her to appear at the Superior Court, Juvenile Matters at Montville.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">On April 30,1996, the Probate Court for the district of New London issued a decree terminating the plaintiffs parental rights in his son. On May 29, 1996, the plaintiff moved the Probate Court for permission to appeal that decree, and that court granted its approval to do so. Thereafter, the plaintiffs appeal, which bore the return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>date of July 1, 1996, was served on the defendant, the plaintiffs former wife and mother of the child, and returned to the Superior Court in the judicial district of New London at New London.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On July 1,1996, which was a Monday, the defendant appeared in person in the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters at Montville because the plaintiffs appeal indicated that it was to be heard in Montville.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court at Montville, <em>Driscoll, J., </em>dismissed the plaintiffs appeal on that day for the plaintiffs failure to appear. Upon learning of the dismissal, the plaintiff filed a motion on July 12, 1996, to vacate the dismissal of July 1, 1996. In October, 1996, after a hearing, the Juvenile Court vacated the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>On November 4,1996, the defendant filed her appearance in the Superior Court in the judicial district of New London. On January 21,1997, the defendant moved that court to dismiss the plaintiffs appeal \u201con the grounds that defective process renders this court without jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On February 10,1997, the court, <em>Hurley, J., </em>granted the motion to dismiss. During the hearing on that motion, the plaintiff requested that the court consider his motion to amend the return date, and the court declined to decide that motion and recommended it be claimed for a hearing at a later date. On February 14, 1997, the plaintiff filed his \u201cMotion to Open Dismissal [and] Motion to Waive Fees.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On May 5, 1997, the court denied that motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Before we address the issues articulated by the plaintiff, we must confront the issue of subject matter jurisdiction raised by the defendant in her brief. She claims that the issue on appeal is \u201cwhether subject matter jurisdiction is a waivable defect\u201d pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 142 through 144, now \u00a7\u00a7 10-30 through 10-32.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>\u201c[0]nce the question of lack of jurisdiction of a court is raised, [it] must be disposed of no matter in what form it is presented . . . and the court must fully resolve it before proceeding further with the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Community Collaborative of Bridgeport, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ganim, </em>241 Conn. 546, 552, 698 A.2d 245 (1997), quoting <em>Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe of Indians </em>v. <em>Southbury, </em>231 Conn. 563, 570, 651 A.2d 1246 (1995); accord <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>State, </em>213 Conn. 54, 58, 566 A.2d 670 (1989); <em>Pantlin &amp; Chananie Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Hartford Cement &amp; Building Supply Co., </em>188 Conn. 253, 258, 449 A.2d 162 (1982); <em>Savoy Laundry, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>32 Conn. App. 636, 639, 630 A.2d 159, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 931, 632 A.2d 704 (1993); <em>Vincenzo </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>26 Conn. App. 132, 135, 599 A.2d 31 (1991). \u201cSubject matter jurisdiction, unlike jurisdiction of the person, cannot be created through consent or waiver.\u201d <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 429-30, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988), and cases cited therein. Jurisdiction over the subject matter is the court\u2019s power to hear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>and decide cases of the general class to which the proceedings at issue belong. See <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 455, 460, 600 A.2d 310 (1991); <em>Shea </em>v. <em>First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of New Haven, </em>184 Conn. 285, 288, 439 A.2d 997 (1981). \u201cWhere a decision as to whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction is required, every presumption favoring jurisdiction should be indulged.\u201d <em>Demar v. Open Space &amp; Conservation Commission, </em>211 Conn. 416, 425, 559 A.2d 1103 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In making her claim that the trial court properly granted her motion to dismiss, the defendant argues that the \u201ccombination of [the] two defects,\u201d the improper return date and improper venue, \u201care fatal to the plaintiff in sustaining his appeal\u201d and deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction. In that regard, she refers to the provision in \u00a7 52-48 that \u201c[p]rocess in civil actions . . . brought to the Superior Court may be made returnable on any Tuesday in any month\u201d and \u201cshall designate the place where court is to be held.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the return day of July 1,1996, which was a Monday, was a fatal defect.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She claims that it is well settled that an improper return date \u201caffects\u201d the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the subject matter. The defendant maintains that until a proper return is made to the court, the court is unable to consider the matter since there is nothing before the court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>consider. For this proposition she cites <em>Danziger </em>v. <em>Shaknaitis, </em>33 Conn. App. 6,11-12,632 A.2d 1130, rev\u2019d, 228 Conn. 914, 636 A.2d 846 (1994). The defendant contends that the plaintiff should not prevail on his argument that her motion to dismiss was untimely because subject matter jurisdiction is not waivable and can be raised at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The defendant also claims that the court \u201csimilarly lacked jurisdiction\u201d because the process directed her to Montville. She maintains that the incorrect Montville reference violates \u201cfundamental notions of fairness and due process,\u201d which demand at least that she be informed of the geographical location of the court to which the papers have been returned. She claims that this is also a fatal defect implicating the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction and, therefore, the case was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">In response, the plaintiff claims that the defendant improperly relies on <em>Danziger </em>v. <em>Shaknaitis, </em>supra, 33 Conn. App. 12,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to change the issue on appeal to a question of subject matter jurisdiction. The plaintiff stresses that he is not making any argument that the defendant ever waived subj ect matter jurisdiction, as he recognizes that it cannot be waived. Rather, what he does claim is that an improper return date is not a subj ect matter jurisdiction defect. The plaintiff in effect maintains that the incorrect Monday return date is an \u201cinsufficiency of process\u201d defect that is curable and that the procedure provided by General Statutes \u00a7 52-72<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> supports his position. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>In explicating his claim, the plaintiff relies heavily on <em>Concept Associates, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>229 Conn. 618, 621-22, 642 A.2d 1186 (1994). The plaintiff contends that the trial court should have granted his motion to amend the return date and that doing so would not have prejudiced the defendant. With regard to the Montville reference, the plaintiff claims that the defendant, by untimely filing her motion to dismiss, waived her claims of defects of insufficiency of process, including venue pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 10-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">We first take up the claimed lack of subject matter jurisdiction because of the incorrect return date. \u201cOur practice does not favor the termination of proceedings without a determination of the merits of the controversy where that can be brought about with due regard to necessaiy rules of procedure. <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Keenan, </em>115 Conn. 704, 705, 161 A. 100 [1932].\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>166 Conn. 102, 111, 347 A.2d 53 (1974); see <em>Andover Ltd. Partnership I </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>232 Conn. 392, 400, 655 A.2d 759 (1995) (claim of lack of subject matter jurisdiction). \u201cA trial court should make every effort to adjudicate the substantive controversy before it, and, where practicable, should decide a procedural issue so as not to preclude hearing the merits of an appeal. \u201d <em>Killingly </em>v. <em>Connecticut Siting Council, </em>220 Conn. 516, 522, 600 A.2d 752 (1991) (claim of lack of subject matter jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Section 52-72, as construed by our Supreme Court in <em>Concept Associates, Ltd., </em>not only furthers this policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>but illuminates our analysis in the present case. In <em>Concept Associates, Ltd., </em>the Supreme Court not only stated that \u201cit appears that [\u00a7 52-72] was enacted in response to decisions of this court holding that an improper return date was a jurisdictional defect that could not be corrected,\u201d but also pointed out that \u201c[i]ndeed, this court has stated that the purpose of \u00a7 52-72 \u2018is to provide for amendment of otherwise incurable defects that go to the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u2019 <em>Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>178 Conn. 472, 478-79, 423 A.2d 141 (1979), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 904, 100 S. Ct. 1079, 63 L. Ed. 2d 319 (1980).\u201d <em>Concept Associates, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 623; see <em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Coppola, </em>243 Conn. 657, 663, 707 A.2d 281 (1998). It determined that \u201c[t]he apparent intent of the legislature in enacting \u00a7 52-72 was to prevent the loss of jurisdiction merely because of a defective return date.\u201d <em>Concept Associates, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 623. That court also rejected the claim that \u00a7 52-72 applied only to amendments to correct a defective return date sought before the correct return date has passed. The court disagreed with the defendant\u2019s claim \u201cthat such a limitation is implicit in the words \u2018a proper amendment\u2019 [in \u00a7 52-72] because there is no longer a case before the court once the return date has passed.\u201d Id. In eschewing such a strict construction, the <em>Concept Associates, Ltd., </em>court stated that \u201c[a]s a remedial statute, \u00a7 52-72 must be liberally construed in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Recently, our Supreme Court pointedly stated: \u201cThe legislature, in enacting \u00a7 52-72, expressed an intent to reject the draconian result of dismissal of the plaintiffs cause of action because of a defect involving the return date.\u201d <em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Coppola, </em>supra, 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">We agree with the plaintiff that the defendant on appeal is attempting to frame the issue strictly in terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>of subject matter jurisdiction and her alleged \u201cwaiver\u201d of that, when the issue to be resolved is whether an incorrect return date is a fatal subject matter jurisdictional defect. The plaintiffs analysis invoking \u00a7 52-72 and the interpretation of that statute by <em>Concept Associates, Ltd., </em>controls the resolution of the issue. <em>Concept Associates, Ltd., </em>is directly applicable and presents a scenario similar to what exists in this case, in which the plaintiff attempted to cure the incorrect return date. We note that the defendant does not even mention \u00a7 52-72, but rather elects to rest on \u00a7 52-48 for her argument that the trial court was left with nothing before it. This is a case where the remedial statute, \u00a7 52-72, \u201cmust be liberally construed in favor of [one] whom the legislature intended to benefit.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Concept Associates, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Next, we address the improper Montville reference, which is basically a claim of improper venue. The terms \u201cjurisdiction\u201d and \u201cvenue\u201d are not synonymous. Jurisdiction has to do with the authority or power of a court to hear and decide \u201cthe cause of action presented to it and its source is the constitutional and statutory provisions by which it is created.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Second Injury Fund </em>v. <em>Lupachino, </em>45 Conn. App. 324, 343, 695 A.2d 1072 (1997). Venue, on the other hand, concerns only the place where the case may be tried, and venue requirements are created for the convenience of the parties. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>9 Conn. App. 349, 354-55, 519 A.2d 73 (1986); 77 Am. Jur. 2d 608, Venue \u00a7 1 (1997). Our Supreme Court has said that \u201c[i]t is a well established rule that, outside the area of administrative appeals, venue is not a jurisdictional but a procedural question; consequently, venue, unlike subject matter jurisdiction, can be waived by the parties.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>206 Conn. 323, 332, 537 A.2d 483 (1988); see generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 354-55; 77 Am. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Jur. 2d 654-55, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 47; 92 C.J.S. 773-75, Venue \u00a7\u00a7 75-78 (1955). \u201c[V]enue is a matter that goes to process rather than substantive rights . . . .\u201d <em>American Dredging Co. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>510 U.S. 443, 453, 114 S. Ct. 981, 127 L. Ed. 2d 285 (1994). By filing her motion to dismiss seventy-eight days after filing her appearance, the defendant waived any claim of improper venue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The question remains as to the nature of our remand. When the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on February 10, 1997, it remarked: \u201cI think the motion to amend the return date may be filed, but it should not be decided at this time. I think that should be claimed for a hearing at a later date.\u201d On February 14,1997, the plaintiff filed a \u201cMotion to Open Dismissal [and] Motion to Waive Fees.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plaintiffs purpose in filing that motion was to seek an opening of the trial court\u2019s February 10, 1997 decision granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss so that the plaintiff could argue his motion to amend the incorrect return date. On May 5, 1997, the trial court heard and denied the plaintiffs \u201cMotion to Open Dismissal [and] Motion to Waive Fees.\u201d In doing so, the trial court stated: \u201cWell, I think the law seems clear that you can\u2019t correct the jurisdiction, that is, the Montville versus New London. I think I have to follow that law. So I\u2019ll have to deny [the plaintiffs] motion to open the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The analytical distillate of what we have concluded is that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on February 10, 1997, and that it should have reached and granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion to correct the incorrect return date.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to grant the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>motion to correct the return date and, thereafter, to proceed according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 45a-186 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny [appeal from an order of a court of probate] shall be filed in the superior court for the judicial district in which such court of probate is located except that ... (2) any appeal in a matter concerning . . . termination of parental rights . . . shall be filed in the superior court for juvenile matters having jurisdiction over matters arising in such probate district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The plaintiffs appeal to the Superior Court for the judicial district of New London at New London did not comply with the requirements of this statute. This failure to comply, however, does not render the Superior Court without subject matter jurisdiction. Our Supreme Court considered the issue of \u201cwhether provision for a separate juvenile docket reflects a legislative judgment that the juvenile docket is vested with subject matter jurisdiction over juvenile cases that is separate and distinct from the subject matter jurisdiction otherwise vested in the Superior Court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>206 Conn. 323, 331, 537 A.2d 483 (1988). The court in <em>Kelley </em>concluded that the juvenile court does not have subject matter jurisdiction separate and distinct from the Superior Court. Id. The court stated, \u201cThe only statutory pronouncement that directly addresses jurisdiction is [General Statutes] \u00a7 51-164s, and that section expressly confers the former jurisdiction of the juvenile court on \u2018the superior court.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>supra, 331-32. The Supreme Court indicated that statutes promulgating rules for a \u201cseparate system\u201d in the juvenile court; id., 329; such as \u00a7 45a-186 (b), involve considerations that are analogous to those of the law of venue and venue can be waived by the parties. See id., 332 and n.12. We find that the parties here waived venue and that the Superior Court in New London had subject matter jurisdiction to consider the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b478-8\"> It was not necessary for the defendant to appear in person on July 1, 1996, in the Superior Court in Montville.

The plaintiff in his brief argues that those are the three claims made in the trial court as to why the defendant claims that his appeal was \u201cdefective.\u201d In fact, the defendant made only two claims before the trial court. At a hearing on February 10, 1997, the defendant argued: \u201cI think the fatal defect, Your Honor, is the combined defect of the wrongful return date and also the defect directing my client to go to Montville when the papers are being returned to New London.\u201d \u201cWe review this case on the theory upon which it was decided below.\u201d <em>Blancato </em>v. <em>Feldspar Corp., </em>203 Conn. 34, 44, 522 A.2d 1235 (1987); <em>Fuessenich </em>v. <em>DiNardo, </em>195 Conn. 144, 151, 487 A.2d 514 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b479-8\"> The plaintiff argued in that motion that the procedural effect of granting the motion to dismiss was that there was no pending case.
