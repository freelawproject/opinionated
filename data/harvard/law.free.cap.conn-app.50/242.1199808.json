In addition, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly ruled that one of the defendant\u2019s witnesses failed to qualify as an expert, permitted the state\u2019s expert witness to vouch for the truthfulness of the victim, prevented the defendant from introducing extrinsic evidence regarding the victim\u2019s credibility and imposed sex offender treatment as a special condition of probation in this case. We agree with the defendant that the state\u2019s closing argument violated his constitutional right to be present during trial and to a fair trial, and we do not address the remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. At the time of trial, the victim, C, was twelve years old and in the seventh grade. The victim lived in Stamford with her mother, Kendra, a younger brother and twin sisters. The victim was in the second or third grade when she first met the defendant. The defendant was Kendra\u2019s boyfriend and the father of the victim\u2019s twin sisters. The defendant met Kendra in the fall of 1989. Kendra became pregnant by the defendant in the summer of 1990, and they agreed that the defendant would become involved as a father to their offspring. Because of his work schedule, the defendant main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>tained a residence in New York City. He resided with Kendra primarily on weekends after she became pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">At first, the victim liked the defendant. He was nice to her, took her to a park, gave her money for ice cream and never punished or hit her. About the time the victim was eight, the defendant began to abuse her sexually. He would enter her bedroom at night when the room was dark and, if she was asleep, would touch her to awaken her. The defendant would get into her bed, take off her panties and put his finger into her vagina, which hurt, and felt like a knife cutting into her. When C would tell the defendant to stop, he complied. He would also push up her nightshirt and touch her chest as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">In February, 1993, during school vacation when C was nine, she went to Massachusetts to visit her paternal grandmother. When her grandmother asked how the defendant was treating her, C said that the defendant did not treat her right and disclosed the abuse to her, saying that it had gone on since she was about eight. On her way back to Stamford, C told her father of the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">On March 2, 1993, C was interviewed by Patricia Nelson of the Stamford Child Guidance Center. An audiotape was made of the interview and played for the jury. In the interview, C stated that the abuse began when she was eight, toward the end of the year. She said that the defendant had rubbed her vaginal area, but she was afraid that the defendant would be angry if she provided more detail and she did not want to get him in trouble. At trial, C explained that her testimony was different from her audiotape interview because \u201cnow that you get a chance to think about what happened, it all comes back to you. Most of it does.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>victim also spoke about the abuse with Marie Williams, a social worker at the department of children and families (department).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">At trial, the state called the victim\u2019s father, Officer Martin Treadway of the Stamford police department, Nelson, Williams, and the victim\u2019s grandmother primarily as constancy of accusation witnesses. The state also called Nelson, Williams, and Stephen Spitz, a psychologist and consultant for the department, as expert witnesses. The defendant testified and denied ever abusing the victim. In addition, the defendant elicited character testimony from ten witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts. The trial court imposed a total effective sentence of five years, suspended after one year, with five years probation and special conditions. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to open the judgment and motion to correct sentence. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The defendant claims that during the state\u2019s closing argument the state\u2019s attorney impermissibly infringed on his constitutional right to be present during trial and that the closing argument amounted to prosecutorial misconduct depriving him of a fair trial. We will address each of these claims individually and, because we find them dispositive, we will not address the defendant\u2019s remaining four claims as it is not likely that they will arise during the new trial. The sentencing claim could arise only in the event of a conviction, and we do not know what the outcome of the new trial will be.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">\u201cIt is well recognized that the state\u2019s attorney \u2018is not only an officer of the court, like every attorney, but is also a high public officer, representing the people of the State, who seek impartial justice for the guilty as much as for the innocent. In discharging his most important duties, he deserves and receives in peculiar degree the support of the court and the respect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>citizens of the county. By reason of his office, he usually exercises great influence upon jurors. His conduct and language in the trial of cases in which human life or liberty are at stake should be forceful, but fair, because he represents the public interest, which demands no victim and asks no conviction through the aid of passion, prejudice, or resentment. If the accused be guilty, he should none the less be convicted only after a fair trial, conducted strictly according to the sound and well-established rules which the laws prescribe. While the privilege of counsel in addressing the jury should not be too closely narrowed or unduly hampered, <em>it must never be used as a license to state, or to comment upon, or to suggest an inference from, facts not in evidence, or to present matters which the jury have no right to consider.\u2019 State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>96 Conn. 160, 168-69, 113 A. 452 (1921).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Satchwell, </em>244 Conn. 547, 577, 710 A.2d 1348 (1998) <em>(Katz, J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim arising from the state\u2019s closing argument and rebuttal argument concerns comments made by the state\u2019s attorney about the defendant\u2019s presence in the courtroom throughout the trial. Specifically, the defendant claims that the comments made by the state\u2019s attorney impermissibly infringed on his constitutional right to be present at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">In the state\u2019s closing argument to the jury, the prosecutor stated: \u201cWho is best able to fabricate a complicated stoiy designed to sway a jury? Your final decision must ultimately be based on whom you believe, the victim ... or the defendant, Andrew Alexander. . . . Now, you may recall that all the witnesses were sequestered. And, that was so they couldn\u2019t hear what the other witnesses were saying <em>so they couldn\u2019t tailor their testimony to each other\u2019s testimony. </em>So that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>couldn\u2019t contradict each other. <em>But there was one witness who wasn\u2019t sequestered. There was one witness who heard everything. And, that was [the defendant], </em>who has a built-in bias in the outcome of this case by virtue of the fact that he\u2019s the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In the state\u2019s rebuttal argument to the defendant\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor stated: \u201cWhen you consider the credibility of the defendant\u2019s testimony, keep in mind that of all the witnesses here, he\u2019s the most obviously biased and interested one. He\u2019s the one who has the motive to distort the truth and <em>fabricate the story. </em>Think about it.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument or rebuttal argument, but did object to the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument after its conclusion and outside the presence of the jury. The defendant did not make the specific objection, however, that he raises on appeal. Thus, the defendant seeks review of this unpreserved claim under the doctrine articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Under <em>Golding, </em>a defendant can prevail on an unpreserved claim of constitutional error \u201conly if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. \u201cThe first two conditions are determinations of whether a defendant\u2019s claim will be reviewed, and the third condition involves a review of the claim itself.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>41 Conn. App. 361, 364, 675 A.2d 930, cert. denied, 237 Conn. 932, 677 A.2d 1374 (1996). The defendant\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>is reviewable because the record is adequate for review, and the claim implicates the defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional right to be present during his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u201cIt is well settled that a violation of constitutional magnitude may be established even though there has not been a complete abridgement or deprivation of the right. A constitutional violation may result, therefore, when a constitutional right has been impermissibly burdened or impaired by virtue of state action that unnecessarily chills or penalizes the free exercise of the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">. . . Thus, [w]hatever might be said of [the state\u2019s] objectives, they cannot be pursued by means that needlessly chill the exercise of basic constitutional rights. . . . The question is not whether the chilling effect is incidental rather than intentional; the question is whether that effect is unnecessary and therefore excessive. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>[390 U.S. 570, 582, 88 S. Ct. 1209, 20 L. Ed. 2d 138 (1968)].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>236 Conn. 112, 126-27, 672 A.2d 899, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 910, 117 S. Ct. 273, 136 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 112, our Supreme Court held that a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be present throughout his trial was violated by the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court stated that \u201c[i]nviting the fact finder to draw an inference adverse to a defendant solely on account of the defendant\u2019s assertion of a constitutional right impermissibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>burdens the free exercise of that right and, therefore, may not be tolerated. ... In arguing to the jury that the defendant had been able to \u2018doctor up\u2019 his testimony simply because, in contrast to the state\u2019s witnesses, the defendant had been present during the entire trial, the prosecutor invited the jury to draw an inference adverse to the defendant solely because of the defendant\u2019s exercise of his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 127-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u201cThe <em>Cassidy </em>court also acknowledged the fact that, in choosing to testify, the defendant put his credibility at issue, thereby subjecting himself to critical cross-examination. Accordingly, the court noted that the prosecutor would have been free to challenge the defendant\u2019s version of the facts and to argue that the defendant had tailored his testimony to fit the state\u2019s case, provided that such an argument was <em>\u2018linked solely to the evidence and not, either directly or indirectly, to the defendant\u2019s presence at trial </em>[i.e., his exercise of a constitutional right].\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 128 n.17.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Shinn, </em>47 Conn. App. 401, 413, 704 A.2d 816 (1997), cert. denied, 244 Conn. 913, 914, 713 A.2d 832, 833 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit also recently addressed this same issue in <em>Agard </em>v. <em>Portuondo, </em>117 F.3d 696 (2d Cir. 1997).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Agard, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the court held that \u201cit is constitutional error for a prosecutor to insinuate to the jury for the first time during summation that the defendant\u2019s presence in the courtroom at trial provided him with a unique opportunity to tailor his testimony to match the evidence. Such comments violate a criminal defendant\u2019s right to confrontation, his right to testify on his own behalf, and his right to receive due process and a fair trial.\u201d Id., 709. \u201cWe therefore hold that the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation prohibits a prosecutor from commenting in summation that a defendant\u2019s testimony may be viewed in light of his presence in the courtroom during trial, because such comments violate the defendant\u2019s right to be present at trial.\u201d Id., 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Shinn, </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 401, this court addressed a similar claim involving the state\u2019s closing argument.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim in <em>Shinn </em>was that \u201cthe state\u2019s closing argument to the jury imper-missibly burdened his constitutional right to testify in his own behalf.\u201d Id., 408. This court held that \u201c[t]he prosecutor in this case, as a consequence of his remarks, invited the jury to draw an adverse inference from the very fact of the defendant\u2019s decision to exercise his fundamental right to testify in his own behalf. The remarks were not objectionable because they addressed the content or credibility of the testimony, but because, as was true in <em>Cassidy, </em>the comments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>directly implicated an important constitutional right of the defendant.\u201d Id., 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">We conclude that the principles established in <em>Cas-sidy </em>and followed in <em>Shinn, </em>as well as those enunciated in <em>Agard, </em>apply to this case. In this case, the prosecutor argued to the jury that by exercising his constitutional right to be present during trial, the defendant tailored his testimony in response to the testimony that he heard. The prosecutor\u2019s statements invited the jury to draw an adverse inference on the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be present during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Although the prosecutor was free to challenge the defendant\u2019s version of the facts and even to argue that he had tailored his testimony to fit the state\u2019s case, the prosecutor was not permitted to link this argument, <em>either directly or indirectly, </em>to the defendant\u2019s presence at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 128 n.17; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shinn, </em>supra, 47 Conn App. 413. The prosecutor\u2019s statement made this impermissible link with the defendant\u2019s presence at trial. If the prosecutor had linked this argument solely to the evidence, her argument would not have been objectionable. \u201cSuch argument exceeded the bounds of fair comment because it unfairly penalized the defendant for asserting his constitutionally protected right to confront his accusers at trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>supra, 128-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Because the prosecutor\u2019s statements in this case linked the defendant\u2019s presence at trial with his guilt, the constitutional violation in this case is of the same magnitude as that in <em>Cassidy, Shinn </em>and <em>Agard. </em>We agree with the Second Circuit decision in <em>Agard, </em>in which that court concluded that \u201ca prosecutor\u2019s summation remarks noting the defendant\u2019s unique opportunity to be present at trial infringe upon that constitutionally guaranteed right. The remarks invite the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to confrontation as evidence of guilt, and therefore penalize him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>for exercising that right. The comments, which imply that a truthful defendant would have stayed out of the courtroom before testifying or would have testified before other evidence was presented, force defendants either to forgo the right to be present at trial, forgo their Fifth Amendment right to testify on their own behalf, or risk the jury\u2019s suspicion. The Sixth Amendment does not permit those comments.\u201d <em>Agard </em>v. <em>Por-tuondo, </em>supra, 117 F.3d 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Having determined that the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks were improper, the fourth prong of <em>Golding </em>requires us to consider whether the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the violation was harmless. \u201cBecause the prosecutor\u2019s argument impermissi-bly infringed upon [the defendant\u2019s] rights guaranteed under the confrontation clauses of the federal and state constitutions, he is entitled to a new trial on those counts unless the state can establish that the objectionable comments were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 129. We conclude that the state has failed to meet its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">In <em>Cassidy, </em>our Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[b jecause the defendant and the victim were the only witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the pertinent events, the state\u2019s case against the defendant rested solely upon the testimony of the victim, which was, in all material respects, uncorroborated. Similarly, the defendant\u2019s affirmative contention that he had not engaged in any of the criminal misconduct alleged by the state was based entirely upon his own testimony. The jury\u2019s principal task, therefore, was to determine which of these two witnesses to believe, making their credibility decisive to the outcome of the case.\u201d Id., 129-30. In <em>Shinn, </em>\u201cthe defendant and the victim . . . were the only witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the events pertinent to the attempted murder charge. The critical question to be resolved by the jury, therefore, was which of the two eyewitnesses was telling the truth.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Shinn, </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>The situation in this case is almost identical to the situations described in <em>Cassidy </em>and <em>Shinn. </em>The state\u2019s case rested entirely on the testimony of the victim and the testimony of constancy of accusation witnesses. There was no physical evidence linking the defendant to the alleged abuse. In addition, the jury\u2019s principal task was to determine whether to believe the victim or the defendant. Thus, their credibility was crucial to the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">We conclude that because (1) the state\u2019s case rested on the uncorroborated testimony of the victim, (2) the relative credibility of the victim and the defendant was critical to the jury\u2019s determination of the case, (3) there was no physical evidence of the crimes to assist the jury in that determination and (4) the prosecutor\u2019s remarks struck at the heart of the critical issue in a closely contested case, we are not persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury was not influenced adversely by the prosecutor\u2019s improper closing argument. The state has failed to prove that the remarks were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and, accordingly, the defendant is entitled to a new trial on the fourth degree sexual assault and risk of injury charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">The defendant next claims that the state\u2019s attorney committed prosecutorial misconduct during her closing and rebuttal arguments, depriving the defendant of a fair trial. Specifically, the defendant claims that in addition to the prosecutor\u2019s comments concerning his presence in the courtroom during trial, the prosecutor also impermissibly expressed to the jury her personal opinion, invited the jury to draw inferences from facts not in evidence, and appealed to the passion and emotions of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">During the state\u2019s closing argument, the defendant objected to the prosecutor\u2019s comments concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>defendant\u2019s continuing to live with the victim\u2019s mother and the victim\u2019s living in Massachusetts with her grandmother. The trial court instructed the prosecutor to eliminate from her argument any reference to the living arrangements of the defendant or the victim. After the state\u2019s rebuttal argument, the defendant objected. The defendant\u2019s requests for a mistrial, a curative instruction to the jury and an opportunity to rebut parts of the state\u2019s additional argument were denied. The defendant also moved for a new trial, arguing that the prosecutor committed prosecutorial misconduct in her closing argument. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Prosecutorial misconduct may occur during closing argument. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 539, 529 A.2d 653 (1987). \u201cIn analyzing the defendant\u2019s claim, we ask whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. . . . We do not focus alone, however, on the conduct of the prosecutor. The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 539-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\u201cIn determining whether prosecutorial misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process, this court, in conformity with courts in other jurisdictions, has focused on several factors. . . . Included among those factors are the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument; <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcone, </em>191 Conn. 12, 23, 463 A.2d 558 (1983); the severity of the misconduct; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>663 F.2d 1173, 1181 (2d Cir. 1981) [cert. denied, 456 U.S. 989, 102 S.

App. 1984); the strength of the curative measures adopted; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>supra, 1181; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>402 F.2d 656, 657 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 1968); <em>State </em>v. <em>Doehrer, </em>supra, 654; and the strength of the state\u2019s case. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>supra, 1181; <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>supra, 564; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>194 Conn. 483, 492, 481 A.2d 741 (1984).\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Satchwell, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 578-79 <em>(Katz, J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u201cThe prosecutor may not express his own opinion, either directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of witnesses. ... Nor may he express his opinion, directly or indirectly, as to the guilt of the defendant. . . . Such expressions of personal opinion are a form of unsworn and unchecked testimony. . . . These expressions of opinion are particularly difficult for the jury to ignore because of the special position held by the prosecutor. . . . The jury is aware that he has prepared and presented the case and consequently, may have access to matters not in evidence . . . which the jury may infer to have precipitated the personal opinions.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 541-44. \u201cSimilarly, counsel may not submit to a jury that a witness has testified truthfully. <em>State </em>v. <em>Oehman, </em>212 Conn. 325, 336, 562 A.2d 493 (1989). A prosecutor\u2019s voucher for the credibility of his witnesses is dangerous primarily because the prosecutor\u2019s opinion carries with it the imprimatur of the Government and may induce the jury to trust the Government\u2019s judgment rather than its own view of the evidence. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 18-19, 105 S.

In this case, we do not believe that the misconduct was invited by any conduct or argument of the defense. We believe that the seriousness of the misconduct is reinforced by the frequency of its occurrence during the state\u2019s closing argument.

Your final decision must ultimately be based on whom you believe, the victim ... or the defendant .... Now, you may recall that all the witnesses were sequestered.

So that they couldn\u2019t contradict each other. But there was one witness who wasn\u2019t sequestered. There was one witness who heard everything. And, that was [the defendant], who has a built-in bias in the outcome of this case by virtue of the fact that, he\u2019s the defendant. . . . When you consider the credibility of the defendant\u2019s testimony, keep in mind that of all the witnesses here, he\u2019s the most obviously biased and interested one. He\u2019s the one who has the motive to distort the truth and fabricate the story. Think about it.\u201d I do not agree with the majority that these comments \u201clinked the defendant\u2019s presence at trial with his guilt\u201d and amounted to a constitutional violation \u201cof the same magnitude as that in <em>Cassidy, Shinn </em>and <em>Agard.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>236 Conn. 112, 672 A.2d 899, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 910, 117 S.

The court stated that \u201c[i]nviting the fact finder to draw an inference adverse to a defendant <em>solely </em>on account of the defendant\u2019s assertion of a constitutional right impermissibly burdens the free exercise of that right and, therefore, may not be tolerated.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

Such tactics prevent rebuttal and cross-examination, which are the engines of the truth-finding process in an adversarial criminal trial. <em>Without facts in evidence to support an inference of fabrication, such remarks are prejudicial and not at all probative.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)

Id., 414. We emphasized, however, that the case did not involve \u201ca comment of a prosecutor that relates to the <em>credibility </em>of a defendant who takes the stand to testify in his or her own behalf. Rather, [the] case concerned] a comment that relates to the fact that a defendant chose to exercise the constitutional right to testify, not to the content of that testimony.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 409-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>In this case, the focus of the prosecutor\u2019s summation to the jury was the relative credibility of the defendant and the victim. In challenging the defendant\u2019s credibility, the prosecutor referred to a multitude of factors, including (1) the defendant\u2019s status as a sophisticated adult who is in a better position than the minor victim to \u201cfabricate a complicated story designed to sway a jury,\u201d (2) the contradictions in the testimony of the defendant and the victim\u2019s mother, (3) the defendant\u2019s demeanor while testifying, (4) the defendant\u2019s statements under oath in a prior court proceeding and (5) the defendant\u2019s interest in the outcome of the case. The prosecutor, therefore, did not invite the jury to draw an inference that the defendant fabricated his trial testimony <em>solely </em>because he exercised his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>47 Conn. App. 632, 644, 708 A.2d 213, cert. denied, 244 Conn. 909, 713 A.2d 828 (1998); compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In addition, the prosecutor referred to facts in evidence to support an inference that the defendant fabricated his trial testimony\u2014specifically, the contradictions in the testimony of the defendant and the victim\u2019s mother regarding whether the defendant had ever entered the victim\u2019s bedroom, and the defendant\u2019s prior inconsistent statements regarding his address. This type of argument has been approved both by our Supreme Court in <em>Cassidy </em>and by the Second Circuit in <em>Agard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Finally, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in this case are unlike those considered by this court in <em>Shinn. </em>Here, all of the remarks challenged by the defendant relate to the <em>credibility </em>of his testimony and do not directly link his presence at trial with his guilt. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Shinn, </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">\u201cIt is well established that once an accused takes the stand and testifies his credibility is subject to scrutiny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>and close examination. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>189 Conn. 631, 640, 458 A.2d 379 (1983). A defendant cannot both take the stand and be immune from impeachment. . . . An accused who testifies subjects himself to the same rules and tests which could by law be applied to other witnesses. <em>State </em>v. <em>Palozie, </em>165 Conn. 288, 298, 334 A.2d 468 (1973).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McClendon, </em>199 Conn. 5, 12, 505 A.2d 685 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s comments during summation properly challenged the defendant\u2019s credibility by reference to the evidence adduced at trial. Moreover, unlike in <em>Cassidy, </em>the prosecutor\u2019s comments did not invite the jury to draw an inference adverse to the defendant <em>solely </em>on account of the defendant\u2019s assertion of his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. I would conclude, therefore, that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that a constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Even if I were to conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s summation remarks were improper, I would not grant the defendant a new trial because the state has established that the remarks were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 131-32, the court based its decision that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were not harmless on the fact that (1) the state\u2019s case rested entirely on the uncorroborated testimony of the victim, (2) the relative credibility of the defendant and the victim was critical to the jury\u2019s resolution of the case, (3) there was no independent evidence of the crimes to assist the jury in that determination, and (4) the trial court failed to give a curative instruction as requested by the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 647-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Although the relative credibility of the defendant and the victim was important to the jury\u2019s resolution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>the case, the state\u2019s case did not rest entirely on the uncorroborated testimony of the victim. Rather, the state called five constancy of accusation witnesses to support the victim\u2019s testimony. In addition, the state adduced testimony from three expert witnesses. Furthermore, unlike in <em>Cassidy, </em>the defendant did not seek a curative instruction at the conclusion of closing argument. <em>See State v. Oehman, </em>212 Conn. 325, 338, 562 A.2d 493 (1989) (conclusion that prosecutor\u2019s comments did not result in prejudice to defendant sufficient to warrant reversal of conviction buttressed by defendant\u2019s failure to object to portions of prosecutor\u2019s summation complained of on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Finally, in <em>Cassidy, </em>the court\u2019s decision \u201cwas based, in part, on the fact that the comments by the prosecutor were misleading to the jury because \u2018it [was] by no means certain that the jurors were . . . aware of the fact that the other trial witnesses were not permitted in the courtroom when not testifying\u2019 due to the existence of a sequestration order.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 643. The court stated that \u201c[t]his information . . . would have at least placed the prosecutor\u2019s comments in a fairer, more complete, context.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 124. In this case, the prosecutor, during summation, clearly and unambiguously stated that, \u201call the witnesses were sequestered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">I would conclude that the allegedly improper comments made by the prosecutor were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">The majority concludes that the defendant was denied a fair trial in violation of his federal and state constitutional rights to due process of law because the prosecutor, during her summation, improperly (1) rendered her opinion on the credibility of the victim\u2019s testimony, (2) made reference to facts not in evidence and (3) appealed to the emotions of the jurors. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>During her rebuttal argument, the prosecutor commented that the victim has no motive to lie, that she told the truth, and that the jurors \u201cshould depend on her word.\u201d In addition, the prosecutor offered her opinion as to the lack of physical evidence in the case and characterized the victims of child sexual abuse as \u201csmall, weak, naive, inarticulate and powerless.\u201d Following the state\u2019s rebuttal argument, the defendant requested a mistrial, a curative instruction to the juiy and an opportunity to rebut orally the prosecutor\u2019s statements. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s requests. The trial court also denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u201cIn determining whether a prosecutor\u2019s conduct was so egregious as to deny a defendant a fair trial, we note that some leeway must be afforded to the advocates in offering arguments to the jury in final argument. [I]n addressing the jury, [cjounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument. . . . [W]e must review the comments complained of in the context of the entire trial. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Villanueva, </em>44 Conn. App. 457, 461-62, 689 A.2d 1141 [cert. denied, 240 Conn. 930, 693 A.2d 302] (1997).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Abdalaziz, </em>45 Conn. App. 591, 605, 696 A.2d 1310, cert. granted on other grounds, 243 Conn. 902, 701 A.2d 334 (1997). \u201cWe look to the propriety of the challenged remark and, if the statement was improper, to whether it caused substantial prejudice to the defendant. <em>Statev. Oehman, </em>[supra, 212 Conn. 336].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>45 Conn. App. 297, 303, 696 A.2d 344, cert. denied, 241 Conn. 927, 697 A.2d 362 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Because the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s requests for a mistrial, a curative instruction to the jury and an opportunity to rebut orally the prosecutor\u2019s statements, as well as his motion for a new trial, it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>be assumed that the trial court did not consider the remarks to rise to the level of \u201cprosecutorial misconduct.\u201d \u201cWhen a verdict is challenged on the basis of the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly prejudicial remarks, the defendant bears the burden of proving the remarks prejudicial in light of the whole trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>10 Conn. App. 361, 364, 523 A.2d 1323, cert. denied, 203 Conn. 809, 525 A.2d 523, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 859, 108 S. Ct. 172, 98 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1987). The trial court\u2019s ruling is entitled to weight because of the vantage point from which it can observe and evaluate the circumstances of the trial. The trial court is in a better position to determine the propriety of the remarks of counsel and whether or not they are harmful. <em>State </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>194 Conn. 483, 493, 481 A.2d 741 (1984).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pouncey, </em>40 Conn. App. 624, 635, 673 A.2d 547 (1996), aff'd, 241 Conn. 802, 699 A.2d 901 (1997). \u201cMoreover, we will not disturb the trial court\u2019s mistrial ruling unless the challenged remarks have so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>218 Conn. 486, 508, 590 A.2d 901 (1991).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pouncey, </em>supra, 634-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">My review of the record reveals that the alleged misconduct was neither intentional nor flagrant and did not rise to the level of substantial prejudice that justifies reversal. The prosecutor\u2019s comments were relatively brief, confined to rebuttal argument and not part of a pattern of misconduct. Further, the trial court instructed the jury that the arguments and statements of counsel during summation were not evidence and that it was the jurors\u2019 recollection of the evidence that should have weight in their deliberations, rather than what counsel said in final argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">I would conclude that none of the defendant\u2019s claims of prosecutorial misconduct justifies reversal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>defendant\u2019s conviction. The effect of the prosecutor\u2019s comments cannot be said to have affected the outcome of the trial or to have so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the defendant\u2019s resulting conviction a denial of due process. If the defendant suffered any prejudice it was minimal, and the sanction of reversal is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">I would affirm the judgment of the trial court and, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-8\"> \u201cAt the conclusion of closing arguments, the defendant moved for a mistrial or, in the alternative, for a curative instruction to the jury. <em>[State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 122].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>47 Conn.
