The dispositive question is whether the conduct of plaintiffs counsel was so calculated to inflame and prejudice the jury as to preclude a fair trial. We conclude that it was, and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Barbara B. Hubble was a patient of Dr. Ellis F. Maxey, an ophthalmologist. On January 23, 1984, Dr. Maxey performed an operation on Mrs. Hubble\u2019s right eye, removing a cataract and implanting an intraocular lens. The operation was performed in Riverside Hospital in Newport News, where Dr. Charlotte M. Wild practiced as an anesthesiologist. While administering general anesthesia to Mrs. Hubble, Dr. Wild had difficulty inserting an endotracheal tube. She succeeded on her fifth attempt. She told Dr. Maxey that Mrs. Hubble would have a sore throat as a result of the trauma caused by the intubation.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Mrs. Hubble was discharged from the hospital the following day. She complained of a sore throat for the next six days, after which she consulted Dr. William R. Steffey, an otolaryngologist. Dr. Steffey readmitted Mrs. Hubble to Riverside Hospital on January 30 for a laryngoscopy. She was found to have a perforation of the cervical esophagus, a very dangerous condition frequently fatal within 24 to 48 hours of its onset. A team of thoracic surgeons, Dr. Charles E. Umstott and Dr. Walter H. Graham, performed successful surgery, but Mrs. Hubble\u2019s condition was grave and she was not released from the hospital until February 22, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">In 1986, Mrs. Hubble brought this malpractice action against Drs. Maxey and Wild. The plaintiffs position was that the endotracheal intubation was negligently performed, perforating the esophagus. The defendants contended that such a result would have caused death within 48 hours of the operation. Their position was that due to the unusual alignment of Mrs. Hubble\u2019s trachea, some trauma during intubation was unavoidable, and probably caused a laceration in the lining of the esophagus, which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>not have violated the standard of care. Such lacerations are not uncommon and rarely evolve into the serious complications Mrs. Hubble experienced. Because of this disagreement, the trial became a two-week battle of experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Before trial, a dispute arose between counsel with regard to the propriety of interviewing an opponent\u2019s prospective expert witnesses. The question was complicated because some treating physicians were also to be called as experts, some experts had previously treated the plaintiff, some physicians were to be \u201cfact witnesses\u201d only, and some were to be experts in a limited sense, omitting any testimony as to the standard of care. The court ruled that physicians who had not treated the plaintiff, but who were to testify only as expert witnesses, could not be interviewed by opposing counsel. On the other hand, the court ruled that any physician who had treated the plaintiff was available to either side for interview and discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Defense counsel named Dr. Steffey, the otolaryngologist, and Drs. Umstott and Graham, the thoracic surgeons, as prospective expert witnesses. Because these physicians also had treated Mrs. Hubble, plaintiffs counsel moved the court to order defense counsel to refrain from any <em>ex parte </em>communications with them. The court overruled the motion, reiterating its holding that \u201cfact\u201d witnesses were available for interview by all parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Notwithstanding that ruling, Gwen Schockemoehl, one of plaintiffs counsel<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> thereafter wrote letters to Drs. Steffey, Umstott, and Graham advising them that \u201csome courts have considered the rendering of expert opinions by treating doctors ... as a breach of the fiduciary relationship which exists between doctor and patient.\u201d The letter ended by asking the doctors to \u201crefrain from discussing your care and treatment of her with unauthorized persons.\u201d Defense counsel sent a copy of the letter to the court, without comment. The court responded with a letter to all counsel reiterating the previous ruling, and indicating that action with respect to Mrs. Schockemoehl\u2019s letter would be deferred until a later stage of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">On the opening day of trial, plaintiffs counsel made a motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude the defendants from calling as witnesses any of the physicians who had treated the plaintiff, stating that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>would be a \u201cviolation of the physician/patient privilege.\u201d The court held that this was covered by its original ruling, and that the court had been \u201cshocked\u201d by Mrs. Schockemoehl\u2019s letter. Nevertheless, Mr. Taylor proceeded to cross-examine Dr. Steffey as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\">Q. Well, did Dr. Maxey\u2019s lawyers \u2014 did you talk with Dr. Maxey\u2019s lawyers about what your opinion was going to be in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">Q. How many times have you talked with Dr. Maxey\u2019s lawyers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">A. I think on two occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">Q. Barbara Hubble is your patient, isn\u2019t she?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-10\">Q. Wasn\u2019t she your patient on January 30 and 31?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-12\">Q. And you treated her in the hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-13\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-14\">Q. Your relationship to Barbara Hubble, was it not, was as a patient?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-15\">MR. HARLAN: Your Honor please, I think this has been the subject of comment before by counsel and the Court, and I\u2019d ask the Court to recollect \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-16\">THE COURT: Yes, I\u2019ve ruled on this, now. I don\u2019t mind you asking him whether he had treated her, but let\u2019s don\u2019t get into any ethical standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-17\">Mr. Taylor was undeterred. His interrogation immediately continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-18\">Q. You have medical ethics, though, don\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">Q. In your profession?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">MR. HARLAN: Your Honor please, you just instructed Mr. Taylor \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">THE COURT: Yes, but I have ruled, ladies and gentlemen, that he has violated no ethical standards in talking with the defendant\u2019s lawyers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Later, in recross-examination of Dr. Steffey, Mr. Taylor persisted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">Q. And you have met with Dr. Wild\u2019s lawyers, have you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-11\">Q. How many occasions have you met with Dr. Wild\u2019s lawyers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-12\">A. Three, I believe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-13\">Q. Did you have any kind of a \u2014 did you ask Barbara Hubble if that would be okay with her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-14\">MR. HARLAN: Objection, Your Honor. That\u2019s not necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-15\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-16\">BY MR. TAYLOR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-17\">Q. Did you have a medical authorization from Barbara Hubble?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-18\">MR. HARLAN: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-19\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-20\">MR. HARLAN: And I move for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>THE COURT: All right, I\u2019ll overrule your motion on that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Plaintiffs counsel, from opening statement through closing argument, attempted to portray the defense as a part of a conspiracy among members of the medical profession. In opening statement, plaintiffs counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">[SJhe\u2019s had what we submit to you as a devil of a time going from doctor to doctor here in this area . . . trying to get help. She has been to two or three eye doctors in this area and found out, she will tell you, that they had been working for Dr. Maxey in this lawsuit on the side. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Plaintiffs counsel also told the jury about two other physicians Mrs. Hubble had consulted who, unknown to her, had secretly been \u201cworking for the other side.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Out of the hearing of the jury, defense counsel complained to the court. Plaintiffs counsel responded with remarkable frankness: \u201cThere is nothing wrong with trying to convey a conspiracy idea when everyone in the United States knows there is a conspiracy of silence, especially in a tight-knit opthalmology community . . . .\u201d The court responded, \u201c[T]he box you are trying to put me in is for this jury to get across that there is insurance involved in this case, . . . [W]hy we can\u2019t just try a straightforward case, I don\u2019t know, unless you are trying to engender sympathy, or trying to get insurance in it indirectly, or trying to show a conspiracy indirectly, and I\u2019m not going to have it.\u201d The court, however, again denied defense counsel\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Notwithstanding the court\u2019s admonitions, the conspiracy theme recurred persistently. In summation, Mr. Taylor argued to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-10\">Now, you might ask yourself, why didn\u2019t we get somebody here in Newport News to testify? Well, you know, physicians tend to close ranks in this type of situation, especially when they are all working together under the same circumstances. And I\u2019m not being critical of any of the local physicians. They find themselves between a rock and a hard place in a situation like this. They have to work every day with Dr. Maxey and Dr. Wild.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>And these doctors are all under the gun in that type of situation, and they don\u2019t come forth to volunteer to help the patient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">After a brief period of deliberation the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the amount of $500,000, the exact amount claimed. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial and entered judgment on the verdict. We granted the defendants an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In <em>A.C.R. Co. </em>v. <em>Robertson\u2019s Ex\u2019r., </em>135 Va. 247, 263, 116 S.E. 476, 481 (1923), we said;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">[An attorney] must be just to opposing litigants and witnesses and always respect their rights. His liberties in argument are large but they are not unlimited. He has no right to testify in argument nor to assume that there is evidence which has no existence, nor to urge a decision which is favorable to his client by arousing sympathy, exciting prejudice, or upon any ground which is illegal. Sometimes the impropriety is so serious in character that its evil effect cannot be corrected by the trial judge. If this ethical rule ... is not sufficient to control those who fail to observe it, the courts, however reluctant they may be to limit the freedom of discussion, or to penalize a litigant for the transgression of his attorney, will be forced to curb this growing evil.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">In that case, we decided that the trial court\u2019s prompt action to correct the improper effect of counsel\u2019s remarks was sufficient to avert the danger of prejudice, <em>id. </em>at 262-63, 116 S.E at 481, and affirmed the judgment. But only eight months later, we were called upon to decide a case in which plaintiffs counsel had persisted in alluding to casualty insurance in a tort case after the trial judge had admonished counsel, instructed the jury in the strongest terms to disregard the improper remarks, and received the jury\u2019s assurance that it understood the court\u2019s instructions and would abide by them. In that case, <em>Rinehart &amp; Dennis Co. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>137 Va. 670, 120 S.E. 269 (1923), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">Generally a new trial will be denied where improper argument has been checked by the court and the jury has been instructed to disregard the improper statements. <em>If however, counsel persists in such argument after the admonition of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number><em>the court, </em>or if it appears that the unfavorable influence of the argument was probably not wholly removed by the court\u2019s action, a new trial may be allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 676, 120 S.E. at 271 (citing <em>Wash. &amp; O.D. Co. </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>119 Va. 334, 339, 89 S.E. 140, 142 (1916)) (emphasis added). Because of counsel\u2019s persistence after the trial court\u2019s admonition, we held in <em>Rinehart &amp; Dennis Co. </em>that a new trial should have been granted, and reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Counsel\u2019s persistence in a course of conduct which the trial judge had disapproved and instructed the jury to disregard was alone sufficient to require reversal of a judgment in favor of the offending counsel\u2019s client in <em>Power Company </em>v. <em>Jayne, </em>151 Va. 694, 144 S.E. 638 (1928). There, plaintiff\u2019s counsel said in argument, \u201cHow long will the defendant company shed its tears after this trial is over? Do you suppose its tear duct has been hurt any?\u201d The court directed the jury to disregard those remarks. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then said, \u201cThat is just a figure of speech. You know corporations haven\u2019t any tear ducts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 703, 144 S.E. at 641. The court instructed the jury to disregard that remark as well, but the result was a reversal on appeal and the grant of a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 705, 144 S.E. at 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">In <em>N. &amp; W. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Eley, </em>152 Va. 773, 148 S.E. 678 (1929), we reversed a judgment for a plaintiff in a case in which the plaintiff\u2019s attorney had argued to the jury that testimony of the engineer and fireman of the defendant railroad should be disbelieved because their \u201cbread and meat\u201d depended upon their giving testimony favorable to their employer. <em>Id. </em>at 779, 148 S.E. 679. We observed that there was no evidence that the defense witnesses had committed perjury for the sake of retaining their jobs, that counsel\u2019s argument was calculated to obtain a prejudicial result, and that the harm to the defendant consisted of depriving it of the central ingredient of the judicial system: a fair and impartial tribunal. Justice Campbell wrote: \u201cTrial courts should be the forum in which litigants should have their rights determined according to the rules of law, instead of becoming arenas in which counsel engage in a battle of wits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 777-78, 148 S.E. at 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">We have continued to the present time to adhere to the views expressed in the foregoing cases. Where counsel makes an improper statement and the court takes prompt action to remove it by appropriate instruction to the jury, it will ordinarily be pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>sumed that .the jury heeded the instruction and that no lasting harm was done. But where the prejudicial effect is so overwhelming that it cannot be removed by the court\u2019s instruction, the injured party, if he requests it, is entitled to a new trial. <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 294, 303, 237 S.E.2d 150, 156 (1977). The injured party\u2019s right to a new trial is especially strong where his opponent has persisted in an objectionable course of conduct after the trial judge has expressed disapproval of it, sustained an objection to it, or instructed the jury to disregard it. In that situation, an appellate court will presume that the prejudicial effect of the improper conduct was too strong to be removed by further admonitions or jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">It is regrettable, as we observed in <em>Robertson\u2019s Ex\u2019r., </em>quoted above, that a litigant must be penalized for an attorney\u2019s misconduct, but where it is apparent that the effect of the misconduct has been such as to preclude the possibility of an impartial trial, it is better that the penalty fall on the party who stood to benefit by the misconduct rather than on the party injured by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In the present case, plaintiffs counsel had every right to cross-examine opposing witnesses to establish bias and to seek to impeach them by any other legitimate means. He had an unrestricted opportunity to prove, if such proof was available, that they were participants, even to the point of committing perjury, in a nefarious conspiracy calculated to deny the plaintiff access to the facts. But the record is devoid of any such proof. There is not a particle of evidence that the defendants\u2019 witnesses were biased, untruthful, or motivated by any wrongful purpose. Counsel\u2019s repeated insinuations to that effect rested only on counsel\u2019s desire to communicate that idea to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The plaintiffs appellate counsel points out, correctly, that the trial judge ruled in the defendants\u2019 favor when objections were timely made, admonished plaintiffs trial counsel, and expressed disapproval of counsel\u2019s remarks in the jury\u2019s presence. The focus of the defendants\u2019 appeal, however, is upon the cumulative effect of plaintiffs counsel\u2019s repeated statements, persisted in notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s rulings. Because of that effect, defendants contend, their motion for a new trial should have been granted. We agree, and will reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b654-8\"> The plaintiff was represented at trial by Edward W. Taylor and Gwen M. Schockemoehl. During the pendency of this appeal, they withdrew and Robert W. Mann entered his appearance for Mrs. Hubble.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
