Eugene Gunter, an attorney, al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>leging violations of Disciplinary Rules 1-102, 7-102, and 7-104. After hearing the evidence, the committee dismissed the latter two charges, but certified to the Executive Director of the Bar, for trial before the Bar\u2019s Disciplinary Board, the charge that Mr. Gunter had violated DR 1-102(A)(4), which provides that a lawyer shall not \u201c[e]ngage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation which reflects adversely on a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law.\u201d At Mr. Gunter\u2019s request, the case was tried before a three-judge court pursuant to Code \u00a7 54.1-3935(B). After a hearing on January 25, 1989, the court found that the Bar had carried its burden of proving a violation of DR 1-102(A)(4), and ordered that Mr. Gunter\u2019s license to practice law be suspended for a period of 30 days.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">The case comes to us on Mr. Gunter\u2019s appeal of right. The sole question is whether the evidence supports the court\u2019s finding. The facts will be stated in the light most favorable to the Bar, which prevailed at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">In May 1984, Jack Zerkel and his wife were living together in Shenandoah County but were having domestic difficulties. Mr. Zerkel, suspecting his wife to be guilty of adultery, retained Mr. Gunter as counsel. He asked Mr. Gunter to hire a private investigator to seek evidence of Mrs. Zerkel\u2019s suspected adultery. Mr. Gunter employed Dennis Sirbaugh, an investigator, for that purpose. Despite continuing surveillance, no evidence of adultery was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">At a meeting with his client in June 1984, Mr. Gunter expressed the view that it would not be improper to install a recording device on the telephone in the Zerkel home in order to maintain surveillance of Mrs. Zerkel\u2019s activities. His view was based upon the facts that the parties were still living together, the telephone was in Mr. Zerkel\u2019s name, and Mr. Zerkel paid the telephone bills. Mr. Zerkel authorized the installation and Mr. Sirbaugh, at Mr. Gunter\u2019s direction, without Mrs. Zerkel\u2019s knowledge, installed a recording device connected to telephone wires in the basement of the Zerkel home. The recording device was activated whenever a receiver was picked up in the home, and it recorded all telephone traffic. Periodically, Mr. Sirbaugh reviewed the tapes and reported the substance of Mrs. Zerkel\u2019s conversa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>tions to Mr. Gunter. There was no simultaneous monitoring of the conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">The tape recorder remained in place for about a month, from mid-June to mid-July, 1984. None of the recordings produced any indication of adultery. Mr. Gunter did learn from the recordings, however, that Mrs. Zerkel was conferring with attorneys to obtain legal advice in contemplation of divorce litigation, a fact she was attempting to conceal from her husband. In conversations with friends, recorded without her knowledge, she discussed the legal advice she had received, but no conversations with her attorneys were recorded. There is no evidence that Mr. Gunter knew that any attorney had agreed to represent Mrs. Zerkel.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">After hearing Mrs. Zerkel\u2019s recorded comments regarding legal advice she had received concerning desertion, support, child custody and property division, Mr. Gunter advised his client to continue \u201cstanding pat.\u201d Later, Mr. Gunter learned from the recordings that Mrs. Zerkel had received joint tax refund checks which she intended to cash by using the parties\u2019 joint bank account. As a result of this information, Mr. Gunter advised his client to close the account immediately. Mr. Zerkel did so, making it impossible for Mrs. Zerkel to cash the refund checks without his endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The recorder was removed from the Zerkel home after Mr. Gunter mentioned it in a memorandum inadvertently sent to Mr. Zerkel at his place of business, where it might have been seen by employees friendly with Mrs. Zerkel. In a memorandum to his file dated July 24, 1984, Mr. Gunter expressed the thought that if Mrs. Zerkel did not discover the surveillance within 10 days, however, he would recommend that the tape recorder be reinstalled \u201cin order to secure possible evidence of adultery and, more importantly, in order to secure an input directly from [Mrs. Zerkel] as to settlement negotiations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The tape recorder was never reinstalled. Mrs. Zerkel ultimately learned about it through Mr. Gunter\u2019s memorandum which she discovered in her husband\u2019s automobile. She complained to the State Police, which resulted in Mr. Gunter\u2019s indictment by the Shenandoah County Grand Jury on January 10, 1985, for conspiracy to violate the wiretapping statute, Code \u00a7 19.2-62. Mr. Gunter was tried by a jury on that charge and was acquitted on February 3, 1986. The following year, the Bar instituted these proceedings before the Seventh District Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>The appeal is based upon the arguments that there was no proven violation of the wiretapping laws, as we construed them in <em>Cogdill </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 272, 247 S.E.2d 392 (1978), because there was no \u201cinterception\u201d of telephone communications; that the charges of violations of law had been dismissed by the district committee in any event; and that in the absence of a violation of law, Mr. Gunter\u2019s conduct did not amount to \u201cdishonesty\u201d or \u201cdeceit\u201d within the meaning of DR 1-102(A)(4). The Bar responds that the conduct complained of did indeed violate the wiretapping laws, notwithstanding Mr. Gunter\u2019s acquittal of the criminal conspiracy charge, but that even if it was not unlawful, it was unethical, and falls within the prohibition of DR 1-102(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">The Bar argues, on brief: \u201c[s] tripped to its essentials, appellant\u2019s position is that if it\u2019s legal, it\u2019s ethical. Appellant\u2019s view of the Code of Professional Responsibility is far too restrictive. The Code requires that an attorney do more than simply refrain from criminal conduct.\u201d That observation conforms to views we have expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In <em>National Airlines </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>223 Va. 578, 292 S.E.2d 308 (1982), after holding that improper conduct on the part of an attorney came within the rules of estoppel, we said, \u201c[t]hese are the rules of the marketplace. Higher standards should prevail in the practice of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583, 292 S.E.2d at 311. The lowest common denominator, binding lawyers and laymen alike, is the statute and common law. A higher standard is imposed on lawyers by the Code of Professional Responsibility, many parts of which proscribe conduct which would be lawful if done by laymen. We must apply that standard in weighing challenges to disciplinary proceedings against lawyers, but we emphasize that more is expected of lawyers than mere compliance with the minimum requirements of that standard. The traditions of professionalism at the bar embody a level of fairness, candor, and courtesy higher than the minimum requirements of the Code of Professional Responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">It follows that conduct may be unethical, measured by the minimum requirements of the Code of Professional Responsibility, even if it is not unlawful. It is therefore immaterial whether the conduct complained of in the present case violates the wiretapping laws, and we expressly refrain from deciding that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The Bar relies upon Formal Opinion 337 of the American Bar Association\u2019s Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>bility (1974), which condemned as a violation of DR 1-102(A)(4) the recordation by a lawyer of <em>any </em>conversation without the consent or prior knowledge of all parties to the conversation, subject only to exceptions in favor of law-enforcement officers. The Bar also cites cases from a number of sister jurisdictions which have considered the question and, with near unanimity, have come to the same conclusion. The ABA Opinion, as well as the cited decisions of other courts, however, embrace the recordation by a lawyer of conversations to which he is a party, a circumstance not present in the case before us. We are not called upon to decide whether that conduct violates DR 1-102(A)(4), and we expressly refrain from deciding that question as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">There remains the question whether the recordation, by a lawyer or by his authorization, of conversations between third persons, to which he is not a party, without the consent or prior knowledge of each party to the conversation, is \u201cconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, [or] deceit\u201d under DR 1-102(A)(4). We have no hesitancy in giving an affirmative answer to that question. Among numerous definitions of \u201cdeceit\u201d are: \u201cthe act or practice of deceiving (as by falsification, concealment, or cheating) . . . artifice, or practice designed to mislead another: wily device . . . any trick, collusion, contrivance ... or underhand practice used to defraud another.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 584 (1976). \u201cDeceitful\u201d is defined as \u201cserving to mislead or ensnare.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 679 (2nd Ed. 1934) (emphasis added). The surreptitious recordation of conversations authorized by Mr. Gunter in this case was an \u201cunderhand practice\u201d designed to \u201censnare\u201d an opponent. It was more than a departure from the standards of fairness and candor which characterize the traditions of professionalism. We hold that it was deceitful conduct proscribed by DR 1-102(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment will be</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b663-7\"> Judge Jennings dissented from the penalty imposed, expressing the view that a public reprimand would be an appropriate sanction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
