Former Code \u00a7 18.2-31(e) (1987 Cum. Supp.). Spencer also was indicted for the rape of Tucker.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">In a bifurcated trial conducted pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.3 and -264.4, a jury convicted Spencer of capital murder and fixed his punishment at death. The jury also convicted Spencer of rape and fixed his punishment at life imprisonment. Following a sentencing hearing, the trial court imposed the sentences fixed by the jury and entered judgments on the jury verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">We have consolidated the automatic review of Spencer\u2019s death sentence with his appeal of the capital murder conviction, Code \u00a7\u00a7 17-110.1 (A) and -110.1(F), and have given them priority on our docket, Code \u00a7 17-110.2. By order entered November 29, 1988, Spencer\u2019s appeal of the rape conviction was certified from the Court of Appeals and consolidated with the capital murder appeal. Code \u00a7 17-116.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">Under established principles of appellate review, we will view the evidence and all reasonable inferences deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. On the evening of Tuesday, December 1, 1987, the nude body of Susan Tucker was found lying face down on the bed in the ransacked master bedroom of her Arlington townhouse. A slip-knotted rope was tied around Tucker\u2019s neck; the free end of the knotted rope had been used to tie Tucker\u2019s hands behind her back. The medical examiner determined the cause of death to be \u201c[sjtrangulation by ligature.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Tucker had been dead three to five days before her body was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">When Tucker\u2019s body was discovered, a blue sleeping bag was partially draped over her buttocks, a brown blanket was underneath her, and her nightgown was on the bed. There were large semen stains on all three items. \u201c[P]ubic hairs of Negroid origin\u201d were found on the blanket and in the bathroom sink and on the counter around the sink. Negroid pubic hairs also were found on a washcloth that apparently had been taken from Tucker\u2019s bathroom and dropped on a bush a short distance from Tucker\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Tucker\u2019s murderer had entered the townhouse by breaking a sliding basement window located under the balcony at the rear of the house. Glass samples of the broken window were taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">On January 20, 1988, Arlington County Police arrested Spencer, a black male, in the City of Richmond on a warrant charging burglary. At the time of his arrest, police seized a camouflage jacket from Spencer. After advising him of his rights, a police officer asked Spencer to voluntarily give blood, hair, and saliva samples. Although the officer told Spencer he was charged with burglary, Spencer asked \u201cif this had anything to do with the rape.\u201d When the officer informed him that the crime had occurred in Arlington, Spencer inquired, \u201cDoes this have anything to do with the murder then?\u201d Spencer had visited his mother\u2019s Arlington home over the Thanksgiving holiday, arriving Thanksgiving morning, November 26, and departing the following Sunday, November 29. Spencer\u2019s mother lived approximately seven blocks from Tucker\u2019s townhouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The medical examiner who performed the autopsy obtained oral, rectal, and vaginal swabs and a blood sample from Tucker\u2019s body. The vaginal swab was taken by inserting the swab \u201cas high in the vaginal cavity as it will go;\u201d the swab did not contact the external genitalia. The medical examiner\u2019s microscopic examination revealed \u201cfour to eight\u201d intact, non-motile sperm in smears made from the vaginal swab. No sperm was observed in the smears made from the anal and oral swabs.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">A forensic serologist who subsequently made smears from the swabs taken by the medical examiner found two sperm on the rectal smears but found no sperm on either the vaginal or oral smears. The serologist explained that she had had to rehydrate the dry swabs before testing them. Consequently, the water diluted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>any seminal fluid present on the swabs, making the sperm more difficult to detect.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Forensic analysis established that the Negroid pubic hairs found on the washcloth, on the blanket from Tucker\u2019s bed, and on the bathroom sink were microscopically consistent \u201cin all identifiable characteristics\u201d with known samples of Spencer\u2019s pubic hair. Forensic scientists also determined that glass fragments found in Spencer\u2019s camouflage jacket matched the optical properties of Tucker\u2019s broken basement window. Only two percent of glass examined at the state laboratory has had the same optical properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Analysis of the semen stains found on Tucker\u2019s nightgown, the blanket, and the sleeping bag established that the stains were left by a \u201csecretor,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>a person whose blood characteristics are expressed in other bodily fluids. Analysis further determined that the individual had blood type O and enzyme groupings of PGM type 1, PGM subtype 1+, and peptidase A type 1. Analysis of Spencer\u2019s blood and saliva samples showed that they matched in all respects the secretions found at the crime scene. This particular combination of blood type and enzyme groupings is shared by approximately 13% of the population.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Spencer\u2019s blood sample and the semen collected from the nightgown and the sleeping bag also were subjected to \u201cDNA printing.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cDNA\u201d is the abbreviation for deoxyribonucleic acid, which is the chemical that carries an individual\u2019s genetic information. The DNA printing technique was used to compare DNA molecules extracted from Spencer\u2019s blood with DNA molecules extracted from the semen found at the crime scene. The DNA printing test established that the genetic material in Spencer\u2019s blood sample had the same characteristics as the genetic material in the semen stains on the nightgown and the sleeping bag. Such characteristics would be present in one of every 135 million black individuals. There are approximately ten million adult black males in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Prior to trial, Spencer moved to dismiss the capital murder indictment on the ground that \u201cimposition of the death penalty constitutes cruel and unusual punishment\u201d in violation of Article I, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>\u00a7 9 of the Constitution of Virginia and the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The trial court denied the motion, and Spencer has assigned error to the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">In numerous cases, we have held that the death penalty does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. <em>See, e.g., Pope </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 114, 121-22, 360 S.E.2d 352, 357 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 1015 (1988); <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 320, 356 S.E.2d 157, 160, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 873 (1987); <em>Beaver </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 521, 527, 352 S.E.2d 342, 345-46, <em>cert. denied, </em>483 U.S. 1033 (1987); <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 124, 134-35, 314 S.E.2d 371, 378, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 873 (1984); <em>Whitley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 66, 77-78, 286 S.E.2d 162, 168-69, <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 882 (1982); <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 844, 851, 284 S.E.2d 844, 849 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 938 (1982); <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 436, 439-40, 271 S.E.2d 123, 125-26 (1980); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 201, 212, 257 S.E.2d 784, 791 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1049 (1980); and <em>M. Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 476, 248 S.E.2d 135, 148 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 967 (1979). We adhere to our previous holdings and reject Spencer\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">On appeal, Spencer also contends that the death penalty is unconstitutional because a sentencing jury is given excessive discretion and the statutory aggravating factors are \u201cunconstitutionally vague.\u201d These constitutional challenges were not raised at trial and, therefore, are barred from appellate review. Rule 5:25; <em>see Fisher </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 403, 410, 374 S.E.2d 46, 50 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. __, 109 S.Ct. 1766 (1989).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The trial court excluded four prospective jurors for cause because they were unwilling to consider imposing the death penalty. Spencer concedes that three of these veniremen stated unequivocally on voir dire that they would not impose the death penalty under any circumstances. Spencer also acknowledges that the Supreme Court in <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510 (1968), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>ruled that such an exclusion is proper. He contends, nonetheless, that we have \u201cnever addressed whether the exclusion . . . violates a defendant\u2019s right to [an impartial jury of his peers]\u201d as guaranteed by Article I, \u00a7 8 of the Constitution of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">In <em>Townes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 307, 362 S.E.2d 650 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 971 (1988), however, Townes claimed that such an exclusion violated both his Federal and Virginia constitutional guarantees of trial by an impartial jury of one\u2019s peers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We rejected Townes\u2019 arguments, <em>id. </em>at 327, 362 S.E.2d at 661, and, adhering to our previous rulings, <em>e.g., Pruett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 266, 277-78, 351 S.E.2d 1, 7-8 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>482 U.S. 931 (1987), we now reaffirm that the exclusion of such jurors does not violate either the Federal or Virginia Constitutions. <em>See also Lockhart </em>v. <em>McCree, </em>476 U.S. 162 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Spencer further contends that the trial court erroneously struck venireman Chris Regan because he \u201chad not voiced objections to the imposition of the death penalty which would disqualify him.\u201d In a capital case, a venireman properly may be excluded if his views concerning imposition of a death sentence \u201c \u2018would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties . . . in accordance with his instructions and his oath.\u2019 \u201d <em>O\u2019Dell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 672, 695, 364 S.E.2d 491, 504 (quoting <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>448 U.S. 38, 45 (1980)), <em>cert. </em>denied, _ U.S. _, 109 S.Ct. 186 (1988). Moreover, because a trial judge \u201csees and hears the juror,\u201d <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 426 (1985), an appellate court must accord the trial judge deference in applying the <em>Adams-O\u2019Dell </em>standard, <em>LeVasseur </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 584-85, 304 S.E.2d 644, 654-55 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1063 (1984). The trial judge\u2019s decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of \u201cmanifest error.\u201d <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 448, 469, 374 S.E.2d 303, 316 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. _ (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">On three separate occasions during jury voir dire, Regan indicated that he could not impose the death penalty. Although Regan stated that he might consider imposing the death penalty \u201c [i]f it was a multiple death involved, . . . like the murder of two or three people,\u201d he also clearly stated that \u201cif it\u2019s just one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>[death], I don\u2019t believe in the death penalty.\u201d Moreover, when Regan was informed that the present case involved only one murder charge, he unequivocally stated that he could not consider the death penalty. Thus, we conclude that the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Regan\u2019s views about the death penalty would have substantially impaired the performance of his duties as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Spencer contends that the evidence is insufficient to prove that he had penetrated the victim\u2019s vagina with his penis. Thus, he asserts, the rape conviction cannot stand. Consequently, he concludes, without proof of a rape, there is no capital murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Our standard for reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence is firmly established.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">[W]hen the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. The trial court\u2019s judgment should be affirmed unless it appears that it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-8\"><em>Tuggle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 493, 510, 323 S.E.2d 539, 549 (1984), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds, 471 </em>U.S. 1096 (1985), a<em>ff'd on remand, </em>230 Va. 99, 334 S.E.2d 838 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>478 U.S. 1010 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">Rape is defined as \u201csexual intercourse with a female by force and against her will.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To prove that sexual intercourse occurred, the evidence must establish that \u201c \u2018there has been an actual penetration to some extent of the male sexual organ into the female sexual organ.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>McCall </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>192 Va. 422, 426, 65 S.E.2d 540, 542 (1951)).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">Penetration, like all other elements of the crime of rape, may be proved by circumstantial evidence. <em>Tuggle, </em>228 Va. at 510, 323 S.E.2d at 549. When the Commonwealth relies solely on circumstantial evidence to prove a rape, however, the facts and circumstances must exclude all reasonable hypotheses of innocence. <em>Id. </em>at 510-11, 323 S.E.2d at 549-50. Nevertheless, the hypotheses \u201cwhich must be thus excluded are those which flow from the evidence itself, and not from the imaginations of defense coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>sel.\u201d <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 226 </em>Va. 427, 433, 309 S.E.2d 325, 329 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">In the present case, the police discovered Tucker\u2019s nude body lying on a bed \u201cface down\u201d with her hands tied behind her back. The medical examiner took a vaginal swab by inserting the swab \u201cas high in the vaginal cavity as it will go\u201d and without allowing the swab to come in contact with the external genitalia. When the medical examiner microscopically examined the smears made from the vaginal swab, she found \u201cfour to eight\u201d intact, non-motile sperm. Additionally, the serologist who later examined the swabs found two sperm on the rectal swab. Large semen stains were found on the victim\u2019s nightgown, the sleeping bag, and the blanket. Spencer\u2019s pubic hairs were found at the scene. Moreover, shortly after the police arrested Spencer and informed him that he was charged with an Arlington burglary, Spencer asked the arresting officer \u201cif this had anything to do with <em>the rape.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) When the officer asked Spencer why he had inquired about a \u201crape,\u201d Spencer responded, \u201c[I]f you want my blood, it must have something to do with <em>the rape.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In spite of these circumstances, Spencer argues that the evidence does not support the jury\u2019s finding that penetration occurred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He primarily focuses upon the fact that the Commonwealth\u2019s expert serologist found no evidence of sperm on the vaginal swab. The serologist explained, however, that before she could examine the swab, she had had to apply a \u201csmall amount of water\u201d which could have \u201cdiluted\u201d any \u201csmall amount of seminal fluid [on the swab] ... to the point where it\u2019s no longer detectable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">It was the jury\u2019s function to weigh and reconcile the testimonies of the medical examiner and the serologist. If their testimonies conflicted, the jury was empowered to resolve the conflict. Obviously, the jury accepted the medical examiner\u2019s testimony concerning the presence of sperm in the victim\u2019s vagina, and this alone is sufficient to support the finding that penetration occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Spencer further contends that, assuming arguendo a rape did occur, there is no evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the rape occurred before or at the time of the victim\u2019s death. Spencer asserts that \u201cthe victim must be alive when the rape occurs. If [the victim] is already dead, there is no Capital Murder.\u201d Spencer\u2019s contention, however, is directly contrary to our holding in <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 31, 307 S.E.2d 864 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1109 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In <em>Coleman, </em>a capital murder case, the defendant challenged the following jury instruction that had been granted by the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">When the death of the victim occurs in connection with rape, it shall be immaterial in the prosecution thereof whether the alleged rape occurred before or after the death of the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">226 Va. at 51, 307 S.E.2d at 875. In his appeal, Coleman argued that the court erred in granting the instruction because \u201cthere was no evidence whether the victim was dead before or after the alleged rape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rejecting Coleman\u2019s contention, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">[The instruction] was based on Code \u00a7 18.2-63.1. The trial court gave it because it was \u201chelpful to the jury.\u201d Without the instruction, the jury might have been misled. Instruction IV [a different instruction] only provided as to the capital murder charged in this case that the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt <em>inter alia </em>that \u201cthe killing was of a person during the commission of rape.\u201d <em>The jury reasonably could have inferred from the evidence that the victim was murdered first and then raped. Without the guidance of [the challenged instruction] the jury might have concluded that Coleman could not be found guilty of capital murder if the rape had been committed after the murder. </em>The trial court, therefore, did not err in granting [the instruction].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-10\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">In <em>Coleman, </em>we also rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to support a capital murder conviction. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>doing so, we reviewed the evidence and concluded that \u201c[t]he jury reasonably could infer from the evidence that Coleman cut the victim with his knife <em>and raped her either before or after inflicting the fatal </em>blow.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 307 S.E.2d at 876 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Spencer, ignoring our holding in <em>Coleman, </em>relies upon <em>Harward </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 363, 330 S.E.2d 89 (1985). His reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">In <em>Harward, </em>the sole issue was \u201cwhether, under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(e), the person murdered can be someone other than the rape victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364, 330 S.E.2d at 90. We held that the statute \u201conly proscribes the murder of a rape victim and cannot be extended to include the murder of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 330 S.E.2d at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Spencer, however, points to our statement in <em>Harward </em>that the language \u201cduring the commission of, or subsequent to\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-31(e) \u201cexcludes a killing which occurs <em>before </em>a rape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366, 330 S.E.2d at 91 (emphasis in original). This statement was dicta and does not affect our clear holding to the contrary in <em>Coleman.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Next, we determine whether the trial court erred in admitting into evidence the results of the so-called \u201cDNA printing\u201d tests. DNA print identification is based upon several well-accepted scientific principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Chromosomes, the genetic seats of the human body, are composed of DNA molecules and protein. The DNA molecule carries the genetic blueprint that establishes each person as separate and distinct. Every cell that has a nucleus<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> contains chromosomes and, ultimately, the DNA molecule. The configuration of DNA molecules does not vary from cell to cell in the same human body; each DNA molecule carries the same genetic code in exactly the same sequence. However, the configuration of the molecule is different in every individual with the exception of identical twins.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>As one expert explained, an intact DNA molecule can be compared to a closed zipper.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The \u201cteeth\u201d of the DNA \u201czipper\u201d are composed of the chemical bases adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. In the early 1950\u2019s, scientists discovered that these chemical bases, or nucleotides, always pair together in a certain arrangement, <em>i.e., </em>adenine units always pair with thymine units; units of cytosine always pair with units of guanine.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">The order in which the nucleotides pair within a DNA molecule governs the genetic code carried by the molecule. In small areas of the DNA molecule, the pairing sequence of the nucleotides is markedly different in every individual except identical twins. These naturally occurring variations are called \u201cpolymorphisms.\u201d Techniques that enable the polymorphisms in the DNA of one individual to be detected, labeled, and compared with the polymorphisms in the DNA of another individual or in another cell sample from the same individual are the means of genetic identification used in DNA identity testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The first step in the testing process is the chemical extraction of the DNA from the biological specimen, <em>e.g., </em>white blood cells, semen, body hair, and tissue. Next, enzymes called \u201crestriction endonucleases\u201d are applied to the DNA molecule to cut the DNA \u201czipper\u201d into fragments. The enzymes recognize a certain sequence of paired nucleotides, or \u201cteeth,\u201d and cut the DNA \u201czipper\u201d at the point of recognition. The resulting DNA fragments differ in length and number for every individual depending on how often the particular sequence of paired nucleotides recognized by the restriction enzyme appears in the DNA specimen.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Using a technique called \u201celectrophoresis,\u201d the DNA fragments are then grouped according to length on a sheet of electrically-charged gel. The electrophoresis procedure arranges the DNA fragments along parallel lines according to the length of the fragments. Once the fragments are arranged by length, a chemical procedure is used to pull apart each fragment of the DNA \u201czipper\u201d along the \u201cteeth\u201d. In other words, the paired chemical bases that form the \u201cteeth\u201d are \u201cunzipped\u201d or unpaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The \u201cunzipped\u201d fragments are then transferred from the electrically-charged gel to a nylon membrane. Next, DNA \u201cprobes\u201d tagged with radioactivity are applied to the fragments. A DNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>\u201cprobe\u201d is essentially half a DNA \u201czipper.\u201d The probe seeks out locations on the \u201cunzipped\u201d DNA fragments that have \u201cteeth\u201d that match the composition and sequence of the probe\u2019s \u201cteeth.\u201d Every probe is designed to search for different polymorphisms at different locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">To determine the statistical likelihood of random matches, each probe is tested on data bases of DNA samples obtained from a number of unrelated individuals. At the time of trial, the DNA data bases were maintained in three categories: Negro, Caucasian, and Hispanic. From this testing, the frequency with which the probe\u2019s matching DNA fragment occurs in a given population is determined. Using population genetics equations standardized in the early 1900\u2019s, the individual frequencies are combined to determine the statistical likelihood of the several different DNA fragments appearing in the same sample.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">When the radioactive probe finds an exact complementary base sequence, the probe binds to that location, causing radioactivity to accumulate at the bonding site. Any probe that has not bonded to its complementary base sequence is then washed off the nylon membrane. X-ray film exposed to the membrane shows the resulting bands of accumulated radioactivity. The pattern of bands is then compared with the pattern of bands obtained from printing the polymorphisms in the DNA of another individual or in another cell sample from the same individual. In a rape investigation, the DNA pattern of the semen samples collected from the crime scene or from the victim\u2019s body is compared with the DNA pattern of the alleged assailant\u2019s blood. If the semen sample and blood specimen are from the same person, the probes will bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>with DNA segments of identical lengths in identical positions, resulting in two identical patterns of bands.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">A sample of Spencer\u2019s blood and the semen stains found on the nightgown and the sleeping bag were forwarded to Lifecodes Corporation, a laboratory that performs DNA testing for forensic purposes. Employing this technique, scientists at the laboratory determined that the DNA extracted from the semen stains found on the victim\u2019s nightgown and on the sleeping bag matched the DNA extracted from Spencer\u2019s blood sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The parties stipulated that Spencer does not have an identical twin and that none of his blood relatives had committed the murder. Therefore, the chance that anyone other than Spencer produced the semen stains was one in 135 million. There are approximately 10 million adult black males in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Dr. Richard Roberts, assistant director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Dr. Kenneth Kidd, Professor of Human Genetics at Yale University, and Dr. Michael .Baird, Manager of Paternity and Forensic Testing at Lifecodes Corporation, were three of the expert witnesses at trial. The record shows that Dr. Roberts qualified as an expert in the field of molecular biology, and that Dr. Kidd qualified as an expert in the fields of molecular biology and human population genetics. Dr. Baird qualified as an expert in the fields of molecular biology and genetics. These witnesses testified that \u201cDNA printing\u201d is a reliable scientific technique that will not produce a \u201cfalse positive\u201d result if a sufficient number of probes are used.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They also testified that the testing procedure employed in the present case was conducted in a reliable manner. Moreover, the undisputed evidence established that the technique is generally accepted in the scientific community and is used in \u201c[s]everal thousands of laboratories\u201d around the world. Similarly, the undisputed evidence showed that the probes used in this case are reliable and used in \u201chundreds of laboratories throughout the world.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Indeed, Spencer acknowledges that the evidence establishes that the DNA tests are accepted \u201cas reliable within the scientific community\u201d and that he \u201cwas unable to find or produce one qualified expert to debunk either the theory of DNA printing or the statistics generated therefrom.\u201d While conceding, therefore, that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>trial court had little choice but to accept the DNA printing evidence,\u201d he contends, nonetheless, that we \u201cshould hold off until another day any decision that DNA printing is acceptable evidence in the courts of Virginia.\u201d We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Because the undisputed evidence supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that DNA testing is a reliable scientific technique and that the tests performed in the present case were properly conducted, we hold that the trial court did not err in admitting this evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Spencer contends that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence a photograph of the victim identified as \u201cCommonwealth\u2019s Exhibit 2s.\u201d He contends that the photograph \u201cadded nothing to [the jury\u2019s] consideration\u201d and was so inflammatory \u201cthat its admission tended toward a guilty verdict despite the other evidence.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">We repeatedly have held that the admission of photographs into evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. Bennett, 236 Va. at 471, 374 S.E.2d at 317-18; <em>Gray, </em>233 Va. at 342, 356 S.E.2d at 173 (compiling cases). \u201cPhotographs of a victim are relevant if they tend to show motive, intent, method, premeditation, malice, or the degree of atrociousness of the crime.\u201d <em>Gray, </em>233 Va. at 342-43, 356 S.E.2d at 173. If photographs accurately portray the scene created by an accused, they are not rendered inadmissible merely because they are gruesome or shocking. <em>Gray, </em>233 Va. at 343, 356 S.E.2d at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Exhibit 2s was relevant for a number of reasons. It depicted a close-up view of the neck ligature used by the accused. This method tended to prove motive, intent, malice, and premeditation. It demonstrated more graphically than a verbal description the brutality and atrociousness of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Additionally, the time of the murder was most relevant. The undisputed evidence established that Spencer left Arlington County on the Sunday following Thanksgiving, which was November 29. The victim\u2019s body was discovered on Tuesday, Decem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>ber 1. The medical examiner opined that the victim had died three to five days prior to the discovery of the body. Her opinion was directly related to the discoloration of the victim\u2019s skin. Exhibit 2s was the only photograph that showed the extreme discoloration of the victim\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Clearly, the photograph was relevant. We hold, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Exhibit 2s into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Code \u00a7 17-110.1 mandates that we review the death sentence on the record. In addition to considering the assigned errors in the trial, we must consider and determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">1. Whether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">2. Whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">In fixing Spencer\u2019s punishment at death, the jury found that both the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d and \u201cvileness\u201d predicates had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Spencer contends that \u201chis death sentence cannot stand the scrutiny of these criteria.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">On September 4, 1987, Spencer was released from prison to a \u201chalf-way\u201d house located in Richmond. As a resident at the \u201chalfway\u201d house, Spencer was still in the custody of the Department of Corrections. Forensic evidence presented during the penalty phase established that within 30 days of his release from prison, Spencer had raped and murdered two women in Richmond. The facts and circumstances of those rape-murders were strikingly similar to those in the present case. Both victims had been strangled to death in a mode similar to the strangulation of Tucker.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">Spencer was arrested by Arlington County Police at the \u201chalfway\u201d house in Richmond. When arrested, Spencer was found in possession of a large screwdriver, a knife, and a box of .25 caliber <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>ammunition. Additionally, Spencer has been convicted of six burglaries, three as a juvenile and three as an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">In the penalty phase of the trial, Spencer called seven witnesses, in addition to himself, who gave mitigating testimony. A community center director testified that Spencer \u201cwas a loner [who] didn\u2019t cause us no problem,\u201d and that he had never seen Spencer act aggressively.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">A supervisor of the \u201chalf-way\u201d house in Richmond stated that Spencer was \u201c[f]riendly, quiet,\u201d and did not have a reputation for violence. One of Spencer\u2019s junior high school teachers noted that, prior to 1975, when Spencer was his pupil, he had had little self-confidence and was \u201cpretty much alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Spencer\u2019s mother testified that Spencer had been a \u201cquiet\u201d child, a \u201cgood idd.\u201d Spencer denied killing Susan Tucker and the two women in Richmond and asked for any sentence except the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Unquestionably, the evidence of Spencer\u2019s conduct in committing the offense supports the jury\u2019s finding of the \u201cvileness\u201d predicate. The victim was naked, and she had been tied in such a position that any struggle by her would have hastened her strangulation. She was then raped, and finally, strangled to death. Evidence of such conduct is sufficient to support a finding of every factor of the vileness predicate. Thus, we hold that Spencer\u2019s \u201cconduct in committing the offense was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman, in that it involved torture, depravity of mind [and] aggravated battery to the victim.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">After considering all aggravating and mitigating factors, we also hold that the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that, based upon Spencer\u2019s past criminal record, prior history, and the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense charged, there is a probability that Spencer \u201cwould commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we find nothing in the record to suggest that the death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-110.1(E), we have accumulated the records of all capital murder cases reviewed by this court. After considering those records, we conclude that Spencer\u2019s sentence of death was not excessive or disproportionate to sentences generally imposed by other sentencing bodies in Virginia for compar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>able or similar crimes. <em>See, e.g., Hoke </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>237 Va. 303, 377 S.E.2d 595, <em>cert. </em>denied, 491 U.S. 303 (1989) (capital murder in the commission of robbery, abduction, and rape, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>237 Va. 126, 376 S.E.2d 288, <em>cert. denied, </em>492 U.S. __, 109 S.Ct. 3263 (1989) (capital murder in the commission of robbery, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>Gray, </em>233 Va. 313, 356 S.E.2d 157 (capital murder in the commission of robbery, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>Pruett, </em>232 Va. 266, 351 S.E.2d 1 (capital murder in the commission of rape and robbery, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>Edmonds </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 303, 329 S.E.2d 807, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 975 (1985) (capital murder in the commission of robbery, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 229 </em>Va. 469, 331 S.E.2d 422 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1099 (1986) (capital murder in the commission of robbery, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>Clozza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 124, 321 S.E.2d 273 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1230 (1985) (capital murder in the commission of rape, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>Coleman, </em>226 Va. 31, 307 S.E.2d 864 (capital murder in the commission of rape, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>Quintana </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 127, 295 S.E.2d 643 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1029 (1983) (capital murder in the commission of robbery, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>Clanton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 41, 286 S.E.2d 172 (1982) (capital murder in the commission of robbery, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>James Dyral Briley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 563, 273 S.E.2d 57 (1980) (capital murder in the commission of rape and robbery, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>Linwood Earl Briley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 532, 273 S.E.2d 48 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1031 (1981) (capital murder in the commission of robbery, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 1091, 254 S.E.2d 116, <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 919 (1979) (capital murder in the commission of rape, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>M.
