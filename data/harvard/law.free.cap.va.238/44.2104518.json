We answer that question in the affirmative and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Through the Education of the Handicapped Act, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401 to 1485 (1982 &amp; Supp. V 1987) as amended (the Act), Congress provides federal funds to assist state and local agencies in educating handicapped children, and conditions the funding upon compliance by a state with certain goals and procedures. The Act was an effort to promote the education of handicapped children and was passed in response to Congress\u2019 perception that a majority of handicapped children in the United States formerly were either excluded from schools or merely sitting in classrooms passing time until they were old enough to \u201cdrop out.\u201d <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 179 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">In order to qualify for federal funds under the Act, a state must demonstrate that it \u201chas in effect a policy that assures all handicapped children the right to a free appropriate public education.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(1). The \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d mandated by the Act is fashioned to the unique needs of the handicapped child by means of an \u201cindividualized educational program.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a)(18).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Responding to the Act, the General Assembly enacted a number of statutes implementing its requirements. Code \u00a7\u00a7 22.1-213 to -221. As pertinent to this case, the Virginia statutes provide that the State Board of Education shall prepare and supervise the implementation by each school division of a program of special education \u201cdesigned to educate and train handicapped children.\u201d \u00a7 22.1-214(A). \u201cThe program developed by the Board of Education shall be designed to ensure that all handicapped children have available to them a free and appropriate education, including special education designed to meet the reasonable educational needs of such children.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>The term \u201cspecial education,\u201d as defined by the Virginia statutes, means \u201cclassroom, home, hospital, institutional or other instruction, including physical education and vocational education, to meet the reasonable educational needs of handicapped children, transportation, and related services required or appropriate to assist handicapped children in taking advantage of, or responding to, educational programs and opportunities commensurate with their abilities.\u201d \u00a7 22.1-213(2). The statute further provides that the \u201cBoard of Education shall determine by regulation standards for determining which instruction and services must be provided pursuant to an individualized education program.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\">The Virginia statutes also provide that if a school division \u201cis unable to provide a free appropriate public education to a handicapped child and it is not appropriately available in a state facility, it shall offer to place the child in a nonsectarian private school for the handicapped approved by the Board of Education or such other licensing agency as may be designated by state law.\u201d \u00a7 22.1-218(A). The statute also provides that the \u201cschool board of such division shall pay to, or on behalf of, the parent or guardian of such child the reasonable tuition cost and other reasonable charges . . . <em>\"Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">The Virginia statutes incorporate certain procedural requirements. Section 22.1-214(B) requires the Board of Education to prescribe \u201cprocedures to afford due process to handicapped children and their parents or guardians and to school divisions in resolving disputes as to program placements, individualized education programs, tuition eligibility and other matters as defined in state or federal statutes or regulations.\u201d The statute also provides that any party aggrieved by the findings and decision made under the established procedures \u201cmay bring a civil action in the circuit court for the jurisdiction in which the school division is located.\u201d \u00a7 22.1-214(D). Significant to the present dispute, the statute also provides: \u201cIn any such action the court shall receive the records of the administrative proceedings, shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party, and basing its decision on the preponderance of the evidence, shall grant such relief as the court determines appropriate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The present proceeding stemmed from the development of an individualized education plan (IEP) for appellee Darren Scott Beasley, a student in the Campbell County Public Schools. Refusing to keep the child in the public schools, his parents removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>him from the county school system in 1983; enrolled him at Oakland School, a private institution located at Boyd Tavern; and filed for a due process hearing in an attempt to have appellant School Board of Campbell County pay for the private residential schooling. At the time, the child was 14 years of age and in the seventh grade. He suffered from a severe learning disability in the area of reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">In June 1984, a hearing officer appointed pursuant to statute and Board of Education regulations, conducted an administrative due process hearing. He considered testimonial and documentary evidence offered on behalf of the child and the school board, the parties being represented by counsel. In a July 1984 report, the hearing officer concluded that \u201cthe program proposed for Darren Beasley for the 1984-1985 school year by Campbell County Public Schools does not offer a free appropriate public education for this severely learning disabled child.\u201d The school board appealed this decision to a duly appointed reviewing officer. Upon consideration of the transcript of the testimony at the due process hearing, the exhibits and written briefs of counsel, the reviewing officer, in a January 1985 report, adopted the factual findings of the hearing officer and generally affirmed his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">In February 1985, the school board, pursuant to Code \u00a7 22.1-214(D), filed the present civil action in the Circuit Court of Campbell County naming the child, acting through his parents, as the respondent. In an amended petition, the school board asserted that it was aggrieved by the administrative decisions. The school board asked the circuit court, \u201cafter giving due consideration to the educational decisions made by the local school authorities,\u201d to find that the evidence does not preponderate that the child is entitled to reimbursement for the cost of private residential placement, and to find that it had offered the required free and appropriate education to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The circuit court, Honorable J. Samuel Johnston, Jr., Judge, presiding, reviewed the complete file on the matter, including the evidence presented to the hearing officer. No further testimony or other evidence was presented, but counsel made additional argument. In an April 1986 letter opinion, the circuit judge ruled in favor of the school board and determined that \u201cCampbell County has taken every reasonable step to provide Darren with a free appropriate public education and should not be required to fund his residential placement at Oakland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>The circuit court\u2019s judgment was appealed to the Court of Appeals, and a panel unanimously reversed the trial court in a May 1988 opinion. <em>Beasley </em>v. <em>School Board, </em>6 Va. App. 206, 367 S.E.2d 738 (1988). The school board\u2019s motion for a rehearing <em>en banc </em>was denied. We awarded the school board this appeal, determining that the decision of the Court of Appeals involves matters of significant precedential value. Code \u00a7 17.116.07(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\">In <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Rowley, </em>the Supreme Court considered the meaning of the requirement of a \u201cfree appropriate public education,\u201d noting that Congress sought in the Act to assist the states in discharging their responsibility under the United States Constitution to provide equal protection of the laws. 458 U.S. at 198. Interpreting provisions of the Act similar to those contained in the Virginia statutes, the Supreme Court said that \u201ca \u2018free appropriate public education\u2019 consists of educational instruction specially designed to meet the unique needs of the handicapped child, supported by such services as are necessary to permit the child \u2018to benefit\u2019 from the instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188-89. Such instruction and services must \u201cbe provided at public expense and under public supervision, meet the State\u2019s educational standards, approximate the grade levels used in the State\u2019s regular education, and comport with the child\u2019s IEP.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189. Therefore, the Supreme Court said, \u201cif personalized instruction is being provided with sufficient supportive services to permit the child to benefit from the instruction, and the other items on the definitional checklist are satisfied, the child is receiving a \u2018free appropriate public education\u2019 as defined by the Act.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">The Supreme Court noted, however, that Congress\u2019 primary aim was to make public education \u201cavailable\u201d to handicapped children. <em>Id. </em>at 192. The intent was \u201cmore to open the door of public education to handicapped children on appropriate terms than to guarantee any particular level of education once inside.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By specifying an \u201cappropriate\u201d education, Congress did not mean \u201ca potential-maximizing education.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197 n.21. Equal protection requires nothing more than \u201cequal access.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">But the education to which access is provided must be sufficient \u201cto confer <em>some </em>educational benefit upon the handicapped child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, the Court concluded that \u201cthe \u2018basic floor of opportunity\u2019 provided by the Act consists of access to specialized instruction and related services which are individu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>ally designed to provide educational benefit to the handicapped child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 22.1-213(2) and -214(A). In other words, a state satisfies the federal requirement to provide a handicapped child with a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d when it provides \u201cpersonalized instruction with sufficient support services to permit the child to benefit educationally from that instruction.\u201d <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 203. <em>Accord Martin </em>v. <em>School Board, </em>3 Va. App. 197, 206, 348 S.E.2d 857, 862 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Against this background, we examine further the procedural aspects of the present case. Looking first to the decisional standard to be applied by the circuit court, we find that the Court of Appeals properly recognized that the trial court was required to make an \u201cindependent decision\u201d based on the preponderance of the evidence. <em>Beasley, </em>6 Va. App. at 211, 367 S.E.2d at 741; <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The Court of Appeals also correctly stated the weight to be accorded by the trial court to the administrative findings under consideration. Review of an administrative decision by officers appointed under authority of the Board of Education concerning a special education program for a handicapped child is not subject to the Administrative Process Act (APA), but to the provisions of \u00a7 22.1-214(D). <em>Beasley, </em>6 Va. App. at 212, 367 S.E.2d at 741. As the Court of Appeals pointed out, the statute permits the court to hear additional evidence, to weigh the evidence as a whole, and to base its decision on a preponderance of the evidence. The trial court is not limited to determining, as under the APA, whether there is \u201csubstantial evidence in the agency record\u201d to support the administrative findings of fact. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17; <em>Virginia Real Estate Commission </em>v. <em>Bias, </em>226 Va. 264, 268-69, 308 S.E.2d 123, 125 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Therefore, the proper standard to be employed by the circuit court is \u201cto determine, based on a preponderance of the evidence, whether the substance of the proposed individualized educational program is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.\u201d <em>Beasley, </em>6 Va. App. at 212, 367 S.E.2d at 741. <em>Accord Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 206-07. But the provision that the circuit court base its decision on the preponderance of the evidence is not \u201can invitation to the courts to substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which they review.\u201d <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 206. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Due weight must be given by the trial court to the administrative proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\">Looking next to the decisional standard to be applied by the Court of Appeals, we conclude that review of a circuit court\u2019s decision by an appellate court in a case like this should be no different than in any other civil appeal. When a case is decided by a trial court sitting without a jury, the judgment below \u201cshall not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that such judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-680; <em>Martin, </em>3 Va. App. at 198-99, 348 S.E.2d at 858. The appellate court is not permitted to reweigh the evidence or to substitute its factual judgment for that of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Our examination of this record demonstrates that the Court of Appeals redetermined the facts in reversing the circuit court, and this was error. Indeed, the Court of Appeals said that \u201cour disagreement lies with the conclusion the circuit court reached based on the whole record before it.\u201d <em>Beasley, </em>6 Va. App. at 212, 367 S.E.2d at 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">As we scrutinize the trial court\u2019s decision and demonstrate that its judgment was not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it, we shall assume, without deciding, that the trial court properly ruled the burden of proof in inquiries concerning free appropriate public education lies with the school board. <em>Contra Bales </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>523 F. Supp. 1366 (E.D. Va. 1981) (burden of proof imposed on child\u2019s parents).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">As the trial judge noted, the sole substantive issue to be decided was whether the IEP devised in 1984 for this handicapped child and offered by Campbell County for the 1984-85 school year was \u201cdesigned and calculated to offer and provide educational benefits to the handicapped child.\u201d Responding to that question, the trial court said that the evidence led \u201cto the inescapable conclusion that Campbell County has complied with the dictates of the statutes and holding [s] of the cases and that the extant IEP was reasonably calculated and designed to provide the handicapped child with educational benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">A detailed recitation of the facts, many of which were conflicting, is unnecessary at this stage of the proceedings. We will summarize the evidence briefly, viewing it in the light most favorable to the school board, the prevailing party in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Darren was born in 1969. Commencing in May 1978, regular child study committee meetings were held concerning him because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>of his severe reading difficulty. Each year thereafter, committee meetings were held to compile annual lEPs appropriate for the child. The 1984 IEP committee was composed of a qualified special education instructor, a supervisor of the county special education program, the principal of Brookville Middle School which the child attended, the child\u2019s mother, and the child\u2019s attorney. All contributed to the development of the IEP for 1984-85, the IEP that the parents claim was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">At least six experts in the field of special education testified on behalf of the school board. Each witness was of opinion that the program offered the child was appropriate to his needs, that he had received benefit from the program, and would continue to benefit in the future if he were enrolled in the program. Indeed, during the due process hearing it was stipulated on behalf of the child and his parents \u201cthat the long term goals and short term goals that are in the IEP are adequate to address his current educational level and that program that\u2019s called for educationally is as well suited to Darren\u2019s needs as can be developed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Moreover, school board witnesses testified that the child \u201cwould progress at a smooth rate without gaps in the reading\u201d in the proposed program; that the child could make \u201cprogress and gains\u201d in the county schools; that his needs could be met in the county school system \u201cin an appropriate fashion\u201d; and that the County program was \u201cthe most appropriate placement for him,\u201d residential placement not being necessary for the child to make educational progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Furthermore, the evidence that the child had made progress and received benefits from his public education in the county included testimony that he had shown \u201cconsistent improvement\u201d in reading; that he had made \u201cconsistent progress that is comparable to other self-contained middle school youngsters\u201d; and that reading comprehension was an area of strength for the child while in the seventh grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Additionally, there was evidence from which the trial court properly could have concluded that the child\u2019s alleged lack of sufficient progress in reading was due to factors not related to a deficiency in the county educational program. Testimony showed that the child was late 90 percent of the time for his reading class, that he often appeared to lack motivation, and that he had difficulty at home responding to parental authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>In sum, there was abundant evidence to support the trial court\u2019s observation: \u201cI cannot imagine Campbell County being required to do more for a handicapped child such as Darren.\u201d At the very least, we cannot say that the circuit court\u2019s decision was plainly wrong or without evidence to support it, and the Court of Appeals erred in holding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\">For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals will be reversed and final judgment will be entered here in favor of the school board, adjudicating that it has offered the child a free appropriate public education as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
