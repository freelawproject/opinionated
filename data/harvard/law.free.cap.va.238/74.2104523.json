In deciding this question, we must apply Pennsylvania law.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Linda Jean Hunt\u2019s motion for judgment, as it relates to this appeal, sought a judgment declaring that under the terms of an insurance policy issued by Erie Insurance Exchange (Erie), she \u201cis entitled to coverage for unlimited medical and rehabilitation expenses.\u201d Erie defended on the ground that it had paid Hunt the full amount of the benefits due under the policy, which it alleged was $50,000 for medical and rehabilitative expenses. Following a bench trial, the trial court entered judgment in favor of Erie, and Hunt appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">On June 26, 1982, Hunt, a resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia, was seriously and permanently injured in an automobile accident that occurred in the State of Colorado. At the time, she was a passenger in an automobile operated by Ronald Rebottini and was insured under an insurance policy issued by Erie to Robert L. Rebottini, a resident of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">The parties agree that Pennsylvania law governs their rights as established under the insurance policy and that the policy incorporated the terms of the Pennsylvania No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, 40 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 1009.101 through 1009.701 (Purdon 1984) (the Act).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties also agree that Hunt is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u201celigible person\u201d as defined in the policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They disagree, however, over whether the medical expense benefits are unlimited, as Hunt contends, or whether the benefits are limited to $50,000, as Erie contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Five portions of the endorsement to the insurance policy are relevant to this appeal. First, the endorsement contains a \u201cBenefits Table\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which states that the \u201cnamed Insured and any relative . . . [and] all other eligible persons\u201d shall receive \u201c [unlimited\u201d medical expense benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Second, the endorsement states that \u201c[i]n accordance with the Pennsylvania No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, the ERIE will pay <em>any or all </em>personal injury protection benefits for: (a) medical expenses ... for bodily injury to an eligible person due to an accident resulting from the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle as a vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Third, under a subheading entitled \u201cLIMITS OF LIABILITY,\u201d the endorsement provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">Regardless of the number of persons insured, . . . the ERIE\u2019S liability for personal injury protection benefits with respect to bodily injury to any one eligible person in any one motor vehicle accident is limited:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">(b) for any other eligible person to the \u201cBasic Limits\u201d amounts shown on the Benefits Table which is on page 1 of this endorsement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">The \u201cBenefits Table\u201d referred to under \u201cLIMITS OF LIABILITY\u201d is the table previously mentioned, which states that the \u201cBasic Limits\u201d for medical expense benefits are \u201cUnlimited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Fourth, paragraph I of the endorsement\u2019s \u201cCONDITIONS\u201d provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>I. Applicable Law. Regardless of any other provisions of this endorsement, the personal injury protection coverage available to an eligible person . . . shall be in accordance with the Pennsylvania No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">With respect to nonresidents of Pennsylvania, the Act provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">(c) Applicable law.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">(1) The basic loss benefits available to any victim . . . shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of the state no-fault plan for motor vehicle insurance in effect in the state of domicile of the victim on the date when the motor vehicle accident resulting in injury occurs. If there is no such state no-fault plan in effect or if the victim is not domiciled in any state, then basic loss benefits available to any victim shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of the state no-fault plan for motor vehicle insurance, if any, in effect in the state in which the accident resulting in injury occurs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">40 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 1009.110(c)(1). Colorado\u2019s no-fault plan, as set forth in the Colorado Auto Accident Reparations Act, established a minimum no-fault coverage of $25,000 for medical expenses and $25,000 for rehabilitation expenses. Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 10-4-706(l)(b), -706(l)(c)(II) (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Fifth, Section II of the endorsement states in part that \u201c[t]he premiums for and the coverage of this policy conform to the Pennsylvania No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">Erie contends that when the policy and the Act are read together, no ambiguity exists. Erie focuses upon Condition I, which states that \u201c[rjegardless of any other provisions of this endorsement, the . . . coverage available to an eligible person . . . shall be in accordance with [the Act].\u201d Erie asserts that because Hunt was a nonresident of Pennsylvania when she was injured and the accident occurred in Colorado, the Act directs that the \u201cbasic loss benefits available to [her] shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of [Colorado\u2019s] no-fault plan for motor vehicle insurance.\u201d 40 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 1009.110(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">Hunt contends, however, that the policy provides for unlimited medical expense benefits for an eligible person, and if Condition I and the Act purport to limit her benefits, the policy is ambiguous. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Because the policy is ambiguous, Hunt asserts, the policy must be construed against the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">A contract of insurance is ambiguous if it'is susceptible of two meanings. <em>See Armon </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>369 Pa. 465, 468, 87 A.2d 302, 303 (1952). Under established Pennsylvania law, all ambiguous insurance policies will be construed against the insurer. <em>E.g., Standard Venetian Blind Co. </em>v. <em>American Empire Ins. Co., </em>503 Pa. 300, 305, 469 A.2d 563, 566 (1983); <em>Mohn </em>v. <em>American Casualty Co., </em>458 Pa. 576, 586, 326 A.2d 346, 351 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In the present case, the endorsement to the policy is susceptible of two meanings respecting Hunt\u2019s entitlement to medical expense benefits. The endorsement provides in three separate places that an \u201celigible person\u201d is entitled to unlimited benefits. A condition of the endorsement, however, purports to limit coverage. The condition references the Act. The Act, in turn, references the no-fault plan of the state in which the accident occurred, which, in this case, is Colorado. Thus, because an ambiguity exists, we must construe the policy \u201cin a light most strongly supporting the insured,\u201d <em>Mohn, </em>458 Pa. at 586, 326 A.2d at 351, <em>viz, </em>to provide unlimited medical benefits to Hunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">We have not found, nor have the parties cited, a Pennsylvania case on point. However, the conclusion we reach is supported by the holding in <em>Shishko </em>v. <em>State Farm Insurance Co., </em>553 F. Supp. 308 (E.D. Pa. 1982), <em>aff'd w/o pub\u2019d opinion, </em>722 F.2d 734 (3d Cir. 1983), a factually similar case applying Pennsylvania law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">In <em>Shishko, </em>a New York domiciliary was injured by an automobile insured by a Pennsylvania no-fault policy. The policy contained a schedule, virtually identical to the \u201cBenefits Table\u201d in the present case, that appeared to offer Shishko unlimited benefits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>However, another policy provision, incorporating Pennsylvania\u2019s no-fault statute, purported to limit Shishko\u2019s medical benefits to $50,000\u2014the amount allegedly recoverable under New York\u2019s no-fault insurance statute. In holding that Shishko was entitled to unlimited medical expense benefits, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\">While the language of a contract should not be tortured to create an ambiguity where none exists ... the apparent difference between the demands of the statute and the provisions of the policy clearly does create an ambiguity. That ambiguity must be construed against [the insurer].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-12\"> The Act is no longer in effect, having been repealed by the Pennsylvania legislature. <em>See </em>75 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 1701 (Purdon 1984); Act of February 12, 1984, P.L. 26, No. 11, \u00a7 8(c), effective October 1, 1984.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b120-11\"> The policy defines an \u201celigible person\u201d as:</p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">(a) the named Insured or any relative who sustains injury while occupying, or as a pedestrian struck by, any motor vehicle;</p>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">(b) any other person who sustains injury while occupying, or as a pedestrian struck by, the insured motor vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b120-14\"> A copy of the \u201cBenefits Table\u201d is set forth in the appendix to this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b122-8\"> Erie strongly relies upon <em>Swezey </em>v. <em>Home Indemnity Co., </em>571 F. Supp. 224 (D. Del. 1983), <em>on remand from Swezey </em>v. <em>Home Indemnity Co., </em>691 F.2d 163 (3d Cir. 1982), <em>vacating Swezey </em>v. <em>Home Indemnity Co., </em>529 F. Supp. 608 (D. Del. 1982). <em>Swezey, </em>however, is inapposite. There, the plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident that occurred in the State of Delaware. The plaintiff claimed basic medical benefits under the Pennsylvania Act. The policy provided that the insurer would pay \u201cany or all\u201d medical expense benefits \u201c[i]n accordance with the [Pennsylvania Act].\u201d The court held that the Act was. incorporated into the policy, and therefore, the coverage limits of the Delaware no-fault statute applied. 571 F. Supp. at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\"><em>Swezey, </em>is distinguishable from the present case in two particulars. First, unlike Erie\u2019s policy, the policy in <em>Swezey </em>contained no \u201cBenefits Table\u201d providing for unlimited benefits. Second, nothing suggests that a claim of ambiguity was made in <em>Swezey.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
