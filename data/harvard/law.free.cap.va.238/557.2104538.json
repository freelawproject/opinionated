Slate told his nephew-in-law, Edward B. Titmus, where Titmus could find Slate\u2019s will if anything happened to Slate. Slate died on December 25, 1987. Several days later, Titmus found a sealed envelope at the place Slate had described. On the front of the envelope, in Slate\u2019s handwriting, was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-13\">Will of Garland B. Slate</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqO\">Atten: Edward B. Titmus</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-14\">Within the envelope was a document, entirely in Slate\u2019s handwriting, that reads as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-15\">I, Garland B. Slate, Route 3-Box 456 Petersburg, Va. do hereby declare this to be my last will and testament.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>I. I give and devise and bequeath to Edward B. Titmus all of my estate, both real and personal where ever situated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-4\">II. I appoint Edward B. Titmus the executor of this my last will and testament, and desire that no security be required of him as such.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">Given under my hand this 25th day of October 1986.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Titmus first offered the writing for probate as Slate\u2019s will before the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Dinwiddie County. The Clerk declined to probate the instrument, opining that the court should make the decision whether the writing was a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Titmus thereafter initiated a probate proceeding by convening all of Slate\u2019s heirs-at-law. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 64.1-80 to -84. The trial court ordered probate of the writing as Slate\u2019s \u201ctrue last will and testament,\u201d and Slate\u2019s heirs-at-law appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Limiting its consideration to the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the document, the trial court stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">Mr. Slate\u2019s signature in the exordium . . . stating that this is \u201cto be my last will and testament\u201d combined with the final words, \u201cGiven under my hand this 25th day of October 1986\u201d, clearly show that the instrument was signed \u201cin such a manner as to make it manifest that the name is intended as a signature . . .\u201d, Code 64.1-49. Mr. Slate makes a full and unequivocal disposition of his entire estate which in no way lacks finality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">Code \u00a7 64.1-49 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[n]o will shall be valid unless it be . . . signed by the testator ... in such manner as to make it manifest that the name is intended as a signature.\u201d This provision has remained unchanged since the General Assembly first enacted the statute in 1850.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">Significantly, the statute does not specify where the signature shall be placed in the writing. While placing one\u2019s name at the end of the instrument may be the best and clearest way of signing a will, we have said repeatedly that the signature does not necessarily have to appear at the foot or end of the writing. <em>See, e.g., Payne </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>210 Va. 514, 517, 171 S.E.2d 826, 828 (1970); <em>Hall v. Brigstocke, </em>190 Va. 459, 466, 58 S.E.2d 529, 533 (1950); <em>McElroy </em>v. <em>Rolston, </em>184 Va. 77, 83, 34 S.E.2d 241, 243 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>(1945); <em>Hamlet </em>v. <em>Hamlet, </em>183 Va. 453, 461, 32 S.E.2d 729, 732 (1945); <em>Dinning </em>v. <em>Dinning, </em>102 Va. 467, 469, 46 S.E. 473, 473-74 (1904); <em>Warwick </em>v. <em>Warwick, </em>86 Va. 596, 602-03, 10 S.E. 843, 845 (1890); <em>Ramsey </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 664, 670 (1857).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">To meet the statute\u2019s requirement, however, it must appear unequivocally from the face of the writing that the person who writes his name therein intends it as his signature. <em>Payne, </em>210 Va. at 517, 171 S.E.2d at 828. Indeed, in <em>Ramsey, </em>the first case in which we construed the statute, we said that the statute \u201crecognizes no will as sufficiently signed unless it appears affirmatively from the position of the signature, as at the foot or end, or from some other internal evidence equally convincing, that the testator designed by the use of the signature to authenticate the instrument.\u201d 54 Va. at 670; <em>accord Warwick, </em>86 Va. at 601, 10 S.E. at 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Slate\u2019s heirs-at-law primarily rely upon <em>Payne, McElroy, Hamlet, Warwick, </em>and <em>Ramsey </em>for the proposition that Slate\u2019s writing is not a valid will. The writings at issue in each of these cases, however, clearly lacked sufficient internal evidence to manifest that the testator intended his name as his signature. Moreover, most were incomplete and lacked the finality required of a valid will.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The writing in the present case, however, is more akin to those in <em>Hall </em>and <em>Dinning. </em>In <em>Hall, </em>the holograph in question began:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">Roberta Leckie Rittenhouse</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMI\">Written by myself October 13th 1946</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adt\">My Will</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">190 Va. at 463, 58 S.E.2d at 531. After five pecuniary gifts, two specific bequests, and a residuary clause, the holograph concluded, \u201cThis is My last Will and Testament[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464, 58 S.E.2d at 531. In upholding the writing as a valid will, we stated that the writing itself showed the finality of the instrument and the testatrix\u2019s intent to make a will. <em>Id. </em>at 466, 58 S.E.2d at 533. We noted that the instrument was a complete document, disposing of the entire estate and containing no blanks. Finally, we said that the language of the will clearly showed that the name at the top was intended as testatrix\u2019s signature. The last sentence of the will, when considered with the first three lines, showed the manifest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>intent of the testatrix that her name serve as her signature. <em>Id. </em>at 466-67, 58 S.E.2d at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">In <em>Dinning, </em>the holograph offered for probate as the will of William Dinning began with language naming an executor and directing payment of debts. After an orderly and complete disposition of testator\u2019s property, the will concluded, \u201cI, William Dinning, say this is my last will and testament.\u201d 102 Va. at 468, 46 S.E. at 473. In reversing the trial court\u2019s denial of probate, we held that the eight words following the signature constituted an \u201cemphatic declaration\u201d that the signature was intended to authenticate all that preceded it. <em>Id. </em>at 470, 46 S.E. at 474. It served as the final consummation of the testator\u2019s purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The purported will in the present case is a complete document; it disposes of Slate\u2019s entire estate and contains no blanks. The writing itself shows the finality of the instrument and Slate\u2019s intention to make a will. Slate\u2019s will begins, \u201cI, Garland B. Slate, . . . do hereby declare this to be my last will and testament.\u201d After disposing of his entire estate, Slate wrote, \u201cGiven under my hand this 25th day of October 1986.\u201d One definition of \u201chand\u201d is \u201c[a] person\u2019s signature.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 644 (5th ed. 1979). Moreover, the phrase, \u201cunder the hand of,\u201d means \u201cauthenticated by the . . . signature of.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1026 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">From a reading of the instrument as a whole, and paying particular attention to the phrase, \u201cGiven under my hand,\u201d we conclude that Slate intended his name, as written in the exordium clause, to be his sigfiature to the will. By using the phrase, Slate adopted his name in the exordium clause as his signature, thereby authenticating all that followed it. Indeed, the phrase is just such \u201cinternal evidence\u201d as was contemplated in <em>Ramsey </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Accordingly, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b605-9\">Justice Lacy,</author>\n<p id=\"ARH\">with whom Chief Justice Carrico joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">There is no question that the author of the writing at issue intended it as his will. It is a complete document, disposing of the author\u2019s entire estate and shows the finality of the instrument. The only ingredient needed to transform a writing with these characteristics into a valid will is the name of the author appearing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>such a manner \u201cas to make it manifest that the name is intended as a signature.\u201d Code \u00a7 64.1-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">We must therefore determine the intent of the author when he wrote his name. The majority gleaned this intent from the authors of dictionaries, rather than from the normal and common understanding more probably used by the author of this writing. Under a plain reading of the document, I can only conclude that the author\u2019s name as it appeared in the document, \u201cI, Garland B. Slate, Route 3-Box 456 Petersburg, Va.\u201d was used to identify himself as the testator in the declarant clause. Similarly, the closing phrase \u201cGiven under my hand\u201d, implies that the writer actually wrote the document, a. phrase of particular significance in a holographic will. The fact that the phrase may be defined as \u201cauthenticated by signature\u201d without more, does not indicate that a person\u2019s name written in the preceding lines was that authenticating signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Furthermore, I am unable to distinguish this case from the <em>Warwick </em>and <em>Ramsey </em>cases cited by the majority. The majority has moved from \u201cthe manifest intent of the writer\u201d to \u201cunder any construction or circumstances\u201d, as the test under \u00a7 64.1-49 for determining the .existence of a signature and, therefore, a valid will. I therefore, must respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
