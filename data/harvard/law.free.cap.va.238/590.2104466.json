In March 1982, Hatsey Lannon, also known as Harriet H. Lannon, owned a home in Henrico County against which Lee Conner Realty Corporation (Conner) filed a bill to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien. The case remained on the trial court\u2019s docket until April 30, 1987 when a final decree was entered enforcing the lien. A necessary change of commissioners in chancery was a major cause of the delay. In May 1982, the cause was referred to a commissioner in chancery. He heard all the evidence in the case at a series of hearings in 1982 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>1983, but never filed a report. In 1984, the commissioner wrote to the court, requesting that he be relieved of the case because of illness. In October 1984, the court referred the cause to a second commissioner in chancery. The second commissioner filed his report on September 11, 1986. The defendant, Mrs. Lannon, made six changes of counsel while the case was pending in the circuit court. She attended one commissioner\u2019s hearing without counsel, and argued the case <em>pro se. </em>She made a seventh change of counsel while the case was pending in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">When the second commissioner filed his report on September 11, 1986, the parties had ten days in which to file their exceptions unless the court extended the time \u201cfor good cause shown.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-615. Conner filed exceptions within the ten-day period and the chancellor set them for argument on December 5, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">At the time the commissioner filed his report, Mrs. Lannon was represented by an attorney who had, a few days earlier, received notification that his license to practice law was suspended, effective November 1, 1986, as the result of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pickus </em>v. <em>Virginia State Bar, </em>232 Va. 5, 348 S.E.2d 202 (1986). There is no evidence that Mrs. Lannon was aware of her attorney\u2019s difficulties. He failed to give her prompt notice of the filing of the commissioner\u2019s report and she did not receive a copy of the report until September 19, one day before expiration of the deadline for filing exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Mrs. Lannon employed new counsel on September 22. He filed a praecipe noting his appearance on September 23, and filed a notice with the court on September 24, requesting an extension of time for the filing of exceptions. On October 2, Mrs. Lannon\u2019s new counsel filed a formal motion for an extension of time until October 10 for the filing of exceptions, noting that he would need several days to complete a review of the transcript, which was over 1500 pages in length. On October 3, the chancellor heard this motion, denied it, and continued the case to December 5 for hearing on the exceptions filed by Conner. In denying Mrs. Lannon\u2019s motion for an extension of time, the chancellor expressed the view that she had failed to act \u201cin good faith throughout the case\u201d and that her frequent changes of counsel had caused \u201ca great deal of expense and undue litigation for a mechanic\u2019s lien case.\u201d On October 10, Mrs. Lannon\u2019s new counsel lodged her exceptions with the clerk, but the chancellor refused to consider them at the hearing on December 5 because they were untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>The chancellor sustained some of Conner\u2019s exceptions, denied others, and, in April 1987, issued a letter opinion confirming the commissioner\u2019s report as modified by the sustained exceptions. The chancellor also taxed most of the costs against Mrs. Lannon and ordered her to pay a $1,500 attorney\u2019s fee to Conner\u2019s counsel because of her \u201cwanton and oppressive conduct\u201d in requiring Conner to attend \u201ca number of hearings for the sole purpose of replacing counsel at different stages of the case.\u201d We granted Mrs. Lannon an appeal limited to the two issues mentioned above.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Mrs. Lannon argues on appeal that the court abused its discretion in denying her motion for an extension of time because the circumstances making an extension necessary were beyond her control. She further argues that the case would lie \u201cdormant\u201d until December 5 when Conner\u2019s exceptions could be heard, thus eliminating any possibility of prejudice to Conner. Conner contends that the denial was well within the court\u2019s discretion because of Mrs. Lannon\u2019s repeated changes of counsel and past dilatory tactics.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">We agree with Mrs. Lannon. A review of the record indicates that although her changes of counsel contributed in some part to the glacial pace of the proceedings, they were by no means the sole cause of delay. As indicated above, the necessity of replacing the original commissioner in chancery contributed to a delay of four years and four months between reference and report. The second commissioner, who heard no additional evidence, retained the case for nearly two years. Conner delayed filing its brief for almost eight months after the evidence was concluded. Mrs. Lannon was erroneously charged with sole responsibility for these delays.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Further, the extremity in which Mrs. Lannon found herself in September 1986 was not part of a continuum, as the chancellor considered it to be. She was evidently unaware that her then counsel had been notified of the suspension of his license. No doubt because of her counsel\u2019s difficulties, she became aware that the commissioner\u2019s report had been filed, and that she had only ten days in which to respond to it, after nine of those days had passed. Her counsel made no effort to advise or assist her. She consulted new counsel promptly and he made prompt efforts to secure an extension. Her prior changes of counsel were entirely unrelated to this difficulty and did not contribute to it in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>We further agree that in the circumstances an extension of time could not have prejudiced Conner\u2019s interests. Mrs. Lannon\u2019s new counsel asked only for an extension until October 10. The case was continued until December 5 for hearing on Conner\u2019s exceptions and no decree could be entered until they were ruled upon. Thus, the extension would have interposed no additional delay. If it had been granted, Conner\u2019s counsel would still have had seven weeks in which to prepare his opposition to Mrs. Lannon\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1 became effective July 1, 1987. It provides authority for a court to order sanctions, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, against parties and attorneys who file pleadings or make motions \u201cfor any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1 (Cum. Supp. 1989). The court\u2019s ruling assessing attorneys\u2019 fees against Mrs. Lannon was made before the statute became effective. Recognizing an absence of Virginia authority for such an award, the chancellor relied on a federal bankruptcy case, <em>In re Randolph, </em>28 Bankr. 811 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1983), which held that despite the traditional \u201cAmerican rule,\u201d the prevailing party may recover attorneys\u2019 fees from the losing party when the latter has \u201cacted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly or for oppressive reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Notwithstanding federal decisions to the foregoing effect, which rest upon the inherent powers of the court, we have consistently adhered to the \u201cAmerican rule\u201d: ordinarily, attorneys\u2019 fees are not recoverable by a prevailing litigant in the absence of a specific contractual or statutory provision to the contrary. <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Basic Industries, </em>233 Va. 485, 490, 357 S.E.2d 514, 517 (1987). Because that was the rule in effect at the time of entry of the final decree, the chancellor erred in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Accordingly, we will vacate the award of attorneys\u2019 fees, reverse the decree, and remand the cause for hearing on the exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s report filed on behalf of Mrs. Lannon and lodged with the clerk of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
