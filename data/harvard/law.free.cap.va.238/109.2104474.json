We must determine whether that conveyance, by operation of law, destroyed the creditor\u2019s lien position, leaving the property vulnerable to the claims of other creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">The facts are stipulated. David E. Laird, Jr., and his wife (collectively, Laird) owned a tract of unimproved land in Hanover County. On October 1, 1981, they entered into a written commercial lease, demising the land to Pocono Nurseries, Inc. (Pocono). Pocono occupied the land and conducted a nursery business thereon, erecting greenhouses and other facilities. Edward M. Ciejek (Ciejek) lent business capital to Pocono, secured by a security agreement dated August 1, 1982, which gave Ciejek a lien upon the greenhouses and other property which Pocono had at the nursery. In 1983, Ciejek perfected his security interest by filing a financing statement with the Clerk of the State Corporation Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>mission and with the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Hanover County.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Pocono suffered financial reverses, defaulted on Ciejek\u2019s loan and other obligations, and filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in 1984. On December 11, 1984, the bankruptcy court entered an order rejecting the lease between Pocono and Laird as an asset of the bankrupt\u2019s estate. The order directed Pocono to surrender possession of the land to Laird. Pocono complied, vacating the land but leaving behind the greenhouses and other property covered by Ciejek\u2019s security interest. At the time, the statutory bankruptcy stay prevented Ciejek from enforcing his security interest upon Pocono\u2019s assets remaining on Laird\u2019s land.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">In 1986, Ciejek obtained a release of the bankruptcy stay. On August 26, 1986, Pocono entered into a written agreement with three of its secured creditors, one of whom was Ciejek, transferring to each creditor title to the property covered by that creditor\u2019s respective security interest, \u201cto avoid foreclosure or similar proceedings to enforce said liens.\u201d The creditors agreed to \u201caccept said items to be applied to the satisfaction of the outstanding loans to Pocono.\u201d Pocono agreed that the transfers were not given as preferences, but were given only to avoid foreclosure. Pocono also agreed that in the event the proceeds of sale of the property should exceed the amount of the liens thereon, the surplus would be paid to Pocono\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy. The agreement also contains the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">8. All parties hereto do waive any and all claims relating to the aforesaid liens and security agreements which they may have against any other party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Ciejek did not release his security agreement or financing statements. He made demand upon Laird for the greenhouses and other items left on the site by Pocono, referring to language in Pocono\u2019s lease which provided that any improvements installed on the land during the term of the lease would remain Pocono\u2019s property and that Pocono might remove the same \u201cat any time.\u201d Laird, citing other lease language which provided that Pocono \u201cshall not charge Landlord for any . . . property left by Tenant on the property upon termination of this lease,\u201d refused to surrender the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Ciejek filed a bill of complaint in 1987, praying for a mandatory injunction to permit his entry onto the land to remove the property, or alternatively, damages for the property\u2019s value and rental value during the time of its detention. Laird filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that the agreement of August 26, 1986, had caused Ciejek\u2019s security interest to merge into his ownership, that Ciejek\u2019s lien position was thus lost, that Pocono had relinquished its interest in the property by executing the agreement, that the lease had been effectively terminated by the action of the bankruptcy court, and that all property left on the land after termination passed to Laird by the terms of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">No evidence was taken. The court granted Laird\u2019s motion for summary judgment by order entered July 20, 1987, and we granted Ciejek an appeal. The dispositive question is whether Ciejek\u2019s security interest merged into his title, vitiating his lien position <em>vis-a-vis </em>Laird.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Professor Glenn, discussing the doctrine of merger in equity, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">[Mjerger of interest, in a technical sense, has a very narrow place here. The point is that merger is a technical rule at best, and so, even though two rights become united in one person, a court of equity will keep them separated if that is required by the outstanding claim of a third party or is necessary in view of the proprietor\u2019s own situation. This is often described as a matter of intention, but in reality it is a \u201crule of law,\u201d that is, it is a principle that guides our courts of equity when the facts are clear. Perhaps Sir George Jessel put it as well as can be when he said \u201cIf there is no reason for keeping it [the outstanding interest, now acquired], then equity will, in the absence of any declaration of his intention, destroy it; but if there is any reason for keeping it alive, such as the existence of another encumbrance, equity will not destroy it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">1 G. Glenn, Mortgages, Deeds of Trust, and Other Security Devices As To Land \u00a7 45.2 (1943) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"ADp\">Our decisions are to similar effect. When a creditor takes title to the property which secures his debt, merger is not automatic, but depends upon the intention of the parties. In <em>Joyner </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>Graybeal, </em>204 Va. 543, 545, 132 S.E.2d 467, 469 (1963), we said: \u201cWhen one acquires absolute title to property which secures his debt, <em>in the absence of evidence showing a contrary intention </em>it is presumed that he intended to merge his secured interest into the legal title acquired\u201d (emphasis added). In that case, we held that a merger had occurred, eliminating the creditor\u2019s security position because the creditor had shown a clear intention to extinguish his lien by making a written notation, after the transfer of title to him, that the property was subject to no liens. <em>Id. </em>at 545-46, 132 S.E.2d at 469. We based our ruling on the factual finding that there was \u201cno evidence to rebut the presumption [of merger].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546, 132 S.E.2d at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">More recently, in <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Templeton, </em>229 Va. 380, 385, 329 S.E.2d 6, 9 (1985), we held, citing <em>Joyner: </em>\u201cThe acceptance of title in satisfaction of a preexisting security interest is presumed, <em>in the absence of evidence of a contrary intention, </em>to constitute a merger of the original secured interest into the legal title acquired.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the intention of the parties is controlling, creating an issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Summary judgment has been available in equity since 1983, but in equity as at law, it is not to be entered if \u201cany material fact is genuinely in dispute.\u201d Rule 2:21. The factual dispute with respect to the intention of the parties to the August 26, 1986 agreement is not resolved by the language of paragraph 8, quoted above. In that paragraph, the parties to the agreement expressly waive any security interests \u201cwhich they may have against any other <em>party.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In our view, that language may only be fairly construed as a waiver of lien claims by the parties to the agreement <em>inter se, </em>not as a waiver in favor of non-parties. Laird was, of course, not a party. The debtor and the three lien creditors who were parties to the agreement were attempting to make an arrangement for their mutual benefit, not for the benefit of those who might have adverse interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In addition to the question of the intention of the parties to the August 26, 1986 agreement, with respect to merger, other issues of material fact remain in dispute. The provisions of the lease between Laird and Pocono are ambiguous \u2014 susceptible of two or more interpretations concerning the landlord\u2019s right to acquire trade fixtures remaining on the land at the termination of the lease. Parol evidence, if available, may be admissible to resolve the ambiguity. The question whether the property was voluntarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>abandoned is also an issue of fact. Accordingly, we conclude that the court erred in entering summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">We will reverse the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
