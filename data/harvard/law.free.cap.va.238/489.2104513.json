Noel Clinard (Thomas G. Slater, Jr.; Barbara O. Bruckman; Charles H. Carrathers, III; Donnell J. McCormack, Jr.; Lewis S. Minter; Stewart E. Farrar; Anthony Gambardella; Joel H. Peck; Hunton &amp; Williams, </em>on briefs), for appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b534-7\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">In this appeal of right, we consider whether the State Corporation Commission correctly determined, under Code \u00a7 13.1-564 of the Retail Franchising Act (the Act), that a franchisor may terminate a franchise agreement of limited duration without establishing statutory \u201creasonable cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">Appellant Betsy-Len Motor Hotel Corporation, the franchisee, and appellee Holiday Inns, Inc., the franchisor, executed a license agreement dated December 21, 1978, in connection with the operation of a Holiday Inn hotel in Danville. The agreement was the renewal of an original 1958 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">Pertinent to this controversy, the 1978 agreement in question provided: \u201cEffective December 18, 1988, either party may terminate this license agreement by giving nine (9) months prior written notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">Code \u00a7 13.1-564 provides: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for a franchisor to cancel a franchise without reasonable cause or to use undue influence to induce a franchisee to surrender any right given to him by any provision contained in the franchise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">In August 1988, the franchisee filed a petition with the Commission asserting that the franchisor had given written notice on March 18, 1988 of termination of the agreement effective December 18, 1988. The franchisee alleged that the franchisor\u2019s action was taken without any reasonable cause and thus violated the foregoing statute. The franchisee asked the Commission to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>mine the reasonableness of the franchisor\u2019s action and to enjoin it from terminating the agreement without reasonable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\">The Commission did not conduct an evidentiary hearing; it considered oral and written argument of counsel and received numerous documents tendered by the franchisor purporting to demonstrate the parties\u2019 understanding about the term of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">The Commission ruled, stating it \u201cdeliberately ignore [d]\u201d the documents, that termination of the agreement in conformity with its specific language would not be a violation of \u00a7 13.1-564. The franchisee attacks this ruling on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The Commission also decided that the franchisor\u2019s attempted termination by notice furnished prior to December 18, 1988 did not comply with the agreement. Viewing the termination language as clear and unambiguous, the Commission said that the adverbial clause, \u201cEffective December 18, 1988,\u201d modifies the remainder of the sentence. Thus, the Commission ruled, the rights given both parties to deliver a termination notice did not arise until December 18, 1988. Accordingly, the Commission found that the franchisor\u2019s action taken prior to December 18, 1988 to terminate the agreement was unlawful under \u00a7 13.1-564 and enjoined the franchisor from violating that portion of the agreement. The franchisor does not challenge this ruling. In fact, counsel advise us that the termination notice was reissued in January 1989 and that the parties have agreed to extend the period of that notice through the date of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">On appeal, the franchisee states that the agreement provides that either party can terminate it upon nine months\u2019 written notice given on or after December 18, 1988. This provision, the franchisee argues, purports to allow the franchisor \u201cto cancel the Agreement for any reason, or for no reason at all,\u201d and thus is of \u201cno effect from the Agreement\u2019s inception to the extent it would allow a cancellation by Holiday Inns without reasonable cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">In addition, the franchisee points to what it labels the Act\u2019s \u201canti-waiver\u201d provision. Code \u00a7 13.1-571(c) provides: \u201cAny condition, stipulation or provision binding any person to waive compliance with any provision of this chapter . . . shall be void. . . .\u201d Contending that the statute\u2019s purpose \u201cis to ensure that the protections of the Act can never be bargained away,\u201d the franchisee asserts that the Commission has \u201ccreated a loophole through which franchisors can cancel franchise agreements arbitrarily and capriciously, contrary to the express language of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>We do not agree with either of the franchisee\u2019s contentions. Neither statute relied upon by the franchisee is applicable under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\">As we recently have noted, the Act is designed \u201cto equalize the balance of power between franchisors and franchisees,\u201d <em>Crone </em>v. <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc., </em>238 Va. 248, 254, 384 S.E.2d 77, 80 (1989), and requires franchisors \u201cto deal fairly with their franchisees with reference to all aspects of the franchise relationship.\u201d Code \u00a7 13.1-558. Nevertheless, the Act does not proscribe the parties to a franchise from, as here, agreeing that it shall be in force for a limited duration and that it shall extend for an identifiable period of time, where there is no claim of duress or mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">As the Commission noted, the Act was intended to prevent the unfair, arbitrary, and capricious abrogation of a franchise agreement before the end of an identifiable period of time to which the parties agreed at the inception of the agreement. The Act does not, however, require renewal or extension of a franchise after it lawfully terminates according to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Under the present agreement, in clear language, the franchisor (as well as the franchisee) was given an unqualified right to terminate the agreement at the end of the ten-year period. Like the Commission, we conclude that the act of giving notice in strict conformity with the agreement \u201cis not the sort of mischief that Code \u00a7 13.1-564 was intended to prohibit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Consequently, the Commission\u2019s December 1988 final order will be</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
