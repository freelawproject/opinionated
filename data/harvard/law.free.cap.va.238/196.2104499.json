VanFossen Lane is a private road which provides access to the Fenco facilities as well as other businesses located on the VanFossen property along the lane. On the morning of March 11, Painter, after checking in for work, was struck by a car while walking north on VanFossen Lane from one of Fenco\u2019s buildings to another. The car was driven by Simmons, who was on his way to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">Painter applied for and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits through Fenco. He also filed this negligence action against Simmons. The trial court sustained Simmons\u2019 plea in bar, holding that Painter\u2019s exclusive remedy was the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. We now consider Painter\u2019s appeal of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">If the acts which gave rise to Painter\u2019s injury \u201carose out of\u201d and \u201cin the course of\u201d Simmons\u2019 employment with Fenco, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is Painter\u2019s exclusive remedy. If such acts did not \u201carise out of \u201d and \u201cin the course of \u201d Simmons\u2019 employment with Fenco, Simmons is an \u201cother party\u201d under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and Painter may maintain a separate action for negligence against him. Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.1-40, 65.1-41, 65.1-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>209 Va. 562, 165 S.E.2d 394 (1969), we held that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was the exclusive remedy for an employee injured by a fellow employee on a private road or passageway on the business premises which separated buildings of the employer and was adjacent to the parking lot. Although neither employee was \u201con the job\u201d at the time of the accident, one employee was leaving work and the other was arriving at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Recently, we again held that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was the exclusive remedy of an employee injured by a fellow employee when both employees had terminated their work day and were leaving a privately owned parking lot where spaces were allocated to their employer. <em>Barnes </em>v. Stokes, 233 Va. 249, 252-53, 355 S.E.2d 330, 331-32 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Painter refers to the above cases as \u201cparking lot\u201d cases, significant because they provide a clear demarcation for the applicability of the Act in these types of cases. Painter argues that extending application of the Act beyond the boundaries of the parking lot will lead to the unmanageable and undesirable results of a \u201creasonable distance\u201d standard. <em>See </em>1 Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 15.12.(a) (1952) (characterizing the \u201creasonable distance\u201d standard, as traditionally applied, as a \u201cwidely-varying subjective standard\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In making this argument, Painter fails to consider the rationale we consistently have utilized to determine whether the Act applied. Merely being in a parking lot utilized by employees is not enough to impose coverage of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>See Fouts </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>219 Va. 666, 250 S.E.2d 746 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In both <em>Brown </em>and <em>Barnes, </em>we relied on the rationale of <em>Bountiful Brick Co. </em>v. <em>Giles, </em>276 U.S. 154 (1928), to determine whether the accidents arose out of and in the course of the employment. In determining whether death benefits were available under the Utah Compensation Act, the United States Supreme Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">[An employee\u2019s] employment includes not only the actual doing of the work, but a <em>reasonable margin of time and space </em>necessary to be used in passing to and from the place where the work is to be done. If the employee be injured while passing, with the express or implied consent of the employer, to or from his work by a way over the employer\u2019s premises, <em>or over those of another in such proximity and relation as to be in practical effect a part of the employer\u2019s premises, </em>the injury is one arising out of and in the course of the employment as much as though it had happened while the employee was engaged in his work at the place of its performance. In other words, the <em>employment may begin in point of time before the work is entered upon and in point of space before the place where the work is to be done is reached.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 158 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">In <em>Bountiful Brick, </em>a brickyard employee was killed on his way to work when crossing railroad tracks adjacent to the brickyard. The railroad company\u2019s right of way was fenced, but employees of the brickyard entered the right of way from the east fence, crossed the tracks, exited through a gap in the fence, and proceeded to the north entrance of the brickyard. Additional methods of entering the brickyard were available to the employees including a public road crossing the railroad tracks as well as brickyard entrances on the north and west sides of the yard. Based on an analysis of the time and situs of the accident, coverage was permitted under the Utah Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The accident in the instant case occurred at a place and time where Fenco expected both Painter and Simmons to be for employment purposes. VanFossen Lane is an acknowledged route of egress and ingress to and between the employer\u2019s facilities. Simmons clearly was using the lane for no purpose other than to commence his work for the day as anticipated by his employer. We previously have stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">[A]n accident occurs in the \u201ccourse of employment\u201d when it takes place within the period of employment, at a place where the employee may be reasonably expected to be, and while he is reasonably fulfilling the duties of his employment or is doing something which is reasonably incident thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-7\"><em>Brown, </em>209 Va. at 564, 165 S.E.2d at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">For the reasons set out above we will affirm the judgment of the trial court sustaining Simmons\u2019 plea in bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
