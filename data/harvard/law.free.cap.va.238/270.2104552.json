Terrell, Inc., was the general contractor for the renovation of the Virginia War Memorial Carillon in Richmond, and Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company (Lumbermens) was the surety on John Grier\u2019s bond. Jones Welding &amp; Repair, Inc. (Jones Welding) was a subcontractor responsible for erecting structural steel on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">A dispute arose between Jones Welding and John Grier over the payment of two change orders to the original contract. John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Grier conceded that it owed Jones Welding $2,808.46 for a change order that had been approved by the project\u2019s architect, but refused to pay $4,455, the amount Jones Welding claimed under the two disputed change orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\">Thereafter, John Grier sent a check for $2,808.46 to Jones Welding. On the back of the check were these words: \u201cThese monies reflect payment in full on the Carillon project.\u201d Jones Welding\u2019s bookkeeper deposited the check in Jones Welding\u2019s bank account without manifesting any form of reservation of rights, objection, or protest. Jones Welding did not endorse the check and was unaware of the words that had been printed on the back of the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Subsequently, Jones Welding sued John Grier for the $4,455, and John Grier interposed a plea of accord and satisfaction. The trial court rejected the plea and entered judgment in favor of Jones Welding in the amount of $4,455. John Grier and Lumbermens appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The burden is on a debtor to prove an accord and satisfaction. <em>See Atkins </em>v. <em>Boatwright, </em>204 Va. 450, 454, 132 S.E.2d 450, 453-54 (1963). The \u201caccord\u201d is the agreement that a debtor will give and the creditor will accept something in settlement of a disputed claim. As with all agreements, there must be an offer and an acceptance, <em>i.e., </em>\u201c[t]he thing agreed to be given ... in satisfaction must be offered and intended by the debtor as full satisfaction, and accepted as such by the creditor.\u201d <em>Virginia-Carolina Elec. Works </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>192 Va. 78, 80, 63 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1951). If either the giving or the acceptance in satisfaction be lacking, an accord and satisfaction cannot exist. <em>Atkins, </em>204 Va. at 454-55, 132 S.E.2d at 454. Thus, an accord and satisfaction does not result \u201cunless the debtor intends his offer as a satisfaction of the demand <em>and such intention is clearly made known to the creditor and accepted by the creditor in accordance with the debtor\u2019s intention.'\u201d Virginia-Carolina Elec. Works, </em>192 Va. at 81, 63 S.E.2d at 719 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u201c[Acceptance of a check on which appears \u2018in full of account,\u2019 or words of like import, does not in fact close the account unless it was accepted with intelligent appreciation of its possible consequences, coupled with knowledge of all relevant facts.\u201d <em>Mercury Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>178 Va. 9, 20, 16 S.E.2d 312, 316 (1941). \u201cThe question whether the acceptance of a check or other remittance by a creditor in payment of an indebtedness to him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>amounts to an accord and satisfaction depends upon the circumstances surrounding the transaction, taking into consideration the conduct and declaration of the respective parties with relation thereto.\u201d <em>Kasco Mills </em>v. <em>Ferebee, </em>197 Va. 589, 593, 90 S.E.2d 866, 870 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\">In the present case, the stipulated facts establish that Jones Welding was unaware of the words that John Grier had written on the back of the check. Obviously, Jones Welding could not have accepted an offer of which it was unaware.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Consequently, mutual assent was lacking, and the parties could not have reached an accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">John Grier contends, nonetheless, that the common-law requisites for an accord and satisfaction have been abrogated by the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.) in transactions governed by the Code. Specifically, John Grier relies upon Code \u00a7 8.1-207, which states that \u201c[a] party who with explicit reservation of rights performs or promises performance or assents to performance in a manner demanded or offered by the other party does not thereby prejudice the rights reserved. Such words as \u2018without prejudice,\u2019 \u2018under protest\u2019 or the like are sufficient.\u201d John Grier asserts that because Jones Welding deposited the \u201cfull payment\u201d check without objection, protest, or reservation of rights, Jones Welding \u201cis barred from recovering any monies in excess of the amount tendered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Much controversy has arisen over the question whether U.C.C. \u00a7 1-207 applies to the \u201cfull payment\u201d check situation and abrogates the common-law doctrine of accord and satisfaction. A small minority of jurisdictions hold that the provision changes the common law so that a creditor may endorse a debtor\u2019s final payment check \u201cwithout prejudice and under protest,\u201d thereby preventing his actions from constituting an accord and satisfaction. <em>See, e.g., Horn Waterproofing Corp. </em>v. <em>Bushwick Iron &amp; Steel Co., Inc., </em>497 N.Y.S.2d 310, 311 n.1, 312 n.3, 488 N.E.2d 56, 57 n.1, 58 n.3 (1985) (compiling legal literature dealing with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>effect of U.C.C. \u00a7 1-207 upon common-law doctrine of accord and satisfaction and acknowledging that question has been much debated); <em>Scholl </em>v. <em>Tallman, </em>247 N.W.2d 490 (S.D. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\">By the majority view, however, U.C.C. \u00a7 1-207 does not operate to supplant the common-law doctrine of accord and satisfaction. <em>See, e.g., Bivins </em>v. <em>White Dairy, </em>378 So.2d 1122 (Ala. Civ. App. 1979); <em>Air Van Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Buster, </em>673 P.2d 774 (Alaska 1983) ; <em>Pillow </em>v. <em>Thermogas Co. of Walnut Ridge, </em>6 Ark. App. 402, 644 S.W.2d 292 (1982); <em>Connecticut Printers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gus Kroesen, Inc., </em>134 Cal. App.3d 54, 184 Cal. Rptr. 436 (1982); <em>R. A. Reither Const., Inc. </em>v. <em>Wheatland Rural Elec. Ass\u2019n, </em>680 P.2d 1342 (Colo. App. 1984); <em>Stultz Elec. Works </em>v. <em>Marine Hydraulic Engineering Co., </em>484 A.2d 1008 (Me. 1984); <em>Chancellor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamilton Appliance Co., Inc., </em>175 N.J. Super. 345, 418 A.2d 1326 (1980); <em>State of Washington, Dept. of Fisheries </em>v. <em>J-Z Sales Corp., </em>25 Wash. App. 671, 610 P.2d 390 (1980); <em>Flambeau Products Corp. </em>v. <em>Honeywell Information Systems, Inc., </em>116 Wis.2d 95, 341 N.W.2d 655 (1984). <em>See generally, </em>6 R. Anderson, <em>The Uniform Commercial Code, </em>\u00a7 3-408:56, -408:57 (3d ed. 1984) ; 1 W. Hawkland, <em>Uniform Commercial Code Series, </em>\u00a7 1-207:02 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">We believe the majority view is the sounder. Code \u00a7 8.1-103 provides that \u201c[u]nless displaced by the particular provisions of this act, the principles of law and equity . . . shall supplement its provisions.\u201d Significant changes in or departures from decisional law ordinarily are highlighted in the comments. <em>See, e.g., </em>Official Comment 2, Code \u00a7 8.3-408. Neither Code \u00a7 8.1-207 nor the comments thereto make any mention of displacing the common-law rules of accord and satisfaction. Indeed, official comment 1 states that \u201c[t]his section provides machinery for the continuation of performance along the lines <em>contemplated by the contract </em>despite a pending dispute.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The comment indicates that the section was intended to address performance under the original contract. Thus, we conclude that the section has no effect on the doctrine of accord and satisfaction, which requires the replacement of the old agreement with a new contract of compromise. <em>Virginia-Carolina Elec. Works, </em>192 Va. at 80-81, 63 S.E.2d at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Accordingly, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b317-6\"> John Grier asserts, however, that the provisions of Code \u00a7 8.4-205 operate to imply Jones Welding\u2019s knowledge and acceptance of John Grier\u2019s full payment offer. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">That section, which permits a bank to provide a depositor\u2019s indorsement, \u201cis designed to speed up collections by eliminating any necessity to return to a non-bank depositor any items he may have failed to indorse.\u201d Official Comment 1, Code \u00a7 8.4-205. Clearly, the section has no application to implying knowledge or acceptance of a full payment offer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
