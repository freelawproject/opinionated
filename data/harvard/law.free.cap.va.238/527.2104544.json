On November 10, 1986, the court below appointed Ardelle Grimes, a niece of the grantor, as guardian for the person and estate of Hatchel. The court found, following an October 17, 1986 hearing on the guardianship petition filed by the City Department of Social Services, that Hatchel \u201cis incapacitated by reason of mental illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">In January 1987, the guardian filed the instant bill of complaint seeking to have the deed \u201cset aside and declared void and invalid.\u201d The sole ground of relief was that the grantor \u201cbecause of her advanced age and impaired health was not mentally able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>understand the nature of the deed she signed.\u201d The guardian did not allege that the grantor had been subjected to either undue influence or constructive fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Subsequently, the chancellor referred the matter to a commissioner in chancery, who held a hearing in September 1987. On conflicting evidence, the commissioner found the guardian had failed to prove that the grantor was incompetent at the time she signed the deed and that she was mentally unable to understand the nature of the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The guardian filed exceptions to the report, which the trial court overruled after considering argument of counsel. The chancellor confirmed the report, noting that the court \u201ccarefully reviewed and weighed the evidence presented, and reviewed and examined the conclusions of said Commissioner.\u201d We awarded the guardian this appeal from the March 1988 final decree entered in favor of the grantee. Later, the grantor died; upon suggestion of the death, we ordered the executor of Hatchel\u2019s estate to be substituted as the appellant in this proceeding. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">In a suit to invalidate a deed upon the ground of mental incapacity, the applicable law is settled. Every person is presumed to be of sound mind, and the burden is upon the party who alleges to the contrary to establish such charge. <em>Howard </em>v. Howard, 112 Va. 566, 568, 72 S.E. 133, 133 (1911). The test for determining whether one lacks sufficient capacity to become bound absolutely by deed or contract is whether, at the time the instrument was executed, the grantor possessed sufficient mental capacity to understand the nature of the transaction and to agree to its provisions. <em>Lohman </em>v. <em>Sherwood, </em>181 Va. 594, 607, 26 S.E.2d 74, 79-80 (1943). Mental ability varies from one individual to another; therefore, no specific degree of mental acuteness is to be prescribed as the measure of one\u2019s capacity to execute a deed. <em>McGrue </em>v. <em>Brownfield, </em>202 Va. 418, 425, 117 S.E.2d 701, 706 (1961). And, when mental capacity is in issue, the outcome of every case must depend mainly on the facts surrounding the execution of the deed in question. <em>Id. </em>at 424, 117 S.E.2d at 706. Hence, the testimony of witnesses who were present when the instrument was executed is entitled to greater weight than the testimony of those witnesses not present. <em>Howard, </em>112 Va. at 570, 72 S.E. at 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">In the present case, a detailed recitation of the conflicting evidence is unnecessary. Under established principles of appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>review, the judgment below is presumed to be correct, especially where, as here, the finding of the commissioner who heard the testimony ore tenus has been confirmed by the chancellor. As we shall demonstrate, the record fully supports the commissioner\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">In her attempt to prove the grantor\u2019s incapacity, the guardian presented evidence that during periods before and after execution of the deed Hatchel was disoriented, confused, and unable to understand any written instrument. According to the testimony, the grantor\u2019s mental condition had begun deteriorating shortly before her retirement in 1984 from city employment. Witnesses related instances of bizarre conduct by the grantor including a time in 1985 when she travelled to Norfolk for a party and later was found near Richmond when she intended to return to her home in Virginia Beach.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">A number of witnesses for the guardian opined that the grantor was incapable of understanding or agreeing to the provisions of a deed in September 1986. For example, a psychologist, who had evaluated the grantor in connection with the guardianship proceeding, testified that based on available information, including a conversation with the grantor on October 13, 1986, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way this lady could have understood what she was doing\u201d at the time the deed was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">None of the guardian\u2019s witnesses who testified about the grantor\u2019s incapacity were present at the closing of the land transaction when the deed was executed, except the grantor. During her testimony before the commissioner in September 1987, a year after the closing, the grantor made generally nonsensical statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">In contrast to the evidence offered on behalf of the guardian, the grantee presented the testimony of three persons who attended the closing, held in the law office of the grantee\u2019s attorney. Present at the closing were the grantor, a male friend who lived in her home, the grantor\u2019s attorney, the grantee\u2019s attorney, and the real estate agent who negotiated the transaction for the grantee. According to that testimony, every document considered or executed during the closing was explained in detail to the grantor, and she appeared to understand the entire transaction and the associated papers, including the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">The grantor\u2019s attorney testified that he met his client on at least two occasions prior to closing and that her mental awareness during these meetings was \u201cgood.\u201d At the time of closing, the attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ney testified, the grantor \u201cknew what was going on\u201d and understood that she was conveying her property in accordance with her desires. The grantee\u2019s attorney testified that during the closing, which lasted about 45 minutes to an hour, there was \u201cno doubt\u201d in his mind that the grantor \u201cknew what was going on and was cognizant of what she was doing.\u201d The attorney testified that the whole transaction was \u201cabsolutely explained to a dead certainty\u201d and that she \u201cdefinitely\u201d appeared to understand the explanation. The commissioner reported: \u201cBoth of the attorneys present at the settlement enjoy impeccable reputations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">The real estate agent had dealt with the grantor for months before she executed the contract of sale for the property in July 1986. He testified that, at closing, she understood she was signing a deed to property which included her home and that she was mentally capable of understanding the nature of her act.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In his appellate argument, the executor treats the case as if the guardian had sought relief upon the ground of undue influence. As we have said, only lack of mental capacity was pled, a matter conceded during argument before the chancellor. Persisting on appeal to discuss undue influence, however, the executor focuses on one of the elements of such a claim, <em>i.e. </em>a showing of the grantor\u2019s \u201cgreat weakness of mind,\u201d <em>see Martin </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>235 Va. 523, 527, 369 S.E.2d 397, 399 (1988). Specifically, the executor contends, he should prevail on a claim of incapacity because the trial court found, both from the bench and in the final decree, that the grantor \u201chad great weakness of mind during the period when the subject contract and deed were executed.\u201d We reject such a contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Mental weakness alone will not invalidate an instrument because courts do not engage in measuring \u201cthe size of peoples\u2019 understanding or capacities.\u201d <em>Lohman, </em>181 Va. at 607, 26 S.E.2d at 80. Therefore, in the context of a suit like this based solely on lack of mental capacity to execute a deed, proof of \u201cgreat weakness of mind\u201d is insufficient to establish mental incapacity. In other words, a person may have great weakness of mind yet may possess sufficient mental capacity to understand the nature of the transaction and to assent to the provisions of the challenged instrument. Thus, the trial court\u2019s finding of \u201cgreat weakness of mind\u201d is not inconsistent with its confirmation of the commissioner\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>For these reasons, we hold that the trial court did not err in refusing to invalidate the deed in question. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s final decree will be</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
