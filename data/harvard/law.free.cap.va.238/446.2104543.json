Lucas, Administratrix of the Estate of Flossie Pumphrey (Lucas), against HCMF Corporation, t/a Heritage Hall Health Care (Heritage Hall), a nursing home. The first case (Record No. 870666) sought damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained by Flossie Pumphrey while under the care of Heritage Hall. The trial court dismissed the case, holding that the evidence presented by Lucas supported a wrongful death action, not a personal injury claim as stated in the motion for judgment. Lucas appealed the dismissal as well as the trial court\u2019s evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>ruling that photographs showing Mrs. Pumphrey\u2019s condition when she left Heritage Hall could not be introduced unless accompanied by comparison photographs taken when she entered Heritage Hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">During the pendency of the appeal, Lucas filed a second suit against Heritage Hall (Record No. 880530) seeking damages for the wrongful death of Flossie Pumphrey. The trial court dismissed the wrongful death action on <em>res judicata </em>grounds. Lucas also appealed that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">We consolidated the cases for appeal and reverse both judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Flossie Pumphrey was an 87 year-old patient at Mary Washington Hospital in September of 1984. Her treating physician, Dr. Rebecca Bigoney, diagnosed Mrs. Pumphrey as suffering from several ailments including resolving staphloccal pneumonia, mild organic brain syndrome, urinary tract infection, and early decubitus ulcers, commonly known as bed sores, on her left hip and upper buttocks. In Dr. Bigoney\u2019s opinion, the only ailment potentially affecting Mrs. Pumphrey\u2019s life expectancy was the organic brain syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">On September 21, 1984, Mrs. Pumphrey was moved to Heritage Hall. Twenty-four days later, on October 15 she returned to Mary Washington Hospital. At that time the ulcer on her hip had become three large ulcers that reached to the bone and tunneled through the skin to meet one another. The ulcer on her buttocks which had been one inch in diameter had grown to eight inches in diameter and extended to the bone. Additional ulcers had developed on each of her ribs, on her left arm and wrist, and on the left side of her face.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">The standard method of treating decubitus ulcers and preventing their spread is keeping the patient mobilized, turning the patient every two hours and periodically moving the patient into a chair. Heritage Hall\u2019s records reflected that Mrs. Pumphrey was not turned at all from September 22 through October 1; nor was she turned on October 4, 7, or 12. Heritage Hall\u2019s records do not indicate that she was moved on a regular basis. On her return to Mary Washington Hospital, Mrs. Pumphrey received emergency treatment for the ulcers. She died on November 14, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">PERSONAL INJURY ACTION</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">On May 22, 1986, Lucas sued Heritage Hall for personal injuries allegedly sustained by Mrs. Pumphrey while a patient. At trial, which commenced on March 19, 1987, the evidence was directed primarily to Heritage Hall\u2019s lack of treatment of Mrs. Pumphrey\u2019s ulcers and the subsequent deterioration in her condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Dr. Bigoney, Lucas\u2019 first witness, testified regarding Mrs. Pumphrey\u2019s condition both before and after her stay at Heritage Hall and the treatment received by Mrs. Pumphrey when she was brought back to Mary Washington Hospital in October. On cross examination, counsel for Heritage Hall asked Dr. Bigoney whether the treatment received at Heritage Hall was a cause of or contributed to Mrs. Pumphrey\u2019s death. Dr. Bigoney responded that, in her opinion, the treatment hastened Mrs. Pumphrey\u2019s death. Heritage Hall immediately moved to dismiss the action on the ground that Dr. Bigoney\u2019s testimony supported a wrongful death action, not the action for personal injuries filed by Lucas. Following argument on the motion, the trial court dismissed the case, denying Lucas\u2019 request to put on further testimony regarding the cause of death and to amend her pleadings.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Lucas could not recover damages for both personal injury and wrongful death based on the treatment of Mrs. Pumphrey by Heritage Flail. Code \u00a7 8.01-56. Code \u00a7 8.01-25 entitles a decedent\u2019s personal representative to file a motion for judgment seeking damages for personal injuries sustained by the decedent; however, if the injuries cause death, the recovery must be sought under Code \u00a7 8.01-50, the wrongful death statute. In choosing to file a personal injury action, Lucas had to prove the elements of that claim to recover damages. Moreover, she was entitled to the opportunity to prove those elements. Dismissal of the action prior to completion of her evidence deprived Lucas of that opportunity and, therefore, constituted error.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Counsel for Heritage Hall concedes that the trial court prematurely dismissed the action, but argues that the error was harmless. Heritage Hall, citing <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Koulizakis, 229 </em>Va. 524, 331 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>S.E.2d 440 (1985), posits that if one\u2019s negligence \u201chastens\u201d death, it is synonymous with destroying \u201cany substantial possibility of the patient\u2019s survival\u201d and becomes a proximate cause of death. <em>Id. </em>at 532, 331 S.E.2d at 446. Therefore, Heritage Hall contends that Dr. Bigoney\u2019s testimony, regarding Heritage Hall\u2019s treatment \u201chastening\u201d Mrs. Pumphrey\u2019s death, leaves Lucas with only a wrongful death action, and further testimony would not alter the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">While a <em>party\u2019s testimony </em>is binding upon him and he cannot ask the court to disregard his own testimony, the same is not true of the testimony of a <em>party\u2019s witness. Massie </em>v. <em>Firmstone, </em>134 Va. 450, 114 S.E. 652 (1922).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">As a general rule when two or more witnesses introduced by a party litigant vary in their statements of fact, such party has the right to ask the court or jury to accept as true the statements most favorable to him. In such a situation he would be entitled to have the jury instructed upon his contention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 462, 114 S.E.2d at 656. Lucas sought to introduce the testimony of Dr. Muncie who had performed the autopsy on Mrs. Pumphrey which indicated that the cause of death was pneumonia. Had Lucas been allowed to proceed with this evidence, the trier of fact would have had to resolve conflicting testimony. Therefore, the action of the trial court denied Lucas the opportunity to complete the presentation of her evidence and, under these circumstances, was not harmless error. Thus, the judgment of the trial court in Record No. 870666 must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">WRONGFUL DEATH ACTION</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">Following the dismissal of her personal injury action, Lucas filed a wrongful death action against Heritage Hall pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-50. Like the personal injury action, the suit was based on the treatment received by Mrs. Pumphrey while a patient at Heritage Hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Heritage Hall sought dismissal on <em>res judicata </em>grounds reasoning that the prior disposition of the personal injury action was a final judgment on the merits, and the wrongful death suit was the same cause of action involving the same parties. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>court agreed and dismissed the wrongful death suit. As a result of our disposition of Record No. 870666, no final judgment in the personal injury suit is outstanding. Because all elements necessary to support a finding based on <em>res judicata </em>are lacking, we must reverse the judgment of the trial court in Record No. 880530.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">ADMISSION OF PHOTOGRAPHS</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In the personal injury action, Lucas also appealed the trial court\u2019s ruling that photographs of Mrs. Pumphrey\u2019s ulcers on her return to Mary Washington Hospital would not be admitted unless accompanied by photographs of the condition of the ulcers when she arrived at Heritage Hall. While the trial court reserved ruling on the admissibility of the photographs until they actually were oifered in evidence, it clearly required that \u201cin a before and after situation, the medium of demonstration has got to be so similar that there is a comparison. ... In other words, if you have an illustration of the before, then an illustration of the after is proper.\u201d No photographs of the ulcers had been taken before Mrs. Pumphrey entered Heritage Hall; therefore, the trial court\u2019s statement effectively prevented the introduction of the photographs under any circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Photographs are admissible when they bear some relevance to a matter in controversy. The party offering the photograph must demonstrate its relevance and lay a foundation for its introduction into evidence. Photographs properly are excluded if they are \u201ccalculated to arouse the sympathies or prejudices of the jury.\u201d <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Kelly, Adm\u2019r, </em>203 Va. 135, 141, 122 S.E.2d 670, 675 (1961). These determinations of relevancy and materiality are within the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Id. </em>The \u201csame medium\u201d prerequisite espoused by the trial court in this case was unrelated to issues of relevancy, materiality and jury sensitivity. In imposing this prerequisite for the admission of the photographs, the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">For the reasons set out above, we will reverse the judgments of the trial court and remand each case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Record No. 870666 <em>Reversed and remanded.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Agd_\">Record No. 880530 <em>Reversed and remanded.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b493-9\"> Although pleading in the alternative under Rule l:4(k) was addressed by counsel in oral argument, this issue was not preserved for appeal, and, therefore, we do not address it.
