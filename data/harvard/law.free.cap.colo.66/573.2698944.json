Blake Rogers, the then Public Trustee, brought the action as provided by the terms of the trust deed itself. This trust deed further provided that property therein mentioned might be released upon certain specified conditions. Before judgment N. S. Walpole, claiming to be the owner of $5,000 of the bonds secured by the trust deed, was upon his motion, and without objection, made a party to the action, and thereafter filed herein his answer and cross-complaint alleging that certain lands had been released by the trustee without authority, and contrary to the terms of the trust deed, and his security thereby endangered. To this answer and cross-complaint was appended a list of the lands so alleged to have been released, together with the names of the owners thereof; and the said Walpole prayed that such owners be made parties defendant. Thereafter motion was filed to strike said answer and cross complaint, and discharge said Walpole as a defendant, which motion was sustained. From this judgment said Walpole prosecutes this writ of error, and the cause is now before us on his application for supersedeas.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b590-5\">Mr. Justice Burke</author>\n<p id=\"AVF\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">It is contended by plaintiff in error that the so-called deed of trust here in question is a mortgage and,' notwithstanding its express terms, must be foreclosed in all respects as such, and as though some other person than the public trustee had been named as trustee therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">With this contention we are unable to agree. We see no reason why the instrument may not be foreclosed according to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Plaintiff in error further contends that the action of the trial court, in striking out his answer and cross-complaint and dismissing his as a party, was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">If the facts alleged in his cross-complaint, as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>wrongful release by the trustee of a considerable portion of the property covered by the deed of trust, be true, then as an owner and holder of bonds of the water company his securities have been wrongfully dissipated. Hence he is entitled to appear herein, and have the owners of such properties made defendants, and to a hearing of his allegations with respect thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\">The judgment is accordingly reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in harmony with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Garrigues, C. J., and Teller, J., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
