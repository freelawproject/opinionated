The amendment became effective on July 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>1955. On or about June 24,1955, an application was filed with the commission to change the zone of the tract of land described therein and hereinafter referred to as areas 1, 2, 3 and 4 from B residence to A residence. The application carried forty-nine signatures of owners of property and residents of premises in the tract or its vicinity. On July 25, 1955, the defendant Robert A. Katz submitted to the Norwalk planning commission for approval preliminary plans of a subdivision for garden-type apartments to be located in area 4. On December 8, 1955, following a public hearing, the defendant commission granted the application to change the zone of area 1 and denied the requested change of zone of areas 2, 3 and 4. The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Common Pleas from the decision of the commission denying the application for the change of zone of area 4. They alleged that the commission acted illegally, arbitrarily and in abuse of the discretion vested in it. The court rendered judgment dismissing the appeal. The plaintiffs have appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The trial court heard the appeal on the record of proceedings before the commission consisting of the minutes of the public hearing and of the executive session held on December 8, 1955, and letters, petitions, maps and all other material relating to the hearing and the decision of the commission. The plaintiffs have assigned as error the court\u2019s conclusions that this record was sufficient and adequate for the determination of the appeal and that there was no extraordinary reason which required the court to hear evidence. They claim that the court erred in excluding evidence claimed to have been offered for the purpose of proving that an exhibit purporting to be a certified copy of the minutes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the hearing and executive session of the commission held on December 8, 1955, was not a complete and accurate stenographic transcript. The plaintiffs also advised the court that they had subpoenaed the director of the Norwalk planning commission and records of that commission for the claimed purpose of proving that the defendant commission acted under an erroneous impression in determining that it would not be in order for it to make the requested change in zone of area 4. The court stated that such testimony and the subpoenaed records wouid not be admitted in evidence. The plaintiffs, further, offered the testimony of a real estate expert for the stated purpose of proving that there was more reason for a change of zone of area 4 than there was for a change of zone of area 1. The court excluded this testimony. The record does not indicate that the plaintiffs took exception to any of these rulings. An exception to a ruling must be taken in order to make it a ground for appeal. <em>Delfino </em>v. <em>Warners Motor Express, </em>142 Conn. 301, 308, 114 A.2d 205; Practice Book \u00a7155.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The plaintiffs offered in evidence records of the zoning board of appeals of Norwalk for the stated purpose of showing that on or about December 28, 1954, an application had been made to it by the defendant Katz for a variance to construct apartments on land in area 4, and of showing the action of the board on that application. The defendants\u2019 objection to the admission of the records was sustained. The present record does not indicate that the plaintiffs took an exception to this ruling. They then requested that the records which they had offered in evidence be marked as an exhibit for identification and took an exception to the court\u2019s denial of their request. They claim that the court erred in refusing to allow the records to be marked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>as an exhibit for identification. The statement of counsel as to the purpose of asking the court to have the exhibit marked for identification makes it clear that his sole object was to obtain a record upon which the court\u2019s ruling excluding the exhibit, as such, could be reviewed. Since no exception had been taken to that ruling, no review of it could be obtained. That aside, as the records of the zoning board of appeals were neither a part of the record of the defendant commission nor necessary for the equitable disposition of the appeal, they were not admissible in evidence under the provisions of \u00a7 379d of the 1955 Cumulative Supplement to the General Statutes<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and \u00a7 Nil of the November, 1955, Supplement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals on Zoning, </em>139 Conn. 450, 454, 94 A.2d 793; <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>138 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Conn. 614, 618, 619, 88 A.2d 382. The record in the instant case shows no attempt by the plaintiffs to demonstrate that the evidence offered was necessary for the equitable disposition of the appeal under the foregoing rule. Consequently, although, of course, the court erred in refusing to allow the records to be marked for identification, the error was not harmful. Only fundamental and material errors which may work an injustice ought to disturb a judgment rendered in substantial accord with principles of law. <em>African Methodist Episcopal Church </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>139 Conn. 418, 423, 94 A.2d 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The plaintiffs maintain that the court erred in dismissing their appeal, contending that the defendant commission acted under a mistake of law and under a misapprehension with respect to the rights of the defendant Katz, who planned to erect apartments on land in area 4; that they were denied a fair hearing by the commission; and that there was as much reason to change the zone of area 4 as there was to change the zone of area 1, if not more. As stated above, the commission had, on June 9, 1955, adopted an amendment to the zoning regulations. - Norwalk Bldg. Zone Regs. \u00a7 3 (1929, as amended). This amendment permitted planned residential developments\u2014apartment houses for multifamily occupancy\u2014in a B residence zone subject to many conditions. The amendment became effective on July 1, 1955. As conceded by the plaintiffs, the defendant Katz had, on July 25,1955\u2014that is, after the amendment was in effect\u2014submitted to the city planning commission for approval preliminary plans of a subdivision for garden-type apartments to be located in area 4. The planning commission had given its preliminary approval on November 2,1955. The record of the proceedings of the defendant com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>mission shows that before the opening of the public hearing upon the application for the change of zone of area 4 the chairman had a memorandum from the planning commission read. Thereafter he said: \u201cAs area [No.] 4 covers the area, and since the preliminary plans have been approved, I believe it would not be in order for the Commission to make any change in that area.\u201d Other members of the commission expressed their views. Interested parties were heard. Reasons for granting the application and reasons for denying it were stated. In the resolution adopted by the commission at its executive session on December 8, 1955, it was stated that \u201cthe area borders on a light industrial zone and should be retained as a Residence \u2018B\u2019 zone in order to provide a buffer zone.\u201d The record indicates the commission\u2019s reason for granting the plaintiffs\u2019 application for a change of zone of area 1. The conditions in and the character of that area were entirely different from those in area 4. The plaintiffs\u2019 claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The plaintiffs assert that the commission\u2019s refusal to change the zone of area 4 is in disregard of the statutory requirement that zoning ordinances shall be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan. This contention is based upon the claim that the action of the commission fosters the interests of the defendant Katz and discriminates against other property owners. The commission\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 application for the change of zone did not give Katz any rights he did not already possess. Section 837 of the General Statutes, which was in effect on December 8, 1955, authorized the zoning commission to regulate the use of buildings, structures and land for trade, industry, residence or other purposes and provided that such regulations should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan. The plaintiffs\u2019 appeal to the Court of Common Pleas was not one from the action of the commission in amending the regulations. It was from the action of the commission in denying the application for a change of zone. If the plaintiffs desired to claim, as they are now endeavoring to do, that the regulations, as amended, were not made in accordance with a comprehensive plan, they should have appealed from the commission\u2019s action in adopting the amendment on June 9,1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">\u201c \u2018The history of zoning legislation indicates a clear intent on the part of the General Assembly that, subject to certain underlying principles, the solution of zoning questions is for the local agencies.\u2019 <em>Couch </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>141 Conn. 349, 359, 106 A.2d 173. The zoning authority is endowed with a wide and liberal discretion. <em>Eden </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>139 Conn. 59, 62, 89 A.2d 746; <em>Mallory </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>138 Conn. 497, 505, 86 A.2d 668. \u2018The circumstances and conditions in matters of zone changes and regulations are peculiarly within the knowledge of the zoning commission. Where it appears that an honest judgment has been reasonably and fairly exercised after a full hearing, courts should be cautious about disturbing the decision of the local authority.\u2019 <em>Kutcher </em>v. <em>Town Planning Commission, </em>138 Conn. 705, 710, 88 A.2d 538; <em>Couch </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra. \u2018Courts must not and legally cannot substitute their own discretion for the wide and liberal discretion enjoyed by zoning agencies.\u2019 <em>Couch </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra.\u201d <em>Levinsky </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>144 Conn. 117, 125, 127 A.2d 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-5\"> \u201cSec. 379d. appeals prom board to court.
