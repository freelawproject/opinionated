General Statutes, Cum. Sup. 1955, \u00a7 2339d. The trial court rendered judgment for the defendant and the plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Following is a summary of the facts: The plaintiff United Interchange, Inc., is a New York corporation with its principal place of business in New York City. It will be referred to as United. It has not qualified to do business in Connecticut. By means of extensive advertising in newspapers and periodicals and on the air, United obtains the names of business and property owners who desire to sell, lease or make an exchange of their business enterprises or properties. It employs the plaintiffs Joel Coldshine and Lester Kirby, nonresidents, on a commission basis to solicit in this state contracts from such prospective sellers to advertise their businesses or properties in \u201cBuyers Digest\u201d and \u201cBrokers Bulletin,\u201d two printed media published by Universal Interchange, Inc., hereinafter referred to as Universal, under .agreement with United. The price for the insertion of an advertisement in the Digest and the Bulletin is a stipulated sum depending in amount upon the space devoted to the advertisement. It is payable either upon the sale of the property or upon the expiration of three months from the date of United\u2019s acceptance of the advertising contract, whichever occurs first.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">\u201cBuyers Digest\u201d is issued monthly in magazine form and is substantially a directory containing advertisements for the sale, lease or exchange of many kinds of real estate, interests therein, and business opportunities. It includes some editorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>material relating to real estate and business opportunity matters. \u201cBrokers Bulletin\u201d is essentially a folder of unbound sheets listing prospective sales and exchanges and is issued to real estate brokers and others for the purpose of enlisting their aid in effecting sales during the period between the regular publications of the Digest. Universal, which publishes and circulates these periodicals under contract with United, advertises them extensively. Both publications are available free of charge to anyone who requests them. The Digest is sent without cost to chambers of commerce, public libraries and real estate and business opportunity brokers throughout the United States and elsewhere. United\u2019s purpose is primarily to promote sales and exchanges and to refer sales opportunities to licensed real estate brokers. It operates in several other states. Its salesmen help prospective sellers to prepare their advertisements.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Prior to June, 1955, United was conducting its business in Connecticut, and during this period it and its affiliate, Universal, sold in this state 225 contracts for a total of $13,000. The defendant received complaints of fraudulent representations from those doing business with companies engaged in a type of enterprise similar to that of the plaintiffs. Some of these complaints were to the effect that sales were guaranteed and that no payment need be made unless there was a sale. Because of these complaints the defendant sought the legislative amendment which is now challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">In 1953 the General Assembly enacted a law requiring the licensing of real estate brokers and salesmen. General Statutes, Cum. Sup. 1955, c. 237a. Before a license can issue, the prospective licensee must apply in writing to the insurance commissioner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>who is charged, with the administration of the law. Cum. Sup. 1955, \u00a7 2342d. The commissioner is authorized to require of the applicant such information bearing upon his integrity and competency as is deemed desirable. \u00a7 2343d. The commissioner is directed to subject the individual applicant, or each member of an association or a partnership applying for a license, or each of the officers and salesmen of a corporation, to a written examination to determine the competency of the person being examined \u201cto act .as a real estate broker or real estate salesman.\u201d Ibid. The fee for a broker\u2019s license and each annual renewal thereof is $15 for an individual, a member of a partnership or an association, or a corporate officer; the fee for a salesman\u2019s license is $5. Ibid. 'The applicant is required to post with the commissioner a bond in favor of the state with corporate .surety in the amount of $2500 if the application is for a broker\u2019s license, and in the amount of $1000 if it is for a salesman\u2019s license. \u00a7 2344d. No one can act as a broker or salesman without a license. \u00a7\u00a7 2341d, 2352d.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The 1953 act defined the term \u201cengaging in the real estate business\u201d to mean \u201cacting for another \u00a1and for a fee, commission or other valuable consideration in the listing for sale, selling, exchanging, buying or renting or offering or attempting to negotiate a sale, exchange, purchase or rental of an estate <em>or </em>interest in real estate, or collecting upon, or offering or attempting to negotiate, a loan secured or to be secured by a mortgage or other encumbrance upon or transfer of real estate.\u201d Cum. Sup. 1953, \u00a7 1783c (e). A broker was defined as one engaged in the activities described above as constituting \u201cengaging in the real estate business\u201d; \u00a7 1783c (a); and a salesman was defined as one employed by a broker to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>any of the things constituting \u201cengaging in the real estate business.\u201d \u00a7 1783c (b). In 1955 the General Assembly repealed \u00a7 1783c and enacted a substitute-therefor, \u00a7 2339d of the 1955 Cumulative Supplement,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which added to the language of \u00a7 1783c-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>defining the term \u201cengaging in the real estate business\u201d the provision that \u201csaid term includes engaging in the business, for a fee, in connection with any contract whereby any person undertakes to promote the sale of real estate through the listing of such property in a publication issued primarily for such purpose or for referral of information' concerning properties to licensed real estate brokers or both.\u201d The definition of \u201creal estate broker\u201d was enlarged to embrace any person carrying on such an activity. A \u201csalesman\u201d was also redefined to include a person employed by a broker for such an activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The 1953 act requiring the licensing of real estate brokers and salesmen (Cum. Sup. 1953, c. 237a), including \u00a7 1783c, was declared to be a valid exercise of the police power under the federal and state constitutions in <em>Cyphers </em>v. <em>Allyn, </em>142 Conn. 699, 118 A.2d 318. The plaintiffs now challenge the constitutional validity of the amendatory language of \u00a7 2339d, which, it is conceded, comprehends them. They charge that it violates the due process, equal protection of the laws and freedom of the press provisions of the federal and state constitutions. U. S. Const. Art. I, Amend. XIV \u00a7 1; Conn. Const. Art. I \u00a7\u00a71, 5, 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>We shall consider first the argument advanced with regard to due process and equal protection of the laws. Successfully to pass the test of constitutional validity in these respects, the act as amended to embrace these plaintiffs must be a proper exercise of the police power of the state. We have recently examined the basic principles applicable to police legislation regulating the conduct of business and professional activity. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>143 Conn. 698, 702, 125 A.2d 477; <em>Calve Bros. Co. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>143 Conn. 609, 612, 124 A.2d 881; <em>Cyphers </em>v. <em>Allyn, </em>supra, 705; <em>Amsel </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>141 Conn. 288, 298, 106 A.2d 152. The test is whether (1) some need for serving the public health, safety or general welfare makes the regulatory legislation necessary or desirable, and (2) the legislation serves that need in a. way which is not arbitrary, discriminatory and confiscatory to an unreasonable and unnecessary degree. In passing upon the need and in fashioning the method of serving it, the legislature under its police powers has a broad discretion. The limitation upon this discretion is drawn by the courts at that point where the regulatory measures either fail to serve the public good or serve it in a despotic way.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The 1955 amendment prevents the plaintiffs from carrying on a lawful business unless they obtain real estate brokers\u2019 and salesmen\u2019s licenses. This is done by defining the activities of the plaintiffs as \u201cengaging in the real estate business\u201d and requiring of them brokers\u2019 and salesmen\u2019s licenses in order to continue their activities. It is true that legislatures may define the terms used in their enactments and that courts are bound to accept their definitions. <em>First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>142 Conn. 483, 489, 115 A.2d 455, and cases cited. This rule extends only to the meaning to be given by the courts, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>construing a statute, to the terms defined. It does not prevent a court, when the constitutionality of the statute is attacked, from examining a definition to-see whether it logically and fairly describes what it purports to define. To take an extreme case, it is questionable whether a legislature could, by defining as a dog an animal having the components of a horse, subject the owner of a horse to the dog licensing-statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">United\u2019s business is primarily advertising. It differs from newspaper and magazine publishers-generally in the respect only that it limits the range-of its advertising activities to specific types of property. Its purposes are to bring to the attention of prospective purchasers properties available for purchase and to the attention of prospective sellers-buyers who are looking for particular kinds of properties. These are the fundamental purposes of all sales advertising. United\u2019s salesmen secure-written contracts from property sellers or buyers to advertise in its publications. These salesmen assist in the preparation of these advertisements. The contracts and the advertisements are then submitted to United and thereafter published in \u201cBuyers Digest\u201d\u2019 and \u201cBrokers Bulletin.\u201d It does not appear, however, that these salesmen advise as to price and for that reason should have some knowledge of real estate values, nor that they direct or assist in the negotiations between the interested parties and so must know something about real estate incumbrances, taxes, zoning and other regulations, and other similar factors involved in a real estate deal. Why then should the officers of United and its salesmen be required to take a written examination to establish their competency to carry on the real estate business with all of the detail which that involves? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>The terms of payment prescribed by United are such that its salesmen have no occasion to handle its customers\u2019 funds. Why then should its salesmen be required, in order to carry on its business, to post surety company bonds in substantial amounts, renewable annually?</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The only reason advanced for the need and design of this amendment is to prevent fraud, a purpose which has always been considered legitimate for the exercise of the police power when the facts warranted it. <em>Walp </em>v. <em>Mooar, </em>76 Conn. 515, 521, 57 A. 277; <em>State </em>v. <em>Feingold, </em>77 Conn. 326, 333, 59 A. 211. A legitimate purpose, however, cannot justify an unreasonable and unnecessarily arbitrary and discriminatory method of accomplishing it. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>126 Conn. 373, 378, 12 A.2d 192; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners of Embalmers, </em>129 Conn. 128, 133, 26 A.2d 780; <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>137 Conn. 701, 706, 81 A.2d 266; <em>Amsel </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>141 Conn. 288, 300, 106 A.2d 152; <em>Louis K. Liggett Co. </em>v. <em>Baldridge, </em>278 U.S. 105, 113, 49 S. Ct. 57, 73 L. Ed. 204; <em>New State Ice Co. </em>v. <em>Liebmann, </em>285 U.S. 262, 278, 52 S. Ct. 371, 76 L. Ed. 747; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>233 U. S. 630, 638, 34 S. Ct. 681, 58 L. Ed. 1129; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ballance, </em>229 N.C. 764, 771, 51 S.E.2d 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The legislative power to regulate a business fraught with particular danger to the public is much wider than in the case of an ordinary lawful business such as advertising. \u201cIn the one business no citizen has an absolute right to engage; in the other all citizens have a right and an equal right to engage. The difference is vital.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Conlon, </em>65 Conn. 478, 486, 33 A. 519; <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>94 Conn. 639, 643, 110 A. 59; 30 Am. Jur. 278, \u00a7 40. Where the business is a lawful one and involves no particular danger to the public, \u201cthe regulation must not be unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>sonably in excess of what is necessary to accomplish the supposed end; and in the case of a business in which all citizens have a right and an equal right to engage, the principle of equality of rights must, in this State, be observed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 645. This is not to imply that activities such as the plaintiffs carry on cannot, consistently with constitutional limitations, be regulated. That is not the issue in this case. Rather, the question for decision is whether this particular legislation is consistent with those limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The amendment purports to describe the business of the plaintiffs as promoting \u201cthe sale of real estate through the listing of . . . property in a publication issued primarily for such purpose or for referral of information concerning properties to licensed real estate brokers or both.\u201d Cum. Sup. 1955, \u00a7 2339d (c). The finding discloses that this is in fact a fair description of what the plaintiffs purport to do. That being so, there is no sound reason for requiring them to take a written examination on their competency as real estate brokers and salesmen, to furnish a corporate surety bond and to pay substantial fees for the original issuance of their licenses and for the annual renewal thereof. Such requirements are unnecessarily burdensome and discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Courts of other jurisdictions have reached the same conclusion on facts analogous to those in the instant ease. In <em>Whitcomb </em>v. Emerson, 46 Cal. App. 2d 263, 269, 115 P.2d 892, a statute providing for the licensing of cosmetologists after examination defined the term \u201ccosmetology\u201d in such a way as to include hairdressing, massage, and manicuring. The plaintiff in that case had long practiced as a masseuse. The board charged with administering the statute ordered her to cease performing any act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>cosmetology until she had obtained a license. The plaintiff had never studied hairdressing or manicuring, had no training or proficiency in those particular branches of cosmetology as defined by the statute, and could not pass an examination in them. The court held that although an activity not harmful in itself might endanger the public health, safety or general welfare if practiced by an inexperienced and incompetent person and therefore be a proper subject for regulation, a statute which prevented a person from carrying on the lawful occupation of masseuse unless she could also qualify under the statute as a hairdresser and manicurist was an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power. Id., 277. A similar line of reasoning controlled the court\u2019s decision in the following cases: <em>Prouty </em>v. <em>Heron, </em>127 Colo. 168, 176, 255 P.2d 755; <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Summers, </em>76 Idaho 446, 452, 283 P.2d 1093; <em>People </em>v. <em>Schaeffer, </em>310 Ill. 574, 580, 142 N.E. 248; <em>Scully </em>v. <em>Hallihan, </em>365 Ill. 185, 191, 6 N.E.2d 176; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Ervin, </em>205 Minn. 84, 88, 285 N.W. 77; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ringe, </em>197 N.Y. 143, 149, 90 N.E. 451; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Baldrige, </em>294 Pa. 142, 144, 144 A. 97; <em>Timmons </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>271 F. 721, 727; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Daly, </em>15 F.2d 881, 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">While the court has not so found, we may nevertheless take judicial notice of the fact that a statute severely limiting the practice of a lawful vocation by stringent qualifications has a tendency to create a monopoly by excluding those who may not possess the highest qualifications from carrying on a lawful business. <em>Buehman </em>v. <em>Bechtel, </em>57 Ariz. 363, 376, 114 P.2d 227; <em>Ex Parte Mihlfread, </em>128 Tex. Crim. 556, 558, 83 S.W.2d 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The defendant argues that even without the amending language the definitions contained in ^ 2339d are sufficiently broad to include the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>activities. The adoption of the 1955 amendment conclusively shows that the legislature did not ascribe to the 1953 form of the statute any such intent as that claimed. <em>Willoughby </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>123 Conn. 446, 455, 197 A. 85; <em>State ex rel. Markley </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>130 Conn. 88, 93, 32 A.2d 58. Furthermore, courts must avoid if they can a construction which for the reasons hereinbefore stated would render the statute apart from the amending language invalid. <em>Cedar Island Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Clinton Electric Light &amp; Power Co., </em>142 Conn. 359, 372, 114 A.2d 535. The defendant gains nothing on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The view which we have taken makes it unnecessary to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">We hold that the provisions of \u00a7 2339d which embrace the plaintiffs\u2019 activities within the definition of what constitutes \u201cengaging in the real estate business\u201d and the activities of a \u201creal estate broker\u201d or a \u201creal estate salesman\u201d violate the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs and are null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-5\"> \u201cSec. 2339d. definitions.
