The plaintiffs make no claim that its zone status, prior to that date, permitted the erection of the proposed shopping center. On that day the defendant, after .a duly advertised public hearing, adopted a so-called comprehensive plan of development embodied in a resolution and a set of maps, one of which included the plaintiffs\u2019 land. That land, on the map, is designated \u201cRS,\u201d which the accompanying legend describes as \u201carea dedicated for a regional shopping center under special conditions.\u201d In paragraph seven of the resolution, it was provided \u201cthat a portion of town be reserved for a Regional Shopping Center, the effective date of any rezoning approved after duly publicized public hearings to be simultaneous with the start of construction.\u201d In paragraph nine, the defendant approved the \u201cgeneralized Plan of Development\u201d set forth in the resolution. Thereafter, the defendant and the town council held a series of public hearings preparatory to the adoption of a new set of zoning regulations and maps, including a map showing the plaintiffs\u2019 land. After a publie hearing on July 29, 1955, the defendant approved proposed new zoning regulations for the town and a new zoning map, the whole to be presented to the town council for adoption as an ordinance. On August 22, 1955, the town council <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>approved and legally adopted the new zoning regulations and map, to become effective on September 9, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">On one sheet of the zoning map, the plaintiffs\u2019 land appears uncolored and unlabeled, and the spaces so treated on the map are explained in the legend on another sheet as \u201cPublic <em>&amp; </em>semi-public land not subject to zoning. Temporar [il]y unzoned.\u201d On \u201cPlan of Development\u201d or \u201cZoning Maps\u201d issued as of December 20, 1955, and, in revised form, as of June 12, 1956, the plaintiffs\u2019 land is marked \u201cNZ,\u201d which, according to the applicable legend is land \u201cnot subject to zoning and special zone reserves according to general plan.\u201d On one sheet of the general zoning map there is a schedule of certain zoning regulations applicable in seven residential zones, two business zones and two industrial zones. By the zoning regulations and map, areas were zoned for business use and so marked, but the plaintiffs\u2019 land was not placed in any business zone. It was marked as aforesaid. The zoning regulations contained no provisions governing the use of land not zoned or temporarily unzoned. They affirmatively listed the uses permitted in the respective zones but did not list any uses for an \u201cNZ\u201d area.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">On March 7, 1956, the defendant, at an executive meeting, set forth the conditions for the establishment of a business zone at the Park Regional Shopping Center, which was the plaintiffs\u2019 land. Included in these conditions were the following: \u201c5. Planning Commission to advertise a public hearing for the purpose of establishing a business zone. 6. Tentative zone change (if granted) subject to the start of building construction within specified time and in accordance with plans approved by the Commission.\u201d Subsequently, at an executive meeting of the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>on March 14, 1956, it was voted to correct the minutes of the meeting on March 7 to read \u201czone determination\u201d in place of \u201czone change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">By application dated March 29,1956, the plaintiffs applied for \u201ca determination of zone, for an area formerly zoned Residential, to Business II (Regional Shopping Center) \u201d and stated that they were \u201cnow ready to meet all the conditions set forth for the establishment of a business zone at the Park Regional Shopping Center.\u201d At the public hearing on the application on April 30,1956, they requested that their land, \u201cpresently classed as NZ,... be changed to B-2.\u201d They referred to the action sought as \u201ca change of this zone to a B-2 zone.\u201d Both the plaintiffs and the defendant followed the usual procedure for a change of zone, including the filing of petitions and presentation of speakers for and against the proposed change and the introduction of documentary evidence purporting to show its desirability. The petitions filed in support of the plaintiffs\u2019 application recited that the signers were in favor of a B-2 zoning designation for the plaintiffs\u2019 land. At an executive session on May 9, 1956, the defendant approved the plaintiffs\u2019 application by a three to two vote of its membership, but denied the application on the ground that it could be granted only by a unanimous vote because of the provisions of the special act, enacted in 1931, authorizing zoning in the town of Windsor. 21 Spec. Laws 277, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The basic claims of the plaintiffs are twofold. In the first place, they claim that they needed no change of zone nor determination of zone because the classification of their property made by the defendant in July of 1955 and approved by the town council effective September 9, 1955, gave them the right to use their land for any purpose whatsoever. This claim, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>sustained, would of course be decisive of this appeal. Secondly, they claim that if their first contention is not sustained, the defendant was in error in construing the special act as requiring, under the facts of this case, a unanimous vote of the defendant\u2019s entire membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The establishment of zones in a community by a duly authorized body is basically a legislative process, although local in its scope. In the interpretation of the language of a legislative enactment, the question is as to the expressed intention, that is, the intention of the legislative body \u201cas found from the words employed to make it manifest.\u201d <em>Lee </em>Bros. <em>Furniture Co. </em>v. <em>Cram, </em>63 Conn. 433, 438, 28 A. 540. The actual intent, as a state of mind, of the members of a legislative body is immaterial, even if it were ascertainable. Ibid.; <em>State ex rel. Pettigrew </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>135 Conn. 228, 233, 63 A.2d 154; <em>Mad River Co. </em>v. <em>Wolcott, </em>137 Conn. 680, 688, 81 A.2d 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The zoning regulations and accompanying map apparently covered all of the property in the town. At least they covered that of the plaintiffs and all other property in the same general area. Since on the zoning map the plaintiffs\u2019 property was indicated to be temporarily unzoned, the effect was that the zoning authority had established, for the time being, no regulations for the use of this property. The finding that the \u201centire scheme of the Windsor zoning regulations is permissive in contrast to the prohibiting type of zoning ordinance which allows all uses, except those expressly prohibited,\u201d is unattacked, as is the finding that the zoning regulations affirmatively fist uses permissible in various zones. It follows that no uses were permissible upon the plaintiffs\u2019 land and none would be until it had been so zoned as to authorize them. Whether the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>tiffs\u2019 claim that their property was open to any nse they might see fit to make of it would have been well founded had the property been wholly omitted from the zoning regulations and map covering the entire town, we have no occasion to consider, since that was not the case. The plaintiffs\u2019 property was included, and unmistakably included, in the zoning regulations, but there was a failure to classify it as to zone or permissible uses. Since in Windsor a property may be used only in conformity with the zoning regulations, and since, admittedly, valid regulations were generally in effect as of September 9, 1955, covering the plaintiffs\u2019 land, a failure to include in those regulations permissible uses for this land rendered it unusable for any purpose until some use was authorized by appropriate action. The first claim of the plaintiffs, therefore, is decided adversely to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Actually, the plaintiffs, in their application and in their statements at the hearing on it, seem to have construed the NZ classification of their property correctly, since they sought, and on May 9, 1956, obtained, approval of a business 2 classification for it. Whether the phrase \u201cchange of zone\u201d or \u201cdetermination of zone\u201d was the more appropriate to \u2022describe the action sought is immaterial here. The approval of the application, but for the provisions of the special act (21 Spec. Laws 277, \u00a7 5), changed the plaintiffs\u2019 property from one having no permissive uses into one having the permissive uses accorded property within a business 2 zone. This was a change of zone within the meaning of the .special act.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">It now becomes necessary to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 second basic claim, that it was not necessary, \u2022on the facts of this case, to obtain a unanimous vote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>of the members of the defendant under the applicable provisions of the special act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here again the only question is one of law as to the meaning of those provisions. <em>Lee Bros. Furniture Co. </em>v. <em>Cram, </em>63 Conn. 433, 438, 28 A. 540; <em>Mad River Co. </em>v. <em>Wolcott, </em>137 Conn. 680, 688, 81 A.2d 119. The defendant\u2019s-interpretation of them is of no importance except-as it conforms to a legal interpretation. There is-no room for, nor any question as to, the exercise of any discretion on the part of the defendant in its: interpretation of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">While some question was made at the trial as to which was the rear line of the plaintiffs\u2019 property, we understand the plaintiffs\u2019 brief to concede that the rear line was the south line. The real dispute' as to the interpretation of the relevant provisions-of the special act, obviously taken from \u00a7 425 of the' Revision of 1930 (now Public Acts 1957, No. 662),. centers on whether the phrase \u201cimmediately adjacent in the rear\u201d modifies \u201carea\u201d or \u201clots.\u201d Ordinarily,, an owner of a lot would be the owner of the area of that lot. The only rational explanation of the-language used is that the General Assembly was not thinking of owners of lots but of owners of areas.. What is required is a protest filed by the owners-(whether one owner or many owners) of at least 20\u2019 per cent of certain areas. It is not the owners of 201 per cent of the lots with whom we are concerned but the owners of 20 per cent of certain areas of lots.. An entire lot, as in the case of the Valente lot here,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>might not be either \u201cimmediately adjacent\u201d to or \u201cin the rear\u201d of the lots included in the change of zone. But if part of it was, then that part would constitute an area \u201cimmediately adjacent in the rear\u201d of the lots included in the zone change. This makes it clear that we are to consider that area of the Valente lot which is \u201cimmediately adjacent in the rear\u201d of the plaintiffs\u2019 property, that is, of the south line of the plaintiffs\u2019 property. It remains to determine what that area is.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">One of the maps shows that the Valente lot fronts on the westerly side of Grove Street and that the westerly line of the lot is substantially parallel with the westerly line of Grove Street. The same is true \u2022of the westerly lines of the other lots in the nearby -area west of Grove Street, as shown on one of the .maps in evidence. Therefore, in determining the .area of the Valente lot which is \u201cimmediately adjacent\u201d to the south line of the plaintiffs\u2019 property as distinguished from the area which is \u201cimmediately adjacent\u201d to property of the town of Windsor which abuts the Valente lot on the north for a distance of .some forty-five feet measured westerly from Grove Street, the division line should run parallel to the westerly line of Grove Street. The north end of this line should be at the southwest corner of the lot belonging to the town of Windsor. The portion of the Valente lot which is west of a line so drawn and not more than one hundred feet southerly of the south line of the plaintiffs\u2019 property should be taken into account as the area (of that lot) \u201cimmediately adjacent in the rear\u201d of the plaintiffs\u2019 property and \u201cextending one hundred feet therefrom.\u201d In excluding the entire Valente lot from consideration because part of it abutted land of the town of Windsor instead of the rear of the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>property, the court was in error. As we understand^ it, however, the plaintiffs conceded during the argument in this court that unless substantially all of the Valente lot is included in the computation area,, more than the required 20 per cent objected to the-zone change. As pointed out, a substantial part,, even though not all, of the Valente lot is not so-included. It follows that a unanimous vote of the-defendant\u2019s membership was required under the-terms of the special act.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">What has been said sufficiently disposes of the-claims for correction of the finding so far as they are material.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-5\"> \u201c[Spec.
