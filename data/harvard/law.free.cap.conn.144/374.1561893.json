J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkK\">The stipulated facts essential to this reservation are these: On October 1, 1954, the plaintiff, a manufacturing concern, was the owner of real estate and personalty located in the town of Bristol. The personalty consisted of machinery, raw materials, goods in process, finished products and motor vehicles. The assessors determined that the actual value of the plaintiff\u2019s real and personal property on October 1, 1954, was $2,496,460 and $6,119,672, respectively. The assessors further determined that all of the taxable real estate in Bristol had, as of the same date, an actual value of $145,650,320, and the personalty an actual value of $48,382,958, or a total of $194,033,278. The assessors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>then set in the tax list of that year the plaintiff\u2019s real estate at $1,248,230; its personalty other than motor vehicles at $5,501,770; and its motor vehicles at $6600; the three amounts being 50 per cent, 90 per cent and 100 per cent, respectively, of the actual values previously determined. These listings made a total assessment against the plaintiff of $6,756,600.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Using comparable methods and percentages, the assessors set in the tax list all of the taxable realty within the town at $72,825,160; all of the taxable personalty other than motor vehicles at $33,755,930; and all of the motor vehicles at $10,876,370. After legal exemptions of $3,951,220 had been applied to these three classifications and after minor adjust-, ments had been made on the application of property owners not parties to this action, the grand list totaled $113,314,360.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The sum of $8,616,132, the actual value of all of the plaintiff\u2019s property as determined by the assessors, was 4.447 per cent of the actual value of all the taxable property in the town. The sum of $6,756,600, the assessed value of all the plaintiff\u2019s property, was 5.962 per cent of the grand list of the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Within the time prescribed by law, the plaintiff appealed to the board of tax review for a reduction in the assessment of its personalty, but the appeal was dismissed. Thereupon the plaintiff instituted this proceeding, which has been briefed and argued as an application in the nature of an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas under General Statutes \u00a7 1800, and we so construe it. The parties having stipulated in the Court of Common Pleas as to the foregoing facts, the case has been reserved for advice upon the four questions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Essentially, these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>qnestions present the single issue whether or not the assessors can, by using a higher percentage of the actual value of personalty than they do of real estate in making assessments, impose upon the plaintiff the obligation of paying a greater proportionate amount of taxes than those assessed, let us say, for only real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The assessing of property at a fraction of its actual value undoubtedly is so widespread that most, if not all, of the municipalities in the state pursue the practice. This rule of assessment has been tolerated for so long a time that it has acquired the respectability of assumed legality. The practice, however, is clearly improper. Section 1738 of the General Statutes provides that taxable realty \u201cshall be liable to taxation at its present true and actual valuation,\u201d and \u00a7 1047d of the 1955 Cumulative Supplement provides that all items of taxable personalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>shall be set in the list of the owner \u201cat their then actual valuation.\u201d Since a municipality has no authority to tax except as granted by the General Assembly, statutes conferring authority to tax must be strictly observed. <em>Thames Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Lathrop, </em>7 Conn. 550, 556. The unambiguous language of the two statutes just mentioned gives assessors no warrant to utilize as a tax base any value other than the actual value of the property. Indeed, the language impliedly forbids the adoption of any different base.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The impropriety of fractional valuation is manifest from the history of \u00a7\u00a7 1738 and 1047d. Prior to 1860, the General Assembly specifically authorized assessments of real estate and personalty at percentages of their valuation. For example, in 1821 the statute provided that \u201c[djwelling-houses, with the buildings and lots appurtenant thereunto . . . shall be valued at the rate which each separate dwelling-house and lot, with the appurtenances thereof, are worth in money, and ... shall be set in the list of the owner, at two per cent of such value. Lands and separate lots ... shall be valued and assessed by the acre . .. and shall be set in the list, at three per cent of such value. . '. . All horses, asses and mules, one year old, or more, shall be valued, and set in the list at ten per cent of such value. . . . Neat cattle one year old, or more, shall be valued, and set in the list, at six per cent of such value. Silver plate, except spoons, . . . shall be valued, and set in the list, at twenty-five per cent of such value. Clocks, watches and time-pieces shall be valued, and set in the list, at fifty per cent of such value.\u201d Statutes, 1821, p. 446, \u00a7 2. This legislative policy of requiring the assessment of property at fractional valuation remained in effect for forty years more, although the percentages were changed from time to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>time and eventually were stabilized at 3 per cent for both personalty and realty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">In 1860, the General Assembly passed an act reciting \u201c[t]hat all property on which, by the laws of this state, taxes may be laid, shall be set in the list at its actual valuation, and not as heretofore at three per cent, of such valuation.\u201d Public Acts 1860, c. 15, \u00a7 1. The assembly thus abandoned, in the clearest sort of manner, the previous method of fractional valuation and directed the rule of assessment to be the actual value of the taxable property. This important change in legislative policy was continued and is to be noted in the Revisions of 1866 and 1875. Rev. 1866, p. 708 \u00a77, p. 709 \u00a78; Rev. 1875, p. 155 \u00a7 13, p. 156 \u00a7 14. The direction found in the two sections of the latter citation is to set real estate at its \u201ctrue and actual valuation\u201d and personalty at its \u201cactual valuation.\u201d It should be stated, parenthetically, that the expressions \u201ctrue and actual valuation\u201d and \u201cactual valuation\u201d mean the same thing, and they are also synonymous with \u201cmarket value,\u201d \u201cmarket price\u201d and \u201cfair value.\u201d <em>Sibley </em>v. <em>Middlefield, </em>143 Conn. 100, 106, 120 A.2d 77. The sections in the Revision of 1875 were continued in almost identical form, and appear in the 1949 Revision as \u00a7 1738 and 1745.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The latter section was amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>in 1953 (Cum. Sup. 1953, \u00a7 848c) in a particular not material to this case and is now \u00a7 1047d. Thus, the history of the statutes discloses the unequivocal legislative intent, as expressed in the public act of 1860 and followed ever since, that all taxable property \u201cshall be set in the list at its actual valuation, and not as heretofore at [a] per cent, of such valuation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Nor can we overlook a further matter in demonstrating the impropriety of pursuing the rule of fractional valuation. When assessors adopt such a rule, they indirectly assume a role which rightfully is not theirs to play. For, if such a rule is applied, the grand list will obviously be smaller in amount than it would be if the mandate of the statute were carried out. Under such circumstances, the borrowing power of the municipality is affected, since its indebtedness may not exceed specified percentages \u2022of the grand list. Cum. Sup. 1955, \u00a7 363d, as amended, Nov. 1955 Sup., \u00a7\u00a7 N8, N119. Assessors who use fractional valuation to determine their assessments therefore interfere, perhaps unwittingly but nonetheless effectively, with a power which legally belongs to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">It is apparent, then, that the Bristol assessors :acted contrary to the statutes, and hence illegally, in listing the plaintiff\u2019s real estate at 50 per cent of its actual value and the personalty, other than motor vehicles, at 90 per cent of that value. <em>Slosberg </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>115 Conn. 578, 162 A. 772; <em>Dennis\u2019 Appeal, </em>72 Conn. 369, 372, 44 A. 545; <em>Ives </em>v. <em>Goshen, </em>63 Conn. 79, 82, 26 A. 845; <em>White </em>v. <em>Portland, </em>63 Conn. 18, 22, 26 A. 342. It does not, however, necessarily follow that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Section 1800 of the General Statutes provides for such an appeal as was taken in the case at bar to the Court of Common Pleas from the action of the board of tax review in denying the plaintiff the relief it sought from the doings of the Bristol assessors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court is empowered by the statute \u201cto grant such relief as shall to justice and equity appertain.\u201d Some sixty odd years ago this court handed down an opinion in <em>Randell </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>63 Conn. 321, 28 A. 523. A summary of the facts in that case is this: It was the uniform rule of the Bridgeport board of assessors to assess taxable property at half its actual value. This was contrary to the statutes, which required assessments to be made at actual value. Rev. 1888, 3827, 3831. In 1891, the board assessed the plaintiffs\u2019 real estate at a figure in excess of such half. Failing to obtain relief from the board of relief, the plaintiffs appealed to the court. The statute then in effect provided, like the applicable present statute, that the \u201ccourt shall have power to grant such relief as shall to justice and equity appertain.\u201d Rev. 1888, \u00a7 3863. We said (p. 323): \u201cThere are two ways in which a taxpayer may be wronged in levying taxes. An assessment may conform to the statute generally, and the individual may be assessed in excess of the statutory requirement. A wrong of that description is easily redressed. But when the town disregards the statute and establishes a rule of its own, assessing the property at one half of its actual value, and then assesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>an individual at the full value of the property, while the injury is the same the application of the remedy becomes more complicated. Practically the only way to redress the wrong is to reduce the assessment; and that makes the court seem to disregard the statute; while if the wrong is not redressed there is a denial of justice; and the court practically ignores the statute giving an aggrieved party an appeal, and practically ignores the statute which provides that \u2018said court shall have power to grant such relief as shall to justice and equity appertain.\u2019 .... Thus we are in a dilemma. If we choose one horn .of it a public statute is violated\u2014not so much by the court as by the town\u2014but by an apparent approval of the court as to one individual; and that by an express command of another statute, and by the dictates of justice. If we take the other horn the court itself violates a remedial statute, and becomes in a measure a party to the wrong doing. Under the circumstances we do not hesitate to choose the former, and to redress the wrong.\u201d In other words we held that, although a judicial reduction of an assessment of property below its actual value was accomplishing what the statute forbade, the reduction was legally warranted under the language \u201c[the] court shall have power to grant such relief as shall to justice and equity appertain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The language quoted from \u00a7 1800 appears to give to the court broad equitable powers to adjust inequalities in the assessment of property for purposes of taxation. We cannot, however, construe it as expressing a legislative intent to confer upon the court the power to adjust inequalities in the assessed values of property when those values have been reached by applying a percentage of less than 100 per cent of the actual values of the property assessed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>in direct violation of the mandate contained in \u00a7\u00a7 1738 and 1047d. To make such an adjustment would necessarily result in the court\u2019s fixing a value below that prescribed by the statutes. Notwithstanding our recognition in the <em>Randell </em>case, supra, that the statutes required the assessors to place property in the tax list at 100 per cent of its actual value, we granted the plaintiffs in that case relief by fixing a valuation at less than 100 per cent of such value. The view which we take in the instant case is contrary to this, and the <em>Randell </em>case must therefore be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">We are unable to give categorical answers to the questions propounded. We can answer only generally by stating that the assessors acted contrary to law in assessing the plaintiff\u2019s property, save the motor vehicles, and that the board of tax review did not act illegally in refusing the plaintiff\u2019s request for reduction of the assessments of its personalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">No costs will be taxed in this court to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-9\"> \u201c1.
