We find nothing to support the claim that the statements by the defendant as to what he paid for the property or what he expected as a profit in reselling it were relied upon by the plaintiffs in making the purchase. The trial court found that these statements were not relied upon. Reliance upon claimed fraudulent representations is an essential element of an action for damages for such representations, and the failure of the plaintiffs to establish that reliance is fatal to their action. <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Oviatt, </em>86 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>63, 67, 84 A. 321.
