Lines. All of the parties requested the Superior Court to reserve the case for the advice of this court upon a stipulated set of facts. The interests of all the direct and collateral descendants \u2022of the testatrix that are known to any of the parties are represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">These material facts are stipulated: The testatrix \u2022died on October 29, 1902, at the age of eighty-two years, leaving a will dated January 16, 1902. The pertinent portions of the will are printed in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The testatrix\u2019 father and mother, William and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Ruth A. N. Kimberly, had died before 1902. In 1896, the testatrix had finished and caused to be printed a genealogical chart of the Kimberly family. She had compiled the data on the last four generations over a period of several years. Her husband, Augustus Lines, from whom she had inherited substantially all of the property she owned at the time of her death, had died in 1887. Her two children had predeceased her. One of them had married James H. Rowland, the father of Mabel S. Lloyd and Stuart L. Rowland. The only issue of the testatrix who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>survived her were these two grandchildren, who were the two life tenants named in her will. The testatrix had eleven brothers and sisters, eight of whom predeceased her. Five of those eight died without issue. Harriet N. K. Bostwick, Eliza K. Morehouse and William H. Kimberly, the other three of the eight sisters and brothers of the testatrix who died before her, left children who were living at her death. The testatrix\u2019 brothers Gilead, James and George survived her and left descendants. George was a contingent beneficiary of part of the income of the residuary trust created by the will. These three brothers died before the trust terminated on June 2,1953, the date of death of Mabel S. Lloyd. Stuart L. Rowland,, who was born on August 19,1878, died unmarried on November 10,1934. His sister, Mabel S. Lloyd, was his sole heir at law. He left no estate. Mabel, who was born on August 20,1879, left no surviving issue. Her husband survived her.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Leonard Bostwick, who was named executor and trustee in the will, is now deceased and The New Haven Bank N. B. A. is the duly qualified and acting successor trustee. The amount of the trust when it was originally turned over to the trustee in 1903 was $31,888.19. After the death of the last surviving life tenant, the successor trustee filed an account showing a balance of $72,366.53 on hand, subject to payment of the remaining administration expenses, and asked for an order of distribution. The Probate Court found that the remaindermen, beneficiaries and distributees of the trust estate are the following heirs at law of the testatrix: Gilead Kimberly, James Kimberly and George D. Kimberly, brothers of the testatrix; Mary R. K. Baldwin, Harriet Kimberly, Hattie K. Del Fosse and Frank W. Kimberly, nieces and nephew of the testatrix, being the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>of a deceased brother, William H. Kimberly; Leonard Bostwick and Harriet B. Patten, nephew and niece of the testatrix, being the children of a deceased sister, Harriet N. K. Bostwick; and Mary L. M. Lines, a niece of the testatrix, being the daughter of a deceased sister, Eliza K. Morehouse. Distribution was ordered to be made to these persons or to the estates of any of them who are deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The court reserved for our advice the question stated below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs are grandchildren of James Kimberly, a brother of the testatrix who survived her. He died on September 2, 1917, leaving a son, James W. Kimberly, and a daughter, Ruth A. Surdam. By his will all of his property was given to his daughter, and nothing was left to his son, who died in 1918 and was the father of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs claim that the testatrix intended, by her use of the words \u201cmy legal heirs\u201d in paragraph 6 of her will, to have take as remaindermen those persons determined to be her heirs at the termination of the last life interest, that of Mabel S. Lloyd, on June 2, 1953. The administrator c.t.a. on the estate of Mabel S. Lloyd contends that the intention of the testatrix was that the trust estate should go to the estates of Stuart L. Rowland and Mabel S. Lloyd. Other parties claim that the trust estate should be distributed, as ordered by the Probate Court, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>heirs of the testatrix as determined at the date of her death, excluding, however, her grandchildren Stuart L. Rowland and Mabel S. Lloyd.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The cardinal rule to be followed in construing the will of the testatrix is to find and effectuate her intent, as disclosed by what she said in the will. <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>143 Conn. 328, 335, 122 A.2d 307. In seeking that intent, the court looks first to the will itself. It examines the words and the language used in the light of the circumstances under which they were written. It studies the will as an entirety. The quest is to determine the meaning of what the testatrix said and not to speculate upon what she meant to say. <em>First National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Parish of St. Thomas\u2019 Church, </em>141 Conn. 489, 497, 107 A.2d 246; <em>Chase National Bank </em>v. <em>Guthrie, </em>139 Conn. 178, 182, 90 A.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The will of the testatrix was executed on January 16,1902. By it she gave her homestead and furniture to her granddaughter, Mabel S. Lloyd. The residue of her estate she gave in trust for the benefit of, and during the lifetime of, her two grandchildren, Mabel S. Lloyd and Stuart L. Rowland, subject to payments, not exceeding $25 a month, to be made from the net income to her brother, George D. Kimberly, during his life, if in the discretion of the trustee his \u201cpersonal needs\u201d should require such payments. Then followed these provisions: \u201c5. Upon the death of the last of my said grandchildren, said trust shall cease, and said trust estate shall be divided among the issue or the issue of issue of the body of either of my two grandchildren, if any should be living, said issue or issue of issue to take per stirpes and not per capita. 6. If there should be none of the issue or issue of issue of my said grandchildren living at the death of the last of my said grandchil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>dren, then I give said trust estate to nay legal heirs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u201cIt is a well settled rule of construction that a legacy given to a person or a class, to be paid or divided at a future time, takes effect in point of right on the death of the testator. In such case the contingency attaches, not to the substance of the gift, but to the time of payment. And where words are equivocal, leaving it in doubt whether the words of contingency or condition apply to the gift itself or the time of payment, courts are inclined to construe them as applying to the time of payment, and to hold the gift as vested rather than contingent.\u201d <em>Dale </em>v. <em>White, </em>33 Conn. 294, 296; <em>Bridgeport-City Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Lister, </em>140 Conn. 147, 152, 98 A.2d 811; <em>Bridgeport City Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>115 Conn. 269, 276, 161 A. 341. In <em>Close </em>v. <em>Benham, </em>97 Conn. 102, 104, 115 A. 626, we said: \u201cWe have adopted this rule in the belief that it leads to the early vesting of estates, and will carry out the probable intent of the testator, where the will indicates no contrary intent.\u201d In the instant case the will indicates no contrary intent. The decisive words, \u201cthen I give said trust to my legal heirs,\u201d in paragraph 6, are written in the present tense. The word \u201cthen,\u201d as it is used, is to be construed as the equivalent of \u201cin such a case\u201d or \u201cin that event.\u201d <em>First National Bank </em>v. <em>Somers, </em>106 Conn. 267, 275, 137 A. 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">If the determination of the \u201clegal heirs\u201d of the testatrix should be made as of the date of the termination of the last life estate, it might be made under a statute of distributions which would take effect many years after the death of the testatrix. She made her will about ten months before her death at the age of eighty-two. The two life tenants were then twenty-two and twenty-three years of age. We cannot assume that the testatrix intended the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>tribution to be to such persons as might be named in a statute of distributions which might be in force at the death of the last of her grandchildren, who were almost sixty years her junior. On the contrary, we regard it as obvious that the beneficiaries she had in mind were those who were then living. She knew who her beneficiaries were at the time she made her will. She could not know who they would be at some later date. We cannot assume that she would be willing to leave the determination of the objects of her bounty to some statute to be passed in the unknown future. <em>Bridgeport City Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>supra, 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The administrator c.t.a. on the estate of Mabel S. Lloyd contends that there is no clear and decisive showing that the testatrix intended to exclude the life tenants. \u201cWherever a life use is given, with remainder over to his issue, and, failing such, to the testator\u2019s children, heirs or next of kin, or other class, we think it must be presumed that the testator intended to exclude the life tenant from this class, unless a contrary intent is manifest in the language of the will.\u201d <em>Close </em>v. <em>Benham, </em>97 Conn. 102, 109, 115 A. 626; <em>Union &amp; New Haven Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Ackerman, </em>114 Conn. 152, 161, 158 A. 224. \u201cThe reason for this rule is that, when a testator has given a beneficiary a limited interest, such as a life estate, in a fund, prima facie it would appear that he did not intend to give that same beneficiary an added interest in the same fund.\u201d <em>Hartford-Connecticut Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Gowdy, </em>141 Conn. 546, 555, 107 A.2d 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The language of the will discloses the plain purpose of the testatrix to exclude her grandchildren, the life tenants. In paragraphs 5 and 6 she clearly stated that, upon the death of the last of her grandchildren, the trust should cease and be divided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>among the issue of her grandchildren and that if there should be no such issue the trust estate should go to her \u201clegal heirs.\u201d Both grandchildren died without issue. The testatrix is presumed to have known that the effect of a gift of the trust estate to her grandchildren would be to make it transmissible either by will or descent. Had it been her purpose to have her grandchildren\u2019s heirs, legal or testamentary, have the trust estate, the natural way to have accomplished it would have been to provide that if her grandchildren died without issue it should go, upon the death of the last of them, to their heirs or to such persons as they should appoint. Instead of this, the testatrix directed that, upon the death of the last of the grandchildren, if neither one of them left issue, the estate should go to her legal heirs. Her clear intention is shown by the language of the will. <em>Union &amp; New Haven Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Ackerman, </em>supra, 159; <em>Close </em>v. <em>Benham, </em>supra; <em>Nicoll </em>v. <em>Irby, </em>83 Conn. 530, 535, 77 A. 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">No intent contrary to the one that the testatrix intended to exclude her grandchildren is manifest in the language of the will. Moreover, the language used by her clearly and decisively shows that she intended to eliminate her grandchildren, who, otherwise, as her legal heirs would have been the distributees, and that she intended to have the trust estate go to those who would be determined to be the distributees under the statute providing for the distribution of an intestate estate when there are no children of the deceased or representatives of them. The heirs of Martha K. Lines as determined at the date of her death on October 29, 1902, excluding, however, her two grandchildren, Mabel S. Lloyd and Stuart L. Rowland, are the persons the testatrix intended to have take as remaindermen by her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>use of tbe words \u201cmy legal heirs\u201d in paragraph 6 of her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Our answer to the question reserved for our advice is that alternative (c) correctly designates those persons the testatrix intended to have take as remaindermen by her use of the words \u201cmy legal heirs\u201d in paragraph 6 of her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">No costs will be taxed in this court to any party. In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-8\"> <em>\u201c2. </em>I give, devise and bequeath to my grand-daughter, Mabel S. Lloyd, my homestead, Number 144 Olive Street, New Haven, Connecticut, together with the outbuildings and land connected therewith, and \u2022all furniture and beds, bedding and clothing of which I may die pos-sessed, to her and her heirs and assigns absolutely in fee simple and forever, with the request that said homestead and land bo never sold or alienated from the Augustus Lines blood while there is a lineal \u25a0descendant of my late husband, Augustus Lines, living who can hold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">\u201c3.
