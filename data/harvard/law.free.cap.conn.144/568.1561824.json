The finding, with such minor corrections as are warranted, supports the determination that the conduct of the defendant was cruel but not intolerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">\u201cIntolerable cruelty\u201d as used in \u00a7 7327 of the General Statutes has a subjective as well as an objective meaning. There must be not only proof of acts of cruelty on the part of the defendant but also proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>that in their cumulative effect upon the plaintiff they are intolerable in the sense of rendering the continuance of the marital relation unbearable. <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>Goddard, </em>143 Conn. 727, 118 A.2d 906; <em>Gowdy </em>v. <em>Gowdy, </em>120 Conn. 508, 510, 181 A. 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The burden was upon the plaintiff to prove intolerable cruelty. Since the finding cannot be corrected to include the ultimate fact of intolerable cruelty, the judgment cannot successfully be attacked. <em>Augur </em>v. <em>Augur, </em>133 Conn. 211, 213, 49 A.2d 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
