Mar\u00f3n, J.), dated June 30, 2014. The order, insofar as appealed from, granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the extent of awarding her the sum of $34,769.80 for attorneys\u2019 fees and reimbursing her $3,510 for fees paid to the attorney for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Ordered that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">The parties entered into a stipulation of settlement as to custody and visitation dated March 25, 2009, which was incorporated but not merged into their judgment of divorce dated May 28, 2009. In an order dated March 28, 2011, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Family Court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion to hold the defendant in civil contempt for his failure comply with the stipulation. By orders to show cause dated July 16, 2012, and January 19, 2013, respectively, the plaintiff again moved, this time in the Supreme Court, to hold the defendant in civil contempt for his violation of the stipulation. The orders to show cause were resolved by a so-ordered stipulation of settlement dated February 17, 2014, in which the parties agreed that the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted \u201cwillful contempt,\u201d that the punishment for the defendant\u2019s contempt would be suspended, and that the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees would be \u201cdecided upon submission on motion to the court.\u201d The plaintiff then moved for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees in the sum of $53,492.82 pursuant to, inter alia, the February 17, 2014, stipulation, Judiciary Law \u00a7 773, and Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 238, and for reimbursement of $3,510 for fees paid to the attorney for the child. The Supreme Court granted the motion to the extent of awarding the plaintiff $34,769.80 in attorneys\u2019 fees and awarding her reimbursement of $3,510 in fees for the attorney for the child. The defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\">The Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in awarding the plaintiff attorneys\u2019 fees <em>(see Mollah v Mollah, </em>136 AD3d 992, 994 [2016]; <em>Le v Le, </em>82 AD3d 846, 846 [2011]). We note that the plaintiff has not cross-appealed and, therefore, we review the amount of the award solely to determine whether it was excessive <em>(see </em>CPLR 5501; <em>Hecht v City of New York, </em>60 NY2d 57, 61-62 [1983]). The detailed billing records submitted by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel establish that the legal fees were reasonable and directly related to the defendant\u2019s contemptuous conduct, and the amount of the award did not constitute an improvident exercise of discretion <em>(see Matter of Gonnard v Guido, </em>141 AD3d 649, 650 [2016]; <em>Pelgrim v Pelgrim, </em>127 AD3d 710, 714 [2015]). Further, the award of reimbursement for fees paid to the attorney for the child was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">The defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<judges id=\"AS84\">Rivera, J.R, Austin, Roman and Connolly, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
