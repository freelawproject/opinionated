They are bounded on the west and south by Front and Madison streets. The grade of Front Street was established by competent authority long prior to the erection of the bridge in question. That of Madison, from Front to the river, has never been established, except as the authority given for the erection of such bridge and its western approach may have served for the purpose. The Columbia Street Bridg-e Company, a private corporation, was, by an act of the legislative assembly approved Feb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>ruary 26, 1885, and amended February 25, 1889, granted the right, privilege, and authority to construct and maintain a bridge across the Willamette River, between the cities of Portland and East Portland, for any and all purposes of travel and commerce. Among other thing's, it was thereby provided: \u201cSaid bridge shall be constructed of iron, or of wood and iron, and shall be conveniently arranged for the safe passage of wagons and other vehicles, and shall have proper sidewalks for pedestrians, and such bridge shall be so constructed, maintained and used from, on, and along Madison Street and [in] the City of Portland to, on, and along Hawthorne Avenue [otherwise designated and formerly known as \u2018Asylum Street\u2019] in the said City of East Portland. * * * Said bridge shall conform to the grade of Front Street in Portland and Water Street in East Portland.\u201d The corporation and its assigns were empowered to take tolls, but the County Court of Multnomah County was authorized to fix and regulate the rates thereof from time to time as occasion seemed to demand. The bridge was constructed in pursuance of the authority thus granted, but at the time of its construction an open roadway, 14J2 feet in width, was left in the center of its western approach, leading from the eastern line of Front Street down the incline on Madison Street, giving ingress and egress to plaintiff\u2019s buildings situate on his lots on the river bank, which are much lower than the bridg'e approach.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-4\">In November, 1891, the Bridge Committee appointed by authority of an act of the legislative assembly, filed in the office of the Secretary of State February 18, 1891, purchased said bridge pursuant to the provisions of the act, and continued in the management arid control thereof until about June 20 following, when the Multnomah county court assumed the management and control, in pursuance of an act of the legislative assembly adopted February 1, 1895, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>has continued in such management and control ever since. In April the Bridge Committee, claiming to act in pursuance of lawful authority, planked over and closed up the said opening, and caused said west approach to be made even and solid. Before closing the opening or roadway the commission petitioned the common council of the City of Portland, praying its consent thereto, which was accorded, with a proviso, however, that the \u201ccommission restore the driveway if not satisfactory to property owners.\u201d The approach, since the closing up of said opening, has been kept and maintained in that condition to the present time, and the plaintiff has been and is now deprived of the means of ingress and egress with teams and vehicles to and from his said buildings by way of Madison Street. The bridge has, ever since its completion, been used by the general public. The Columbia Street Bridge Company charged and received tolls for the use of the bridge up to the time the Bridge Committee acquired the same, ever since which time it has been free to the general public. The defendant, the East Side Railway Company, has a franchise for operating its street railway upon and over said bridge, and is now maintaining a double track' thereon, and directly over the space formerly left open for the roadway. The western approach, extending from Front Street to the main part of the bridge, is 261 feet in length, and is constructed so as to conform to- the grade of said street. The plaintiff brings this suit against Multnomah County, the City of Portland, and the said East Side Railway Company, to enjoin each of them from maintaining the said bridge and the western approach thereof in its present condition, and to require them to reopen the said roadway from Front Street to the plaintiff\u2019s water-front buildings. The defendants prevailed in the court below, and the plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Apq\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>For appellant there was a brief over the name of <em>Fenton, Broncmgh &amp; Muir, </em>with an oral argument by <em>Mr. William T. Muir.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-3\">No grade has ever been established on Madison Street from the east line of Front Street to the river. This act does not assume to establish a grade; it merely grants a franchise to a private corporation and restricts and regulates the method of exercising the powers granted: <em>Willamette Iron Works </em>v. <em>Oregon Ry. &amp; Nav. Co., </em>26 Or. 228, 229 (29 L. R. A. 88, 37 Pac. 1016, 46 Am. St. Rep. 620); <em>McQuaid </em>v. <em>Port. &amp; Vanc. Ry. Co., </em>18 Or. 237 (22 Pac. 899).</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-4\">The approach, when originally constructed, was and could be used only by those traveling over this toll bridge. The act did not grant the corporation the power of eminent domain. The building of a solid elevated roadway from the west end of the bridge 261 feet to- the east line of Front Street, would necessarily destroy the right of ingress to and egress from the plaintiff\u2019s property, and render access to the river front impossible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-5\">This closing up of the open space in\" the bridge approach measurably destroys plaintiff\u2019s right of ingress to and egress from a portion of his property abutting on Madison Street and utterly cuts off all access to that portion of it facing the Willamette River. This right of ingress and egress is property, and cannot be destroyed by either the legislature or city council, nor can it be taken without compensation: 2 Dillon, Mun. Corp.

They are so dependent because their beginning and subsequent continuation are inseparable from the streets, and because they arise and exist out of the relation which the lot, to which they are appurtenant, bears to the adjoining streets. In addition to the right of safe and unobstructed travel, the abutting- owner has a special and private right to use the street as a me\"ans of access <em>to </em>his property. This easement he may protect, and, in the protection of it, he may insist that no structure shall be placed or maintained in the street which, although it may be beneficial in a sense to the public at large, is detrimental to him as the owner of property affected: <em>Willamette Iron Works </em>v. <em>Oregon Ry. &amp; Nav.

Whatever authority a municipality may enjoy or possess, pertaining to its streets and highways, must be derived from the legislative assembly through its franchise or charter; and such a corporation acts, if at all, through a delegated power emanating from the initial source: 2 Dillon, Munic. Corp. (4 ed.), \u00a7\u00a7 680, 683; <em>Winters </em>v. George, 21 Or. 251, 259 (27 Pac. 1041); <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Northup, </em>27 Or. 487, 501 (40 Pac. 560, 30 L. R. A. 171). Nor does the mere fact that the state has delegated certain powers to the municipality inhibit it from again resuming or exercising such powers. Hence it is said: \u201cThe legislature of the state represents the public at large, and has, in the absence of special constitutional restraint, and subject (according to the weight of more recent judicial opinion) to the property rights and easements of the abutting owner, full and paramount authority over all public ways arid public places\u201d : 2 Dillon, Munic. Corp. (4 ed.), \u00a7 656. The logical and cogent result of these principles is that the state, as well as the cities and towns to which it has previously delegated the requisite authority, may fix and establish the grade of the streets and public highways within the corporate limits of such municipalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> Whatever right the municipality may acquire in and about its public streets \u2014 whether through dedication or by condemnatory proceedings, or whatever may be the property interests which remain or are left vested in the owner of property abutting thereon, it has come to be settled, if ever it was seriously controverted, that they cannot be burdened with any additional servitude, other than that which properly and legitimately attaches to them as public streets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>and highways, without just compensation being made to the abutting lot owner: <em>Willamette Iron Works </em>v. <em>Oregon Ry. &amp; Nav. Co., </em>24 Or. 224 (46 Am. St. Rep. 620, 29 L. R. A. 88, 37 Pac. 1016); <em>Huddleston </em>v. <em>City of Eugene, </em>34 Or. 343 (43 L. R. A. 444, 1 Munic. Corp. Cas. 3340, 55 Pac. 868); <em>Barney </em>v. <em>Keokuk, </em>94 U. S. 324, 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> The authorities are uniform to the purpose, however, that a municipality does not entail any liability for consequential damages resulting from the fixing or establishment of a street grade, unless specially required to respond by some constitutional, statutory, or charter provision: 2 Dillon, Munic. Corp. (4 ed.), \u00a7 686; <em>Willamette Iron Works </em>v. <em>Oregon Ry. &amp; Nav. Co., </em>26 Or. 224 (29 L. R. A. 88, 37 Pac. 1016, 46 Am. St. Rep. 620); <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Mayor of Baltimore, </em>65 Md. 171 (3 Atl. 594).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><bracketnum>4.</bracketnum> The authorized establishment of a street grade, although the change may result in consequential damages to the abutting property, is not a \u201ctaking,\u201d within the meaning of the clause of our constitution (Const. Or. Art. I, \u00a7 18), providing that \u201cprivate property shall not be taken for public use.\u201d The doctrine is well illustrated by the case of <em>Northern Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>99 U. S. 635, where the legal distinction is specifically drawn between the term \u201ctaken,\u201d as used in the Constitution of the United States and the earlier state constitutions, and the phrase \u201ctaken or damaged,\u201d in the later ones. It is there said: \u201cActs done in the proper exercise of governmental powers, and not directly encroaching upon private property, though their consequences may impair its use, are universally held not to be a taking, within the meaning of the constitutional provision.\u201d After the work complained of in that case had been substantially completed, the people of Illinois adopted another constitution, whereby it was ordained that private property should not be taken or damaged for public use without compensation; and, as thus adopted, it was held to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>be an enlargement of the common provision for the protection of private property. In a later case <em>(Chicago </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>125 U. S. 161, 166, 8 Sup. Ct. 820), which directly involved its construction, it was held that it \u201crequired compensation in all cases where it appeared that there had been some physical disturbance of a right, 'either public or private, which the plaintiff enjoys in connection with his property, and which gives to it an additional value, and that by reason of such disturbance he has sustained a special damage with respect to his property in excess of that sustained by the .public generally.\u201d It is apparent that the interpolation of the words \u201cor damaged\u201d constitutes an innovation upon the usual provision, and explains the divergent views of the courts on the subject, and this is a cogent re-enforcement of the doctrine as quite uniformly maintained and held to under the United States Constitution, and those state constitutions containing a like or similar provision in respect of the \u201ctaking\u201d of private property for public use. Judge Cooley states the generally accepted rule as follows: \u201cAny proper exercise of the powers of government which does not directly encroach upon the property of an individual, or disturb him in its possession or enjoyment, will not entitle him to compensation or give him a right of action\u201d: Cooley, Const. Lim. (6 ed.), 666. The rule was directly applied by him, while upon the bench, in the case of <em>City of Pontiac </em>v. Carter, 32 Mich. 164, which was an action to recover damages for raising the grade of a public way, wherein he asserts that the weight of authority against the action is overwhelming, and sustains the assertion by a citation and review of a great number of cases. In further support of the rule, see <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>City of Clinton, </em>79 Mo. 603; <em>Kehrer </em>v. <em>Richmond City, </em>81 Va. 745; <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Hartford Bridge Co., </em>29 Conn. 523; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Corporation of Washington, </em>61 U.

Dec. 307); <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>Chicago, </em>26 Ill. 249. A bridge connecting public highways, and erected for the general use and accommodation of the public, whether built and maintained at public expense, or by a private corporation authorized to charge and collect tolls from persons using the sanie, is itself a public highway, and constitutes part of the highways with which it is connected: <em>Pittsburg &amp; W. E. Pass. Ry. </em>v. <em>Point Bridge Co., </em>165 Pa. St. 37 (30 Atl. 511, 26 L. R. A. 323).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><bracketnum>5.</bracketnum> In this connection it may be stated, as a general proposition, that, when a franchise or license to take tolls has expired, thereafter the right to- the free use of such bridge as a public highway becomes vested in the people: <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Lawrence Bridge Co., </em>22 Kan. 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><bracketnum>6.</bracketnum> We come now to an application of these principles to the facts which characterize this case. The legislature, in granting authority to1 construct the Madison Street Bridge, specialty prescribed that its western approach should conform to the grade of Front Street, and it was so constructed, in observance with the legislative will. The width of the bridge was not designated in the act, 'but the grant carried with it the authority to erect such a structure as would reasonably accommodate public travel across the river at that point; and no question is made that the structure is unnecessarily cumbersome, or occupies more space than is requisite to meet the demand. As constructed, it practically occupies Madison Street, from First Street to the river, and constitutes an elevated roadway above the original surface of the street; and the broad contention is that the bridge constitutes an additional servitude upon the street, which plaintiff is entitled to have abated, or the structure so modified from its present condition as to give plaintiff access to his waterfront buildings. We are of the opinion that the grant of authority to the bridge company to erect a bridge connecting the public highways theretofore terminating at the river banks, particularly specifying that the structure should con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>form at its western approach to the grade of Front Street, was, under the conditions prevailing, an establishment of the grade of that part of Madison Street to be occupied by-said approach. It has resulted in an entire diversion of public travel from the original surface of Madison Street to the highway constituted by the bridge structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><bracketnum>7.</bracketnum> In <em>Wilkin </em>v. <em>City of St. Paul, </em>33 Minn. 181 (22 N. W. 249), the defendant entered into a contract with certain railroad companies which were maintaining tracks and operating railroads upon Third Street in said city, whereby the companies agreed to construct upon the southerly portion of the street, over the tracks, and 20 feet above the established grade, a roadway 24 feet wide, with projecting sidewalks increasing its width to 36 feet, leaving uncovered and unoccupied 30 feet of the street. It was further agreed that the companies should construct approaches leading up to the roadway of the bridge, and should close and keep closed for travel that part of the street lying along the bridge and not occupied thereby, so as to deflect such travel to the bridge. An injunction was granted, upon the suit of the owner of lots abutting upon that portion of the street to be occupied by the bridge structure, restraining the companies from carrying the contract into effect, upon the ground that it would result in a change of the grade of that part of the street occupied by the bridge; and upon appeal to the supreme court the injunction was sustained. It was held that the contemplated work was intended to, and would, raise the established grade 20 feet; that, in effect, it would make the grade of the bridge, and necessarily of the approaches to it, the traveled street grade.between the two ends of the work; and such grade not having been established, and compensation paid the abutter, as required by the city charter, the work was consequently restrained. The central idea upon which the case turned was that the purpose of the authorities was to bring about an actual change of grade, and that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>would be the effect, in practical operation, if the contract was carried out, and, such being its effect, the change could not be legally accomplished in that manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">In another case <em>(Selden </em>v. <em>City of Jacksonville, </em>28 Fla. 558, 14 L. R. A. 370, 10 South. 457, 29 Am. St. Rep. 278), a suit was instituted to enjoin the construction of a viaduct over and above numerous railroad crossings upon a public street by four railway companies under an agreement with the county and city, and to make the surface of the viaduct, instead of the original surface of the occupied street, the grade for public use and travel. It was held that the construction of the viaduct would effectuate a change of grade, and the suit having proceeded upon the theory that the municipal government of Jacksonville was erecting the structure, not as a joint party with the other parties to the agreement, but in the due exercise of its charter powers to change the grade of streets, though under agreement with the several parties named as co-defendants, by which they were to contribute to the expenses, it was concluded that the viaduct would not become or constitute an additional servitude upon the street, for which compensation should be recovered. So, in <em>Willets Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Chosen Freeholders of Mercer Co., </em>62 N. J. Law, 95 (40 Atl. 782), it was held that, a bridge having been constructed for the purpose of joining together the two parts of the highway bisected by a waterway, the approaches thereto became a part of the highway, and that they constituted no additional burden thereupon. In that case the City of Trenton had, by proper proceeding's taken for the purpose, acquired the right to use the <em>locus in quo </em>for the purpose of the public highway. These cases, while not to the exact purpose, serve to indicate very clearly what acts would be considered or would constitute an actual change of grade; so that, if the legislative assembly has employed language in connection with the subject-matter calculated to induce the doing of such acts, we must conclude th\u00e1t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>it intended to establish the grade, and to require the change, in pursuance of the exercise of the franchise granted. The language of the act is that said approach \u201cshall conform to the grade of Front Street.\u201d The bridge itself was to become a highway, and the approaches constitute a part of it. The legislative purpose was to divert the public travel upon the bridge \u2014 the newly-constituted highway \u2014 which wras to occupy, so far as the western approach is concerned, that portion of Madison Street extending from Front Street to the river. So the conclusion is inevitable that the legislative will was also- to establish the grade in conformity with Front Street when it required the structure to conform to the grade of that street, and such is the legitimate effect of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\">It is stoutly contended that the case of <em>Willamette Iron Works </em>v. <em>Oregon Ry. &amp; Nav. Co., </em>26 Or. 224 (46 Am. St. Rep. 620, 29 L. R. A. 88, 37 Pac. 1016), ought to be, and is, controlling, to the purpose that the Madison Street approach constitutes an additional servitude. But there is a radical distinction between-the two cases. In that case the approach was constructed without pretense of a grant of authority to change the grade of the street; nor did it, or the bridge to which it was joined, form any part of, or an extension of, any public highway. Not so with the case at bar. The bridge and the approaches, as we have seen, form and constitute a part of the public highway, meeting and joining public streets or highways, extending to the river at each end thereof, giving continuous travel from and upon said streets upon and across the bridge; and the approach complained of, being constructed upon the authorized grade of Madison Street, constitutes the established grade thereof, supplanting the Madison Street surface, as used and occupied prior to its construction. It is true that, in the construction of the bridge by the Columbia Street Bridge Company, it left the roadway open through the approach on Mad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ison Street leading to- plaintiff\u2019s water-front buildings; but it is apparent from what we have said that it was not required to do so, being authorized, in a practical sense, to raise the surface grade of the street by means of the approach. The leaving of the roadway was but a matter of accommodation, to meet the convenience of the property interests on the river bank, subject to be closed at the behest of the bridge company. The Bridge Committee succeeded to all the powers and authority granted to the bridge company under the franchise, and, among others, the right and authority to close up the roadway leading to the water front, and thus make the bridge approach a solid structure throughout its entire width. , The fact that permission was asked of the City of Portland, and granted, upon the condition that the commission restore the roadway if not satisfactory to property owners, does not alter the case. There was no attempt by the city to alter the grade of the street; nor could it, if it had so desired, accomplish such a purpose in that manner. The only purpose was to give its consent in so far as it had any control in the premises, to the Bridge Committee to act; the committee being, in a substantial sense, the agent of the city. Subsequently, however, the city became the owner of the bridge and franchise, and, the county -having assumed the operation thereof, insists that' the roadway shall be kept closed; so that the bridge company having been granted the authority in the first instance to raise the surface grade of the street by means of the solid approach to the bridge, and the present authorities having succeeded to the franchise, it follows that they have the right to so maintain it. This view of the case is strengthened by reason of the fact that the bridge company has surrendered its franchise and right to take tolls, so that, in practical operation, its free use has become vested in the public; thus disendowing it of the only remaining characteristic of a private concern, and putting it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>upon the broad basis of a public highway, to all intents and purposes.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AWj\">For appellant there was an additional brief by <em>Mr. William D.

The pivotal issue is whether the bridge, with its approach upon Madison Street, constitutes an additional servitude, or has perverted the street to other than legitimate street purposes. If such is its effect, the plaintiff presents a substantial basis for a decree in accordance with the prayer of his complaint; otherwise not. There is but little, if any, conflict in the law, which is aptly and succinctly stated, with its proper limitations and distinctions, in <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Winona City, </em>59 Minn. 27 (60 N. W. 814, 26 L. R. A. 142). In that case the city, under authority of the state and national legislatures, constructed a bridge across the Mississippi River, the approach of which extended a considerable distance along the center <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>of one of the streets of the city, and past the plaintiff\u2019s property, and the question arose whether it constituted an additional servitude, in determining which Mr. Justice Mitchell says: \u201cThe doctrine of the courts everywhere, both in England and in this country (unless Ohio and Kentucky are exceptions), is that, so long as there is no application of the street to purposes other than those of a highway, any establishment or change of grade made lawfully, and not negligently performed, does not impose an additional servitude upon the street, and hence is not within the constitutional inhibition against taking private property without compensation, and is not the basis for an action for damages, unless there be an express statute to that effect. That this is the rule, and that the facts of this case fall within it, is too well established by the decisions of this court to require the citation of authorities from other jurisdictions: <em>Lee </em>v. <em>City of Minneapolis, </em>22 Minn. 13; <em>Alden </em>v. <em>City of Minneapolis, </em>24 Minn. 254; <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>City of Minneapolis, </em>32 Minn. 319 (20 N. W. 322); <em>Yanish </em>v. <em>City of St. Paul, </em>50 Minn. 518 (52 N. W. 925). See, also, <em>Northern Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>City of Chicago, </em>99 U. S. 635; <em>Selden </em>v. <em>City of Jacksonville, </em>28 Fla. 558 (10 South. 457, 14 L. R. A. 370, 29 Am. St. Rep. 278). The New York elevated railway cases cited by plaintiff are not authority in his favor, for they recognize and affirm the very doctrine that we have laid down in <em>Story </em>v. <em>New York Elev. Ry. Co., </em>90 N. Y. 122 (43 Am. Rep. 146), but hold that the construction and maintenance on the street of an elevated railroad operated by steam, and which was not open to the public for the purpose of travel and traffic, was a perversion of the street from street uses, and imposed upon it an additional servitude which entitled abutting owners to damages. Neither does <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Chicago B. &amp; N. R. R. Co., </em>39 Minn. 286 (12 Am. St. Rep. 644, 39 N. W. 629, 1 L. R. A. 493), aid the plaintiff, for that case proceeds upon the proposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>that the construction and maintenance of an ordinary commercial railway upon a street is the imposition of an additional servitude. Plaintiff also cites numerous cases as to what constitutes a \u2018taking\u2019 of private property. The law of those cases is unquestioned. There is no doubt that the acts of the city would amount to a taking of plaintiff\u2019s property, so as to entitle him to compensation, provided the use made of the street by the city imposed an additional servitude upon it; but that is the very question in the case. Our conclusion is that the construction and maintenance of this bridge approach did not impose an additional servitude upon the street, but was a proper street use, and hence constitutes no basis for an action in favor of plaintiff for damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AR0\">This case affords a complete answer to the counsel\u2019s contention that there is a \u201ctaking\u201d in the present instance, within the purview of the state and national constitutions, and, as the reasoning- of the learned justice is so apt for our present purposes, we have taken the liberty to quote at much length from the opinion. The doctrine of the New York elevated railway cases and of <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Chicago B. &amp; N. R. R. Co., </em>39 Minn. 286 (1 L. R. A. 493, 39 N. W. 629, 12 Am. St. Rep. 644), is not questioned, but it is not applicable to this controversy. In those cases there was an additional servitude created \u2014 in the former, by the construction of the elevated railway; and, in the latter, by an ordinary commercial railroad upon the streets. Other New York cases present apt illustrations of the distinction which obtains between the legal effect of a structure which constitutes an additional servitude and one which is effective merely in producing a change in the street grade. They hold that the construction of an ordinary railroad upon a street is an additional burden or servitude, for which compensation may be recovered, yet that the change of a grade upon lateral streets, made necessary to effectuate a convenient crossing of the railroad, does not constitute a burden for which the abutter is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>compensation: Rand, Em. Dom., \u00a7 399; <em>Uline v. New York etc., R. R. Co., </em>101 N. Y. 98 (4 N. E. 536, 53 Am. St. Rep. 123); <em>Conklin </em>v. <em>New York L. &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>102 N. Y. 107 (6 N. E. 663); <em>Rauenstein v. New York L. &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>136 N. Y. 528 (32 N. E. 1047, 18 L. R. A. 768). To the same purpose, see, also, <em>Robinson v. Great Northern Ry. Co., </em>48 Minn. 445 (51 N. W. 384); and <em>Wead </em>v. <em>St. Johnsbury &amp; L. C. R. R. Co., </em>64 Vt. 52 (24 Atl. 361).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\">All these approve the doctrine that a mere change in a street grade, lawfully accomplished, without negligence or carelessness on the part of the proper authorities, does not entitle the abutters to compensation for any inconvenience that may be entailed thereby. It was said in <em>Conklin </em>v. <em>New York L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., </em>102 N. Y. 107 (6 N. E. 663), Mr. Justice Finch speaking for the court: \u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s fee in it to its center line was not subjected to a new or different use involving a new or added compensation, but it remained unchanged as the public highway originally laid out in everything but its grade. If it became such by dedication, compensation for the easement was expressly waived. If taken .by right of eminent domain, the compensation paid covered all the damages sustained, among which were necessarily embraced such as might flow from a change of grade required for the public use and convenience. That might be altered by any lawful authority, and whatever of injury or inconvenience should result to the abutting owner was either waived by the dedication, or paid for by the original compensation, SO' that a change of grade upon a highway invades no private right. The contrary doctrine once held <em>(Fletcher </em>v. <em>Auburn &amp; S. R. R. Co., </em>25 Wend. 462), has been effectually overruled <em>(Radcliff's Ex'rs. </em>v. <em>Mayor of Brooklyn, </em>4 N. Y. 195, 53 Am. Dec. 357; <em>Bellinger </em>v. <em>New York C. R. R. Co., </em>23 N. Y. 42; <em>Selden </em>v. <em>Delaware Canal Co., </em>29 N. Y. 634). The appellant here relies upon <em>Story </em>v. <em>New York Elev. Ry. Co., 90 </em>N. Y. 122 (43 Am. Rep. 146). That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>case was not intended to thus unsettle the law, for it expressly excluded from its operation injuries resulting from changes of grade.\u201d Nor do the cases of <em>Pumpelly </em>v. <em>Green Bay Canal Co., </em>80 U. S. (13 Wall.), 166; <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Boston C. &amp; M. R. R., </em>51 N. H. 504 (12 Am. Rep. 147), and others holding to the same doctrine, help the plaintiff, for in those cases there was a physical invasion of the real estate of the private owner by a permanent flooding, which was regarded as a taking within the meaning of the constitutional inhibition. These cases are characterized by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller in <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>United States, 166 </em>U. S. 269 (17 Sup. Ct. 578), as containing the \u201cextremest qualification\u201d upon the doctrine which is everywhere established except, perhaps, in Ohio and Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><em>Willis </em>v. <em>Winona City, </em>59 Minn. 27 (26 L. R. A. 142, 60 N. W. 814), is in point and authoritative to the purpose that the bridge approach constructed upon Madison Street does not constitute an additional servitude thereon. It is also authority for the other proposition held to in the first opinion, namely, that the legislative authority given the bridge company to construct the bridge and its approach, specifying that such approach should be put upon the established grade of Front Street, was in itself an establishment of the grade upon that part of the street occupied by the approach. Mr. Justice Mitchell says: \u201cThe bridge is just as much a public highway aso is Main Street, with which it connects; and, whether we consider the approach as a part of the former or of the latter, it is merely a part of the highway. The city having, as it was authorized to do, established a new highway across the Mississippi River, it was necessary to connect it, for the purpose of travel, with Main and the other streets of the city. This it has done, in the only way it could have been done, by what, in effect, amounts merely to raising the grade of the center of Main Street in front of plaintiff\u2019s lot. It can make no difference in principle whether this was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>done by filling up the street solidly, or, as in this case, by supporting the way on stone or iron columns. Neither is it important that the city raised the grade of only a part of the street, leaving the remainder at a lower grade.\u201d So, too, it was held in <em>Colclough </em>v. <em>City of Milwaukee, </em>92 Wis. 182 (66 N. W. 110), that the construction, under legislative authority, of an elevated approach to a viaduct which occupied the whole street, constituted but a mere change of the grade thereof for the corresponding distance, but not an additional servitude for which the abutter was entitled to compensation. Mr. Justice Pinney says: \u201cIt is impossible, we think, to maintain that the construction of this approach to the viaduct is not really a mere change of the grade of the street for the corresponding- distance, and of .which it takes the place. It is in the nature of a bridge which is an extension of a highway or street, and the street beneath is practically discontinued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><bracketnum>9.</bracketnum> We feel assured that our former opinion is sound upon the proposition; but, if we are mistaken in this, the act of 1898 (Sess. Laws 1898, p, 185, \u00a7 231), declaring the bridge approach to be the established grade of Madison Street so far as occupied thereby is curative of the irregularities complained of, although such act may have been adopted after the commencement, or even decision, of the present suit in the court below: <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Wheeling Bridge Co., </em>59 U. S. (18 How.), 421, and <em>The Clinton Bridge, </em>77 U. S. (10 Wall.), 454. For the reasons here stated, the former opinion will be adhered to.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Affirmed on Rehearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
