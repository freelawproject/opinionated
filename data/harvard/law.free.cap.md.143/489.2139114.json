They relate to the admissibility of evidence in a trial which resulted in the conviction of the appellant under an indictment charging him and others with having engaged in a conspiracy to obstruct the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">The issues of fact and law in th\u00a9 case were tried before Ciitef Judge Gorter, and Associate Judges Boyd, Duffy Staytoy and Steiy of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City. It is earnestly contended that, their decision against the appellant was improperly influenced by the admission of the testimony to which the numerous exceptions refer. In the brief submitted by the appellant\u2019s able counsel it is further insisted that, reg-ardlessi of the exceptions in the. record, there was such manifest error in the conviction, in view of all the evidence, as to justify a reversal of the judgment and a remand of the case for a new .trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>This Court has no authority to decide as to the appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence. That duty and responsibility rested upon the five judges before whom, as a jury, the case was tried iu the lower Court. Under the Constitution of our State, and in their capacity as a jury, they were \u201cthe judges of law, as well as of fact\u201d in the ease. It is therefore; not within our jurisdiction, as an appellate tribunal, to determine as to tbe legal sufficiency of the evidence upon which the vferdiet was rendered. <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>State, </em>126 Md. 223; <em>Jessup </em>v. <em>State, 117 </em>Md. 119. The only judicial concern we can have; with respect to the evidence, is. to ascertain whether any ruling of the trial court as to the admissibility of any portion of it was erroneous and tended to prejudice the appellant\u2019s! interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">In the indictment under which the appellant was tried it is charged that he conspired with John Keller and Walter Socolow to convey certain misleading information to police officers and to the State's Attorney of Baltimore City for the purpose of obstructing the prosecution of Socolow and others for the murder of Willi ami B. Korris, by discrediting a confession obtained from E'rank L. Allers, one of the participants in tbe robbery in the. course of which the homicide occurred. Those implicated by tbe confession, besides. Allers himself, were Socolow, John L. Strath, Charles. P. Carey and James Hart. When the confession was made Socolow and Hart were still at large. Keller had no part in the robbery or murder, but subsequently aided Socolow and Hart while they were evading arrest. The plan of deception, which the appellant was alleged to have agreed to&gt; and promoted, was to have Keller first secure the confidence of the prosecuting officers, by conducting Police Captain Inverton to the place where the cash box taken in the robbery, and the license tags of the automobile used by the bandits, had been secreted, and then make the statement, that he had heard Allers say he was \u201cframing\u201d Socolow. The suggestion of this scheme is said to have been made by Socolow, and to. have been accepted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>the appellant and Keller, in an interview' at the appellant\u2019s home on the evening of the day on which the confession of Allers appeared in the newspapers. On the following day Keller met Oaptain Leverton at the appellant\u2019s law office and went with the officer to a pond from which the cash box and license tags sought for were recovered. Soon afterwards, at the Central Police Station, Keller told Inspector Hurley and Mr. O\u2019Oonnor, Deputy State\u2019s Attorney, that he heard Allers say: \u201cMow is the time to frame Socolow, Wiggles (meaning Smith) and Carey.\u201d This statement is proved to have been false, and Keller testified, in effect, asi a witness for the State, that it was planned in the interview with the appellant and Socolow on the occasion we have mentioned.' There was a positive contradiction of Keller on this- point by the appellant and by Socolow in their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The admissibility of the evidence with which the exceptions are concerned must, of course, be considered with- particular reference to the precise nature of the charge sought to he proved. The specific purpose of the conspiracy into which the appellant is accused of having entered- was to obstruct jus-ticei by means of -a false and misleading' statement to be made to the prosecuting officers by one of the conspirators. Any evidence having a legitimate tendency to- support that accusation was not subject to a valid exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Tn discussing and disposing of the exceptions we shall follow generally the order and classification adopted in the appellant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">There are ten exceptions which relate to the admission of evidence that, in the interval between the murder of Mr. Morris, on August 18-th last, and the -time of the interview of Keller and Socolow with the appellant, which occurred on the night of August 23rd, the police had been searching for Socolow, Hart, Smith and Lewis, who were suspected of having participated in the -crime, that the automobile used by those who committed it had been located, that Smith and Lewis had been arrested, that Allers had voluntarily surreal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>dered and had confessed, that on the afternoon of August 23rd his confession had been published in the Baltimore Evening Sun, and that the appellant had represented Socolow in a criminal case, in April, 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">In order that the significance of the alleged conspiracy might, be understood it was proper that the State should prove the conditions to which it related. The principal facts to- which the evidence just referred to was directed were averred in the indictment. They were proved, as they had been alleged, for the purpose of presenting the case in its proper perspective. To support the theory of the indictment, that the appellant conspired to defeat the prosecution of Soeolow, and his associates in the robbery and murder of Mr. Norris, it was permissible to offer evidence of the fact that such, a prosecution was impending. As, the appellant was. charged with having conspired to discredit a confession upon which the- State would rely, it was material to prove that the confession had been made and had been given such publicity as to- justify the inference that it had come to the appellant\u2019s knowledge before the interview in which rbe conspiracy is said to have had its inception. The evidence that the appellant had previously acted as Soeolow\u2019s attorney was unobjectionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Til,ero are three exceptions in the second group to be considered. They refer to admitted testimony of Keller to the effect that he was with Hart and Soeolow on the night of August 20th and went with them to a, garage^ where the money box and license tags already mentioned had been concealed, and helped them to take those articles to- thei pond from -which they were afterwards recovered by the police with Ms aid. This testimony describes conditions directly related to the conspiracy charged. The association of Keller with the men who disposed of the. cash box and license tags, and his knowledge of the place where they had been deposited, were facts to he used, according to Ihe State\u2019s theory, in the promotion of the unlawful project with which it proposed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>prove the appellant to have been identified. It was to those facts that the statement made by Keller to the police primarily had reference. He testified that they were narrated to the appellant in the interview at his home. The alleged suggestion by Socolow, in which the conspiracy is said to have originated, was to have Keller tell the police that it was Allers whom he accompanied to the garage and the pond when the cash box and license tags were disposed of, and the declaration to he attributed to Allers, as to his Intention to \u201cframe\u201d Socolow, was to he reported as having been made on that occasion. It seems clear to us that the evidence on this subject was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Seven exceptions relate to testimony of Police Oommissioner Gaither as to offer\u2019s made by the appellant, on the day of the murder of Mr. Harris, and on the following day, to aid the Police Department in discovering the perpetrators of the crime, and as to' a statement by the appellant of his belief that it was not committed by local mien but by certain persons from other cities whose presence' in Baltimore he had heard of and whose movements he regarded as suspicious. There are two exceptions to testimony of a representative of the Baltimore Sun that ait his request, on the night of August 18th, the appellant promised to give any aid in his power to the efforts being made to locate and arrest the men guilty of the murder. The declarations of the appellant, to which the nine last noted exceptions relate, were made some days before the occasion for the alleged conspiracy had arisen or could have been anticipated. The effect of the testimony .as to those declarations was to prove an interest on the part of the appellant which appears to have been free of any ulterior motive and which did not tend to support the specific charge with which he was confronted at the trial. It could not he reasonably inferred from his offer of assistance to' the Police Department, and his suggestion as to the probability of the crime having been committed by men who had come from other cities, that he was entertaining the thought of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>entering into a scheme which was only made possible by the unforeseen conditions which subsequently arose. But we are unable to. hold that this evidence was altogether immaterial, as it reflected upon the appellant\u2019s relation to the general situation with respect to which .the conspiracy is alleged to have developed. In any event we cannot see how this testimony injured the appellant. It referred to his own conduct, and Avas apparently consistent with his innocence. Its. admission certainly affords no ground for a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">There were six exceptions to testimony of police officials that the appellant AA'as at the Central Police Station on the \u2022 day after the murder and saAV Smith and Lewis, avIio had been arrested the previous afternoon, and that lie expressed an interest in having them released on the ground that he did not believe them to be guilty. Another1 exception refers to the proof of a 'Statement by the appellant to one of the officers, on the afternoon of the day succeeding1 the crime, in Avhich he criticized the arrests made in the case as \u201cpinhead policing.\u201d Other expressions by the appellant to police officials indicating an interest in certain men who' had been arrested and released, and bis remark to Captain Burns, on the afternoon of August 23rd: \u201cI may have something for</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">you tomorrow,\u201d AArere the subject of testimony to Avhich four exceptions were directed. There is nothing in the record to suggest that when the statement just quoted was made the appellant bad any reason to expect that. some, hours later lie avouM be visited at. his borne by Heller and Socolow and would have an interview in which a plot to deceive the, prosecuting officers, might be proposed. But the .acts, and declaration's to which the eleven exceptions of this group refer were provable as manifesting an interest which might reflect upon the question of niot\u00cdAre for the appellant\u2019s alleged participation in the scheme which the indictment describes. Apart from this possible effect the testimony would be altogether harmless even though it be regarded as immaterial. Tt was for the trial court to determine as to the weight of this proof. In our opinion it was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>It was testified, by Keller that when be and Socolow called ait the borne of the appellant on the night of August 23rd, the latter greeted Socolow with the\u201e exclamation: \u201cMy God, boy, what are you doing here,\u201d and then asked \u201cWho is this kid; is this Hart?\u201d and Socolow replied: \u201cHo, it is a kid by the name of Kelly, wanted for an automobile case.\u201d They were then taken to the kitchen to wash and be given some food. Afterwards they went out on a porch where they were rejoined by the appellant, who said: \u201cThat was a brutal thing you did, Socolow.\u201d According to Keller\u2019s testimony Socolow admitted His guilt and described the homicide, though the appellant and Socolow, on the contrary, testified that he protested his innocence, and then the appellant went to another entrance to .see a detective who had called. In reference to what transpired upon the appellant\u2019s return the testimony of Keller proceeds as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">\u201cQ. How, when Mr. Wolf came back what occurred; what did Walter (Socolow) say to him or Mr. Wolf say to Walter ? A. Asked him how would this sound: how would this do ? Q. What was it he said there ? A. I siaid I heard Allers. say he was framing Socolow. I just said to Socolow what would be all right for me to say. Then he told me to say instead of Hart and 'Socolow taking me to the box, Frank Allers took me there. Then the telephone rang. Q. Was anything said about the name of Allers? A. Chicago. Q. Then the telephone rang?' A. Yes, sir. Q. What happened then ? Did Mr. Wolf sit. there or go out; A. Went to the telephone. Q. And when he oam\u00e1 back what happened; A. He said: C didn\u2019t get you; tell me it again.\u2019 And so I told him again. Q. How, wha.t did you tell him? A. Told him the same thing I told him the first time. Q. What did you tell him the first time? A. About Allers taking' me to the box instead of Hart and SoColow, and that I heard Allers say he was framing Socolow. Q. How, what was said, if anything, by anybody, about having nerve or not having nerve ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">' To this question an objection was made on the ground that it was leading. The objection being overruled, the witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>quoted the appellant as having said: \u201cIf you have got the nerve, it is all right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">A leading question is one which, embodies a material fact and admits of a simple affirmative or negative answer. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Tinges, </em>7 Md. 234; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>106 Md. 633; <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Black, </em>107 Md. 653. The question objected to is not within that description. It does not admit of an answer in either an affirmative or a negative form. The purpose of the inquiry was to- ascertain what, if anything, was said on the subj set to which it directed attention. This was a permissible method of developing; the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Another question which is said to have been leading, propounded to Keller, was. as follows: \u201cEow, when you got to Wolf\u2019s house did Walter say anything about Allers having \u25a0confessed or squealed, or did Wolf say anything about it? Was anything said about that?\u201d The answer was: \u201cI think Soeolow said Allers confessed.\u201d The form of tins question was loading as it admitted of a simple affirmative or negative reply as, to the material fact which it embodied. But it could not have prejudiced the defense because it was proved by Detective Hammersla, who called at the appellant\u2019s house during, but in ignorance of, the visit there of Keller and Soeolow, that he discussed with the appellant the effect of the confession of Allers which had just been published, and it. i\u00ae not denied by the appellant that the confession had then come to his knowledge. Besides, the trial count, had a discretion, in regard to relaxing thei rule as, to leading; questions, which it does not appear to have abused with respect to the one just quoted. <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Black, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Kineteen exceptions relate to testimony as to the acts and declarations of Keller after the interview in which the conspiracy is alleged to have originated and out of the appellant\u2019s presence. It was proved that on the morning of August 24th, Keller went to the appellant\u2019s office and was introduced to Captain Leverton, with whom he went in an \u2022automobile to the poud into which the money box and license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>tags had he&amp;n thrown, and on the way told -the officer that on the night of August 20th he was accosted by two men who induced him by threats and promise of payment to accompany and assist them in obtaining the box and tags from a garage where they had been left and in talcing them to. the pond. Subsequently, according to the evidence, Keller stated to- officers in charge of the case- that while in tlie- company oi the two men he heard one- -of them, whom he identified as Allers, malee the statement in reference to \u201cframing'\u201d S'ocolow, Smith and Oarey, to which we have already alluded. All of this, testimony is said to- have been inadmissible on the theory that no <em>prima facie </em>case of conspiracy, against the appellant, was proved at any period of the trial. It i\u2019s unquestionably true that, under t-lic law, the appellant could not be held to be affected by the acts and declarations of Keller, out of his presence, unless they were in pursuance of a common design. <em>Lawrence </em>v. State, 103 Md. 17; <em>Bloomer </em>v. State, 48 Md. 521; <em>Hays </em>v. State, 40 Md. 633. The objection to the testimony on that sirbjeet wofild necessarily prevail if no evidence could be found in the record having* the <em>prima facie </em>effect of proving a conspiracy between the appellant and Keller to- -accomplish the purpose to which the subsequent conduct and statements of the latter were apparently directed. But we are unable to avoid the conclusion that there is evidence in the record having such a tendency. The strong contradiction with which it is met does not disentitle the State to have it given legal effect upon .the question as to the admissibility of the testimony now being considered. It was testified, in substance, that the appellant assented to a proposal to have Keller malee the misleading statement which he is proved to have- actually made to- the police and prosecuting officers, and there was evidence that -action on the part of the appellant provided -the opportunity which Keller utilized for that purpose. Captain Leverton stated in his testimony that on the night of August 2-3rd he received a, re quest by telephone from, the appellant to call at his office the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>next morning. An appointment was made by the appellant for .Keller to be there at the same time. The result of this arrangement was that Keller was. brought. int.o&gt; communication with Captain Leverton and proceeded to carry out a scheme of deception which he asserts the appellant had approved. As we have no right to exclude from consideration the testimony referred to-, we cannot hold that, there was no <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the conspiracy charged in the indictment. and, in our opinion, therefore, the objections to Keller\u2019s acts and statements in pursuance of the alleged scheme were properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">An exception upon which counsel for the appellant lay great stress relates to the testimony of Detective Tlammersla as to bis call at the appellant\u2019s home during the time of Soeolow\u2019s and Keller\u2019s visit.. The witness narrated a conversation he had with the appellant on that occasion, testifying in part as follows: \u201cAlters had confessed to, the murder of Norris and had told the whole story; it was all published in the papers: and I said to him, \u2018What do- you think of the latest development in the Norris case?\u2019 lie said, \u2018Harry, I am the worst fooled man in Baltimore.\u2019 He said, \u2018No. man could possibly have made me believe it was local boys who committed that crime; I didn\u2019t think they had nerve enough to do it.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018you are sure that they did it now, aren\u2019t you,?\u2019 Tie said, \u2018Yes, absolutely.\u2019 * <em>* </em>* And T asked him then the question, was he going\u201d to defend any of them. Tie said, \u2018No, T will not.\u2019 \u201d The remainder of the narrative of the witness., to which exception was taken, need not he quoted as it does not affect the question to be decided. It is not contended th\u00a1a,t the appellant was injured by the testimony of Detective Tlammersla! as, to anything said in the conversation to which the exception refers,, hut it is said that prejudice to the defense resulted from the disclosure of the appellant\u2019s omission during the interview to report the fact that Socolow and Keller were then in his house. A strongly fortified argument has been made in support of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>proposition that the appellant-, with due regard to professional honor and propriety, conld not have abused the confidence of persons- who came to him for counsel by delivering them to an officer of the law. It is not suggested on behalf of the State that the appellant\u2019s conduct in this respect is subject to censure. The proof upon which the State- relied shows that the appellant advised Socolow to surrender to the police, and that there was no relation between the conspiracy charged in the indictment and the appellant\u2019s silence as to the presence of Socolow and Keller1 in -his house- during, his talk with the detective. When that conversation occurred the alleged plan of Socolow to have Keller discredit the confession of Allers had not been suggested. The fact that the .appellant did not reveal the- presence of Socolow and Keller could have no legitim,ate tendency to support the theory that he subsequently entered into an unlawful agreement which the State itself proves he did not originate. It is hardly conceivable that the judges who- rendered the verdict in the case were influenced in their conclusion as to- the existence of a conspiracy by conduct of the appellant prompted by his conception of his professional duty to the- person who; is said to have <em>afterwards </em>suggested the unlawful project-. But the exception could not properly have been sustained because the testimony to- which it relates was inherently admissible. It tended to- show that the appellant was aware, at the time of his interview with Keller and Socolow, that Allers had made a confession implicating Socolow in the murder of Mr. Korns. The possession of such knowledge by the appellant at that time was a fact which it was proper for the- State; to prove. Being admissible for that purpose, the testimony excepted to could not have been excluded merely because it made apparent the particular conduct of -the appellant with respect to which the objection is mainly urged.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">There are twenty-four exceptions to evidence in regara to acts and declaration\u00ae of the appellant after the nigjht on which the conspiracy is said to have been conceived. Some of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>exceptions refer to testimony as to the appellant's! efforts to see Keller after he had said that the statement he had made about Alle-rs was false 'and the appellant had been accused of having instigated the attempt to embarrass the prosecution. Other exceptions relate to answers of the appellant to inquiries by representatives of the press as to his attitude towards the charges made against him on the basis of Keller's statements. It is urged that none of the testimony to which the exceptions of this class relate has a tendency to, convict the appellant of the offense for which he was indicted. The conduct and expressions described appear to be susceptible of a construction which would he consistent with innocence rather than with guilt. But the question to be determined is whether in the admission of this evidence the trial court committed reversible error. If the acts and utterances, proved be regarded as wholly devoid of any sinister meaning, they were not for that reason necessarily irrelevant, and there was no injury to the appellant in the admission of the proof on that subject. He could not be awarded a new trial on the ground that his own acts and words, consistent with innocence, had been considered hv the judges to whom, the case was submitted. In our opinion these exceptions present no adequate reason for a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The only other exceptions discussed in the brief for the appellant were two which referred to the repetition by Captain Beverton to a newspaper reporter, out of the appellant\u2019s presence hut at Ms instance, of the story which Keller had told about meeting two men, on the occasion o\u00b1 his assisting-in the disposition of the cash box and license tags,, and one exception to testimony of Captain Burns that on August 2fth, he went before the Grand Jury in reference to the charge against Smith, Carey, Soeolow, Hart,, Aliara and others. It is clear that this evidence could have had no prej udicial effect upon the defense, and any error in its admission was therefore not reversible.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The rulings on eighty of the one hundred and twenty exceptions in the; record have now been discussed. The remain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>ing forty exceptions were not specifically urged in the appellant\u2019s brief for tbe reason there stated that those argued sufficiently present the points upon which he relies. In regard to none of the exceptions have we discovered any ground for deciding that reversible error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The argument was partly directed to the question whether the testimony of Keller as to the existence of .a conspiracy had been corroborated. It wias argued also that his credibility was conclusively impeached. Eo reversible error having been found in any of the rulings on the admissibility of evidence, we have no authority to disturb tbe judgment and verdict on the theory that the judges who tried the case reached the wrong conclusion as to the facts. While the veracity of Keller was strongly attached, we cannot deny to the tidal judges ithe right to give credence to his story. With their conclusion upon the question of corroboration we are not. at liberty to interfere. Eo one accused of a crime could rightfully be convicted upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. But the corroborative evidence need not be sufficient in itself to convict. Tbe requirement is that it should tend to sustain the charge with respect to \u201csome of the material points involved.\u201d <em>Luery </em>v. <em>State, </em>116 Md. 294. In the ease just cited each of several defendants, under indictment for receiving stolen goods, made a motion, after the testimony had been taken, that a discharge be ordered \u201con the ground that upon the uncorroborated evidence of accomplices connecting the defendants with a crime the law does not permit a conviction to stand.\u201d That case was tried before a jury, and this Court said, in the opinion delivered by OiiiEr Judge Boyd : \u201cThere is no practice in this \u00a1State which would have, authorized the Court to discharge the defendants as requested in the motion, and it was properly overruled.\u201d Tt was said in the opinion that \u201cinasmuch as under our system the Courts do not .charge the juries in criminal cases, and the juries are made judges of the law and of the facts, one effective way of affording relief is for the trial court not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>to permit a conviction to stand if based <em>ewclusively </em>on snob testimony, if a motion for a new trial is seasonably made, or the trial courts might well adopt the practice of granting prayers advising or cautioning juries against conviction without corroboration.\u201d In the trial of the present case the judges themselves sat as a jury, and a motion for a new trial was made and denied. It cannot be doubted that the question as to the tendency and effect of the evidence to corroborate the testimony of the alleged accomplice Was given full consideration by thei judges who rendered the verdict, and by the Supreme Bench of Baltimore O'ity in hearing and disposing of the motion for a new1 trial. As to the issue of guilt or innocence determined by the verdict, or as' to the propriety of the ruling' on the; motion for a new trial, the appeal does not authorize us to pass judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The record shows that a demurrer to the indictment was filed and overruled, but no reference to the demurrer is made in the appellant\u2019s brief, and we think the action of the court upon it was clearly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
