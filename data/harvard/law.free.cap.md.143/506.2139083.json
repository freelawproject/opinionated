If the court shall determine that the Commission has acted within its powers and lias correctly construed the law and facts, the decision of the Commission shall be confirmed; otherwise it shall be reversed or modified. Upon the hearing of such an appeal the court shall, upon motion of either party filed with the clerk of the court according to the practice in civil cases* submit to a jury, any question of fact involved in such case. The proceedings in every such an appeal shall be informal and summary, but full opportunity to be beard shall be had before judgment is pronounced. Ho such appeal \u25a0\u25a0shall be entertained unless notice of appeal shall have been served personalty upon some member\u2019 of the Commission within thirty days following the rendition of the decision appealed from. An appeal shall not be a stay. If the decision of the Commission shall be changed or modified, the practice prevailing in civil cases as to the payment of costs and the fees of medical and other witnesses shall apply. Appeal shall lie from the judgment of the circuit court of the county or the common law courts of Baltimore City to the Court of Appeals as iu other civil cases, and such appeals shall have precedence over1 all cases except, criminal cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The order of September 3rd, 1921, was passed, in pursuance of the power conferred upon the State Industrial Accident Commission, to reconsider any case previously disposed of, to re-adjust the rate of compensation or to terminate the payments, should it be considered necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">By section 42 of the ,act it is provided: \u201cIf aggravation, diminution or termination of disability takes place or be discovered after the rate of compensation shall have been established or compensation terminated in any case, the Commission may, upon application of any party in interest or upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>its awn motion, readjust for future application the rate of compensation in accordance with rules in this section provided, or in a proper case, terminate the payments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">And by section 53 of the: act it is further provided that the powers and jurisdiction of the Commission over each case shall he continuing and it may from, time to time make such modification or change with respect to former finding\u2019s or orders with respect thereto, as in its opinion may be justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Leas, </em>127 Md. 576, it is said, the act secures to the party appealing the right to a jury trial, and the right to have \u201cany question of fact involved in the case, submitted to a jury. The court is empowered to confirm, reverse, or modify the decision of the Commission and it is provided that in the proceedings oil appeal, \u201cfull opportunity to be heard shall be had before judgment is. pronounced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">As stated, if the appellant\u2019s contention that: the Commission\u2019s order in refusing to reopen a, case is a discretionary act, not subject to appeal, were a true exposition of the law, it would be possible for the Commission arbitrarily to refuse to reopen a case, thus effectually precluding an employee from ever securing an, inquiry into the impaired state of his health, which may be visited upon him in the future as a direct result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Section 55 of the act provides for an appeal from any ruling or order of the Commission, and the language of the section seems to show that the Legislature did not intend to restrict the application of the act, in the manner urged by the appellant, and to so hold, we think, would tend to defeat the very purpose of the act. <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Leas, </em>127 Md. 572; <em>U. S. F. &amp; G. Co. </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>136 Md. 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">The second and third objections present the rulings of the court on the prayers and the form of the: verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">The appellant offered two (\u00a3\u2022) prayers. The first, prayer was granted as modified in connection with the court\u2019s separate instruction, but its second prayer was refused. The court granted the following instruction of its own: The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>count instructs the jury that if they find from the evidence that the finding of the State Industrial Accident Cbmmissiort was .on the 24th March, 1919, that the claimant, George 'Simmons, had been in the accident referred to, temporarily totally incapacitated, and shall further find from the evidence that finding of the Commission to have been correct, then in this proceeding .the verdict of the jury shall be \u201caffirmed.\u201d Tf on the other hand the jury find from the evidence the award above referred to' not to have been correct, then their verdict shall be \u201creversed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The appellant\u2019s first and second prayers were clearly erroneous and were properly refused and modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Hor do we think, that the court\u2019s instructions properly or correctly defined the issue to be decided by the jury. The prayer erroneously submitted to the jury the question, \u201cwhether to affirm or reverse,\u201d the decision of the Commission, instead of leaving to the jury a finding or determination of fact. It was for the jury to- determine the issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The record contains the following docket entries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">\u201c10th June, 1922. \u2014 Motion by the defendant that the appeal of George Simmons, the claimant, from the decision of the State Industrial Accident Commission of Maryland passed on the 3rd day of September, 1921, be dismissed \u2018Overruled,\u2019 per verbal order of tbe court (Judge Stein).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\">\u201c13th September, 1922. \u2014 Jury sworn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-11\">\u201c13tb September, 1922. \u2014 Pinding of the State Industrial Accident Commission of Maryland, \u2018Reversed.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-12\">\u201c13th September, 1922.. \u2014 Judgment on verdict nisi.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-13\">\u201c15th September, 1922. \u2014 Order of the State Industrial Accident Commission of Maryland \u2018Reversed.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">In the recent case of <em>Schiller </em>v. <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., </em>137 Md. 242, this Court, in dealing\u2019 with a somewhat similar condition and in commenting on section 55 of the Act of 1914, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-15\">\u201cThe provision as to the right of either party, on motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>to liave any question of fact submitted to a jury following the language above quoted, would seem to be intended to protect the constitutional right to a jury trial of the. facts involved, but in such a way as to enable the court to apply the law to the facts after they are found by the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">\u201cFor the practical working of such a scheme there does not seam to be any method so appropriate as the submission of issues in a manner analogous to the practice in cases sent from the orphans court or from courts, of equity where1 it is desired that a jury shall pass on the facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">It will be seen, however, there was but one issue, in this ease, and the form of the verdict of reversal, under the decisions of this Court, would be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">In <em>Schiller </em>v. <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., </em>137 Md. 235, it is said, it may well be that in many cases., a verdict for the appellant or for the appellee would be equivalent to a, finding of the only fact, in controversy, and in such cases, that form of verdict would be sufficient, nor do we mean to say that in such eases it would be necessary to submit the fact, in controversy in the form of an issue. <em>Browne </em>v. <em>Browne, </em>22 Md. 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Finding no reversible error, on the record now' before us, the judgment of tbe Baltimore. City Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
