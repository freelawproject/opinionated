The case then proceeded to trial and the defendant was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment in the jail of Frederick County for the term of four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">An appeal was taken from the judgment, but no hill of exceptions is found in the record, therefore, the only question before us is the ruling of the court upon the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">The description of the offense follows the language of see. 5, of chap. 30- of the Acts of 1916, under which the appellant was indicted, which provides that, .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-13\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for auy person, persons, social club, firm or corporation to manufacture for sale, sell or purchase for sale, transport for sale, dispense or otherwise dispose of any alcoholic, spirituous, vinous, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>fermented, distilled or malt liquors or intoxicating bitters or liqnid mixtures or preparations, whether patented or not, which will produce intoxication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The statute applies to all of Frederick County, which includes both the City of Frederick, and the \u201cpolice limits of the City of Frederick.\u201d The latter unit embracing] the City of Frederick and some of the adjacent territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">In 1902, an act was passed (chap. 427), relating to the sale of spirituous and fermented liquors within the \u201cpolice limits of Frederick City,\u201d in Frederick County.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">This act required those wishing' to sell spirituous or fermented liquors or lager beer, within the \u201cpolice limits, of the City of Frederick\u201d to first obtain a license therefor, and for a sale of such liquors or lager\u2019 beer without such license, the act imposed \u201ca finei of not less1 than one hundred dollars, nor more than five hundred dollars, or undergo imprisonment in the jail of Frederick County for not- less than three months nor more than twelve months^ or to both fine and imprisonment at the discretion of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">The Act of 1916, already referred to, which was passed, of course, after the Act of 1902, and while the latter was. in force, provided \u201cthat any person * * * selling * * * any alcoholic * * * liquors * * * within (Frederick County) shall ho liahle for all the penalties now1 or hereafter prescribed, for -x- * -x- se]]^ng * -x- * into'xioating liquors without a, license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A7a\">The appellant claims he was prejudiced by the allegation in the indictment that the offense was committed in the \u201cpolice limits, of the City of Frederick,\u201d which we have said was wholly in Frederick County. The indictment not only alleges that the offense was committed in the \u201cpolice limits of the City of Frederick\u201d hut also that it was committed in Frederick County. As the act. applied to the whole county, this was sufficient without alleging with more particularity that the offense was committed within the \u201cpolice limits of the City of Frederick.\u201d Therefore, the allegation that the offense was committed within the \u201cpolice limits of the City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>of Frederick\u201d was merely surplusage and it in no way affected the validity of the indictment. The fact that the appellant Was charged with having committed the offense within the \u201cpolice limits of the City of Frederick\u201d could in no possible way have prejudiced his rights, hut on the contrary it informed him with greater certainty as to the place at which he was charged with the commission of the offense, and was a benefit rather than an injury to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">It is also claimed that the indictment is defective, because it fails to negative an exception which is said to be found in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">That which is referred to\u00a1 as an exception is the provision found in the Act of 1916, at the end of the danse prohibiting the sale of intoxicating, liquors and compounds therein mentioned \u201cexcept for medicinal, pharmaceutical, scientific, sacramental or mechanical purposes', as may he allowed under the provisions of such acts as the General Assembly of Maryland shall pass at its regular' session held next after the date of such election or any subsequent session allowing such sale for such p'uropseis only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">This Court, has said, \u201cwhere there is. an exception so incorporated with the enacting clause of the statute, that the one cannot he read without the other, there the exception must be negatived. <em>Barber </em>v. <em>State, </em>50 Md. 161; <em>Kiefer </em>v. <em>State, </em>81 Md. 562; <em>Howes </em>v. <em>State, </em>141 Md. 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">The said provision referred to by the appellant as an exception is not an exception, nor does the act create one. It is merely a provision by which succeeding legislatures might except from the provisions of <em>the </em>act the sale of intoxicating liquors, etc., for one or more of the purposes therein mentioned. But until such legislation was passed there were no exceptions from the provisions, of the act, and if such legislation were passed, the exceptions created thereby, under the cases cited, would certainly not he of such character as to require them to he negatived in the indictment. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>State, </em>139 Md. 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>The claim is made in the appellant\u2019s brief that the court was without authority to impose a sentence of imprisonment. This question, however, was not presented by the demurrer, and as the record fails to show that any objection was made to the sentence in the court below and proceedings taken thereon properly presenting the question to this Court on appeal, it cannot now be considered by us. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>State, </em>82 Md. 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">As we find no error in the ruling of the court below, the judgment appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
