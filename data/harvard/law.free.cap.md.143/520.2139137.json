Gerding against the widow of Erederick J. Baier, deceased, as the administratrix of said decedent, alleges that the plaintiff was a eo'-partuer of the said Erederick J. Baier, deceased, and engaged in the general printing business at 407 South Bond Street, in Baltimore City, under the firm name of J. E. Gerding Company; that the said Baier died on the 25th of September, 1922, and letters of administration were taken out by his widow, Mary M. Baier; that the said \u201c\u2019business consists of machinery, typo, paper, office furniture and outstanding debts\u201d; that \u201cirreconcilable differences have arisen between\u201d the plaintiff and 'the said Mary M. Baier, and by reason of said \u201cdifficulty\u201d the business has, been much jeopardized, and it is to the best interests of the parties and the creditors of said partnership that the partnership' should he terminated, and that a receiver be appointed to close out the partnership' business, and that he, the plaintiff, has no adequate remedy at law. The prayer of the bill was for the appointment of a receiver to take charge \u201cof all the partnership hooks and papers of accounts, goods and effects, and to collect the debts due thereto and to preserve and dispose of the same, under the directions\u201d of the court, and for general relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The court below passed an order requiring the defendant to shovy cause on or before the day named therein why the relief prayed should not- be granted, and the defendant promptly filed her answer, in which she admitted the co-partnership1, the death of her said husband and the other matters stated in the first three paragraphs of the bill, but in reference to the differences charged to have arisen between her and the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>tiff she alleged, \u201cthat the only difference which has arisen between\u201d her and the plaintiff \u201cis the carrying into effect of a certain contract entered into\u201d by the plaintiff and her deceased husband, under' which she is entitled to receive ceor- ' tain weekly payments, &amp;c., \u201cout of the profits of the business-,\u201d which .contract, a copy of which was filed with her answer, the plaintiff \u201cnow desires to- repudiate,\u201d and that there \u201cis no- sufficient reason in equity for the appointment of a receiver and the disposition of the business as sought by the hill of complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The contract referred to- in the answer and offered in evidence is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u201cDecember 20, 1907.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u201cTo Whom It May Concern:</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\u201cWe, the undersigned, trading as the J. E. Gerding Company, in the City of Baltimore, State of Maryland, do hereby mutually agree that in the event of the decease of either .one of the undersigned, the survivor shall pay the widow of the deceased partner 50% (fifty per cent.) of the earnings of the survivor, said sum to he paid weekly or monthly and to continue for the space of five (5) years, at which time surviving partner can purchase widow\u2019s interest at half the valuation of plant at time of death. (In case said widow marries within the specified time of five years, then said payment shall cease immediately.) In case there is no widow, same to he paid to the children of the deceased or their guardians, valuation having been procured by at least three disinterested people. All monies in building associations and savings hank the widow shall receive half immediately, s,</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">\u201cJ. E. Gerding. (Signed)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">\u201cFrederick J. Baier. (Signed)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">\u201cMade this twentieth (20th) day of December, in the year of 1907.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">The other evidence in the-,,caso, which consists of the testimony o-f the plaintiff, shows that he and his deceased partner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>for a number of years prior and up to' the time of his death each received from tlie business a salary of $75 per week; that in addition to their salaries they paid to their employees salaries amounting to $55 per week; that the plaintiff has conducted the business .since Mr. Baier\u2019s death, and that in addition to Ins salary at $75 per week and the salaries of his employees \u00abmounting to $55 per week, he paid to the Ear tional Composition Company, in the month of Eovemher, 1922, between $160' and $180 for work that lie \u201ccould not got out in time\u201d; that the work that Mr. Baler did for tlie firm was that of a \u201ccompositor,\u2019'' and that according to the \u201cunion scale\u201d it would cost about $42 a week to employ a \u201ctypesetter\u201d or \u201cjourneyman\u201d in his place; that the plaintiff has never tried to get, any one in Mr. Baier\u2019s place, but has continued the business with the same force that they had before' his death-with the help of the Eational Composition Company, which the firm began to employ some time before Mr. Baier\u2019s death; that the business lias declined \u201csomewhat\u201d in the past- year owing to the falling off\" of the packing\u2019 business; that the plaintiff could not tell what the profits of the business were in 1919, 1920 or 192 1.; that he \u201cfigured\u201d a net profit of $1,000 \u201clast year\u201d over and above all salaries; that the company has no debts, and had $1,000 in bank at the time the plaintiff testified (December, 1922); that, according to the inventory and appraisement, which the plaintiff had made, the plant of the company is worth $6,092.72 '\"as a. running plant,\u201d and the company also owns two lots, which he valued at $700. There is no suggestion in the case that the defendant has interfered in any way with the plaintiff\u2019s management and conduct of the company\u2019s, business, or that there has been any disagreement, between them in regard to the same. It would seem from the testimony and argument of counsel that, according to the plaintiff\u2019s, and defendant\u2019s const ruction of the contract referred to, the defendant is .entitled to receive from the company an amount, equal to fiftv per cent, of the <em>salary </em>the plaintiff receives, and the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>contention is that the company cannot afford to pay her that amount, notwithstanding the evidence shows- that the business was conducted 'successfully while paying Mr. Baier twice that amount, -and that the company can employ a competent person to1 do- the work he did for about the remaining\u2019 fifty per cent, of the salary he received and which the plaintiff is still receiving. The only and obvious purpose, therefore, of the bill is to avoid any obligation under the contract, which the plaintiff says- he wrote at the instance of his deceased partner, and to the same end he has- brought this appeal from the decree of the court below dismissing his bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Ordinarily a partnership' is dissolved by the death of one of the partners. <em>Walker et al. </em>v. <em>House, </em>4 Md. Ch. 39; 20 R. C. L. sec. 225, p. 989; 30 Cyc. 653; <em>Scholefield </em>v. Eichel<em>berger, </em>7 Peters, 585; <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Mandeville's Executor, 2 </em>Howard, 560; <em>Parnell </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>81 Kan. 119, 33 L. R. A. (N. S.), p. 668; <em>Uniform Partnership Act. </em>see. 31, sub sec. 4, art. 73 A of the Code. But it. has been held that, the partners may by their contract provide otherwise. In 20 <em>L. R. A., supra, </em>it is said: \u201cIn the absence of an express agreement to the contrary, every partnership is dissolved by the death of one of the partners, whether the partnership is one at will or for a fixed term. Where, as is. often the case, the articles provide that the partnership' shall not be dissolved by the death of \u00a1a, partner, such provision will be given effect by the courts.\u201d And it is said in 30 <em>Cyc. supra, </em>that the death of a partner \u201cproduces a dissolution of the firm, not only as to the estate of the deceased, but as to all the partners, unless the continuance of the partnership has been provided for 'by the agreement of the parties.\u201d In <em>Scholefield </em>v. <em>Eichelberger, supra, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States said, on page 594: \u201cThere is no1 doubt that the liability of a deceased partner, as well as. his interest in the profit of the concern, may, by contract, be extended beyond his death; but without such stipulation, even in case of a partnership'for a term of years (3 Madd. 245), it is clear1 that death dissolves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>the concern.\u201d And in <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Mandeville\u2019s Executor, supra, </em>Mr. Justice Story said: \u201cBy the general rule of law every partnership is dissolved by the death of one of the partners. It is true that it is competent for the partners to provide by agreement for the continuance of the partnership after such death. * * * A partner too may by bis will provide that the partnership shall continue notwithstanding his death; and if it is assented to by the surviving, partner, it becomes obligatory. * * * But, then, in each ease, the agreement or authority must be clearly made out.\u201d See also <em>Goodburn et ux. </em>v. <em>Stevens et al., </em>5 Gill, 1, and <em>Parnell </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra. </em>Subjection (5) of section 4 of article 13 A of the Code (Uniform Partnership Act) expressly provides: \u201cThis article shall not be construed so as to impair the obligation of any contract existing when the article goes into effect,\u201d and if we assume that by reason of the contract between the plaintiff and his deceased partner the partnership was not dissolved by tbo death of Mr. Baier, the question remains whether under the pleadings and evidence in the ease the plaintiff is entitled to a decree dissolving the partnership or appointing a receiver. The only ground alleged in the bill is that \u201cirreconcilable differences have arisen\u201d between the plaintiff and defendant, which jeopardize the business of the company. In <em>Fooks </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>120 Md. 440, the Court, said, in reference to a bill for the dissolution of a partnership: \u201cA bill of this character should not merely allege irreconcilable differences between the partners, but should also allege facts, sufficient in their character to make it apparent, to the Court that, if supported by proof, the differences were irreconcilable, and of such a nature as terminated or seriously imperiled any further' continuance of the relation.\u201d Disregarding, however, any defect in the pleadings, there is no evidence to sustain the only ground upon which relief is prayed, or to establish any other ground up <em>on </em>which a. court of equity would be justified in dissolving a partnership or appointing a receiver to take charge of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>assets. The evidence entirely fails to show any differences between the plaintiff and the defendant as to the conduct of the company\u2019s business, or that she has in any way interfered with the plaintiff\u2019s management of it, or that the business cannot be continued without a loss to the parties interested.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Suib-seotion (\u00e9) and sub-section (c) of section 7 of article 73 A of the Code (Uniform Partnership' Act), provide that \u201cthe receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business is <em>prima facie </em>evidence that he is a partner in the business, but no such inference shall be drawn if such profits were received in payment; * * * as an annuity to a widow or repre^ sentafive of a deceased partner,\u201d 'but whatever may be the true relation of the plaintiff and the defendant under the contract in question, it is a clear undertaking on his part to continue die business of the company for the period of five years from the date of Mr. Baier\u2019s death, and to pay the defendant, as his widow, during that time, unless she remarries, fifty per cent, of his, the plaintiff\u2019s, earnings in said business^ and a. court of equity will not aid him to escape an obligation which he has freely and voluntarily assumed, or intervene by the appointment of a receiver to take charge of and distribute the assets of the company except in the clearest ease for the protection of the interests of all concerned. <em>Miller\u2019s Eq. Pro., </em>secs. 635-636 and 637, and eases cited in the notes. We will, therefore, affirm the decree of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, with costs</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
