L., </em>sec. 27 p, 181; 1 <em>Archbold\u2019s Crim. Brad. &amp; Pleading </em>(Waterman\u2019s Notes), 279-280), and (2) that the defense of former conviction, or plea of <em>autrefois convict, </em>is established by the production of the record of conviction, and parol evidence showing the identity of the parties and the offenses. <em>Hochheimer\u2019s Criminal Law, </em>sec. 280, p. 176; 3 <em>Greenleaf, Evidence </em>(16th ed.), sec. 36; 5 <em>Ency. of Evidence, </em>sec. 5, p. 879. In <em>Greenleaf, Evidence, supra, </em>the learned author says: \u201cThe former judgment, in these cases, is pleaded with an averment that the offense charged in both indictments is the same; and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>identity of the offense, </em>wliich may he shown hy parol evidence, is to he proved hy the prisoner. This may generally he done by producing the record, and showing that the same evidence, which is necessary to support the second indictment, would have been admissible and sufficient to procnre a legal conviction upon the first.\u201d And see also cases cited in note 35, p. 880, in support of the statement in the text that, \u201cin case of offenses wliich in their nature are capable of repetition, * * the identity of the offenses cannot be presumed from the identity of the former and subsequent indictments, but must he proved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">While a more definite averment as to the particular place of the offense might aid a traverser in establishing his defense of former conviction, it would hot relieve him of the necessity of showing the identity of the offenses, and is not required, except, as. wo have said, when the particular place is necessary in order to describe the offense charged. The demurrer being* to the whole indictment, it could not have been sustained if any one of the counts was sufficient. <em>Avirett </em>v. <em>State, </em>76 Md. 527; <em>Gunther </em>v. <em>Dranbauer, </em>86 Md. 1. But the indictment seems to follow the forms suggested in <em>Hochheimer\u2019s Criminal Law, </em>pp. 490-491, and 2 <em>Archbold\u2019s Crim. Pract. &amp; Pleading </em>(Waterman\u2019s Notes), pp. 935-937, and does not appear to be open to any serious objection on demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">At- the trial the State offered evidence tending to show that on the 18th of September, 1922, while a number of employees were on their way to work at the \u201cTToffa Brothers mine,\u201d near Barton, in Allegany County, they were met hy a large number of men or strikers from other parts of the county, estimated in the evidence at from thirty-five to between one and two hundred, and including the defendants, who stopped them and forced them to retire hy threats of bodily harm, and hy using clubs and throwing stones and by discharging firearms, and that the employees so attacked retreated as best they could. On the other hand the evidence produced hy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>defendant tended to show that they, and the others constituting their party, went there for the purpose of peaceably persuading the employees of the \u201cHoffa. Brothers mine\u201d from going to work, and that they did not \u201ccommit any act of violence or cause any disorder until after one of their men had been shot\u201d by one of the employees of the coal company.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Douglas Truly, one of the defendants, testified that he lived at Rational; that he went to the Hoffa mine on the eighteenth of September on picket duty for the purpose of talking to some men that had been working and persuading them to stay away from work; that he reached there between six and six-thirty o\u2019clock in the morning; that when he got there he saw and passed four or five men; that he did not stop; but walked on up&gt; the road, because he knew \u201cif we got in a crowd together we would be violating the law.\u201d He was then asked by his counsel: \u201cWas anything said by you or the'others there about the way things should be conducted there?\u201d He replied, \u201cTes, sir,\u201d and was then asked: \u201cWhat was said, if anything?\u201d The State objected to,the question, and the first exception is. to the refusal of the court below to permit the question to be answered. It is urged on behalf of the appellants that there was serious error in this ruling, because the object of the question was to show by the witness that the gathering together of the defendants and others in their party was for a lawful purpose, and that they did not, as alleged in the indictment, assemble unlawfully. How far the question of their guilt or innocence under any of the counts in the indictment was dependent upon their <em>original </em>object or purpose in assembling is not necessary to be determined in this connection (2 <em>Bishop's Criminal Lem </em>(7th ed.) secs. 1150-1151), for we know of no rule of evidence authorizing them to introduce their own unsworn statements or declarations to prove their intentions. It was entirely permissible for each defendant to testify to his intentions and purpose in going to the mine, and the witness did so testify, as did other witnesses, but the court properly refused to per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>mit Mm to introduce his own statements or declarations, or the statements of those assembled with him, for the purpose of proving Ms intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The second exception was to the refusal of the court to permit one of the defendants, Russell Kaefer, to answer the following question: \u201cWill you state, Mr. Kaefer, whether or not in picketing during this strike it was usual to have men from one section of the county do the picketing in another section ?\u201d We cannot see the relevancy of the evidence offered in this exception. The evidence tending to show that the men who were assembled on the occasion mentioned in the indictment did not live in the neighborhood of Barton did not reflect upon any element of the offense charged in the indictment, and the .fact that it was usual, during the strike referred to, to have the picketing done by men from another section of the county, would not have tended to rebut any legitimate inference to be drawn from, such evidence. But even if it could he said to be admissible for any purpose, the defendants, it would seem, got the benefit of such evidence in the statement of the witness that he had been out picketing before on different occasions, and \u201cliad been picketing out all along the line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The only other exception was to the ruling of the court below permitting the witness Moore, who was called by the State in rebuttal, to state what, if anything, happened before the shooting took place. The evidence in chief produced by the State was to the effect that the strikers threw stones, used clubs, and fired shots, and the evidence in question was offered by the State in rebuttal of tbe evidence produced by the defendants to show that there were no acts, of violence on the part of those who assembled at the mine until after shots were fired by the employees of the mining company, and was admissible for that purpose. Moreover, it has been frequently held that the question of what is rebutting evidence \u201cand what is evidence properly adducible in chief\u201d is one addressed to the \u201csound discretion of the court, and the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>late court will not reverse for an error on this point, unless the ruling of the court below was both manifestly wrong and substantially injurious,\u201d and that, \u201cas a general rule, in such cases no appeal will lie.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>State, </em>132 Md. 148; <em>Snowden </em>v. <em>State, </em>133 Md. 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In the order for appeal, counsel for the defendants directed the clerk of the court below to enter an appeal \u201cfrom the verdict in\u201d the case, and the State has made a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that there could be no appeal from the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Prior to the Act of 1892, ch. 506, appeals in criminal cases were entered before the interposition of the sentence, and the appeal did not bring up for review a ruling of the trial court on a demurrer to the indictment. Since the passage of that aet (article 5, section 80 of the Code) the appeal in such cases is from the judgment, and the record includes the demurrers and exceptions as in civil cases. <em>Avirett </em>v. <em>State, supra. </em>The docket entries in this case show that the verdict was rendered on November 4th, 1922, that the sentences were imposed by the court on November 10th, and that the appeal was entered on November 11th. Under such circumstances we think the appeal should be treated as having been taken from the judgment, and that the motion of the State to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it was taken from the verdict should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">On the 15th of December, 1922, counsel for the defendants submitted to the court below a petition for an extension of the time for the filing and signing of the bills of exception to December 30th, 1922, and an agreement of the State\u2019s Attorney, dated the 12th day of December, 1922, consenting to- such extension. On the 18th of December, 1922, the court below signed the bills of exception as of that date, and noted that they did so, \u201cafter the expiration of thirty days from the rendition of the verdict, only because of the agreement signed by the State\u2019s Attorney on the 12th day of December, 1922.\u201d In the case of <em>Balto. Bldg. Assn. </em>v. <em>Grant, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>41 Md. 566, the Court said: \u201cIt appears from, the certificate that the formal bill of exceptions was signed by the judge on May 1st, 1874, some time after the judgment. Now there is nothing to show that it was not then competent for the judge to sign it; no rule of court is produced to the contrary; and the presumption is that it was done by consent of the parties, or in accordance with the leave of court before given allowing time for its preparation.\u201d In the case at bar the record does not contain any rule of the Circuit Court for Allegany County providing when bills of exception must be presented to or signed by the court and, in view of the agreement of the State\u2019s Attorney, the bills of exception cannot be said to have been signed too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Finding no reversible error in any of the rulings of the court below, the judgment appealed from must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
