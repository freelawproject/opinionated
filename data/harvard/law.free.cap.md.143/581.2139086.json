When the witness Seankus was pointed out to her in the court room, and she was asked whether she knew him, she said that she did not and had never seen him before in her life; that his statement about seeing her in bed with a man was false and that she had never been in bed with Eovakage or any other man except her husband, and had never done anything wrong with any man; that she lived with Mrs. Kasdeliweitz at 659 Portland Street, and on the third floor of that house, for two years, and paid her at first six dollars and later seven dollars a month rent; that no man had ever lived there with her and that the only man ever seen in her room was her son, who was about twenty-six years old; that she worked all the time in 1920 and 1921 for Yincent Yusldevitz, 417 South Paca Street, and on 'September 26th, 1921, she moved from Mrs. Kasdeliweitz\u2019 house to her son\u2019s home on Washington Boulevard; that she did not lose any days from work in September, 1921, and went to work every morning about seven o\u2019clock; that she worked for Yincent Yusldevitz for about three years; that she got up every morning' about half past five and went to work about seven o\u2019clock; that she still works; that she brings home some coats and works at home some times until twelve o\u2019clock at night; that she had always been a good wife to the plaintiff, hut that he had \u201ctreated\u201d her \u201clike a dog.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Yincent Yuskievitz testified that he was engaged in the business of making custom coats and stock coats at 417 South Paca Street; that the defendant had worked for him for two and a half years; that she worked for him in September, 1921, and never missed a day in that month; that his shop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>opened every morning at half past six or seven o\u2019clock, and that the defendant never came to- work in September, 1921, after nine o\u2019clock in the morning,; that his books show the days she worked, and that he saw them the \u201cother day,\u201d and would produce them in court if desired. On crossrexamination he said that the plaintiff worked every day, and was still working for him, and that he could take, his books and show the days she worked. Mrs. Mason, the defendant\u2019s daughter-in-law, testified that the defendant lived on Portland Street for about two years, and until the 26th of September, 1921, when her husband and herself purchased their home on Washington Boulevard and she came to live with them, and that her husband was twenty-eight years old. When asked if she had heard the testimony of the witness .Seankus, she replied, \u201cYes, I did, Mr. Kaufman, and he did not tell the truth.\u201d The rest of her testimony was stricken out by the court below on motion of the plaintiff. The decree in the ease of Mrs. Mazeika against the plaintiff, referred to in the bill and in the evidence, was also offered in evidence, and it appears that the defendant was, on the 8th of January, 1919, granted a divorce a <em>mensa, et thoro </em>from the plaintiff in this case, and that he was required to pay her two- dollars per week as permanent alimony, and to p-ay Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, her attorneys, a fee of $250.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">We have referred to- the evidence at some length because it shows a sharp and irreconcilable conflict between the testimony produced by the plaintiff and the testimony of the defendant, in which she is strongly supported by the testimony of her employer, who offered to- produce his- books in further corroboration of her positive denial of the conduct attributed to her by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses. Under such circumstances the conclusion to be reached must depend largely upon the credibility of the witnesses, and where that is the case the chancellor, who had the opportunity of seeing the witnesses and observing; their conduct and demeanor on the witness stand, has a distinct advantage over the appellate court, and his conclusion ought not to be disturbed unless there has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>obvious error. As early as the case of <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>10 Md. 346, Chiee Judge Le Geabtd had occasion to say: \u201cThese witnesses are unknown to this Court, as are, also, those who prove her imbecility. The credit to be attached to their evidence, in some degree, would depend upon their appearance, and their manner of giving it. We have been deprived of this advantage; the orphans\u2019 court enjoyed it, and we cannot be insensible to the value of the conclusions which it enabled them, to derive from it. * * * Repeating, were it not for the positive evidence of Mr. White, and others, that we would hold the testatrix to have been incompetent at tbe time to* have made a valid will, and the suspicions surrounding the transaction, yet we cannot feel ourselves justified in reversing the order of the orphans\u2019 court.\u201d And this Court has, more recently, and in several instances, recognized the importance of the advantage referred to, and the consideration that should he given to it. In the ease of <em>Richter </em>v. <em>Poe, </em>109 Md. 20, Judge Bubke said, in determining the questions in that case, as to* which there was direct and irreconcilable conflict of evidence, \u201ctwo things must be remembered,\u201d and after stating the first, he said, \u201csecondly, that the greater part of the testimony * * * was taken orally in the court below before the judge who- decided the case. He, therefore, had the opportunity to observe the witnesses and their manner of testifying, and had the best means of deciding upon the value of their testimony. This circumstance, it is true, would not prevent this Court from reversing the decree if <em>we </em>found it was not warranted by the evidence; but where' the question to he decided turns so largely, as it does in this ease; upon the weight of the testimony and the credibility of the witnesses it is properly entitled to much consideration.\u201d See also <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>140 Md. 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In addition to* the weight that should he given to the fact that the testimony in this case was taken before the learned chancellor who dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s hill, the evidence produced by the plaintiff hears marks of weakness other than those attributable to the manner and demeanor of the wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>nesses. Seaixlvus, the most important witness, testified that he told the plaintiff what he had seen in September, 1921, about two weeks after his visit to the defendant\u2019s rooms on Portland Street, yet when the plaintiff filed his bill only a few weeks later he alleged that the defendant had- been guilty of adultery with men whose names were unknown to him. Again, the same witness first testified that he walked into \u201cthe kitchen and the door was open, there was nothing in the kitchen and I walked in the front room,\u201d and latex\u2019, when pressed by counsel fox* the defendant, he said that he did not go into the front room, but simply stuck his head inside the door, and ixx another part of his testimony he said he went to the door, and that Novakage opened the door and said \u201cWhat do you waxxt.\u201d l\u00ede also said when first asked if the defendant had any covers over her when he saw her in bed that \u201cthere was ixothing on her,\u201d and later testified that she was partly covex\u2019ed, hut that he could see that she had a red petticoat on. The witness Metalis at one time testified that when he went to the defendant\u2019s, rooms she was walking around and \u201cwent in the other room,\u201d and later, when asked on re-examixxation by counsel for plaintiff if there was a bedroom on the floor on which the defendant lived, he said \u201cNo.\u201d that he saw one room, \u201clike a kitchen,\u201d but did not see any other room. Another hut less important feature of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence is that, notwithstanding the defendant obtained a divorce <em>a mensa et thoro </em>from him about two year\u2019s before, axxd her statement that he had treated her \u201clike a dog,\u201d he testified in this case that he had \u201ctreated her very nice.\u201d In view of these contradictions and inconsistencies in' the plaintiff\u2019s evidence we would not be justified ixx reversing the decree of the court, below, and it will, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
