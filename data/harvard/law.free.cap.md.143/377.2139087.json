And further meaning thereby and intending to lead said subscribers * * * of the Commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Voice to believe that the said Lincoln Theatre failed to pay its employees, and that the readers and subscribers so understood the said\u201d article. \u201cAnd further meaning thereby and intending to lead said subscribers * * * of the Commercial Voice to believe that the plaintiff was dishonest in and about the management of his business\u201d; that he was unable to pay his debts ; that he was insolvent and did not merit the credit of his employees, and of the persons with whom he dealt and from whom he received credit, and that the said subscribers and readers \u201cso understood said news article to mean.\u201d And further meaning thereby and intending and leading the said subscribers, &amp;c., \u201cto believe that the plaintiff improperly managed and conducted his business, the Lincoln Theatre, in its dealings with its employees and others\u201d; that the publication \u201cwas false and malicious and designed * *'* to defame and injure the plaintiff in his business, * * * and his credit in the management\u201d of the same, and to. otherwise bring him into \u201cpublic scorn, contumely and disrespect amongst his friends and neighbors, acquaintances, patrons, customers and his creditors and business associates, especially amongst the colored population of Baltimore City,\u201d &amp;c., to his great injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The demurrer admits the publication by the defendants, and that the words are false and malicious, but it does not admit that they are, in themselves, or as explained by the innuendoes, actionable, nor does it admit that they are, when read by themselves, or in connection with the inducement and colloquium, capable of the meaning ascribed to them in the innuendoes, and whether the innuendoes are warranted by the article when read in connection with the inducement and <em>colloquium, </em>is a question of law for the court. The office of an innuendo is to explain the words published and to give to them their true meaning, but it cannot introduce new matter, add to or enlarge the sense of those words, or impute to them a meaning not warranted by the publication, when taken alone or read in connection with the inducement and <em>eolio</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number><em>quium. Avirett </em>v. <em>State, </em>76 Md. 510; <em>Goldsborough </em>v. <em>Orem &amp; Johnson, </em>103 Md. 671; <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>News Pub. Co., </em>117 Md. 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">There are no special damages alleged in the declaration, and the question to be determined is whether the publication declared on, when read in connection with the inducement, <em>colloquium </em>and innuendoes, is <em>per se </em>libellous. \u201cA false and malicious printed or written publication which imputes conduct, or qualities tending to disparage, or degrade the plaintiff, or expose him to contempt, ridicule or public hatred, or prejudice his private character, or credit are libellous <em>per se.\u201d Goldsborough </em>v. <em>Orem &amp; Johnson, supra; Weeks </em>v. <em>News Pub. Co., supra; Stannard </em>v. <em>Wilcox &amp; Gibbs, </em>118 Md. 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Assuming that it would be libellous <em>per se </em>to falsely and maliciously publish of a man engaged in the business in which the plaintiff is alleged to have been engaged, and under the circumstances stated in the declaration, that he failed to discharge his debts and to pay his employees; or that the business in which he was engaged failed to pay its employees; or that he was dishonest; or that he was unable to pay his debts; or that he was insolvent; or that he managed his said business improperly, the meanings ascribed in the declaration to the publication complained of, the question remains whether either of those meanings are fairly inferable from the words published, when read in connection with the inducement and <em>colloquium. </em>If they'are not then the innuendoes are bad, and the demurrer to' the declaration was properly sustained. <em>Avirett </em>v. <em>State, supra; Weeks </em>v. <em>News Pub. Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">We do not understand the appellant, as contending, that the words contained in the three paragraphs of the published article, below the headline, are libellous <em>per se, </em>for no one \u25a0could ascribe to them the meaning that the plaintiff was dishonest; or that he failed to pay or was, unable to pay his \u25a0debts; or that he was insolvent, or that he managed his business improperly. But the appellant insists that the real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>\u201csting\u201d in the publication is contained in the headline. Even if we were to assume that the headline, if it alone had been published, when read in connection with the inducement and <em>colloquium, </em>would be susceptible of the meanings ascribed to the publication in the innuendoes, the rule is that the libellous character of the article must be determined from the <em>whole article </em>published. In <em>Newell on Slander and Libel </em>(3rd ed.), sec. 368, the author says: \u201cThe defendant is therefore entitled to have the whole of the alleged lihel read as part of the plaintiff\u2019s case. And for the purpose of showing that what he wrote was no libel, and will not bear the construction which plaintiff seeks to put upon it, he may give in evidence any other passages in the same publication which plainly refer to the same matter, or which qualify or explain the pasage sued on.\u201d In <em>Gustin </em>v. <em>Evening Press Co., 172 </em>Mich. 311, the court said: \u201cTo test its libellous quality, a publication must be considered as a whole,\u201d and in the case of <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>News Pub. Co., supra, </em>this Court, in affirming a judgment on demurrer in favor of the defendant, said: \u201cReading the article as a whole, and allowing the words employed their natural significance, we fail to find anything in the publication itself, or in the inducement and <em>colloquium, </em>to justify the meaning, ascribed tq it in the declaration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Words may have different meanings according to the connection in which they are used, and their context may confine them to but a single and innocent construction. It would be a dangerous doctrine, and tend to promote grave injustice, to- permit words to be withdrawn from others with which they are connected and used by the publisher, and then impute to them a meaning not warranted by the whole publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Mow when the words in the headline in the article complained of ar\u00e9 read in connection with the rest of the publication they can only mean that the plaintiff refused to p-ay one of' his employees, or actors, all that the actor claimed was due him, and that the actor thereupon cut the curtains of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s theatre, for which the plaintiff had him arrested. This construction clearly does not impute to the plaintiff a refusal or failure to pay his <em>honest debts, </em>or dishonesty or insolvency, or any mismanagement of his theatre calculated to injure or prejudice him or his business. We must therefore hold that the alleged libellous matter does not warrant any of the meanings ascribed to it in the <em>innuendoes, </em>and that the demurrer to the declaration was properly sustained by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
