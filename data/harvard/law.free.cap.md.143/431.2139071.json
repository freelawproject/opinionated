Hook, one-third to Sebastian J. Hook, and one-third to Katherine Brauer, and on the ...death of either of said beneficiaries their respective shares in the said income shall be paid to their issue, 'until the last of said beneficiaries shall depart their life', then said trust shall cease and the corpus be - divided equally among their surviving children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">\u25a0 The testator's brothers and sister, who were the original beneficiaries for life under the provision just quoted, are now all deceased, Katherine Brauer having died on July 14th, 1914, Sebastian J. Hook on February 14, 1915, and Jacob W. Hook on August 29,1922. There are. nine surviving children of Katherine Brafier, eleven of Sebastian J. Hook, and two of Jacob1 W. Hook. Since the death of Katherine Brauer in 1914 her-children have been paid, ,a.s the will provided, the share of income which their mother had received. The children of Sebastian J. Hook have likewise been receiving one-third of the income from the trust estate since his death in 1915. But the time for the termination of the trust has now arrived in consequence of the recent death of Jacob W. Hook, the last survivor of the legatees for life, as the will directs that when \u201cthe last of said beneficiaries shall depart their life, then said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>trust shall cease and the corpus be divided equally among their surviving children.\u201d The question to be determined is whether the distribution of the corpus among the surviving children of the life beneficiaries should be <em>per capita </em>or <em>per stirpes. </em>The appeal is from a decree construing the will as intending a <em>per capita </em>division. This conclusion was in accordance with the views expressed in the; answers filed by the children of Katherine Bruner and Sebastian J. Hook, but it was contrary to the contention of thei children of Jacob W. Hook, and they have therefore appealed from the decree. As there are twenty-two; surviving children of the three life beneficiaries a <em>per capita </em>distribution would give each of them one twenty-second of the estate, while on the basis of a division <em>per stiipes </em>each of the, nine children of Katherine Brauer would receive one twenty-seventh, each of the eleven children of Seibastion J. Hook on\u00a9 thirty-third, 'and each of the two, children of Jacob W. Hook one sixth.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">It is argued on behalf of the appellants that as the testator adopted the <em>per stirpes </em>method of disposition as to the income of the trust estate, on the death of a beneficiary for life, during the period of the trust, he presumably intended the seme principle to; be; applied to the division of the corpus. But the provision as to- the; payment of income was expressly made operative only until the death of the last surviving legatee for life. When, that event occurred the corpus of the estate was to be \u201cdivided equally\u201d among the surviving children of those for whose benefit primarily tile trust bad been created. Prior to the death of the last surviving life beneficiary the corpus; was clearly intended to be held and administered as an undivided estate. Until the trust expired only the income was to be divided, and that was to be paid in equal shares to the testator\u2019s; brothers and sister for life, each receiving one-third. It was not intended that the children of any of them should receive any part of the income during their parent\u2019s life. The direction was that \u201con the death of either of said beneficiaries their respective shares in the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>income shall he paid to their issue,\u201d until \u2019the expiration, of the trust. It would have involved a departure from the general plan and purpose of the will to have provided for a <em>per capita </em>division of <em>&amp; </em>deceased life beneficiary\u2019s share of the income among the children of all three of the persons originally entitled. The effect of such a provision would have been to give interests in the income to children of a legatee for life while their parent was still living. This was evidently not a result which the testator desired. The expression of his purpose in regard to the income, therefore, does not, in our opinion, reflect upon the question relating to the corpus which we have to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">No disposition of the corpus of the trust estate was contemplated by the will until the death of the last survivor of the testator\u2019s sister and brothers. Then, as the will declares \u201csaid trust \u2019shall cease and the corpus be divided equally among their surviving children.\u201d There is no uncertainty in the description of the class of remaindermen among whom the corpus of the estate is to' he divided. They are the surviving children of the brothers and sister of the testator named in his. will. The division of the corpus wias directed to he made <em>equally </em>among the members of tbe class of persons which the will describes. A distribution <em>per stirpes </em>would not satisfy \u25a0that requirement. It would result in an unequal division of the estate among the designated remaindermen. It is only by a <em>per capita </em>distribution that the testator\u2019s declared purpose .as to&gt; the disposition of the corpus can be given effect. As we find nothing in the context of the will to qualify the meaning of the provision relating specifically to tbe corpus, We must apply its terms according to their plain intent that there shall be a general equality of participation by those to whom the estate is limited in remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">In the case of <em>McPherson vs. Snowden, </em>19 Md. 197, there was a trust, created by deed, for the benefit of the four daughters of the grantor, and their issue, until the death of the last survivor of the four daughters, the issue of any daughter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>dying while the trust continued to take her portion of the income, and it was provided that .after the death of all of the grantor\u2019s daughters, the property conveyed by the deed should pass to \u201call the issue of all the daughters.\u201d of the grantor, \u201cin fee simple.\u201d The word \u201cissue\u201d as used in the deed, was considered to he synonymous with \u201cchildren,\u201d and with respect to the disposition of the corpus the Court said: \u201cThe terms of the grant To all the issue of all the daughters,\u2019 entirely exclude the idea of a representative right through the daughters, and make that issue, or the children of the daughters, the immediate and equal recipients of the benefits of tlie grant. * * * The corpus of the estate is not disposed of until the happening of the contingency of the death of all tlie daughters., and then it is given to. all the children-as a class, who must necessarily take <em>per capita,.\u201d </em>There is a close analogy between the trust provision now under consideration and tlie one construed in the ease just cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The will construed in <em>Allender vs. Keplinger, </em>62 Md. 7, provided life est-ates. in all the property of the. testator for his two daughters and directed that after both 'had died the estate should be divided equally among the issue of Ms deceased son and of the two daughters. It was. held that all the issue of the son and daughters composed a class of persons, among whom there should be a <em>per capita </em>division of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">In <em>Brittain, </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>46 Md. 186, it was. provided by the will there considered that the residuary estate of the testator should be \u201cequally divided between\u201d bis' daughter who was then living and the: children of a daughter who was deceased. Tti was. held that the grandchildren were entitled to share <em>per capita, </em>with the remaining daughter, there being no. indication in the will that they were intended to take as the representatives of their deceased mother. That decision was recently followed in the case of <em>Courtenay </em>v. <em>Courtenay, </em>138 Md. 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">It was said by this. Court in <em>Levering </em>v. <em>Orrick, </em>97 Md. 145: \u201cIn bequests, to. descendants equally, or to all the descendants of any person, or to the descendants' simply, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>ri\u00f3le is -all take <em>per capita </em>unless a contrary intention appears.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">An interesting and instructive ease, cited for the appellees, supporting our conclusion, is that of <em>In Re </em>Stone, L. R. 1895, N. S. 2 Chancery Div. 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In the cases cited on behalf of the appellants it appeared from -the terms of the wills there interpreted that the persons entitled to the estates awaiting'! division were intended to take by representation. The case of <em>Levering </em>v. <em>Levering, </em>14 Md. 30, upon which the argument for the appellants specially relied, was concerned- with a will by which .the testator bequeathed the income from his residuary estate to his .two daughters for life, and provided that \u201cin the case of the death of either of them', the rents, issues and profits of the one so dying shall be equally divided between the heirs of the said deceased,\u201d and that after the death of both daughters the estate should be converted into money which he direoted-to be distributed among the \u201cheirs and representatives of the life tenants.\u201d In <em>Plummer </em>v. <em>Shepherd, </em>94 Md. 466, the devisees and legatees were classified as groups of \u201cheirs\u201d of persons to whom the will referred. The principle of representation was also clearly involved in the testamentary provisions construed in the case of <em>Singluff </em>v. <em>Johns, </em>87 Md. 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The design of tire will now before us, in regard to' the separate dispositions of the income and corpus of the trust estate, is simple and consistent. The fact that the testator wished the income to be applied in the manner specified during the continuance of the trust is wholly compatible with his apparent desire to give the corpus equally to all the children of his deceased brothers and .sister after the event by which the trust was to be terminated. This being the evident purpose of the provision relating to the corpus we are obliged to-give it effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">\n<em>Decree affimied, the costs to he paid out of the-corpus of the estate.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
