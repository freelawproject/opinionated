Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 209, subd. (b); count I), second degree robbery (\u00a7 211; count II), attempting to dissuade a witness by threat of violence (\u00a7 136.1, subd. (c)(1); count III), and evading a pursuing peace officer (Veh. Code, \u00a7 2800.2; count IV) and found firearm use allegations (\u00a7 12022.5) true. Appellant then admitted felony conviction allegations (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (a), 667.5). Appellant was sentenced to state prison for life plus 18 years and 8 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Appellant contends the trial court erred (1) in answering a jury question without obtaining appellant\u2019s personal waiver of his attorney\u2019s presence (\u00a7 1138) (2) in giving the standard reasonable doubt instruction (CALJIC No. 2.90) (3) in not staying the sentence on count III (\u00a7 654) (4) in imposing two section 12022.5 enhancements and (5) in imposing both a section 667, subdivision (a) and a section 667.5 enhancement for a single felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">We find merit in only appellant\u2019s last two contentions, modify the judgment accordingly, and as modified, affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">There being no insufficiency of evidence claim, we synopsize the facts. Our perspective favors the judgment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barnes </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 284, 303-304 [228 Cal.Rptr. 228, 721 P.2d 110].)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">On August 23, 1991, appellant and at least two confederates kidnapped a truck driver and hijacked his tractor trailer loaded with eleven pallets of compact discs, audiotapes, and videotapes. During the two-hour kidnapping appellant looked at the victim\u2019s driver\u2019s license and said, \u201cIf you open your mouth we are going to kill you. I know where you live.\u201d The victim, who had been handcuffed, was released unharmed, walked to a hospital, and reported the hijacking to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">On September 4, 1991, after a high-speed pursuit, appellant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">1. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in answering a jury question without obtaining his personal waiver of his attorney\u2019s presence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">During deliberations the jury sent a question to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1655\">*1655</page-number>Appellant acknowledges \u201c[djefense counsel waived his presence, and the presence of defendant, for the answer to the . . . question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The record supports the acknowledgement: \u201cThe Court: People versus Nichols. The defendant is not present. Neither counsel is present, [f] They have both been informed regarding the question and the suggested answer, and both counsel waive their presence and the defendant\u2019s presence as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Nevertheless, appellant contends <em>he </em>was not asked to and did not waive his right to have <em>counsel </em>present<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when the trial court answered the jury\u2019s question. From this foundation appellant constructs the following bridge to prejudice. Appellant states: \u201cIn this case, since counsel was absent during the instruction, there is no guarantee appellant was not prejudiced. The answer provided the jury, <em>which is unknown because unrecorded, </em>\u2018may have affected substantial rights of appellant.\u2019 (Cite.) For instance, the court may have provided an answer which directed the jury to return a guilty verdict on the count 1 charge.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Appellant is mistaken. As we have indicated, the trial court informed the jury in open court that counsel had been informed of their question \u201cand the suggested answer\u201d and that counsel had waived their presence, and the defendant\u2019s presence. The reporter\u2019s transcript then reflects the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-8\">\u201cThe Court: . . . Mrs. Wilson, you are the foreperson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-9\">\u201cJuror Wilson: Yes, Your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-10\">\u201cThe Court: I received the following question. \u2018Can the defendant be found guilty of kidnapping by force without the use of the firearm? <em>The answer is yes. </em>[j[] <em>Does that answer the </em>question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-11\">\n<em>\u201c(The jurors answered collectively in the affirmative.)</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-12\">\u201cThe Court: Go back and continue deliberations. Thank you.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">The record, clear and unequivocal, refutes appellant\u2019s conjecture that the trial court may have \u201cdirected the jury to return a guilty verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">Before answering the jury\u2019s question the trial court notified counsel. The trial court also informed counsel of the \u201csuggested answer.\u201d Whether counsel was present or absent the simple and correct \u201cyes\u201d answer would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1656\">*1656</page-number>been the same. Therefore, either because there was no error <em>{People </em>v. <em>Lang </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 991, 1028 [264 Cal.Rptr. 386, 782 P.2d 627]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bloyd </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 333, 358-361 [233 Cal.Rptr. 368, 729 P.2d 802]) or because any error was harmless <em>{People </em>v. <em>Douglas </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 468, 517-518 [268 Cal.Rptr. 126, 788 P.2d 640]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hovey </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 543, 585 [244 Cal.Rptr. 121, 749 P.2d 776]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chagolla </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 422, 430-433 [193 Cal.Rptr. 711]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Conrad </em>(1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 308, 323-324 [107 Cal.Rptr. 421]), appellant\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">2. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in giving the standard reasonable doubt instruction (CALJIC No. 2.90).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">After appellant filed his opening brief the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska </em>(1994) 511 U.S. _ [127 L.Ed.2d 583, 114 S.Ct. 1239] which upheld CALJIC No. 2.90. Appellant\u2019s contention is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">3. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in not staying the sentence on count III (\u00a7 654).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">Appellant argues he cannot be punished both for kidnapping the victim (\u00a7 209, subd. (b); count I) and threatening to kill him if he \u201copen[ed] [his] mouth\u201d (\u00a7 136.1, subd. (c)(1); count III) because the crimes \u201cwere part of an indivisible course of conduct with one intent and objective\u201d (\u00a7 654; <em>Neal </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1960) 55 Cal.2d 11 [9 Cal.Rptr. 607, 357 P.2d 839]). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">In declining to overrule <em>Neal </em>our Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-9\">\u201cDecisions since <em>Neal </em>have limited the rule\u2019s application in various ways. Some have narrowly interpreted the length of time the defendant had a specific objective, and thereby found similar but <em>consecutive </em>objectives permitting multiple punishment. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Harrison </em>[(1989)] 48 Cal.3d [321] at pp. 334-338 [256 Cal.Rptr. 401, 768 P.2d 1078] [multiple sex crimes each have the separate objective of achieving additional sexual gratification]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>[(1979)] 23 Cal.3d [545] at pp. 551-554 [153 Cal.Rptr. 40, 591 P.2d 63] [similar]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Trotter </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 363, 368 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 648] [\u2018each shot [fired at the same victim] evinced a separate intent to do violence\u2019].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-10\">\u201cOther cases have found separate, although sometimes simultaneous, objectives under the facts. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 112, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1657\">*1657</page-number>162 [255 Cal.Rptr. 813, 768 P.2d 32] [assault of robbery victim had separate intent and objective than the robbery]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nguyen </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 181, 189-193, 196 [251 Cal.Rptr. 40] [harming of unresisting robbery victim a separate objective from the robbery itself]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Booth </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 1499, 1502 [248 Cal.Rptr. 64] [\u2018dual objectives of rape and theft when entering the victims\u2019 residences\u2019 supported separate punishment for burglaries and rapes]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Porter </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 34, 37-39 [239 Cal.Rptr. 269] [robbery and kidnapping the same victim for a later, additional, robbery had separate objectives].) Additionally, even <em>Neal </em>itself made clear that crimes of violence against multiple victims were separately punishable. <em>{Neal, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d at pp. 20-21.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-5\">\u201cThese examples, which are not exhaustive, have helped mitigate the concerns regarding the <em>Neal </em>test in specific situations. . . .\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Latimer </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1203, 1211-1212 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 144, 858 P.2d 611].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-6\"><em>Latimer </em>also observed: \u201cWe also stress that nothing we say in this opinion is intended to cast doubt on any of the later judicial limitations of the <em>Neal </em>rule. For example, we do not intend to question the validity of decisions finding consecutive, and therefore separate, intents, and those finding different, if simultaneous, intents. . . . Multiple punishment in those cases remains appropriate.\u201d (5 Cal.4th at p. 1216.)</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Appellate counsel characterizes appellant\u2019s \u201centry into the truck, his movement of the truck, and his threat to [the victim] not to divulge facts concerning the robbery\u201d as \u201ca course of conduct with but one intent to deprive [the victim] of the truck so that appellant could sell the musical recordings.\u201d This is not how appellant characterized his own conduct. Appellant testified he was merely buying stolen property from a willing thief, the victim truck driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">The jury disbelieved appellant\u2019s version and the trial court rejected the version now suggested by appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">\u201cThe question of whether the acts of which defendant has been convicted constitute an indivisible course of conduct is primarily a factual determination, made by the trial court on the basis of its findings concerning the defendant\u2019s intent and objective in committing the acts. This determination will not be reversed on appeal unless unsupported by the evidence presented at trial.\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Lee </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 774, 786 [168 Cal.Rptr. 231].)</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">We find substantial evidence that appellant had two separate objectives: (1) to hijack the truck by kidnapping and robbing the victim and (2) to avoid detection and conviction by dissuading and intimidating the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1658\">*1658</page-number>The first objective was accomplished in two hours. The second was ongoing. It was initially successful when the victim, fearing for his life, falsely told the police he had been blindfolded and could not identify any of the kidnappers.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The means of achieving each objective was also different. A shotgun pressed against the victim\u2019s stomach achieved the first. Looking at the victim\u2019s driver\u2019s license, reading aloud his address, and threatening future harm achieved the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Appellant was properly sentenced on both counts I and III.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">4. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in imposing two section 12022.5 enhancements.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">The trial court imposed gun use enhancements (\u00a7 12022.5) in connection with <em>both </em>counts I and III. Appellant contends it was error to do so. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">Section 12022.5 provides that \u201cany person who personally <em>uses </em>a firearm in the commission . . . of a felony\u201d shall be punished by an additional term of imprisonment. But <em>In re Culbreth </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 330, 333 [130 Cal.Rptr. 719, 551 P.2d 23] \u201cheld that even if there are multiple counts involving multiple victims of violent crime, the enhancement may be imposed only once \u2018if all the charged offenses are incident to one objective and effectively comprise an indivisible transaction.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>King </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 59, 63 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 233, 851 P.2d 27].)</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">Although <em>People </em>v. <em>King </em>overruled <em>Culbreth </em>(17 Cal.3d at p. 79), it did so only prospectively. <em>Culbreth </em>applies to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">Applying <em>Culbreth </em>to our facts is not without difficulty. \u201c[A]ppellate courts (and undoubtedly trial courts) have found it very difficult, if not impossible, to consistently implement the rule.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>King, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 77.) Notwithstanding substantial evidence appellant harbored two separate intents or objectives for purposes of section 654, appellant had continuous possession of the shotgun during the two-hour commission of counts I and III, there was but one victim, and the commission of count III occurred during the indivisible kidnap-robbery transaction. We conclude, within the meaning of section 12022.5 as construed by <em>Culbreth, </em>there was but one personal firearm use.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1659\">*1659</page-number>5. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in imposing both a section 667, subdivision (a) and a section 667.5 enhancement for a single felony conviction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Respondent concedes \u201cthat the trial court erred in imposing two separate enhancements based on a single prior conviction for voluntary manslaughter: a five-year enhancement pursuant to section 667(a), and a one-year enhancement pursuant to section 667.5(b).\u201d The concession is appropriate. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1142 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 753, 857 P.2d 1163].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The abstract of judgment is ordered corrected by indicating that the count III enhancement has been stayed (\u201cS\u201d) for a total of \u201c0\u201d years, by striking the section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement, and by correcting tide \u201cTotal term imposed\u201d entry on page 1, line 8 to read \u201c9 years, 8 months.\u201d A corrected abstract of judgment shall be sent to the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">As corrected, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">Lillie, P. J., and Johnson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 1, 1995.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-14\"> Statutory references, unless otherwise noted, are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b819-15\"> Appellant makes no claim concerning his own absence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b823-11\"> In his pro se brief appellant argues the trial court erred in imposing sentences on both counts I (\u00a7 209) and II (\u00a7 211). Appellant is mistaken. Because the count II sentence was stayed there was no violation of section 654.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
