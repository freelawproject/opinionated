J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG\">Apellant Carol Butcher was an overnight guest at the home of Donald and Peggy Gay in Pine Mountain on August 4, 1990. On February 20, 1991, appellant filed this action against respondent Donald Gay. She alleged that she had contracted Lyme disease \u201cas a result of exposure to infested ticks\u201d on respondent\u2019s property, and that respondent had \u201cfailed to spray the area, post signs or prevented [szc] domestic dog(s) from coming into contact with the plaintiff thereby exposing her to a vector of the disease without her knowledge.\u201d Her third amended complaint presented two causes of action, one entitled \u201cpremises liability\u201d and one entitled \u201cgeneral negligence.\u201d Both causes of action alleged in essence that respondent had negligently permitted his dog to become infested with a Lyme-disease-carrying \u201cwestern black legged tick,\u201d had negligently failed to warn appellant to avoid exposure to the dog, and had negligently allowed the dog to sit on appellant\u2019s lap. Respondent\u2019s answer, filed in January 1992, denied the allegations of appellant\u2019s third amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Respondent moved for summary judgment. He contended that certain undisputed facts demonstrated that he \u201cowed no duty to protect or defend plaintiff from the alleged harmful insect\u201d and that he was not the cause of any injury to appellant. The superior court granted the motion and ruled that \u201cdefendant was under no duty to prevent the injury plaintiff alleges occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Respondent presented the following evidence in support of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Peggy Gay\u2019s declaration asserted that she had owned a pet dog named Pansy since 1988.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since 1989 Peggy, respondent and Pansy had lived at 1701 Zermatt Drive in Pine Mountain Club. During this time she had never seen a western black-legged tick, and had never been told by any person that the western black-legged tick was prevalent in or indigenous to the Pine Mountain area. She became acquainted with appellant sometime in 1990, and appellant was invited to stay as a guest in the Gay home during a local community festival. Appellant arrived in Pine Mountain on the afternoon of August 4, 1990, and left the Gay home in the late morning on August 5, 1990. At no time during appellant\u2019s visit to the Gay home did appellant say that she had seen a western black-legged tick or any other insect. Nor did appellant indicate that she had been bitten by any tick or insect, or complain of any rash or \u201cskin irritant.\u201d At no time prior to appellant\u2019s visit had anyone ever told Peggy that anyone had been bitten by a western black-legged tick in the Pine Mountain area. Nor had any guests to her home complained of seeing any fleas or western black-legged ticks on the Gay property, or of having been bitten by any such tick. She had not seen or heard any announcement about the presence of Lyme disease in California, and had received no information that the western black-legged tick was a carrier of the disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Peggy kept Pansy \u201cwell groomed and clean.\u201d She occasionally inspected Pansy for fleas and ticks, and used flea and tick shampoos \u201con a monthly basis to repel these insects\u201d but had never seen any evidence of a tick or flea actually having been present on Pansy. Pansy\u2019s veterinarian was Dr. Diane Cosko. Dr. Cosko had never told Peggy that Dr. Cosko had ever found fleas or ticks on Pansy.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Respondent\u2019s declaration was virtually identical to Peggy\u2019s. It included the same denials of any knowledge that western black-legged ticks carried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Lyme disease or that these ticks were prevalent in the Pine Mountain area. Respondent added that he had become acquainted with appellant during a visit to his son\u2019s home earlier in 1990, and that it was respondent who had invited appellant to stay as a guest at the Gay home during a local community festival.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The declaration of Dr. Cosko (Pansy\u2019s veterinarian) stated that she had \u201chad occasion\u201d to examine Pansy and that during her examination she had never found Pansy to possess a tick or any portion of a tick. Nor did she see any sign that Pansy had been bitten by a tick. Nor did Pansy exhibit any symptoms of Lyme disease. She had never found Pansy\u2019s fur to be dirty or matted. Dr. Cosko also stated that in her capacity as a veterinarian in the Frazier Park area, she was \u201cresponsible for posting information in my office regarding pests that may cause serious illness to pets or their owners.\u201d She was never informed at any time prior to August 15, 1990, that any tick in Kern County had tested positive for the Lyme disease bacteria. At no time prior to August 4 had she received any warning notices from the California State Department of Health or the local mosquito abatement district regarding the presence of Lyme disease in the Frazier Park or Pine Mountain area. Prior to August 15, 1990, she had not posted in her office any pamphlets or reading paraphernalia regarding Lyme disease. A vaccine for Lyme disease was made available sometime after August 15, 1990. The vaccine was distributed by the Fort Dodge Chemical Company and \u201cwas intended to be used on the local canine population.\u201d The vaccine \u201cwas accompanied by information regarding Lyme disease to be disseminated to the general public.\u201d \u201cAfter August 1990\u201d Dr. Cosko was \u201ccalled upon to review literature regarding the spread of Lyme disease and to present lectures to various community groups, in the Frazier Park area\u201d regarding the spread of Lyme disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Joan Peet owned Joan\u2019s Canine Corner, a pet grooming business. Prior to opening her business, she attended canine grooming classes for a six-month period. Some of these classes related to the detection and identification of certain pests that may be on a pet when the pet is presented for grooming. She was trained in the inspection for and detection of the presence of ticks or fleas, and in the detection of evidence that would indicate such pests had recently been present on a dog. Between June 1988 and August 1992, Peggy brought Pansy to Joan\u2019s Canine Corner \u201cfor regularly scheduled grooming.\u201d During the summer of 1990, Pansy\u2019s regularly scheduled grooming took place on June 27, 1990, and on August 9, 1990. At each appointment Peet inspected Pansy to determine if any fleas or ticks were present. Peet never saw any fleas or ticks on Pansy and \u201cnever saw . . . any evidence that such pests had been present.\u201d At no time during Pansy\u2019s visits did Peet find Pansy\u2019s coat to be matted or in disrepair.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The declaration of Dan Bird, M.D., offered the opinion that appellant was not suffering from Lyme disease. He reached this opinion after reviewing the medical records of several doctors who had treated appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Respondent also presented portions of appellant\u2019s deposition testimony. Appellant testified that she had no information the Gays knew the dog had ticks on it. She also stated that she never actually saw any insect or bug on her own body while she was at the Gay home. All she saw was something that looked like an insect bite.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Appellant opposed the motion by attempting to demonstrate that she had contracted Lyme disease from a tick carried by Pansy, and that respondent should have taken steps to mitigate the possibility of such an occurrence. She presented the declarations of herself, Dr. Wilfred Ellis, and attorneys Jack M. Janis and Michael P. Dacquisto. She also presented respondent\u2019s responses to appellant\u2019s request for admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Respondent admitted in requests for admissions that he had \u201cpermitted the dog to jump onto the lap of plaintiff at her request.\u201d He also admitted that the dog was not wearing a flea and tick collar on August 4,1990, or during the six months prior to that date, that he permitted the dog to freely roam the wooded area adjacent to the Gay property, and that the dog was unlicensed. Respondent also admitted that \u201cdog owners have a reasonable responsibility to protect members of the public from diseases, of the nature that are prevented through vaccinations and regular shots of pets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The declaration of Wilfred Ellis, M.D., stated that Dr. Ellis was a medical doctor specializing in the area of infectious diseases, that he had examined appellant and that he was of the opinion that appellant was suffering from \u201cStage III Lyme disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The declaration of appellant\u2019s attorney, Jack M. Janis, stated that in late 1990 he went to the City of Los Angeles Department of Animal Regulation in Northridge, California to purchase a license for his dog. While paying for the license, he noticed a document on the wall which discussed Lyme disease in California and the location of the tick that spreads it. He spoke with an animal control officer about the document. He \u201clearned that the document was an official publication of the State of California, Department of Health Services, Vector Surveillance and Control Branch.\u201d Janis asked the officer for a copy of the document and the officer complied. Janis attached a copy of the document to his declaration. The document is entitled \u201cFacts about Lyme Disease in California.\u201d The document describes Lyme disease as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>\u201cLyme disease is an infectious disease transmitted by the bite of a tick. It is caused by a spirochate (a spiral-shaped bacterium) that may persist in the human body for several years if not properly treated with antibiotics. The natural history of this disease is not completely understood and the illness it produces takes many forms. Because of varied symptoms, diagnosis can be difficult. This newly recognized disease was first noted in 1975 at Old Lyme, Connecticut, and was first seen in California in 1978.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">\u201cLyme disease is now recognized as an important tick-borne disease throughout the northeastern USA from Massachusetts to Delaware; in the midwest in Minnesota and Wisconsin; in some southeastern states; and in the west in California, Oregon, and Nevada, as well as in many European countries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The document (also referred to by appellant as a \u201cleaflet\u201d) describes the manner of transmission of Lyme disease as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">\u201cThe Western Black-legged Tick (Ixodus pacificus) is the only tick of the 49 species occurring in California that is known to transmit Lyme disease. The spirochete causing Lyme disease was first isolated from this tick in 1984.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">\u201cThe tick has three active life stages: Immature stages (larvae and nymphs) feed on small rodents, rabbits, lizards, birds, and occasionally large mammals. Adults feed on large mammals, including deer, dogs, and humans. All stages feed by imbedding their mouth-parts into the skin of a host and taking a blood meal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">\u201cPreliminary studies show that white-footed mice and deer may be the primary reservoirs of Lyme disease in California. Larval and nymphal ticks acquire spirochetes from the blood of infected mammals as they feed; the infected nymphs and adults transmit the spirochetes to other mammals (including humans). In California a low percentage of the ticks tested are infected with the Lyme disease spirochete.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">\u201cAdult ticks are most commonly found from December through June, during the period of the year when humidity is usually high. The adult female is red-brown with black legs, about 1/8 of an inch long; males are smaller and entirely brownish-black. Both are teardrop shaped. While the Western Black-legged Tick has been reported from 50 of the 58 California counties, it is most common in the humid coastal areas and on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada range.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-10\">\u201cThis tick can be found on grasses and brush in both urban and rural settings. Ticks do not fly, jump, or drop from trees. Instead they climb to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>tips of vegetation, typically along animal trails or paths, and wait for a host to brush against them. This behavioral method of finding a host is called questing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Under a heading entitled \u201cSymptoms,\u201d the leaflet states in part that \u201c[t]he first recognizable symptom usually is a characteristic rash . . . that occurs 3 to 30 days after the bite of an infected tick.\u201d The rash \u201cis a red, blotchy, circular, expanding rash that may grow to several inches in diameter and clears centrally, producing a ring-like appearance.\u201d Under the heading \u201cTick Avoidance\u201d the leaflet gives eight recommendations for avoiding contracting the disease. These are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">\u201cPersonal</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">\u201cTuck pants into boots or socks, and shirt into pants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">\u201cWear light-colored clothing so ticks can easily be seen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">\u201cApply insect repellent on pants, socks, and shoes. Use a repellent registered for use against ticks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">\u201cAvoid trail margins, brush, and grassy areas when in tick country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">\u201cCheck yourself and your children frequently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-12\">\u201cEnvironmental</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-13\">\u201cMow grass along trails, buildings, and camping areas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-14\">\u201cRemove brush along trails or other areas of high human activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-15\">\u201cArea application of insecticides is <em>not </em>effective for tick control.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-16\">The leaflet includes a map of California showing the \u201cDistribution of the Western Black-legged Tick\u201d in the state. The areas of the state where the tick has been found are designated by a dark shading. A fairly large, almost oval-shaped area of central California is not shaded on the map, but it does not appear that the reader of the pamphlet can tell with any degree of certainty whether the Pine Mountain area is or is not an area where the tick has been found. The lower left hand comer of a page of the leaflet bears the notation \u201c4/86.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-17\">Appellant\u2019s declaration attempted to dispute respondent\u2019s contention that appellant did not suffer from Lyme disease. She stated that Dr. Bird never examined her. Attached to her declaration was a document which she said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>was prepared by a Dr. Ling and which states, among other things, \u201cYou have clinical Lyme disease.\u201d Her declaration also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\">\u201c7. After I learned I had Lyme disease, I did extensive reading on it. As a result of that reading, I learned that ticks were the insects that carried this disease, the ticks that carry it are very small and not visible to the naked eye, and that these ticks are generally found in wooded areas and often times on dogs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">\u201c8. At no time while I was in Frazier Park, at Mr. Gay\u2019s house, did I come in contact with any dogs or other animals that carry ticks, other than Mr. Gay\u2019s dog, Pansy. I first noticed a red spot on my leg, below my knee, that looked like a bite, and extensive itching while I was at Mr. Gay\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">\u201c9. At no time did Mr. Gay ever tell me to wear long clothes, to use insect spray, to stay away from his dog, or to be on the lookout for ticks that might bite me. If he had done this, I would have taken these precautions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">\u201c10. While I was at Mr. Gay\u2019s house the dog appeared dirty and unkept. It did not look like it had been recently groomed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">\u201c11. Mr. Gay\u2019s house in Frazier Park is in an area that is somewhat mountainous and wooded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">The declaration of appellant\u2019s other attorney, Michael P. Dacquisto, described the procedural history of this case prior to respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment. These procedural facts are pertinent only to appellant\u2019s contention that the court should have continued the hearing on respondent\u2019s summary judgment motion to allow appellant to conduct further discovery. We will set forth the pertinent procedural facts in our discussion of that particular issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">Contentions on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">Appellant contends (1) respondent did not establish the absence of a legal duty to appellant, (2) respondent did not establish the absence of a triable issue as to causation, and (3) the trial court should have continued the hearing on the motion so appellant could conduct further discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">In order for a plaintiff to succeed in a negligence action brought against a defendant, the plaintiff must demonstrate (1) the existence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>duty of due care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, (2) defendant\u2019s breach of that duty, and (3) injury or damage to the plaintiff that is (4) legally caused by the defendant\u2019s breach. <em>{Peter W. </em>v. <em>San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 814, 820 [131 Cal.Rtpr. 854]; 6 Witkin Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Torts, \u00a7 732; 4 Witkin Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Pleading, \u00a7 527.) In the present case, respondent attempted to demonstrate that he owed no duty to appellant to take steps to prevent her from being bitten by a Lyme-disease-carrying tick. A motion for summary judgment \u201cshall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c); see also <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Cracchiolo </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 18, 35 [210 Cal.Rtpr. 762, 694 P.2d 1134]; <em>Lipson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 362, 374 [182 Cal.Rtpr. 629, 644 P.2d 822].) When respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment was heard and decided in 1993, subdivision (n) of Code of Civil Procedure section 437c stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">\u201c(n) For purposes of motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">\u201c(2) A defendant or cross-defendant has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action. Once the defendant or cross-defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff or cross-complainant to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">An appellate court reviewing a trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment will make a de novo determination of whether there is a triable issue of fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>{Saldana </em>v. <em>Globe-Weis Systems Co. </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1505, 15111515 [285 Cal.Rtpr. 385.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The moving party\u2019s papers are strictly construed, while those of the party opposing the motion are liberally construed. If there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>is any doubt as to whether summary judgment should be granted, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion. <em>(Brooks </em>v. <em>Eugene Burger Management Corp. </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1611, 1618 [264 Cal.Rtpr. 756].)</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\n<em>Duty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">In a negligence case the existence and scope of a defendant\u2019s duty is a legal question to be decided by the court. It is not a factual question to be decided by the trier of fact. The California Supreme Court made this clear in <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Uribe </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 564 [224 Cal.Rtpr. 664, 715 P.2d 624], where the court stated in footnote 6 at pages 572-573: \u201cThe question of \u2018duty\u2019 is decided by the court, not the jury. [Citations.] As this court has explained, \u2018duty\u2019 is not an immutable fact of nature \u2018 \u201cbut only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] In California, the general rule is that all persons have a duty \u2018 \u201cto use ordinary care to prevent others being injured as the result of their conduct. . . .\u201d \u2019 <em>(Rowland </em>v. <em>Christian </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 108, 112 . . . .) <em>Rowland </em>enumerates a number of considerations, however, that have been taken into account by courts in various contexts to determine whether a departure from the general rule is appropriate: \u2018the major [considerations] are <em>the forseeability of harm to the plaintiff, </em>the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury, the closeness of the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered, the moral blame attached to the defendant\u2019s conduct, the policy of preventing future harm, the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach, and the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.\u2019 (Italics added.) [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The court reaffirmed in <em>Ann M. </em>v. <em>Pacific Plaza Shopping Center </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 666 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 137, 863 P.2d 207], that \u201cthe existence of a duty is a question of law for the court\u201d and an appellate court will \u201cdetermine de novo the existence and scope of the duty . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 674.)  <em>Ann M. </em>also clarified that although foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff is one of the seven considerations<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> listed in <em>Ballard </em>and in <em>Rowland </em>as matters to be taken into account by a court in determining the existence and scope of a duty, this does not mean a plaintiff is necessarily entitled to have the trier of fact determine whether the plaintiffs injury was a foreseeable result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>defendant\u2019s conduct. \u201cForeseeability, when analyzed to determine the existence or scope of a duty, is a question of law to be decided by the court.\u201d <em>(Ann M. </em>v. <em>Pacific Plaza Shopping Center, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 678.)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In <em>Brunelle </em>v. <em>Signore </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 122 [263 Cal.Rtpr. 415], the plaintiff spent a weekend at the defendant\u2019s vacation home in Cathedral City and was bitten by a \u201cbrown recluse spider.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 125.) The spider\u2019s venom destroyed tissue in the plaintiffs right foot. The foot became swollen and infected and developed ulcerated lesions. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged the defendant negligently maintained his property and \u201cfailed to warn plaintiff regarding the property\u2019s safe use . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 125.) The defendant moved for summary judgment and contended although he had a duty to use ordinary care to prevent others from being injured as a result of his conduct, that duty did not, as a matter of law, require him to take affirmative steps to protect against or to warn about the possibility of being bitten by a spider. The Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and stated: \u201cOur consideration of the <em>Rowland </em>factors leads us to the conclusion in this case that an owner or occupier of a private residence does not have a duty to protect or prevent bites from harmful insects where: (1) it is not generally known that the specific insect is indigenous to the area; (2) the homeowner has no knowledge that a specific harmful insect is prevalent in the area where his residence is located; (3) the homeowner has on no occasion seen the specific type of harmful insect either outside or inside his home; and (4) neither the homeowner nor the injured guest has seen the specific insect that bit the guest either before or after the bite occurred. To impose a duty under these circumstances, where the owner or occupier of the premises had no reason to anticipate or guard against such an occurrence would be unfair and against public policy. Imposition of a duty even in those cases where the homeowner shared general knowledge with the public at large that a specific harmful insect was prevalent in the area but the homeowner had not seen the specific harmful insect either outside or inside his home would impose a duty on the owner or occupier of the premises that would also be unfair and against public policy. In either of these instances, the burden on the landowner would be enormous and would border on establishing an absolute liability. Further, the task of defining the duty and the measures required of the owner or occupier of private residences to meet that duty would be difficult in the extreme.\u201d <em>(Brunelle </em>v. <em>Signore, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d at pp. 129-130, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Respondent\u2019s motion contended the evidence presented by respondent (summarized above) demonstrated the existence of seven \u201cundisputed facts\u201d (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437, subd. (b)) which entitled respondent to judgment in his favor as a matter of law. These \u201cfacts\u201d were: (1) it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>generally known that western black-legged ticks are indigenous to the Pine Mountain Club area; (2) defendant had no knowledge that western black-legged ticks possessing the Lyme disease bacteria were prevalent in the Pine Mountain Club area; (3) Donald Gay had, on no occasion, \u201cseen a Western Black-legged Tick infested with the Lyme disease bacteria\u201d either outside or inside his home; (4) neither Donald Gay nor appellant saw the specific insect that bit her either before or after the bite occurred; (5) Donald Gay\u2019s dog, Pansy, has not been a host to any flea or tick since 1988; (6) \u201cExpert evidence exists that prove [sic], to a medical certainty, that plaintiff does not have Lyme disease;\u201d and (7) \u201cThe actions of defendant Donald Gay are not the cause of plaintiff\u2019s alleged injuries of <em>[sic] </em>a result of her alleged infection with the Lyme disease bacteria.\u201d The last two of these seven purportedly \u201cundisputed\u201d facts appear to pertain to respondent\u2019s lack of causation argument, i.e., respondent\u2019s argument that respondent was not the cause of appellant\u2019s alleged Lyme disease because appellant does not actually have Lyme disease.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The superior court rejected this contention and so do we. The declaration of respondent\u2019s expert, Dr. Bird, was in conflict with that of appellant\u2019s expert, Dr. Ellis, on the issue of whether appellant actually suffered from Lyme disease. The remaining five \u201cundisputed facts\u201d appear to be designed to attempt to demonstrate respondent cannot be held liable to appellant under the test set forth in <em>Brunette, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Although we find <em>Brunette </em>to be instructive, the four-part test set forth in that opinion does not appear to us to be appropriate for application to the present case. <em>Brunette </em>deals with \u201cbites from harmful insects.\u201d (215 Cal.App.3d at p. 129.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The creature involved in <em>Brunette, </em>a brown recluse spider, was described as a \u201ctan to brown\u201d spider \u201capproximately the size of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>a half dollar.\u201d (215 Cal.App.3d at p. 125, fn. 1.) It could be \u201ceasily identified by a violin- or fiddle-shaped marking on its back.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Presumably all or most brown recluse spiders possess the same kind of venom which caused the injuries to the plaintiff in <em>Brunelle. </em>Presumably all or most people would, upon seeing such a spider, either recognize it as a creature which could cause harm or pain to a human being or at least suspect it to be a potential cause of harm or pain.  In the present case, however, appellant\u2019s own evidence described the adult female western black-legged tick as being about an eighth of an inch long and the males as \u201csmaller.\u201d Although there was no evidence that appellant herself had actually ever seen such a tick or was herself an expert, she stated in her declaration that such a tick is \u201cvery small and not visible to the naked eye.\u201d If a person were to see a western black-legged tick, one wonders how discernible it would be from a tick belonging to one of the other 48 species of ticks which, according to the leaflet presented by appellant, are known to exist in the state of California. Dr. Bird\u2019s declaration states in addition that \u201c[i]n California, only about one to two percent of the adult Western Black-legged Ticks are infected with the bacteria that causes Lyme disease.\u201d We therefore cannot say, based upon the evidence presented to us, that someone who sees a small tick is seeing a creature that necessarily can transmit Lyme disease and is therefore \u201charmful\u201d in that respect. Apparently only an extremely small percentage of all California ticks carry Lyme disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Even if we were to conclude that a homeowner (or dog owner) could, under some circumstances, be held liable in negligence for a guest\u2019s illness due to the transmission of a disease-carrying tick from the owner\u2019s dog (or from another source on the owner\u2019s property) to the guest, our consideration of the <em>Rowland </em>factors would nevertheless not lead us to impose liability without some degree of \u201cmoral blame attached to the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>(Rowland </em>v. <em>Christian </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 108, 113 [70 Cal.Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561, 32 A.L.R.3d 946]; <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Uribe, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 572.) In other words, without evidence that a defendant knew or reasonably should have known there was any danger or potential danger associated with that defendant\u2019s act or failure to act, any imposition of liability would in essence be the imposition of liability without fault.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">A duty does not generally arise in the context of negligence unless there is some awareness of a danger and some responsibility for it. Insects are a part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>of life\u2019s burdens and it is reasonable to conclude a person cannot be held responsible for their existence. Where one has not fostered an environment designed to cultivate such predators they are simply part of the inherent risks of living. However, where one was aware, or reasonably should have been aware, that an animal he or she was responsible for created a risk of harm as a result of infestation by a dangerous insect, then arguably, failure to act might result in liability for harm. Realistically, the <em>Brunette </em>criteria require a significant degree of knowledge of the existence and locus of the insect. It is the distinction between general knowledge that black widow, spiders are frequently found in wood storage areas and specific knowledge that a black widow is in a wood storage area.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">In the present case, respondent presented his own declaration stating that he was unaware, prior to the alleged incident involving appellant, of the presence of Lyme disease or of ticks carrying the disease in the Pine Mountain area. No one had ever told him of anyone being bitten by such a tick in the Pine Mountain area. He declared he had \u201cnot received through any medium any indication that the Western black-legged tick was a carrier of Lyme disease in California or that said ticks were prevalent in the Pine Mountain area.\u201d Respondent\u2019s wife submitted a virtually identical declaration. The local veterinarian, Dr. Diane Cosko, declared that \u201cprior to August 15, 1990, I was not informed that any tick in Kern County had tested positive for the Lyme disease bacteria.\u201d This is evidence showing that (1) respondent was personally unaware of any Lyme disease risk and (2) it was not generally known that there was any risk of Lyme disease in the Pine Mountain area. Faced with this showing, appellant could not avoid a summary judgment against her without presenting, at a minimum, some evidence tending to show respondent knew or reasonably should have known he was subjecting appellant to a risk of incurring Lyme disease when he permitted appellant to enter his house and/or permitted Pansy to sit on appellant\u2019s lap.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Appellant argues there is a triable issue of fact as to whether respondent\u2019s asserted ignorance of any danger of Lyme-disease-carrying ticks is truthful. She argues that the court should not have accepted respondent\u2019s assertions about his own state of mind. Although the court could have refused to accept respondent\u2019s assertion about respondent\u2019s own state of mind, it was not required to do so. Subdivision (e) of the summary judgment statute provides that \u201csummary judgment may be denied in the discretion of the court. . . where a material fact is an individual\u2019s state of mind, or lack thereof, and that fact is sought to be established solely by the individual\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>affirmation thereof.\u201d The court therefore did not err in refusing to deny the motion on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Appellant similarly contends the court should not have believed Dr. Cosko\u2019s declaration that she was unaware of the presence of Lyme-disease-carrying ticks in Kern County prior to August 15,1990. This contention fails for the same reason. Under subdivision (e) the trial judge had no obligation to refuse to believe Dr. Cosko.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Appellant then contends there is a triable issue of fact as to whether the presence of Lyme-disease-carrying ticks in the Pine Mountain area was generally known on August 4,1990, because appellant\u2019s attorney, Janis, saw the above described \u201cFacts About Lyme Disease in California\u201d leaflet in \u201clate 1990\u201d in the \u201cCity of Los Angeles Department of Animal Regulation in Northridge, California.\u201d But knowledge of persons in the City and County of Los Angeles in late 1990 is not in issue in this case. In issue is whether there was any general knowledge of the presence of Lyme-disease-carrying ticks in the Pine Mountain area of Kern County on or before August 4,1990, and, if not, whether respondent himself nevertheless had any such knowledge. Even construing the Janis declaration liberally, it does not tell us anything about information available in the pertinent place at the pertinent time. Appellant presented no evidence that this leaflet was distributed to anyone in the Pine Mountain area, or indeed anywhere in Kern County, at any time prior to August 4, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Appellant further argues that even if respondent, as a property owner, had no duty to warn appellant about or protect appellant from Lyme-disease-carrying ticks, he nevertheless had this duty because he was a dog owner. We are not persuaded. Appellant points out that a dog owner has a duty to exercise reasonable care in the management of the dog. (See <em>Drake </em>v. <em>Dean </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 915 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 325]; and Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 518.) We do not question this proposition. But the issue here is whether that duty extends so far as to include warning a house guest not to allow a dog on her lap, or to require the taking of other steps to prevent the possible transmission of a Lyme-disease-carrying tick from the dog to the guest, if the owner does not have, and could not reasonably be expected to have, any knowledge that his dog posed any such danger to the guest. Appellant calls our attention to cases involving dog attacks and \u201cspooked\u201d horses. We do not find these to be apposite because it is generally known dogs sometimes bite people and that horses, when frightened, will sometimes behave in a manner that may injure people nearby. Every dog who bites people has to have a first victim. Thus, the fact that the first victim of a particular dog cannot demonstrate the dog had previously bitten someone else does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>necessarily mean the owner of the dog was unaware of the possibility the dog might one day bite someone. The Legislature undoubtedly had this in mind when it enacted Civil Code section 3342, providing that \u201c[t]he owner of any dog is liable for the damages suffered by any person who is bitten by the dog while in a public place or lawfully in a private place . . . regardless of the former viciousness of the dog or the owner\u2019s knowledge of such viciousness.\u201d If there was some evidence tending to show that a reasonably prudent dog owner in the Pine Mountain area would have been aware, prior to August 4, 1990, of a reasonable possibility that there were Lyme-disease-carrying ticks in the area, appellant should have presented that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">II.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\n<em>Continuance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The judgment is affirmed.

We do confess to be somewhat baffled by respondent\u2019s \u201cmaterial fact\u201d No. 3.

In <em>Ann M., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 666, the landowner was presumably aware that crime sometimes occurs in San Diego.
