Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">Appellant Robin Re Sharp timely appeals from his conviction after a jury trial of seven felony counts of forcible lewd and lascivious conduct with a child under the age of fourteen years (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (b) [counts 3, and 5, relating to Joann G.; counts 20, 22, 24 and 26, relating to Tammy G.; count 44, relating to Vanessa P.]),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> one felony count of forcible penetration with a foreign object (\u00a7 289, subd. (a) [count 4, relating to Joann G.]), three felony counts of nonforcible lewd and lascivious conduct with a child under the age of fourteen years (\u00a7 288, subd. (a) [counts 6 and 7, relating to Joann G.; count 43, relating to Vanessa P.]), two felony counts of rape (\u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2) [counts 11 and 13, relating to Tammy G.]), three felony counts of forcible oral copulation with a person under the age of fourteen years (\u00a7 288a, subd. (c) [counts 19, 21 and 23, relating to Tammy G.]), and one misdemeanor count of battery (\u00a7 242 [count 9, relating to Joann G.]). Appellant was also convicted, based on a plea of no contest, to five counts of receiving stolen property (\u00a7 496.1 [counts 33, 40, 42, 51 and 52]), eleven counts of residential burglary (\u00a7 459 [counts 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1777\">*1777</page-number>41, 47 and 48], one felony count of forcible lewd and lascivious conduct with a child under the age of fourteen years (\u00a7 288, subd. (b) [count 49, relating to Rebecca F.]), and one felony count of attempted kidnapping (\u00a7\u00a7 207, subd. (a), 664 [count 50, relating to Rebecca F.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">After a bench trial, the court found true the allegation of a prior conviction of a serious felony, first degree rape of a 12-year-old girl in the state of Washington. (\u00a7 667, subd. (a).) The trial court sentenced appellant to a total of 129 years in state prison for the foregoing offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Appellant\u2019s primary contention on appeal (and the sole issue presented in his petition for writ of habeas corpus) is that he was deprived of his constitutional right to face-to-face confrontation with his accuser when the prosecutor positioned herself in the courtroom so that one of the young victim witnesses, Tammy G., did not have to look at him while testifying about his acts of sexual molestation. Appellant also contends that the trial court erred in denying his request for a new attorney to investigate a possible new trial motion based on incompetence of trial counsel. In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that the procedure used by the prosecutor to question Tammy did not violate appellant\u2019s confrontation clause rights, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting his posttrial claim of ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Appellant also claims that the trial court erred by admitting certain hearsay and similar act evidence, and by failing to inquire about an incident in which two jurors were reported to have cried after hearing the victim witnesses\u2019 testimony. Finally, appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions on several of the sex offenses, and that the trial court erred in its computation of his sentence. We address all but one of these claims in the unpublished portion of the opinion. As to appellant\u2019s claim that there was insufficient evidence of a \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d to support the conviction on count 6, we conclude in a published portion of the opinion that even a seemingly innocent act, such as stroking a child\u2019s hair or rubbing her back, can be found to be \u201clewd or lascivious\u201d when viewed in the totality of the circumstances in which it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">Finding no reversible error, we affirm the judgment of conviction in its entirety and deny the petition for writ of habeas corpus. However, we remand for resentencing to correct an error which, respondent concedes, was committed by the trial court in the determination of appellant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">II. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">Appellant\u2019s claims of error all relate to his convictions, entered upon the jury\u2019s verdict, of sex offenses against three young girls. Joann G. was nine or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1778\">*1778</page-number>ten years old when she lived on Heidi Place in Santa Rosa, where appellant was her neighbor from 1989 to 1992. Joann testified to four incidents of lewd and lascivious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">In the first incident, charged in counts 6 and 7, Joann and a friend were washing appellant\u2019s truck when appellant told her he wanted to show her something in the backyard. Joann followed him, waited at the fence and, while she was there, appellant \u201cdangled\u201d her hair<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and massaged her back. Appellant also reached down and around under her shirt and pinched her breast. Appellant told her, \u201c[I]t\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t have to do nothing, just don\u2019t tell your mom or nothing.\u201d Joann said this made her afraid. Joann then returned to the truck. Appellant tried to touch her breast again, but she put her hand down to block him.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">On another occasion, charged in count 3, appellant rubbed Joann\u2019s genital area hard enough so that it hurt. When Joann returned home, she started to bleed when she went to the bathroom. On yet another occasion, charged in count 4, appellant used his hand to pull down her shorts and panties and then put something \u201creally greasy up [her] butt.\u201d She did not know what it was and did not turn around to look because she was afraid. She said her rectum hurt that day and the next day. Trudy Crough, a physician\u2019s assistant and the pediatric sexual abuse coordinator at the county hospital, examined Joann in February 1992 and found a tear in her anus in a position consistent with penetration while she was standing. Crough found no signs of trauma to Joann\u2019s vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">In the fourth incident, charged in counts 5 and 9, Joann saw appellant walking on the street looking disheveled, with his penis exposed. Appellant told her to approach him and then accused her of telling her mother about his prior conduct. He also made her touch his penis by holding her hand to it and, when she did, he slapped her. She then fell down and appellant tried to kick her. Earlier, appellant had told her he would kill or hurt her or her family if she told anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Appellant also sexually assaulted Joann\u2019s younger sister, Tammy G., who was eight years old at the time of the incidents alleged in this case. Tammy initially testified that appellant never touched her, but that she was afraid of him. At that point, the prosecutor asked for a recess. After the break, the prosecutor moved to a position in the courtroom so Tammy would not have to look at appellant while testifying. Tammy then testified that appellant took her into his bedroom twice and touched her in the vaginal and anal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1779\">*1779</page-number>areas. She also said that, on one occasion, he took her clothes and his clothes off and lay on top of her but did not penetrate her. At that point, Tammy told the court she was tired and her testimony was continued to the next court day.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">When Tammy took the stand again two days later, she testified that appellant penetrated her vagina twice with his penis. On either that or another occasion, appellant penetrated her rectum with his hand. She further testified that he touched her rectum with his penis three or four times when she was in his bedroom, and put his mouth on her vagina three times. Appellant told her not to tell anyone or he would kill her mom.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Trudy Crough also examined Tammy in February 1992 and found a tear in her hymen that she believed was caused by penetration. There was also, however, undisputed evidence that Tammy had been molested by a friend\u2019s father between July 1990 and February 1992. During the examination by Crough, Tammy said that appellant molested her by, among other things, anal-penile and anal-finger contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">The jury also heard testimony from Carol Brandt, a special education teacher for the Santa Rosa School District who works with children with learning disabilities. Brandt described her work with both Tammy and Joann. As to Tammy, Brandt said she had disabilities in auditory memory, auditory perception, and language development. In her opinion, Tammy was able to remember events but sometimes had difficulty explaining them. When asked if Tammy was truthful, Brandt said, \u201cI think so.\u201d In 1989, Brandt also worked with Joann who, at the time, had an auditory attention deficiency and difficulty in focusing. According to Brandt, Joann\u2019s memory seemed fine and she appeared to be truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">Appellant molested a third neighborhood girl, Vanessa P., when she was eight or nine years old. Vanessa testified that appellant would occasionally pay her to wash his truck. One time, while Vanessa was washing the truck, appellant touched her breast. She tried to get away from appellant by moving to the other side of the truck, but he went around and tickled her on the breast again. Appellant said he was not going to hurt her. Vanessa further testified to another occasion on which appellant picked her up after she fell off a swing and held her for \u201c[kjind of long\u201d and \u201c[a] little tight,\u201d touching her knee with his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">Appellant did not take the stand in his own defense. In fact, the only defense witness to testify was Dr. Kevin Coulter, a pediatrician, who reviewed the slides of the anal and vaginal areas of Joann and Tammy G. taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1780\">*1780</page-number>in February 1992. Dr. Coulter testified that he did not find any abnormalities, but admitted that there have been studies showing that known penetrations do not necessarily lead to abnormal findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">The jury trial in this case began on July 27, 1992. On July 31, appellant pleaded no contest to counts 31 through 42, and 47 through 52 of the 52-count information, as described above. On September 3, the court granted appellant\u2019s motion for acquittal on eleven of the remaining counts. On September 4, the jury rendered its verdict. On the same date, the court dismissed five additional counts that were charged as alternatives or as lesser counts of crimes for which he was convicted. The court also dismissed one count of burglary \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d On September 10, the court found true the allegation of a prior conviction of a serious felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">On October 29, appellant moved through counsel to withdraw his no contest pleas. On November 2, he also moved for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. Both appellant and his trial counsel filed briefs in support of the new trial motion. On November 12, the court denied both motions. Thereafter, appellant moved in pro per seeking appointment of substitute counsel because of alleged ineffective assistance of his trial attorney. After a hearing in chambers with appellant and his trial counsel, the court denied this motion on November 30. Appellant was sentenced on December 1, 1992. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">A. <em>The Prosecutor\u2019s Questioning of One of the Young Victim Witnesses, With the Child Looking Away From the Defense Table, Did Not Deprive Appellant of His Right to Face-to-face Confrontation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Appellant\u2019s first contention is that he was deprived of his right to face-to-face confrontation with his accuser (U.S. Const., Amend. VI; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15) when the prosecutor sat or stood next to the witness stand so Tammy could look away from the defense table while she was testifying. Tammy was the victim in nine of the seventeen counts of which appellant was convicted by the jury, and much of the testimony given in this unorthodox fashion was central to the prosecution\u2019s case on the counts involving Tammy.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">Appellant relies primarily on <em>Herbert </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 661 [172 Cal.Rptr. 850, 19 A.L.R.4th 1276] <em>(Herbert), </em>a prosecution for oral copulation and lewd acts upon a child, in which the defendant claimed his confrontation rights were violated by an arrangement by which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1781\">*1781</page-number>the young victim witness was seated so the defendant could hear but not see her as she testified at the preliminary examination. Apparently, the magistrate in that case sat in the jury box facing the child, who was seated in the witness chair, but the defendant was seated across the courtroom from the magistrate such that his view of the witness stand was obstructed by the bench. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 664-665, fn. 1.) The magistrate had ordered this unusual arrangement after finding that the child was reluctant or unable to testify because she \u201c \u2018was disturbed by the number of people in the courtroom and in particular with the presence of the defendant. . <em>{Id. </em>at p. 664.)</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">The Third District held that the arrangement violated the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights: \u201cBy allowing the child to testify against defendant without having to look at him or be looked at by him, the trial court not only denied defendant the right of confrontation but also foreclosed an effective method for determining veracity.\u201d <em>{Herbert, supra, </em>117 Cal.App.3d at p. 668.) As the court explained, \u201cThe historical concept of the right of confrontation has included the right to see one\u2019s accusers face-to-face, thereby giving the fact-finder the opportunity of weighing the demeanor of the accused when forced to make his or her accusation before the one person who knows if the witness is truthful.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 671.)</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\"><em>Herbert </em>is distinguishable from the instant case. In that case, the courtroom was arranged so it was physically impossible for the defendant and witness to see one another during the child\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (117 Cal.App.3d at pp. 664-665, fn. 1.) Here, by contrast, appellant was able to watch Tammy as she gave sworn testimony, limited only in his view of a portion of her face. Evidence presented in connection with appellant\u2019s habeas petition indicates that appellant was able to see the side and back of Tammy\u2019s head during the prosecutor\u2019s examination. Thus, even if he could not clearly see all of her facial expressions, appellant could observe the witness\u2019s general demeanor and reactions to the questioning. Tammy, on the other hand, was able but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1782\">*1782</page-number>chose not to look at appellant. The relevant fact finder\u2014the jury\u2014was able to view both the defendant and Tammy, and their reactions to one another and the questioning, during the child\u2019s testimony. We find nothing improper about this procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Indeed, the situation in this case is not materially different from one in which a witness might stare at the floor, or turn her head away from the defendant while testifying. In such a case, \u201c[t]he Confrontation Clause does not, of course, compel the witness to fix his eyes upon the defendant; [the witness] may studiously look elsewhere.\u201d <em>(Coy </em>v. <em>Iowa, supra, </em>487 U.S. at p. 1019 [101 L.Ed.2d at p. 866].) The mere fact that the prosecutor facilitated Tammy\u2019s decision to look away from appellant does not transform this innocuous act into a violation of the confrontation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">A contrary holding would border on the absurd. Surely, appellant cannot be claiming a constitutional right to stare down or otherwise subtly intimidate a young child who would dare to testify against him. Nor can he claim a right to a particular seating arrangement in the courtroom. A witness who avoids the gaze of the defendant may be exhibiting fear, embarrassment, shyness, nervousness, indifference, mendacity, evasiveness, or a variety of other emotional states or character traits, some or all of which might bear on the witness\u2019s credibility.  It is, however, the function of the jury to assess such demeanor evidence and \u201cdraw its own conclusions\u201d about the credibility of the witness and her testimony. <em>(Coy </em>v. <em>Iowa, supra, </em>487 U.S. at p. 1019 [101 L.Ed.2d at p. 866].) There was no interference with the jury\u2019s ability to perform that function in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Although we decline to follow <em>Herbert </em>on the ground that it is distinguishable, we also have serious doubts about the precedential value of that case. <em>Herbert </em>appears to hold that a criminal defendant has an absolute right\u2014under the confrontation clause of both the federal and state Constitutions (U.S. Const., Amend. VI; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15)\u2014to see and be seen by his accusers during any testimony, regardless of the age of the witness, the type of crimes charged, and the potential for further psychological trauma to the particular child from having to testify under the hostile glare of the defendant. <em>Herbert </em>has been criticized by the California Supreme Court because of its assumption that the state and federal Constitutions require such a result in a preliminary hearing. <em>(Whitman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1063, 1077 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 160, 820 P.2d 262].) The holding of <em>Herbert </em>has also been limited by statutes which were enacted by the California Legislature to provide special protection to young children who are called to testify as victims of sexual molestation. (\u00a7 1346 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">Since <em>Herbert </em>was decided, moreover, the United States Supreme Court has held that a trial court may employ procedures allowing something <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1783\">*1783</page-number>less than literal face-to-face confrontation between an adult defendant and his or her child victims in a sexual molestation prosecution. <em>(Maryland </em>v. <em>Craig, supra, </em>497 U.S. at pp. 849-850 [111 L.Ed.2d at pp. 680-681].) Such procedures will pass constitutional muster if: (1) they are necessary in a given case to protect a child witness from emotional trauma that would be caused by testifying in front of the defendant, at least where such trauma would impair the child\u2019s ability to communicate; and (2) the reliability of the testimony is otherwise assured by rigorous adversarial testing. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 850, 857 [111 L.Ed.2d at pp. 681, 686].)</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Under the two-part test established by <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Craig, supra, </em>we conclude that the procedure approved by the trial court in this case did not violate appellant\u2019s confrontation clause rights. We first note that the arrangement of the courtroom during Tammy\u2019s testimony resulted in only the most minimal interference with appellant\u2019s right to confront his accuser. Tammy and the other accusing witnesses physically appeared in open court to give live testimony against appellant before judge and jury. They testified under oath and were subject to contemporaneous cross-examination. No physical barrier or screen was erected between appellant and the witnesses as they testified. No technological devices were employed to insulate the witnesses from the accused. (Cf. 497 U.S. at pp. 849-850 [111 L.Ed.2d at pp. 680-681].) Indeed, the only limitation on appellant\u2019s right to confront Tammy was that he did not have a full, frontal view of her face.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Balanced against appellant\u2019s interest in having a literal face-to-face meeting with Tammy were the important interests of the state in obtaining a complete and accurate account of the interactions between appellant and Tammy, and in protecting Tammy from unnecessary emotional trauma. <em>(Maryland </em>v. <em>Craig, supra, </em>497 U.S. at pp. 845-846, 852-853 [111 L.Ed.2d at pp. 678-679, 682-683].) Although the trial court did not make explicit findings, it is apparent from the record of her testimony that Tammy was experiencing considerable distress and suffering inexplicable memory lapses about sex acts she had theretofore consistently reported.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It also appears that Tammy was having difficulty focusing, as the prosecutor repeatedly had to ask her to \u201c[l]ook at me [the prosecutor]\u201d while she was testifying.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She was, in short, unable to participate effectively in the proceedings when seated in the conventional position in the witness box, facing appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1784\">*1784</page-number>When the prosecutor began her direct examination on the morning of August 11, Tammy initially testified that appellant never touched her anywhere. Tammy then gave a series of flatly contradictory answers to the prosecutor\u2019s questions. For example, she answered \u201cYeah,\u201d when the prosecutor asked, \u201cDid anything happen when you were in Robin\u2019s house?\u201d Immediately thereafter, however, she answered \u201cNo,\u201d when the prosecutor asked if Robin said or did anything to her when she was in his house. Obviously concerned that Tammy was becoming aphonic, the prosecutor asked Tammy if she was scared. At first, Tammy would only nod her head but, eventually, she testified that she was scared of appellant \u201cin particular.\u201d Tammy then testified she told a detective that appellant asked her if she wanted to play a game. Tammy answered \u201cYeah\u201d when the prosecutor asked if she remembered what happened next. But when the prosecutor asked if she could tell the jury what happened, she said, \u201cI forgot.\u201d The balance of Tammy\u2019s testimony on the morning of August 11 is riddled with inconsistency, forgetfulness, evasiveness, and confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">After a two-hour recess, the prosecutor obtained the court\u2019s permission to continue her examination of Tammy from a chair to the right of the witness stand, so the child would not have to look at appellant. At that time, the prosecutor argued that \u201cI think that it was clear to all present that when Tammy was testifying earlier today she was scared and was unable to participate.\u201d The prosecutor conducted the rest of her examination of Tammy with the child facing away from the defense table. It was during her testimony on the afternoon of August 11, and on the following court day, that Tammy described the numerous sex acts for which appellant was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">After a careful review of the record, we are persuaded that the minor interference with appellant\u2019s right to face-to-face confrontation was fully justified in the circumstances of this case. Allowing Tammy to look away from the defense table while giving live, in-court testimony, maximized appellant\u2019s opportunity to have a face-to-face meeting with a key prosecution witness, while minimizing the resulting emotional trauma to the young witness. It also afforded the jury an opportunity to hear and see a full account of Tammy\u2019s claims, ranging from complete denial to detailed descriptions of multiple acts of sexual molestation. The jury was as free to decide that Tammy was being truthful when she said appellant never touched her, as it was to accept her graphic testimony about acts of sexual intercourse, oral copulation, penetration with a foreign object, and sodomy. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1785\">*1785</page-number>was no error in the trial court\u2019s decision to authorize this procedure, which clearly \u201cpreserve[d] the essence of effective confrontation.\u201d <em>(Maryland </em>v. <em>Craig, supra, </em>497 U.S. at p. 857 [111 L.Ed.2d at p. 686].)</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Two recent cases from other jurisdictions are in accord with our conclusion. <em>(Brandon </em>v. <em>State </em>(Alaska App. 1992) 839 P.2d 400; <em>Stanger </em>v. <em>State </em>(Ind.Ct.App. 1989) 545 N.E.2d 1105.) In <em>Stanger, </em>the court considered whether placement of a witness chair at a slight angle toward the jury and away from the accused during the testimony of the child witnesses violated the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights. (545 N.E.2d at p. 1112.) The procedure utilized did not prevent the defendant from hearing or seeing the child witnesses. It did not prevent the witnesses from being heard or seen by the judge or jury. Nor did it prevent the witnesses from hearing or seeing the defendant. The defendant\u2019s only objection was that the witnesses were not facing directly at him. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Indiana Court of Appeals held that the arrangement did not violate the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation, as guaranteed by either the federal or state constitution: \u201cWhere, as here, the method of eliciting testimony permits jury, witness, and defendant all to see and hear each other and possesses the added virtue of actually facilitating the truthfinding function at the trial, positioning the witness away from the defendant is but a reasonable limitation on the defendant\u2019s interest in physical confrontation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1113, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\"><em>Brandon </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>involved a defendant accused of beating his wife nearly to death while his three-year-old son watched. (839 P.2d at p. 402.) The defendant in that case claimed he was deprived of his confrontation clause rights when the trial court arranged for the son to testify from a small chair and table, rather than from the witness stand. This arrangement placed the boy\u2019s chair perpendicular to his father, in a position from which he could probably see his father out of the comer of his eye. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 409.) Evidence presented by the prosecutor indicated that the boy was \u201c \u2018particularly afraid of testifying against his father, knowing his father will be here in the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Alaska Court of Appeals held that the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation was not infringed. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 410.) The court based its holding on the facts that the child\u2019s position relative to his father was \u201c \u2018not really different from where their positions would be if he were in the regular witness chair,\u2019 \u201d and that the trial judge did not require defense counsel to question the child from any particular part of the courtroom. Thus, if defense counsel had questioned the child from the podium or the normal defense counsel\u2019s chair, the child would have had to face the defendant in order to respond directly to counsel. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">As did the courts in the foregoing cases, we recognize that trial courts are regularly called upon to make tough decisions about how to afford criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1786\">*1786</page-number>defendants the full measure of procedural protections to which they are entitled under the confrontation clause, without unduly traumatizing victim witnesses whose contributions to the truth-seeking process are so vital. When the victim witness is a young child, the risks of damage to both the witness and the truth-seeking function can be especially great. (See <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Craig, supra, </em>497 U.S. at p. 857 [111 L.Ed.2d at p. 686]; and see generally, Cecchettini-Whaley, <em>Children as Witnesses After Maryland </em>v. <em>Craig </em>(1992) 65 So.Cal.L.Rev. 1993, 2005-2018.) The special procedure approved by the trial court in this case minimized those risks, while maximizing appellant\u2019s opportunity for a face-to-face meeting with his principal accuser. This procedure did not violate the confrontation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">B., C <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">D. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Denying Appointment of Substitute Counsel for the Purpose of Investigating a Claim of Incompetence of Trial Counsel and a Second New Trial Motion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Appellant next contends that the trial court failed to adequately inquire into his posttrial claim that his counsel was incompetent, and his concomitant request for substitute counsel. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Marsden </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 118 [84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 388 [217 Cal.Rptr. 306].) We conclude that the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s <em>Marsden!Stewart </em>motion was adequately informed, and well within its discretion in that appellant did not there\u2014and does not here\u2014make a proper showing of ineffective assistance by his appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">The decision whether to permit a defendant to discharge his appointed counsel and substitute another attorney is a matter entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marsden, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 123.) \u201cWhen a defendant moves for substitution of appointed counsel, the court must consider any specific examples of counsel\u2019s inadequate representation that the defendant wishes to enumerate. Thereafter, substitution is a matter of judicial discretion. Denial of the motion is not an abuse of discretion unless the defendant has shown that a failure to replace the appointed attorney would \u2018substantially impair\u2019 the defendant\u2019s right to assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Webster </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 411, 435 [285 Cal.Rptr. 31, 814 P.2d 1273]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Marsden, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at pp. 123-125 [trial court must give defendant an opportunity to explain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1787\">*1787</page-number>reasons for desiring new counsel].) \u201c[T]he inquiry is forward-looking in the sense that counsel would be substituted in order to provide effective assistance in the <em>future. </em>But the decision must always be based on what has happened in the <em>past.\u201d {People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 684, 695 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 122, 863 P.2d 192], italics in original.) \u201cIf the claim is based upon acts or omissions that occurred at trial or the effect of which may be evaluated by what occurred at trial the court may rule on the motion for new trial without substituting new counsel.\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Stewart, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.3d at pp. 396-397.) The same standard of proof applies to a motion for substitute counsel made in the trial court whether it is made before or after conviction. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 696.)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Appellant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance was presented to the trial court in a <em>Marsden </em>motion filed by appellant in propria persona, literally on the eve of sentencing. In that motion, appellant argued that his court-appointed attorney, Barry Collins, had failed to investigate and subpoena a favorable defense witness\u2014Vanessa\u2019s grandmother, Beatrice Helmick\u2014and to prepare a motion to suppress evidence obtained through illegal searches of his home and vehicles. Evidence obtained in those searches included a box containing numerous photographs and negatives that had been shot surreptitiously or stolen from the homes of young girls in the Santa Rosa area, distinctive articles of clothing that, had been described by victims as having been worn by a burglar who had been prowling the same area, and a handwritten note containing Tammy\u2019s phone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">In response to appellant\u2019s <em>Marsden </em>motion, the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing at which appellant was afforded a full and fair opportunity to air his grievances against his trial counsel. Mr. Collins also testified briefly, informing the court that he had been aware of and considered each of the questions raised by appellant. Mr. Collins also said he believed he had at all times acted in appellant\u2019s best interests but declined to comment further, saying that he did not want to do anything that might affect appellant\u2019s appeal. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court denied the motion, stating that the matters raised therein had already been considered and rejected by the court, or should be raised on appeal. The court also commented that Mr. Collins had \u201cdone an admirable job,\u201d and noted that the relationship between appellant and Mr. Collins was still functional: \u201cThis is not a situation where there\u2019s been a breakdown in communication or such a strain between you that you could no longer effectively operate as a defense team.\u201d The court further noted\u2014and appellant agreed\u2014that Mr. Collins was in a better position to represent appellant at sentencing than would be any newly appointed attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">The court\u2019s inquiry into appellant\u2019s <em>Marsden </em>motion was adequate. It considered the specific examples of counsel\u2019s inadequate representation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1788\">*1788</page-number>appellant enumerated, all of which were based upon acts or omissions which occurred at trial or the effect of which could be evaluated by what occurred at trial. Thus, the trial court was fully justified in ruling on the motion for new trial without substituting new counsel. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Webster, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at pp. 435-436; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stewart, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.3d at pp. 396-397.)</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">As to Ms. Helmick, the trial court was fully apprised of the fact that she had been available to testify for the defense at trial but had not been called. This information was presented to the court both in the opposition to appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial and in the <em>Marsden </em>proceeding. In addition, the court had before it an offer of proof as to what she would say if called as a witness. There was no error in the trial court\u2019s finding that her testimony had only minimal probative value and would not have made any difference in the outcome of the trial. Indeed, even if fully credited, Ms. Helmick\u2019s proposed testimony\u2014that she did not see appellant molest her granddaughter or any other young girl\u2014would have added almost nothing to the defense case. Several other neighbors had already testified that they were in a position to, but never did, see appellant sexually molest the girls who spent time at his house. Reasonable defense counsel could also conclude that calling Ms. Helmick to, in essence, accuse her own granddaughter of lying about appellant\u2019s acts of molestation would be more harmful than helpful to his client\u2019s cause. We see no reason to disturb the trial court\u2019s findings with respect to this claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">The trial court was also fully apprised of the circumstances of each of the searches that yielded evidence against appellant, having before it sworn testimony about them during the preliminary hearing. The court was also familiar with the applicable case law. There is no dispute that appellant was at all relevant times a parolee, subject to warrantless searches.  Such searches are lawful if based on a reasonable suspicion that the parolee is involved in criminal activity or otherwise violating the terms of his parole. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 576, 594 [253 Cal.Rptr. 710, 764 P.2d 1087]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Burgener, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at pp. 533-536.)  There was not and, we think, cannot be any serious question but that the searches were conducted upon reasonable suspicion. Further, although appellant correctly notes that parolees retain the right to object to searches conducted in an unreasonable manner (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Bravo </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 600, 607 [238 Cal.Rptr. 282, 738 P.2d 336]), or undertaken for purposes of harassment <em>{People </em>v. <em>Clower </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1737, 1741-1742 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 38]), the record of this case is utterly devoid of any indication that the searches of appellant\u2019s residence, car, and work vehicle were improper in either motive or manner of execution. No other plausible basis for challenging the searches appears in the record, or in appellant\u2019s briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1789\">*1789</page-number>It is true that, as a \u201clayman totally unschooled in the law,\u201d appellant could not be expected to conduct an investigation and determine whether a motion to suppress the seized items would have been meritorious. It is also true, however, that appellant was not left entirely to his own devices to deal with this issue. As we have discussed, the trial court was familiar with the case law governing parole searches and the circumstances of the searches conducted in this case. Appellant has also had the benefit of an independent review of this matter by his court-appointed appellate/habeas counsel. That review has yielded no new facts or case authority to warrant further inquiry into the competence of trial counsel in his handling of the search and seizure question. It would be pointless to remand to the trial court for further proceedings on this issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">E., F.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">G. <em>There Was Sufficient Evidence to Support the Convictions on All the Sex Offenses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">Appellant next contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the convictions on several of the sex offenses in this case. We will discuss each of his contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">1. <em>Count 6.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">First, he argues that there was no \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d proven as the predicate for count 6. (\u00a7 288, subd. (a).) As framed for the jury by the prosecutor during closing argument, that count consisted of appellant\u2019s conduct in \u201cdangling\u201d Joann\u2019s hair while she was standing by his fence\u2014 after having been lured there by appellant on the pretense that he wanted to show her something in the backyard\u2014followed by the rubbing of her back. At that time, appellant told her, \u201c[Ijt\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t have to do nothing, just don\u2019t tell your mom or nothing.\u201d The prosecutor argued that, while the particular acts charged in count 6 \u201cmay seem somewhat innocent,\" it could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1790\">*1790</page-number>be inferred from the circumstances that the acts were \u201clewd and lascivious\u201d and that appellant had the specific intent to arouse himself or Joann. Among the circumstances the prosecutor asked the jury to consider were appellant\u2019s other, more obviously sexual contacts with Joann, as well as with Tammy and Vanessa.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">The issue here is whether appellant\u2019s conduct in \u201cdangling\u201d Joann\u2019s hair and rubbing her back can constitute a \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d within the meaning of section 288.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant argues as a matter of law that it cannot, citing a line of cases which hold that an \u201cinnocuous or innocent touching,\u201d even one performed with the requisite intent, is insufficient to constitute a violation of section 288. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wallace </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 568, 571 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 67]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Webb </em>(1958) 158 Cal.App.2d 537, 542 [323 P.2d 141]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Gaglione </em>(1994) 26 Cal.4th 1291, 1297-1298 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 169]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Filson </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1841, 1852 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 335]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Self (1993) 12 </em>Cal.App.4th 1222, 1226-1227 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 67].) Under this line of cases, \u201c[a] lewd or lascivious act is defined as any touching of the body of a child which to an <em>objectively reasonable person </em>is sexually indecent or tends to arouse sexual desire. [Citation.] In sum, it is a sexual act.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. Wallace, <em>supra, 11 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 579, italics in original; and see <em>People </em>v. <em>Webb, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.2d at p. 542 [defining a lewd or lascivious act as \u201can act which is lustful, immoral, seductive or degrading\u201d].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the <em>Wallace </em>court explained, \u201c[A] mere intention of the accused to commit a crime or his belief that he is committing a crime, does not give rise to criminal liability. Apart from the mens rea, there must be some act or conduct in violation of law which itself is socially harmful.\u201d (11 Cal.App.4th at pp. 579-580.)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Respondent urges us to follow another line of cases which hold that <em>any touching </em>done with the requisite intent can be a \u201clewd or lascivious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1791\">*1791</page-number>act\u201d within the meaning of section 288. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marquez </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1325-1326 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 821]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1372, 1380 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 660] [rubbing stomach, back and thigh sufficient to constitute lewd or lascivious act when done with requisite intent as established by course-of-conduct evidence]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dontanville, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.3d at pp. 795-796 [rubbing victim\u2019s stomach, with requisite intent, can be a lewd or lascivious act]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hobbs </em>(1952) 109 Cal.App.2d 189, 190-192 [240 P.2d 411] [kissing and rubbing the leg of a 12-year-old girl under her skirt was lewd or lascivious act within the meaning of section 288]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Austin, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d at p. 113; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pitts, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d at pp. 887-889.) As the <em>Hobbs </em>court explained, \u201cSection 288 of the Penal Code was enacted to protect children from the lustful advances and tamperings of callous and unscrupulous persons as well as from the assaults of depraved unfortunates. In all cases arising under this statute the purpose of the perpetrator in touching the child is the controlling factor and each case is to be examined in the light of the intent with which the act was done. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Owen </em>[(1945)] 68 Cal.App.2d 617, 620. . . , it is said that \u2018It is not the accomplishment but the intent of the party that is the basis of the commission of the acts condemned in Penal Code section 288.\u2019 If intent of the act, although it may have the outward appearance of innocence, is to arouse, or appeal to, or gratify the lust, the passion or the sexual desire of the <em>perpetrator </em>it stands condemned by the statute, or, if it is intended to arouse feelings of passion or sexual desire in the <em>child, </em>it likewise stands condemned. The intent with which the act is done is manifested by the circumstances under which it was committed. (\u00a7 21.) As is said in <em>People </em>v. <em>Owen, supra, </em>each case involving a lustful advance upon a child \u2018must be decided by the evidence introduced and is not necessarily controlled by a previous decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hobbs, supra, </em>109 Cal.App.2d at p. 192, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">We find the circumstances of this case to be sufficient under either of these two lines of authority. The instant case presents a good example of seemingly \u201cinnocent\u201d acts\u2014stroking a child\u2019s hair and rubbing her back\u2014 that take on a markedly sexual cast when viewed in context. There was ample evidence from which an objectively reasonable person could conclude that these acts, committed after appellant lured Joann to a secluded spot on a pretense and reassured her of her safety but instructed her \u201cnot to tell,\u201d were \u201csexual\u201d in nature even under the definition stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wallace, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at page 579. This is perforce true given the evidence of other acts of a similar nature committed by appellant on the other young female victims in this case. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1380-1381.) In addition, the jury could readily find that appellant\u2019s conduct was not merely \u201cpreparatory\u201d to some \u201cultimate\u201d lewd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1792\">*1792</page-number>or lascivious act. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Webb, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.2d at p. 542.) Unlike the defendant in <em>People </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>who placed his arm around the shoulder of a young boy to lead him into a bungalow to molest him, appellant began to fondle Joann\u2019s hair and back after they arrived at the location he had selected for the molestation. Finally, only a very calloused individual would fail to recognize that, even if appellant had stopped\u2014or had been interrupted\u2014on that particular occasion after rubbing Joann\u2019s back, his conduct as charged in count 6 was itself \u201csocially harmful\u201d and \u201csexual\u201d in nature <em>when viewed in context. (People </em>v. <em>Wallace, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 580.) It is likely that, by that point, he had already inspired the fear Joann said she experienced and violated the social compact by which adults are expected to care for, protect, and nurture children, and not to manipulate them as objects to satisfy the adult\u2019s sexual urges. In the totality of the circumstances in which the alleged touchings occurred, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed a \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d within the meaning of section 288, subdivision (a), when he \u201cdangled\u201d Joann\u2019s hair and rubbed her back.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Although we apply the \u201cobjectively reasonable person\u201d test announced in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wallace, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at page 579, we do not thereby, endorse the requirement that a \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d must be a \u201csexual act.\u201d We note that concept has been incorporated in the Comment to revised CALJIC Instruction No. 10.41 (\u201cThe Wallace court require[s] that the act be <em>by itself </em>lewd.\u201d (Italics added.)). We do agree with <em>Wallace </em>that a \u201clewd or lascivious act,\u201d and the specific \u201cintent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires,\u201d are separate elements which must be proven\u2014and which must coincide (\u00a7 20)\u2014to establish a violation of section 288. (11 Cal.App.4th at pp. 578-579.) Furthermore, we share the concern that the <em>pTt-Wcdlace </em>CALJIC definition of a \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d can be read as conflating these two elements. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 581.) We are troubled, however, by the <em>Wallace </em>court\u2019s attempt to limit the reach of section 288 to only those touchings which an \u201cobjectively reasonable person\u201d would find to be \u201csexual\u201d in nature. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wallace, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at pp. 579-580.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Apparently, the <em>Wallace </em>court believed that there are some types of touchings which are inherently\u2014and incontestably\u2014 \u201cinnocuous or innocent\u201d and, thus, incapable of serving as the predicate for a section 288 violation. (11 Cal.App.4th at pp. 571, 578.) For example, the <em>Wallace </em>court strongly suggests that \u201cinnocuous\u201d acts such as \u201cbrushing a child\u2019s hair or touching a child\u2019s arm\u201d could never qualify as \u201clewd or lascivious acts,\u201d regardless of the surrounding circumstances and even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1793\">*1793</page-number>done with the requisite intent. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 575-576, 580.) Similarly, the <em>Wallace </em>court sharply criticizes dicta in <em>People </em>v. <em>Austin, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d at pages 113-114, which suggested that a violation of section 288 was complete when a knife-wielding defendant offered to pay a child to pull down her pants and then, when the child was indecisive, touched her in the course of pushing and guiding her to a secluded spot in an orange grove. (11 Cal.App.4th at pp. 575-577.) The <em>Wallace </em>court also implies that nothing \u201csexual\u201d or \u201csocially harmful\u201d was done to the 11-year-old victim in <em>People </em>v. <em>Webb, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.2d at page 542, by the time the defendant\u2014a janitor who befriended the child over the course of the summer while working at a public school adjacent to the boy\u2019s home\u2014lured the boy onto the school grounds on the pretense he had a job for him, told the boy\u2019s friend to remain outside the locked gates to the school, and placed his arm around the boy\u2019s shoulder as he led the child to a bungalow (where he subsequently forced the child to perform an act of oral copulation that formed the basis of a separate count under section 288a). (11 Cal.App.4th at pp. 576-577.)</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">We reject the <em>Wallace </em>court\u2019s narrow view of what constitutes a \u201csexual\u201d and \u201csocially harmful\u201d touching of a child. The 11-year-old victim in <em>People </em>v. <em>Webb, supra, </em>may well have been terrified when the defendant isolated him away from his friends and began to touch him by placing an arm around his shoulder. The same was undoubtedly true of the eight-year-old girl in <em>People </em>v. <em>Austin, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d at pages 112-114, as she was being shoved at knife point toward an isolated location for the purpose of completing the proposed molestation. Likewise, in this case, Joann testified that appellant\u2019s acts of touching at his back fence were alarming to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">The five-year-old girl in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gaglione, supra, </em>may not have been sophisticated enough to be afraid of the stranger who lured her into a utility closet in her apartment complex with a promise of payment, then initiated physical contact by asking her first to touch him on the shoulder, then on his genitals. (26 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1295, 1298.) Like the young victims in <em>Webb, Austin, </em>and the instant case, however, the girl\u2019s personal security and bodily privacy were clearly compromised as of the first touching. Nevertheless, if the child\u2019s babysitter had interrupted the defendant after this first contact, rather than seconds later as she did, <em>Wallace </em>would require dismissal of the section 288 charge. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gaglione, supra, 26 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1295.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">We think it beyond purview that social harm is done when an adult draws a child into his or her confidence, lures the child to an isolated location, acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1794\">*1794</page-number>surreptitiously, and commences touching the child in a manner that invades the child\u2019s bodily privacy and, at least in most instances, causes the child to be fearful.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As the foregoing discussion reveals, many such incidents\u2014at least at the outset\u2014involve acts that are not obviously \u201csexually indecent,\u201d and would not \u201ctend[] to arouse sexual desire\u201d in a normal, objectively reasonable person. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Wallace, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 579.) When committed in an isolated location and accompanied by secretive conduct, however, the sexual nature of even the most ostensibly \u201cinnocuous\u201d touching of a young child by an adult becomes apparent. Section 288 should not be read in such a restrictive fashion that there can be no criminal sanction until the defendant has accomplished a blatantly \u201csexual\u201d act, or in cases where the transaction is interrupted or the child escapes before the \u201ctouching\u201d has progressed to the point that the \u201csexual\u201d nature of the act is evident without reference to the context in which it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Accordingly, we hold that <em>any touching </em>of any part of the body of a child under the age of 14 can be \u201ca lewd or lascivious act\u201d within the meaning of section 288 <em>if, in the totality of the circumstances in which it occurred, </em>including any secretive or predatory conduct by the defendant, a reasonable person could conclude it was sexual in nature. We further conclude that the instructions given in this case (CALJIC Nos. 10.41, 3.31, 2.02 (5th ed. 1988)), coupled with the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the seemingly \u201cinnocent\u201d acts alleged in count 6 were \u201clewd and lascivious\u201d when viewed in the circumstances in which they occurred, were in substantial conformity with our holding and were sufficient to advise the jury of each of the elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1795\">*1795</page-number>which the prosecution must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, to establish a violation of section 288.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Of course, inadvertent or casual, nonoffensive touching, unaccompanied by other direct or circumstantial evidence of an intent to arouse, appeal to or gratify lust, passion, or sexual desire of the defendant or the child, will not qualify as a \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d for purposes of section 288. Distinguishing the former touchings from the latter is, however, ordinarily a question of fact for the jury to decide on the basis of the evidence presented in each case. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hobbs, supra, </em>109 Cal.App.2d at p. 192 [each case involving a lustful advance upon a child must be decided by the evidence introduced and is not necessarily controlled by a previous decision].) Trial judges must be especially sensitive and alert to this issue and, in appropriate cases, grant motions for a judgment of acquittal (\u00a7 1118.1) at the conclusion of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief to assure that an innocent touching is not made criminal. Additionally, in close cases, appropriate lesser offense instruction under sections 647.6 (misdemeanor child molesting)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and 664 (attempts) must be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">In this case, the jury must have found that appellant\u2019s touching of Joann\u2019s hair and back were sexual in nature. We will not disturb this finding, which is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">2.-4.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">H. <em>This Matter Must Be Remanded for </em>Resentencing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1796\">*1796</page-number>IV.

However, <em>Coy </em>was called into question just two years after it was decided when a different five-justice majority decided <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Craig </em>(1990) 497 U.S. 836 [111 L.Ed.2d 666, 110 S.Ct. 3157], and approved a statutory procedure\u2014televised testimony by an accusing witness who never had to appear in the courtroom\u2014that arguably interfered more severely with the defendant\u2019s right to face-to-face confrontation. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 849-850 [111 L.Ed.2d at pp. 680-681].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b929-7\"><em> Maryland, </em>v. <em>Craig, supra, </em>seems to require a trial court finding that a procedure affording less than literal face-to-face confrontation is necessary to protect the particular child witness.

(CALJIC No. 10.41 (5th ed. 1988).) This instruction states that \u201c[a] lewd or lascivious act is defined as <em>any touching </em>of the body of a person under the age of fourteen years with the specific intent to arouse, appeal to, or gratify the sexual desires of either party.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b936-7\"> Beginning with <em>People </em>v. <em>Wallace, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at page 579, this line of cases has raised doubts about the definition of a \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d contained in CALJIC No. 10.41 (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 7), the essence of which has been approved for use for nearly a quarter of a century. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Dontanville </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 783, 796 [89 Cal.Rptr. 172]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Austin </em>(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 110, 113 [168 Cal.Rptr. 401]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pitts </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 606, 887 [273 Cal.Rptr. 757].) In response, the Committee on Standard Jury Instructions adopted the alternative definition proposed in <em>Wallace </em>which, the committee suggests, may be used if the trial court so chooses. (Use Note to CALJIC No. 10.41 (1993 rev.) (5th ed. 1994 pocket pt.).) The instruction as revised provides that \u201cA lewd or lascivious act is defined as any touching of the body of a person under the age of fourteen years . . . which to an objectively reasonable person is sexually indecent or tends to arouse sexual desire.\u201d (CALJIC No. 10.41 (1993 rev.) (5th ed. 1994 pocket pt.), internal brackets omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b938-5\"> Plainly, the statute itself is not so limited. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marquez, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th 1315 at p. 1326.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b939-8\"> The defendant\u2019s criminal history included six prior convictions for oral copulation and kidnapping. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gaglione, supra, </em>26 Cal.App.4th atp. 1296, fn. 1.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b940-5\"> There are, of course, many possible variations on this scenario. The defendant\u2019s efforts to draw the child into his or her confidence may be extended (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Webb, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.2d at p. 539 [befriending the child over a period of months]), or quite brief (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Gaglione, supra, </em>26 Cal.App.4th at p. 1295 [offer by stranger to pay child for helping with a simple task]). If the child balks at attempts to lull her or him into a false sense of security, the molester may resort to the use of force to accomplish the sexual objective. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Austin, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d at pp. 112-114.) The surreptitious conduct may consist of exhortations by the defendant \u201cnot to tell,\u201d or efforts to avoid detection. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Webb, supra, </em>at p. 539 [separating a child from his or her companions]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gaglione, supra, </em>at p. 1295 [taking child into utility closet and closing the door].) The fact that the defendant is a stranger to the child or to the community may also be significant. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gaglione, supra, </em>at p. 1295 [stranger posing as a meter reader].) Further, a fearful reaction by the victim may be sufficient, but is not necessary, to indicate that social harm has been inflicted by the defendant. (See <em>ibid, </em>[child did not seem disturbed after being directed to touch, and touching, defendant\u2019s genital area].) Finally, it is well established that it is not necessary to show that either the child or the defendant was actually aroused by the interaction. (See <em>ibid, </em>[neither child nor defendant seemed flustered, surprised, or disturbed by transaction in which defendant directed child to touch his genital area]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McCurdy </em>(1923) 60 Cal.App. 499, 503 [213 P. 59].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b941-9\"> We do not quarrel with the alternative definition in CALJIC No. 10.41 (July 1994 rev.) that a lewd or lascivious act under section 288 is \u201cany touching . . . which to an objectively reasonable person is sexually indecent or tends to arouse sexual desire.\u201d (Internal brackets omitted.) That formulation does permit the jury to consider the totality of circumstances in assessing the lewd nature of the act.
