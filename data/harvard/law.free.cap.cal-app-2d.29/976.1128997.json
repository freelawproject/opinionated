J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGqA\">A jury convicted defendant of assault with a deadly weapon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)), grossly negligent discharge of a firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 246.3) and possession of a firearm by a convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>felon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12021, subd. (a)). The jury found defendant personally used a firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)), inflicted great bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.7) in committing the assault, suffered a serious felony conviction (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (a)) and served a prior prison term (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5). The court sentenced defendant to prison for 14 years and 8 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Defendant appeals, contending the trial court erred in refusing his request to represent himself. <em>(Faretta </em>v. <em>California </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 806 [45 L.Ed.2d 562, 95 S.Ct. 2525].) We agree and shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">During pretrial proceedings defendant, who was represented by the public defender, informed the court he wished to represent himself. After extensive questioning by the court into defendant\u2019s background and understanding of the potential consequences of self-representation, the court continued the case to the following afternoon to give defendant time to reconsider his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The following day, defense counsel expressed a concern whether defendant was competent to stand trial. The court expressed a doubt as to defendant\u2019s present mental competence, suspended criminal proceedings, appointed doctors to examine defendant psychiatrically and ordered a hearing. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1368, 1368.1 &amp; 1369.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The issue was submitted on the doctors\u2019 reports. The court considered the reports and found defendant competent to stand trial. The court then denied defendant\u2019s pending <em>Faretta </em>request.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court explained: \u201cI am going to make a determination that although competent to stand trial, you\u2019re not competent to make the decision to represent yourself or, in effect, represent yourself, [f] I\u2019m making specific reference to the finding that there is some level of delusions and grandeur <em>[sic] </em>you have with regard to this issue as referenced in the medical reports. And, also, to the occasional non sequitur responses to the questions. Not necessarily the question I asked you today, but the hearing we had earlier. []Q I don\u2019t believe you\u2019re competent to make a knowing and intelligent decision with regard to representing yourself. And with regard to your ability to state in a coherent fashion basis for your defense, I don\u2019t believe you have the competency to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Defendant later renewed his <em>Faretta </em>request at a trial setting conference held before a different judge. The court denied the request, stating: \u201cWell, according to the doctor, although you apparently do not have a mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>disease or disorder, he says your thought patterns are a bit eccentric, rather grandiose and somewhat bizarre. [\u00a1[] And the doctor says that you should not be representing yourself because you are quite naive and erroneous about your ability to defend yourself. . . . HU You think [of] everything in real simple terms, and you\u2019re not able to think through clearly all the legal ramifications. You have apparently a real easy answer for everything, and some things are quite complicated, fi[] I\u2019m not going to change the prior judge\u2019s ruling that you\u2019re not competent to represent yourself. He read all of these doctors\u2019 reports and concluded that it would be unfair and probably result in an uneven\u2014I\u2019m sure he felt that going against a trained prosecutor you could not appropriately represent yourself and handle all the legal issues that are going to come up. [ft] So I\u2019m not going to disturb Judge Connelly\u2019s finding that it would be appropriate. <em>Farretta </em>[sic] is again denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In <em>Faretta, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a defendant in a state criminal prosecution has a constitutional right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to waive counsel and represent himself. <em>(Faretta </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>422 U.S. at pp. 819-821 [45 L.Ed.2d at pp. 572-574, 95 S.Ct. at p. 2525].) Once defendant asserts this right, the court must determine whether he has the mental capacity to make a voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Joseph </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 936, 943 [196 Cal.Rptr. 339, 671 P.2d 843].) In making this determination, \u201c[t]he trial court is not concerned with the wisdom of defendant\u2019s decision to represent himself, or with how well he can do so. The sole relevant question is whether the defendant has the mental capacity to knowingly waive counsel while realizing the probable risks and consequences of self-representation. . . .\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 41, 107 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 554, 833 P.2d 561], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">In the present case, the court found defendant competent to stand trial but \u201cnot competent to make the decision to represent yourself or, in effect, [to] represent yourself.\u201d These rulings are antithetical. The United States Supreme Court has expressly \u201crejected] the notion that competence ... to waive the right to counsel must be measured by a standard that is higher than (or even different from ) the . . . standard [for competence to stand trial].\u201d <em>{Godinez </em>v. <em>Moran </em>(1993) 509 U.S. _ [125 L.Ed.2d 321, 113 S.Ct. 2680].)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Furthermore, in denying the request for self-representation, the court improperly considered defendant\u2019s ability to represent himself. The high court has also recently spoken to that point: \u201c[T]he competence that is required of a defendant seeking to waive his right to counsel is the competence to <em>waive the right, </em>not the competence to represent himself.\u201d (509 U.S. at p. __ [125 L.Ed.2d at p. 332]; original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>The United States Supreme Court recently stated: \u201c[Although the defendant \u2018may conduct his own defense ultimately to his own detriment, his choice must be honored[.]\u2019 . . . Thus, while \u2018[i]t is undeniable that in most criminal prosecutions defendants could better defend with counsel\u2019s guidance than by their own unskilled efforts,\u2019 a criminal defendant\u2019s ability to represent himself has no bearing upon his competence to <em>choose </em>self-representation.\u201d <em>(Godinez </em>v. <em>Moran, supra, </em>509 U.S. _ [125 L.Ed.2d at p. 333], citations and footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The <em>Faretta </em>court acknowledged the apparent inconsistency between the holding in that case and the thrust of its own Sixth Amendment jurisprudence: \u201cThere can be no blinking the fact that the right of an accused to conduct his own defense seems to cut against the grain of this Court\u2019s decisions holding that the Constitution requires that no accused can be convicted and imprisoned unless he has been accorded the right to the assistance of counsel (See <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>[1932] 287 U.S. 45, 77 L.Ed. 158, 53 S.Ct. 55, 85 A.L.R. 527; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst </em>[1937] 304 U.S. 458, 82 L.Ed. 1461, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 146 A.L.R. 357; <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright </em>[1963] 372 U.S. 335, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, 83 S.Ct. 792, 93 A.L.R.2d 733; <em>Argersinger </em>v. <em>Hamlin </em>[1972] 407 U.S. 25, 32 L.Ed.2d 530, 92 S.Ct. 2006.) For it is surely true that the basic thesis of those decisions is that the help of a lawyer is essential to assure the defendant a fair trial. And a strong argument can surely be made that the whole thrust of those decisions must inevitably lead to the conclusion that a State may constitutionally impose a lawyer upon even an unwilling defendant.\u201d (422 U.S. at pp. 832-833 [45 L.Ed.2d at p. 580], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Explaining its resolution of the apparent conflict in favor of the right of self-representation the court said: \u201cThe right to defend is personal. The defendant, and not his lawyer or the State, will bear the personal consequences of a conviction. It is the defendant, therefore, who must be free personally to decide whether in his particular case counsel is to his advantage. And although he may conduct his own defense ultimately to his own detriment, his choice must be honored out of \u2018that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.\u2019 <em>(Illinois </em>v. <em>Allen </em>[1970] 397 U.S. 337, 350-351 [25 L.Ed.2d 353, 90 S.Ct. 1057] (Brennan, J., concurring).\u201d (422 U.S. at p. 834 [45 L.Ed.2d at p. 581].)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">A more pungent rendering of the same principle appears in <em>Adams </em>v. <em>U.S. </em>ex rel. <em>McCann </em>(1942) 317 U.S. 269 [87 L.Ed. 268, 63 S.Ct. 236,143 A.L.R. 435] which the <em>Faretta </em>court quoted: \u201c \u2018The right to assistance of counsel and the <em>correlative right to dispense with a lawyer\u2019s help </em>are not legal formalisms. They rest on considerations that go to the substance of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>accused\u2019s position before the law . . . . [ID . . . What were contrived as protections for the accused should not be turned into fetters. ... To deny an accused a choice of procedure in circumstances in which he, though a layman, is as capable as any lawyer of making an intelligent choice, is to impair the worth of great Constitutional safeguards by treating them as empty verbalisms, [f]. . . When the administration of the criminal law . . . is hedged about as it is by the Constitutional safeguards for the protection of an accused, to deny him in the exercise of his free choice the right to dispense with some of these safeguards ... is to imprison a man in his privileges and call it the Constitution.\u2019 <em>{Id,., </em>at 279-280 [87 L.Ed. 268, 63 S.Ct. 236, 143 A.L.R. 435, italics original].)\u201d (422 U.S. at p. 815 [45 L.Ed.2d at p. 570].)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Respect for the dignity and autonomy of the individual is a value universally celebrated in free societies and uniformly repressed in totalitarian and authoritarian societies. Out of fidelity to that value defendant\u2019s choice must be honored even if he opts foolishly to go to hell in a handbasket. At least, if the worst happens, he can descend to the netherworld with his head held high. It\u2019s called, \u201cDoing It My Way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">We hold the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s request to represent himself.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since the error is prejudicial per se <em>{People </em>v. <em>Ortiz </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 975, 987-988 [275 Cal.Rptr. 191, 800 P.2d 547]), we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">On remand, if defendant again seeks to waive his right to counsel, the trial court must determine not only defendant\u2019s competence to waive but also, if defendant is competent, whether the waiver is intelligent and voluntary. (See <em>Godinez </em>v. <em>Moran, supra, </em>509 U.S._[125 L.Ed.2d at pp. 333-334.]</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Blease, J., and Raye, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-9\"> Criminal proceedings were not formally resumed. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1370, subd. (a).) The mental competence proceedings and the criminal proceedings were before the same judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-10\"> To the extent <em>People </em>v. <em>Burnett </em>(1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1314 [234 Cal.Rptr. 67] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Manago </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 982 [269 Cal.Rptr. 819] would suggest otherwise, we disagree with those opinions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
