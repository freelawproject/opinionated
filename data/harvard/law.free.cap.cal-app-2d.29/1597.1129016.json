J.</author>\n<p id=\"AD2\">Quial Botanical Gardens Foundation, Inc. (Quail) appeals a judgment denying its petition for peremptory writ of mandate. Quail seeks to vacate the approval and certification by the City of Encinitas (City) of a negative declaration under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Pub. Resources Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 21000 et seq.) regarding a proposed subdivision by Beck Properties, Inc. (Beck). Quail contends the City (i) improperly approved the negative declaration, because there is substantial evidence to support a fair argument significant environmental impacts may occur if the subdivision is built as proposed; (ii) abused its discretion by failing to consider whether an environmental impact report should be required for the proposed subdivision; (iii) improperly deferred mitigation measures which should have been specifically addressed in the negative declaration; and (iv) improperly prevented Quail from refuting Beck\u2019s testimony regarding toxic contamination on the subdivision property. Quail also contends the court erred in failing to consider posthearing evidence on the toxic contamination issue. Because we conclude there is substantial evidence supporting a fair argument significant environmental impacts may occur as a result of the subdivision as proposed, we conclude the City erred in certifying the negative declaration. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment with directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1600\">*1600</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Quail is a nonprofit corporation dedicated to preserving and enhancing the Quail Botanical Gardens (Gardens), a 27-acre public park known for its rare and endangered plant species and which is located in the City and owned by the County of San Diego. The Gardens also supports a wide variety of bird and animal wildlife, including the California quail. Quail has about 12,000 members and conducts tours and educational programs at the Gardens for students and the general public. The Gardens annually has about 120,000 visitors from across the United States and around the world.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">In December 1991, Beck applied for a tentative map for its proposed 12.6-acre subdivision in the City which Beck would convert from an existing greenhouse and agricultural use to a 40-lot residential single-family home subdivision. The proposed subdivision is adjacent to the Gardens along its entire western boundary and along the southern boundary of its western extension. The City conducted an initial study of the potential environmental impacts of the proposed subdivision and published its notice of intent to consider adoption of a mitigated negative declaration on April 21, 1992. Brian F. Mooney Associates (Mooney), apparently the City\u2019s environmental consultant, determined the potential significant environmental effects of the subdivision could be mitigated by implementing certain measures set forth in the proposed mitigated negative declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">After three hearings, the Old Encinitas Civil Advisory Board recommended the City\u2019s planning commission deny approval of the tentative map for the proposed subdivision. However, after two full commission hearings and one subcommittee hearing, the City\u2019s planning commission approved the tentative map. Quail then appealed to the city council (Council), and a hearing was held on December 16, 1992. Although one Council member pronounced the subdivision \u201c[is] going to be quite a change for the environment,\u201d the Council approved the tentative map application for the proposed subdivision and specifically resolved: \u201cIn the independent judgment of the City Council, this project will not have a significant effect on the environment with incorporation of the mitigation measures set forth in the initial study from Brian F. Mooney Associates dated May 21, 1992, made conditions of approval hereunder, and a negative declaration is hereby certified, pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).\u201d The trial court denied Quail\u2019s petition for writ of mandate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">The appropriate standard of review of the City\u2019s action is disputed by the parties to this appeal. However, as we discuss below, the basic standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1601\">*1601</page-number>review is fairly clear based upon the great weight of case law, although it must be carefully interpreted and applied to comply with CEQA\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In adopting CEQA, the Legislature in section 21001 declared it to be the policy of the State of California, in part, to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">\u201c(a) Develop and maintain a high-quality environment now and in the future, and take all action necessary to protect, rehabilitate, and enhance the environmental quality of the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">\u201c(b) Take all action necessary to provide the people of this state with clean air and water, <em>enjoyment of aesthetic, natural, scenic, and historic environmental qualities, and freedom from excessive noise\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Section 21060.5 defines \u201cenvironment\u201d as \u201cthe physical conditions which exist within the area which will be affected by a proposed project, including land, air, water, minerals, <em>flora, fauna, noise, </em>objects of historic <em>or aesthetic </em>significance.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">CEQA requires a governmental agency prepare an environmental impact report (EIR) whenever it considers approval of a proposed project that \u201cmay have a <em>significant </em>effect on the environment.\u201d (\u00a7 21100, italics added.) In addition to the intent to require governmental decision makers to consider the environmental implications of their decisions, the Legislature in enacting CEQA also intended to provide certain substantive measures for protection of the environment. <em>(Friends of Mammoth </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 247, 254-256 [104 Cal.Rptr. 761, 502 P.2d 1049], disapproved on another point in <em>Kowis </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 888, 896-899 [12 Cal.Rptr .2d 728, 838 P.2d 250]; <em>Sierra Club </em>v. <em>Gilroy City Council </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 30, 41 [271 Cal.Rptr. 393].) In particular, one court noted section 21002<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requires public agencies \u201cto deny approval of a project with significant adverse effects when feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures can substantially lessen such effects.\u201d <em>(Sierra Club </em>v. <em>Gilroy City Council, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.3d at p. 41.)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">If there is no substantial evidence a project \u201cmay have a significant effect on the environment\u201d or the initial study identifies potential significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1602\">*1602</page-number>effects, but provides for mitigation revisions which make such effects insignificant, a public agency must adopt a negative declaration to such effect and, as a result, no EIR is required. (\u00a7\u00a7 21080, subd. (c), 21064.)  However, the Supreme Court has recognized that CEQA requires the preparation of an EIR \u201cwhenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental impact.\u201d <em>(No Oil, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75 [118 Cal.Rptr. 34, 529 P.2d 66]; see also <em>Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 231, 864 P.2d 502].) Thus, if substantial evidence in the record supports a \u201cfair argument\u201d significant impacts or effects may occur, an EIR is required and a negative declaration cannot be certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Upon a challenge of an agency\u2019s decision no EIR is required, the reviewing court\u2019s<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cfunction is to determine whether substantial evidence supported the agency\u2019s conclusion as to whether the prescribed \u2018fair argument\u2019 could be made.\u201d <em>(Friends of \u201cB\u201d Street </em>v. <em>City of Hayward </em>(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002 [165 Cal.Rptr. 514].) Restated, when the reviewing court: \u201cperceives substantial evidence that the project might have such an impact, but the agency failed to secure preparation of the required EIR, the agency\u2019s action is to be set aside because the agency abused its discretion by failing to proceed \u2018in a manner required by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>More recently, the First District Court of Appeal summarized this standard of review, stating: \u201cA court reviewing an agency\u2019s decision not to prepare an EIR in the first instance must set aside the decision if the administrative record contains substantial evidence that a proposed project might have a significant environmental impact; in such a case, the agency has not proceeded as required by law. [Citation.] Stated another way, the question is one of law, i.e., \u2018the sufficiency of the evidence to support a fair argument.\u2019 [Citation.] Under this standard, <em>deference to the agency\u2019s determination is not appropriate and its decision not to require an EIR can be upheld only when there is no credible evidence to the contrary. </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Sierra Club </em>v. <em>County of Sonoma </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1317-1318 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 473], italics added.) Thus, the applicable standard of review appears to involve a question of law requiring a certain degree of independent review of the record, rather than the typical substantial evidence standard which usually results in great deference being given to the factual determinations of an agency. We agree with and adopt the First District\u2019s <em>Sierra Club </em>standard of review as quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1603\">*1603</page-number>We decline to adopt the contrary minority view expressed in <em>Newberry Springs Water Assn. </em>v. <em>County of San Bernardino </em>(1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 740, 747-749 [198 Cal.Rptr. 100], in which the court ostensibly adopted the standard of review set forth in <em>Friends of \u201cB\u201d Street </em>v. <em>City of Hayward, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.3d at page 1002, but proceeded to apply it in the forgiving, deferential manner typifying the substantial evidence standard. In any event, that case is inapposite and its deferential approach may be dicta, as the court concluded there was \u201cno real evidence in the record, other than plaintiffs\u2019 opinion\u201d that a 900-cow dairy farm would have a significant effect on the environment. <em>(Newberry Springs Water Assn. </em>v. <em>County of San Bernadino, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.3d at p. 749.) Further, that same court may have abandoned its deferential approach when it later restated the generally accepted standard of review and concluded, \u201c. . . if it is clear that considerable evidence was presented and that the evidence was not properly considered by the lead agency the reviewing court may find an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>(Citizens Assn, for Sensible Development of Bishop Area </em>v. <em>County of Inyo </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151, 173 [217 Cal.Rptr. 893].)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">We further note our deferential approach taken in <em>Uhler </em>v. <em>City of Encinitas </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 795 [278 Cal.Rptr. 157], is inconsistent with the standard of review we apply in this case. In <em>Uhler, </em>we stated we may not substitute our judgment for that of the agency which certified a negative declaration, mistakenly applying the deferential substantial evidence standard of review. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 802-803.) Accordingly, we candidly admit the <em>Uhler </em>standard of review cannot be reconciled with the correct standard of review we adopt in this case, and, as a result, we now abandon the erroneous standard we applied in <em>Uhler.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">In applying the appropriate standard, we must, of course, review the record and determine whether there is substantial evidence in support of a fair argument the subdivision may have a significant environmental impact, while giving the City the benefit of the doubt on any legitimate, disputed issues of credibility. In effect, we apply a hybrid, quasi-independent standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Applying this standard of review to our record, we note Quail asserts significant environmental impact may occur in four areas as a result of the proposed subdivision. It contends its panoramic ocean views, indigenous birds and wildlife, and tranquillity may be significantly impacted. Further, it contends the toxic pesticides in the subdivision\u2019s soil may significantly affect its residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1604\">*1604</page-number>Based on our review of the administrative record, we conclude there is sufficient evidence of a possible environmental impact upon the Gardens\u2019 views which supports a fair argument the subdivision, as proposed, may have a significant impact or effect on the environment. The City\u2019s initial study performed with the assistance of Mooney concluded the subdivision could have significant environmental effects, but, through the implementation of proposed mitigation measures, the subdivision would not result in an overall adverse impact on the environment. In light of this initial study which addressed, among other things, the issue of view impact and in the course of the extensive lay and expert testimony and other evidence on the view issue during the hearings, the City effectively acknowledged the impact of the subdivision on the Gardens\u2019 views could be a potential significant environmental impact. Further, the City does not dispute on appeal the effect of the subdivision on the Gardens\u2019 views could raise an issue of significant impact under CEQA. Rather, it appears to contend any impact has been reduced below a level of significance by the imposition of mitigation measures which are a part of its negative declaration. Quail, however, asserts such mitigation measures do not clearly make view impacts insignificant, and substantial evidence supports a fair argument the subdivision, even with the mitigating measures, may have a significant impact on the Gardens\u2019 views.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Appendix G to the CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15000 et seq.) states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">\u201cA project will normally have a significant effect on the environment if it will:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">\u201c(b) Have a substantial, demonstrable negative aesthetic effect[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Thus, the CEQA Guidelines essentially establish a rebuttable presumption any substantial, negative aesthetic effect is to be considered a significant environmental impact for CEQA purposes. We must give great weight to the CEQA Guidelines. <em>(Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 391, fn. 2 [253 Cal.Rptr. 426,764 P.2d 278].) Lacking any reason to conclude otherwise, we adopt this provision of the CEQA Guidelines as self-evident. We further conclude it is inherent in the meaning of the word \u201caesthetic\u201d that any substantial, negative effect of a project on view and other features of beauty could constitute a \u201csignificant\u201d environmental impact under CEQA.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1605\">*1605</page-number>Extensive testimony and photographs in the record establish persons at the Gardens presently enjoy a panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean in a tranquil, beautiful setting. A dispute revolves, however, around whether it may be fairly argued the proposed subdivision may \u201csignificantly\u201d impact or diminish such view and beauty. To the City\u2019s and Beck\u2019s credit, many changes were made to the proposed subdivision over the course of the hearings in an effort to reduce any such impact. Yet, we do not judge compliance based on how many changes were made from the original proposal, but rather on the status of the proposed subdivision at the time of approval by the City together with any specific mitigation measures adopted by the City at that time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both Beck and Quail presented photographs from many vantage points on the Gardens\u2019 property overlooking the subdivision and Pacific Ocean, and we have reviewed these photographs. Many of these photographs reveal the location of various \u201cstory poles\u201d Beck placed on the property to indicate the height of some of the proposed houses. Although more elaborate methods such as computerized three-dimensional imagery or more complete roof outlines may more accurately display the extent of view obstruction, even this rather simple method of using \u201cstory poles\u201d reveals there is a definite probability of at least some view obstruction. However, the exact extent of obstruction is unclear and disputed by the parties. In addition to the lay testimony of Quail members and representatives of the County of San Diego Department of Parks and Recreation who indicated the subdivision would substantially impair the existing views and beauty of the Gardens, more probative evidence was introduced through the testimony of John Blake, an expert surveyor retained by Quail. Blake performed a number of survey measurements from various vantage points on the Gardens and testified, \u201cit\u2019s pretty clear that at least 60% of the view is going to be missing, maybe up to 90%.\u201d More specifically, he identified two areas from which the view impacts will be the greatest, namely, the parking lot area and the Asian gardens area which are both adjacent to the proposed subdivision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1606\">*1606</page-number>It also seems self-evident that replacing existing greenhouses with many large two-story homes will have at least some adverse effect upon the Gardens\u2019 views and the beauty of the setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Finally, we note the City\u2019s mitigation measures do not clearly reduce such effects below a level of significance. The only specific mitigation measure adopted by the City at the time of approval regarding the height of the houses was set forth in the City\u2019s resolution approving the tentative map, providing in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">\u201cFor purposes of this analysis, the threshold for determining a significant visual impact is assumed to be the maximum height of the \u2018building envelope\u2019 for proposed Lots #18-27. The maximum \u2018building envelope\u2019 shall be measured at approximately four feet above the crest of the adjoining grade of the Quail Gardens property adjacent to the eastern subject property boundary. This represents the typical eye level by which a person standing anywhere along the Quail Gardens parking lot would have \u2018ocean views\u2019 looking westerly. For example, the maximum \u2018building envelope\u2019 for proposed Lot #22, as viewed from the northwest comer of the adjacent Quail Gardens parking lot, is at an elevation of approximately 264 feet AMSL. Therefore, the roof ridgelines of future homes constructed on proposed Lots #18-27 shall not be allowed to project above the maximum \u2018building envelope\u2019, where significant view opportunities occur for visitors to the Quail Botanical Gardens, without specific authority through design review. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-7\">\u201cFuture homes on Lots 19, 21, 22, 23, and 24 shall be limited to a maximum height of 22 ft. and future homes on Lots 18, 20, and 25 shall be limited to a maximum height of 24 ft. . . . [The City then sets forth specific building height limits for 13 adjacent lots.]\u201d Thus, the basic height limitation is four feet above the adjacent Gardens level. Given the uncontradicted expert survey showing the adjacent parking area of the Gardens is typically about 260 feet above sea level, even a beginning geometry student can deduce that such a limitation would not prevent obstruction of the ocean view. In fact, for a child or disabled person in a wheelchair with a line of vision under a height of four feet, such a limitation would result in total obstruction of certain views of the ocean, leaving, at best, limited and amorphous \u201cview corridors\u201d which were not adequately identified or proven, either quantitatively or qualitatively, during the hearings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Thus, based on the record before it, the City could not conclude its mitigation measures clearly would reduce the subdivision\u2019s adverse view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1607\">*1607</page-number>impacts below a level of significance. The record clearly shows Quail presented substantial evidence there may be a significant impact upon the Gardens\u2019 views, and \u201ccontrary evidence is not adequate to support a decision to dispense with an EIR.\u201d <em>(Sierra Club </em>v. <em>County of Sonoma, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.4th at p. 1316.) The expert testimony of Blake indicated there would be a significant impact upon views and contradicted expert testimony presented by Beck. Accordingly, as one court stated, \u201c. . . if there is a disagreement among experts over the significance of an effect, the agency is to treat the effect as significant and prepare an EIR.\" <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Based upon our review of the reliable and largely undisputed evidence in the record before the City regarding potential impacts on views, we conclude there is substantial evidence supporting a fair argument the proposed subdivision, even with its specific mitigation measures, may significantly impact the environment. Accordingly, the City erred in certifying the mitigated negative declaration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The judgment is reversed with directions to the trial court to enter a judgment granting the petition, to issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing the City to set aside its December 16, 1992, resolution certifying the negative declaration and approving the tentative subdivision map, and to issue such injunctive and other relief as may be appropriate and consistent with this opinion.

I find nothing in this pronouncement to suggest that in an environmental case, an appellate court is free to engraft \u201ca certain degree of independent review of the record\u201d onto the substantial evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">I believe it is important to observe that Quail Botanical Gardens is hardly a wilderness area. Land uses surrounding the proposed project include both apartment houses and condominiums. Commercial development on Encinitas Boulevard is but a stone\u2019s throw away. Furthermore, the property of Quail Botanical Gardens Foundation, Inc. (Quail) is not regarded as either a \u201cSignificant Viewshed\u201d or \u201cVista Point\u201d in the visual resources sensitivity map of the city\u2019s general plan. The Coastal Commission has opined that Quail \u201chas ... an undistinguished view of greenhouses and urban development.\u201d The commission therefore removed Quail from its local coastal program \u201cVisual Resources\u201d element.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">The administrative record in this case reveals that the proposed project was the subject of exhaustive, expensive and good faith environmental analysis. No fair argument can support Quail\u2019s contention of inadequate toxic soil analysis, noise or the threat purportedly posed by predatory house pets to Quail\u2019s fauna and flora. Indeed, save City\u2019s improper deferral of view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1609\">*1609</page-number>mitigation, Quail\u2019s assignments of error do not only fail to support \u201ca fair argument,\u201d they are patently absurd. Had City imposed the selfsame view impact mitigation measures during the review process which it proposes be deferred to the design stage, the judgment would have to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">If this court is inclined to abandon the standard of review articulated in <em>Uhler </em>v. <em>City of Encinitias, supra, </em>I would prefer that decision be based on stronger facts than those presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 29,1994, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b777-12\"> Judge of the San Diego Superior Court sitting under assignment by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
