Code, \u00a7 3726)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> assessing a penalty of $2,000 against him for failure to obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance in violation of section 3700. He challenges the constitutionality of the statutory scheme and in particular section 3726 which, he contends, violates the separation of powers doctrine, due process, and principle of check. He claims that the Legislature encroached upon the judicial branch of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>government by permitting a \u201clay person\u201d\u2014the Labor Commissioner\u2014to order any clerk of any superior court to enter a court judgment. He further claims that the Director of Industrial Relations\u2019 powers to order continued payment to nonworking employees as well as to order penalty assessments without adequate prior judicial review are self-enforceable judgments which violate the judicial powers clause, thus violating the \u201cprinciple of check.\u201d We conclude that entry of judgment against him does not offend any constitutional principles and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The record reveals that the Labor Commissioner, who is the authorized delegee of the Director of Industrial Relations, Administrator of the Uninsured Employers Fund of the State of California, requested that the Clerk of the Ventura County Superior Court enter special judgment against appellant. Attached to the request was a document from the Department of Industrial Relations Division of Labor Standards Enforcement entitled \u201cStop Order - Penalty Assessment.\u201d The document stated that an investigation of appellant\u2019s premises by a representative of the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement revealed that appellant had employees whom he had failed to cover with workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Appellant was ordered to stop using any employee labor until he secured the requisite insurance, and was notified that failure to observe this stop order is punishable as a misdemeanor, and that any employee affected by this work stoppage shall be paid for such time lost, not exceeding 10 days, until appellant secured the payment of workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Additionally, the document reflected a penalty assessment of $2,000 as a penalty for noninsurance. The document notified appellant that unless appealed, the penalty had to be received by the office of the State Labor Commissioner no later than February 24, 1993, and that appellant could appeal by requesting a hearing on the stop order and/or penalty assessment as shown on the reverse of the document. The clerk entered judgment June 28, 1993, pursuant to section 3726, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">1. <em>Separation of Powers and Principle of Check</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">Appellant challenges the authority of respondent to have a clerk enter judgment immediately upon the filing of respondent\u2019s request without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>any claimed injury being made by any employee or prejudgment adjudication of the claim by the courts. He contends that the Legislature has no judicial power, nor may it delegate judicial power to any division of state government, other than the judiciary. <em>(Strumsky </em>v. <em>San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 28, 35 [112 Cal.Rptr. 805, 520 P.2d 29] .)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">We review the statutory scheme. Every employer except the state must secure the payment of workers\u2019 compensation either by obtaining insurance against liability from a duly authorized insurer or by securing from the Director of Industrial Relations a certificate of consent to self-insure. (\u00a7 3700, subds. (a), (b).) Failure to secure payment of workers\u2019 compensation as provided in section 3700 is a misdemeanor. (\u00a7 3700.5.) Any injured employee or his or her dependents may bring an action at law against an employer who fails to secure the payment of workers\u2019 compensation and it will be presumed that the employee\u2019s injury was a direct result of the employer\u2019s negligence. (\u00a7\u00a7 3706, 3708.) The Director of Industrial Relations may adopt, amend, and repeal such rules and regulations reasonably necessary to enforce and administer workers\u2019 compensation laws. (\u00a7 3710.)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">When an employer fails to secure workers\u2019 compensation required by section 3700, the director \u201cshall issue and serve on such employer a stop order prohibiting the use of employee labor by sr ch employer until the employer\u2019s compliance with the provisions of Section 3700. Such stop order shall become effective immediately upon service.\u201d (\u00a7 3710.1.) The employer must pay any employee so affected by such work stoppage for such time lost, not exceeding 10 days, pending compliance by the employer. <em>{Ibid.) </em>The employer may protest the stop order by filing with the director a written request for a hearing within 20 days after service of the stop order, and may take a writ of mandate within 45 days from the director\u2019s findings after hearing to the appropriate superior court. <em>{Ibid.) </em>Failure to observe a stop order is a misdemeanor. (\u00a7 3710.2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">When the stop order is issued, the director \u201cshall also issue and serve a penalty assessment order requiring the uninsured employer to pay to the director, for deposit in the State Treasury to the credit of the Uninsured Employers Fund, the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000) per employee employed at the time the order is issued and served, as an additional penalty for being uninsured at that time.\u201d (\u00a7 3722, subd. (a).) An employer may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>contest the penalty assessment order by filing a written request for a hearing within 15 days after service of the order. (\u00a7 3725.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Any amount of penalty found by the director as a result of the hearing shall become due and payable 45 days after notice of the findings and written findings have been mailed. (\u00a7 3725.) The employer aggrieved by the decision may take a writ of mandate from these findings upon the execution of a bond to the state in double the amount found due \u201cas long as the party agrees to pay any judgment and costs rendered against the party for the assessment.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The director may withdraw a stop order or a penalty assessment order where investigation reveals that the employer was in compliance with section 3700 on the date and at the time of service of such order or on the date and at the time of an injury or claimed injury, or where an insured employer responded in writing to a request to furnish the status of the workers\u2019 compensation coverage within the time prescribed. (\u00a7 3727.1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Although appellant takes issue with section 3722, subdivision (b)(1), and asserts that there must first have been an \u201cadjudication of the claim,\u201d that section is inapplicable here. Section 3722, subdivision (b)(1) concerns the imposition of penalties following the adjudication of a claim. The section pertinent here is section 3722, subdivision (a), which is triggered by the employer\u2019s failure to be covered by workers\u2019 compensation insurance and is not dependent on a claim for industrial injury having been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In construing a statute, a court should ascertain the legislative intent in order to carry out the purpose of the law. <em>(DuBois </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 382, 387 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 523, 853 P.2d 978].)  The underpinnings of the workers\u2019 compensation system rest upon the employer\u2019s obligation to secure payment of workers\u2019 compensation. <em>(Self-Insurers\u2019 Security Fund </em>v. <em>ESIS, Inc. </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1148,1156 [251 Cal.Rptr. 693].) This statutory obligation begins with the inception of the status as employer and does not depend upon the making of a claim. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The separation of powers doctrine is based upon the separation of powers clause (art. Ill, \u00a7 3) and the judicial powers clause (art. VI, \u00a7 1) of the California Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The California Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[d]espite the breadth of [art. VI, \u00a7 1], various administrative agencies in this state are authorized by the Constitution to exercise judicial powers. Some of these agencies are created by the Constitution, and are thereby vested with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>certain judicial powers (e.g., arts. XX, \u00a7 22 [Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control]; XII [Public Utilities Commission]); others have been legislatively endowed with judicial powers pursuant to a specific constitutional authorization (see art. XIV, \u00a7 4 [Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board]; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 1 [\u2018The Legislature may provide ... for the general welfare of employees and for [that purpose] may confer on a commission legislative, executive, and judicial powers.\u2019]).\u201d <em>(McHugh </em>v. <em>Santa Monica Rent Control Bd. </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 348, 355-356 [261 Cal.Rptr. 318, <em>777 </em>P.2d 91], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The California Supreme Court, in commenting on the separation of powers provided in the California Constitution, stated that the two provisions preclude exercise of judicial power by \u201cnonconstitutional\u201d administrative agencies, i.e., those whose authority is derived solely from a grant of power by the state or local government entity, but do not limit the power of agencies whose authority is derived from the Constitution itself. <em>(Lentz </em>v. <em>McMahon </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 393, 404 [261 Cal.Rptr. 310, <em>777 </em>P.2d 83].)  Regarding the statutory scheme at issue, the Legislature has required all employers to secure the payment of workers\u2019 compensation to injured workers pursuant to the \u201cplenary power\u201d the Constitution has granted to the Legislature \u201c \u2018to create, and enforce a complete system of workers\u2019 compensation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(DuBois </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>5 Cal.4th 382, 388; Cal. Const., art. XIV, \u00a7 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Consequently, neither the separation of powers nor the judicial powers clause, per se, prohibits the exercise of \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d functions by an administrative agency. Rather, the California Supreme Court has held that an administrative agency may constitutionally hold hearings, determine facts, apply the law, and impose certain types of monetary relief so long as (i) these activities are \u201cauthorized by statute or legislation and are <em>reasonably necessary </em>to effectuate the administrative agency\u2019s <em>primary, legitimate regulatory purposes, </em>and (ii) <em>the \u2018essential\u2019 judicial power </em>(i.e., the power to make enforceable, binding judgments) <em>remains ultimately in the courts, through review of agency determinations.\" (McHugh </em>v. <em>Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., supra, </em>49 Cal.3d 348, 372.)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Here the instant statutory scheme does authorize the director to adjudicate penalties imposed on employers who fail to secure workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Nonetheless, the Legislature\u2019s authorizing the challenged power does not shield it from scrutiny under the reasonably necessary/legitimate regulatory purpose prong of McHugh\u2019s test. <em>(Walnut Creek Manor </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 245, 257 [284 Cal.Rptr. 718, 814 P.2d 704].) An important function of penalty assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>under the challenged statutory scheme is to help finance the California Uninsured Employers Fund, a source of funds for injured workers whose employers have failed or refused either to obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage, or to qualify as self-insurers for the employers\u2019 liability. <em>(DuBois </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd.., supra, </em>5 Cal.4th 382, 388-389.) This purpose dovetails with the several intents of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act; i.e., \u201c(1) to ensure that the cost of industrial injuries will be part of the cost of goods rather than a burden on society, (2) to guarantee prompt, limited compensation for an employee\u2019s work injuries, regardless of fault, as an inevitable cost of production, (3) to spur increased industrial safety, and (4) in return, to insulate the employer from tort liability for his employees\u2019 injuries.\u201d (S. <em>G. Borello &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Industrial Relations </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 341, 354 [256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399].)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Consequently, the penalties imposed pursuant to statute are reasonably necessary to the primary concern to create a source of benefits to the employee who otherwise would receive no benefits because of the employer\u2019s failure or refusal to obtain workers\u2019 compensation coverage. The adjudicatory functions of the agency are circumscribed since the director determines whether or not the employer is insured, and, if not, the number of employees in its employ. The penalty is based on that number.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, there is a statutory limit of $100,000 on the amount of penalty that can be assessed. (\u00a7 3722.)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Appellant argues that the director\u2019s powers to require the employer to continue to pay each then nonworking employee ordered not to work by the director, as well as assessing a penalty, violate the \u201cprinciple of check.\u201d In <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., supra, </em>49 Cal.3d 348, 376-377, the California Supreme Court found that the order of the Rent Control Board, which was given immediate practical effect without giving the landlord opportunity to obtain judicial review, violated the \u201cprinciple of check.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>A statute is to be construed whenever possible to preserve its constitutionality. <em>(Walnut Creek Manor </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 245, 271.)  Courts will uphold an agency\u2019s authority to exercise a challenged power, however, \u201conly if the administrative scheme also respects the \u2018principle of check\u2019 by providing for judicial review of administrative determinations.\u201d <em>(McHugh </em>v. <em>Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., supra, </em>49 Cal.3d 348, 373.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Here the enabling statute makes certain practices crimes and provides penalties for their violation. The director does not devise punitive measures, but merely implements those mandated by statute. Moreover, unlike <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., supra, </em>49 Cal.3d 348, the statutory scheme here provides that if a hearing is requested, the decision of the director upholding a penalty assessment does not become final and enforceable for 45 days, during which the aggrieved employer may seek judicial review by filing a writ of mandate in the superior court. (\u00a7 3725.) This opportunity for judicial review satisfies the \u201cprinciple of check.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Appellant additionally asserts that section 3710.2, which makes the failure of the employer to comply with the stop order a crime \u201cirrespective of merit or lack of merit of the stop order\u201d (appellant\u2019s words), is a violation of the \u201cprinciple of check.\u201d We disagree. Section 3710.2 also makes the failure to obtain a policy of workers\u2019 compensation insurance or a certificate of consent to self-insure as required by section 3700 a misdemeanor in accordance with section 3700.5. An employer who fails or refuses to comply with section 3700 is already in violation of the law as illegally uninsured. <em>(Self-Insurers\u2019 Security Fund </em>v. <em>ESIS, Inc., supra, </em>204 Cal.App.3d 1148, 1157.) An employer cannot be criminally liable unless he or she knows, or because of knowledge or experience should know, of the obligation to secure workers\u2019 compensation insurance. (\u00a7 3700.5.) If an employer is illegally uninsured, section 3710.2 simply imposes further criminal liability in continuing to use employees who may be exposed to on-the-job injury where the employer has no insurance to cover them. If the employer has complied with section 3700, the employer can show proof of compliance and request the stop order be lifted. Although an employer may have to pay an employee\u2019s salary for up to 10 days under a stop order, compliance with section 3700 is within the control of the employer and not the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The entry of judgment by the clerk upon the director\u2019s request is simply a ministerial function similar to entry of a default judgment (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 585), a clerk\u2019s entry of judgment following an unappealed arbitration award (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1141.23), or a clerk\u2019s entry of judgment on a sister-state judgment (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1710.25). There was no violation of the separation of powers doctrine or \u201cprinciple of check.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>2. <em>No Denial of Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Appellant asserts that he was denied due process by having judgment entered by the clerk without the opportunity of notice and opportunity to be heard by an impartial tribunal. He argues further that a writ of mandate is a hollow tool where respondent has reached an opinion of violation and amount of penalty without any evidentiary hearing or record for use in court.  The procedural requirements necessary to satisfy due process vary according to the competing interests of the government and the citizen. <em>(Menefee &amp; Son </em>v. <em>Department of Food &amp; Agriculture </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 774, 781 [245 Cal.Rptr. 166].)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The court must balance the private interest affected by the official action against the risk of an erroneous deprivation of that interest through the procedures used, along with the government\u2019s interest, including administrative burdens which would be incurred by additional safeguards. <em>(Peretto </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 449, 460 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 392]; <em>Mackey </em>v. <em>Montrym </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 1, 10 [61 L.Ed.2d 321, 329, 99 S.Ct. 2612].) In <em>Montrym, </em>the United States Supreme Court upheld a statute that provided for an immediate hearing upon request after surrender of the license without a presuspension hearing. (443 U.S. 1,10 [61 L.Ed.2d 321, 329].)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The assessment order here was served by mail and contained the warning that failure to appeal would result in enforcement of the penalty assessment as a judgment. It also advised appellant of his appeal rights.  The fundamental requisite of due process is an opportunity to be heard. That right has little reality or worth unless one is informed that the matter is pending so that one can choose whether or not to contest it. <em>(Traverso </em>v. <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1152, 1164 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 217, 864 P.2d 488].)  Appellant cannot successfully contend he lacked notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The statutory scheme provides for a hearing before the director upon the timely filing of an appeal. Ten days is not an unreasonable period of time to show proof of compliance with section 3700. (See <em>Traverso </em>v. <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept, of Transportation, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 1152, 1164.) The administrative record would thus contain whatever evidence was relevant that appellant produced which a court could then review on the filing of a petition for writ of mandate. Due process does not require a hearing at the initial stage or at any particular point of an administrative process so long as the requisite hearing is held before the final order becomes effective. <em>(Lusardi Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Aubry </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 976, 992 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 837, 824 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>643].) Appellant had a right to a hearing and was notified of this right. That he chose not to contest the stop order and penalty does not make the administrative scheme unconstitutional any more than a defendant\u2019s election not to answer a complaint and to allow a default judgment to be entered makes the civil action against him unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The judgment is affirmed.
