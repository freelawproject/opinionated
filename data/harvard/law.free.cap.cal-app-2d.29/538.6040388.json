At the time of the hearing before this court petitioner testified that his average income for the past year was from $110 to $115 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>This is the sole question necessary for determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">\n<em>May the trial court make an order permitting a party who is not an indigent to prosecute an action before a jury without the prepayment of jury fees?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">This question must be answered in the negative. The law is settled in California that only an indigent person has a right to prosecute a civil action <em>in forma pauperis. (Gomez v. Superior Court, </em>134 Cal. App. 19, 20 [24 Pac. (2d) 859] ; <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>98 Cal. App. 729, 730 [277 Pac. 757].) Indigent means destitute of property (Funk &amp; Wagnall\u2019s Practical Standard Dictionary, (1938) 586); lacking in what is requisite (vol. V, The Oxford English Dictionary, (1933) 213). In the present case from petitioner\u2019s own testimony it appears that he was not indigent, since he was at the time in receipt of an average monthly income of from $110 to $115 and therefore, applying the rule of law above stated, was not entitled to prosecute his action <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">For the foregoing reasons the alternative writ heretofore issued is discharged and a writ of mandate is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Grail, P. J., and Wood, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">An application by petitioner to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on January 30, 1939.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
