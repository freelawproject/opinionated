III (Tony). Jayne contends the termination order is fatally vague concerning visitation and the nondissemination order is in excess of jurisdiction and contrary to statute. Jerry also challenges the nondissemination order. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Tiffany and Tony were born on June 1, 1984, to Jayne and her husband, Tony G. II (Tony II). After Jayne and Tony II divorced, the children apparently lived with Jayne. In October 1988, Jayne married Jerry. In June 1990, the children began therapy after Jayne and Jerry reported they had acted out sexually and disclosed that their maternal grandparents and cousins had molested them. In October 1990, after Tiffany and Tony were placed in foster care, they revealed Jayne and Jerry had sexually molested them and forced them to identify their maternal grandparents and cousins as the perpetrators. On November 20,1990, the juvenile court declared the children dependents due to sexual abuse. It detained and then placed them with their fattier in Iowa at a confidential address.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">The Nondissemination Order</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">According to the social worker\u2019s January 20, 1994, review report, in October 1993 Jayne and Jerry told the child abuse unit of the San Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Department that the maternal grandparents had molested Tiffany and Tony. After a new investigation the case was closed. At some point, Jayne and Jerry mailed packets of materials to numerous people in California and Iowa. These packets included copies of various juvenile court reports, a social study, a review report, psychological evaluations of Tiffany and Tony, and evidentiary interview reports concerning the children. The social worker said: \u201cSuch action is extremely demeaning to Tiffany and Tony and violates these children\u2019s sense of privacy, if not rights of privacy. These actions by the mother and stepfather would certainly be emotionally damaging to the minors if the minors knew of their occurrence. I appeal to the court to take any action possible to protect these minors from continued abuse in this way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">At the January 20, 1994, review hearing, Jayne\u2019s attorney furnished the court what he represented was a copy of the disseminated materials. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>court described the packet as containing confidential documents including psychological evaluations, reports prepared by the department of social services, and a report prepared by children\u2019s hospital. The court read and considered the January 20, 1994, review report. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\">\u201cI\u2019m going to inform you that all documents generated from the dependency action in this case around these two kids generated by the department, generated by agencies with whom the Department works in doing their efforts are confidential. They\u2019re confidential by California statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">\u201cNow, you, mom, you get to see them because you\u2019re mom, because you\u2019re a party to this action; and it wouldn\u2019t be fair for you not to know what we\u2019re talking about. But the confidentiality extends to you and not beyond you to family, friends or other professionals who are not directly involved in the dependency process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">\u201cAnd as far as stepfather is concerned, the . . . confidentiality does not even extend to you and certainly does not authorize you to distribute the materials anywhere else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">\u201cNow, the order I\u2019m going to issue to the two of you is that you are ordered not to distribute confidential materials generated as part of this dependency process to anyone, period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Jerry then inquired: \u201cHow about the grand jury?\u201d The court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">\u201cYou are not to distribute them to anyone. If the grand jury wants them, the grand jury has a way to get them. They don\u2019t have to go through you for it. You, particularly, Mr. [D.], aren\u2019t supposed to have them in the first place; so you\u2019re not supposed to have them. You\u2019re not supposed to give them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">\u201cMom, you don\u2019t give them to the grand jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">The court explained violation of its order would constitute contempt of court, with each violation punishable by up to five days in custody. Jayne said she understood. After a lengthy protest by Jerry and further explanation by the court, the court found he understood the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">The Visitation Order<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Jayne contends the nondissemination order is in excess of jurisdiction and contrary to Welfare and Institutions Code<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> section 827, subdivision (a). Jerry asserts Jayne was entitled to receive the records and disclose them to him. He argues she is a holder of a privilege with respect to the records, entitling her to waive the privilege and allow him to inspect them.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He further asserts the nondissemination order is an invalid prior restraint, a violation of his First Amendment rights, overbroad, unsupported by substantial evidence, preempted by state law, lacking in statutory authority, and not narrowly drawn to protect Tiffany and Tony.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Section 827, subdivision (a) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">\u201c[A] petition filed in any juvenile court proceeding, reports of the probation officer, and all other documents filed in any such case or made available to the probation officer in making his or her report, or to the judge, referee, or other hearing officer, and thereafter retained by the probation officer, judge, referee, or other hearing officer, <em>may be inspected only by court </em>personnel, the district attorney, a city attorney or city prosecutor authorized to prosecute criminal or juvenile cases under state law, the minor who is the subject of the proceeding, <em>his or her parents or guardian, </em>the attorneys for the parties, and any other person who may be designated by court order of the judge of the juvenile court upon filing a petition therefor. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">\u201cAny records or reports relating to a matter within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court prepared by or released by the court, a probation department, or the county department of social services, any portion of those records or reports, and information relating to the contents of those records or reports, shall not be disseminated by the receiving agencies to any persons or agencies, other than those persons or agencies authorized to receive documents pursuant to this section. Further, any of those records or reports, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>portion of those records or reports, and information relating to the contents of those records or reports, shall not be made attachments to any other documents without the prior approval of the presiding judge of the juvenile court, unless they are used in connection with and in the course of a criminal investigation or a proceeding brought to declare a person a dependent child or a ward of the juvenile court.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Jayne and Jerry argue while section 827, subdivision (a) limits the ability of authorized <em>agencies </em>to disseminate juvenile court records, there is no specific corresponding statutory limitation on the right of a <em>parent to </em>do so. Thus, they argue, as the statute does not specifically name them as parties who may not disseminate juvenile court documents, they are free to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">We think this is too narrow a reading of the statute, and in particular it ignores the need to read together all of the statutes on this subject so as to determine the legislative intent. <em>(Freedom Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Orange County Employees Retirement System </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 821, 828 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 148, 863 P.2d 218].) Under this broader approach, we reject the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">To begin with, the documents here at issue, pursuant to the specific language of section 827, subdivision (a) \u201cmay be inspected <em>only </em>by court personnel ... the minor . . . [and] his or her parents or guardian . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Thus the specific prohibition on disclosure by government agencies need not be repeated with respect to persons, as those individuals are already necessarily precluded from any such disclosure by the limitations on access to the material in question which are set out above.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Also, in the next paragraph, section 827, subdivision (b), the Legislature \u201creaffirms its belief that juvenile court records, in general, should be confidential.\u201d (\u00a7 827, subd. (b)(1) [exception for cases involving serious acts of violence].) Thus, reading section 827, subdivision (a) together with section 827, subdivision (b) compels rejection of the contrary argument advanced herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Furthermore, we are obliged to hold paramount Tiffany\u2019s and Tony\u2019s best interests <em>(In re Mary S. </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 414, 418-419 [230 Cal.Rptr. 726]) and consider the dependency law\u2019s objective of protecting them <em>(In re Marilyn H. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 295, 307 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 544, 851 P.2d 826]). While Jayne has access to the juvenile court\u2019s records, to allow her to disseminate them to anyone she pleases would stand the confidentiality principle on its head, and disserve rather than support the principle of confidentiality.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Cf. <em>Bank of San Pedro </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 797, 804 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 696, 838 P.2d 218].)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Moreover, Jayne and Jerry\u2019s circulation of these records seems nothing short of callous and cruel. In light of the trauma and fear of Jayne and Jerry that the children continue to experience, allowing the dissemination of these records can only be viewed as likely to compound their suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u201c[T]here exists in this state a strong public policy protective of the confidentiality of juvenile court records and proceedings.\u201d <em>(Foster </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 218, 228 [165 Cal.Rptr. 701].) The juvenile court has the authority to determine the extent to which its files are released and \u201chas the inherent right to control the time, place and manner of inspection.\u201d <em>(Lorenza P. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 607, 610-611 [242 Cal.Rptr. 877] [mother (accused of murdering her daughter) and mother\u2019s counsel can inspect child protective services documents concerning the victim and mother\u2019s other child]; T.N.G. v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 767, 778, 781 [94 Cal.Rptr. 813, 484 P.2d 981] [confidentiality protects juveniles from having to disclose their arrest and detention records to employers or other third parties]; <em>Wescott </em>v. <em>County of Yuba </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 103, 106-109 [163 Cal.Rptr. 385] [relying on T.N.G. v. <em>Superior Court, supra].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">In exercising its authority, the juvenile court must make the children\u2019s best interests its primary concern. <em>(San Bernardino County Dept, of Public Social Services </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 188, 207 [283 Cal.Rptr. 332] [section 346 authorizes juvenile court to admit press to dependency proceedings]; <em>In re Maria V. </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 1099, 1103 [213 Cal.Rptr. 73].) \u201c[T]he constitutionally protected public right of access to trials and pretrial proceedings in criminal cases does not extend to juvenile dependency proceedings.\u201d <em>(San Bernardino County Dept. of Public Social Services </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.3d at p. 192.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Here, the court\u2019s order that Jayne and Jerry not circulate confidential information was well within its authority and was aimed at protecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Tiffany and Tony. Jayne argues \u201cunless expressly prohibited by statute, or unless the publication prohibited by the court is of a nature to obstruct or embarrass the court in its administration of the law and the execution of its powers, the public has a right to know, discuss, and publish all judicial proceedings.\u201d Be that as it may, allowing Jayne and Jerry to circulate at will confidential documents in the juvenile court file would clearly undermine the court\u2019s efforts to protect the children and promote their best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Nor was the juvenile court\u2019s order an invalid prior restraint or a violation of Jerry\u2019s First Amendment rights. As he notes, the juvenile court lacks \u201cthe power to restrict the press\u2019s right to investigate and publish information which it has lawfully obtained.\u201d <em>(San Bernardino County Dept. of Public Social Services </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.3d at p. 206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Presumably, Jerry obtained from Jayne the juvenile court documents at issue here. Assuming this means he obtained them lawfully (a questionable assumption given the statute\u2019s language), it does not invalidate the nondissemination order. The order here in no way prohibits Jerry from expressing his views on the dependency proceeding to the grand jury or anyone else. It merely prevents him from circulating confidential documents which contain not Jerry\u2019s thoughts and expressions, but rather those of Tiffany and Tony, their therapist, the social workers, and the other professionals involved in caring for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Furthermore, even assuming the nondissemination order does in some way implicate Jerry\u2019s right to free speech, disclosure of the confidential materials infringes upon Tiffany\u2019s and Tony\u2019s constitutionally protected privacy right. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 1.) Jerry has failed to demonstrate an interest superior to that of the children. He does not deny that the grand jury can obtain any information it needs without his aid. Moreover, the order does not prevent Jerry from asking the grand jury to seek the information itself, nor does it prevent any persons authorized to receive confidential material from doing so. Finally, to the extent that Jerry seeks to refute \u201clies\u201d and to defend himself and Jayne, the order does not prevent him from doing so. It merely proscribes the dissemination of confidential juvenile court documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Jerry asserts the nondissemination order is overbroad because it prohibits disclosure to persons entitled to receive the confidential documents, such as law enforcement agencies and child abuse investigation teams. As Jerry has no right to receive the documents in the first place, he has no right to give them to anyone else, including persons statutorily authorized to receive the documents without his assistance. We also reject Jerry\u2019s claim the order was not narrowly drawn to protect Tiffany and Tony. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>As noted above, it cannot be gainsaid that Jayne and Jerry\u2019s circulation of confidential juvenile court documents harms the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Finally, Jerry maintains the nondisclosure order is void because state law preempts it. He argues while section 827, subdivision (b)(2) provides an intentional violation of the section\u2019s confidentiality provisions constitutes a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $500, the juvenile court attempted to make a violation of the section punishable by the greater penalty for contempt of court. Again we disagree. The punishment specified in section 827 is for violation of the section itself with no requirement of a prior court order. A violation of an order of the juvenile court, on the other hand, is clearly punishable as contempt In any case, even if the court here had erred in stating a violation of its order was punishable as contempt, this does not render the nondissemination order invalid. It merely limits the punishment available for violation of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in making the nondissemination order.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Todd, Acting P.
