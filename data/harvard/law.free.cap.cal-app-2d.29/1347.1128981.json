Haslam, for negligence and bad faith, Fireman\u2019s Fund settled with Miranda for $1,050,000 and cross-complained against Haslam for indemnity. In a special verdict, the jury held Haslam liable to Fireman\u2019s Fund for the full amount of this settlement. After Haslam\u2019s posttrial motions were denied, judgment was entered consistent with the jury\u2019s verdict. Haslam appeals, contending that (1) an insurer cannot state a cause of action for indemnity against an insurance broker for extracontractual damages paid in settlement of the insurer\u2019s bad faith claims; (2) even if an insurer can state such a cause of action, public policy considerations preclude application of this doctrine; (3) the trial court should have determined as a matter of law that Miranda\u2019s policy was terminated by mutual agreement rather than sending this issue to the jury; and (4) the court erred by admitting evidence of Haslam\u2019s insurance and of an opinion rendered by Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s counsel stating that Haslam was negligent. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">In January 1988, Joseph B. Miranda asked Rudy Honrado to insure an apartment building he owned on Woodward Street in San Francisco. Honrado was an insurance broker, but he only handled life and disability insurance. He approached appellant Edward J. Haslam, doing business as Edward J. Haslam Company, to obtain this insurance on Miranda\u2019s behalf. He told Haslam that Miranda wanted to insure the Woodward Street property. Haslam was an authorized agent of respondent Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company. Haslam filled out a Fireman\u2019s Fund application for insurance without describing the Woodward Street address as the insured property, but listing Miranda\u2019s mailing address on Capp Street in San Francisco. The Capp Street property was Miranda\u2019s residence and a rest home\u2014not an apartment building. Fireman\u2019s Fund issued a policy listing the Capp Street address as the insured property instead of the Woodward Street apartment building. Miranda made Ms first premium payment by check, noting the Woodward address on it. He regularly paid Ms premiums believing that Ms Woodward Street apartment building was insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In May 1988, Fireman\u2019s Fund conducted a routine loss control inspection of its insured property. The loss control report stated that the Capp Street property was not an apartment building as the insurance application had stated, but was a residence and rest home. Fireman\u2019s Fund treated the disparity between its report and Miranda\u2019s application as a misrepresentation. Accordingly, in June 1988, it instructed Haslam to return Miranda\u2019s policy for cancellation and to obtain replacement insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In August 1988\u2014two months after Fireman\u2019s Fund had issued its instructions to cancel the policy and obtain replacement insurance\u2014Haslam passed on these instructions to Honrado, who obtained Miranda\u2019s signature on a Haslam-prepared cancellation form on August 15. Miranda did not want to cancel Ms insurance, but signed the form because Honrado insisted. Miranda also dated the form in Ms handwriting under Ms signature. Honrado told Miranda that he had no more insurance as of that day. When Miranda signed the form, the space for the cancellation date was blank. When the form was returned to Haslam, an employee typed in the August 15 date.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Fireman\u2019s Fund cancelled the policy on August 15, 1988, but accepted two more montMy premiums from Miranda. At first, Miranda sought insurance coverage elsewhere. When he received another billing from Fireman\u2019s Fund, he believed that it had corrected its error and that the Woodward Street site was still insured. No replacement insurance was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">On September 27, 1988, a fire destroyed the Woodward Street apartment building. When Miranda made a claim on the policy, Haslam discovered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>address error on its application for insurance. On October 4, 1988, Haslam explained to Fireman\u2019s Fund that he had omitted the Woodward Street property address from the insurance application in error. He asked that Fireman\u2019s Fund reform the policy to conform to Miranda\u2019s expectations and pay his claim. However, Fireman\u2019s Fund denied coverage, stating that the policy had been cancelled before the loss was incurred. It refunded the two additional monthly premiums that Miranda paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">In August 1989, Miranda filed an action against Fireman\u2019s Fund, Haslam and Honrado for negligence, bad faith and related claims. He sought reformation of the contract, rescission of policy cancellation, as well as compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In December 1989, Haslam sought indemnity from Fireman\u2019s Fund, disclaiming any direct liability for Miranda\u2019s loss. By April 1990, Haslam, Honrado and Fireman\u2019s Fund had each cross-complained against the others for indemnity. In November 1991, Fireman\u2019s Fund discovered that Miranda had not filled in the date blank on the cancellation form, bringing the validity of the cancellation into question. In January 1992, Fireman\u2019s Fund settled with Miranda for $1,050,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In March 1992, Fireman\u2019s Fund filed its first amended cross-complaint against Haslam and Honrado, alleging causes of action for indemnity, fraud and deceit, negligence, fraud and negligence by a fiduciary, and breach of contract. Haslam\u2019s motions to exclude evidence of his malpractice insurance and of a Fireman\u2019s Fund attorney letter opining that Haslam was negligent were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Trial began in July 1992. Fireman\u2019s Fund brought out evidence that Haslam did not inspect the property before issuing the policy on behalf of Fireman\u2019s Fund. When the loss control investigation prompted Fireman\u2019s Fund to instruct Haslam to cancel the policy, Haslam did not investigate the matter, but merely instructed Honrado to obtain Miranda\u2019s signature on the cancellation form. Haslam expected that Honrado would check out these matters. Fireman\u2019s Fund also introduced evidence that Honrado\u2019s involvement in the policy application process constituted brokered business\u2014a practice which Haslam knew Fireman\u2019s Fund forbade. The jury also heard evidence that Haslam carried errors and omissions insurance\u2014a type of malpractice insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">The jury heard other evidence of the results of an attorney\u2019s investigation of the Miranda matter, prepared for Fireman\u2019s Fund. The attorney was assigned to assess the legal liabilities, responsibilities and obligations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>Fireman\u2019s Fund to Miranda before Fireman\u2019s Fund learned that the cancellation form might not be valid. She prepared an opinion letter, outlining her findings. She concluded that Haslam was negligent in not transmitting the correct address to Fireman\u2019s Fund. The jury was admonished that this evidence was admitted only for a limited puipose\u2014not as a legal conclusion, but to show that Fireman\u2019s Fund received this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">In the opinion letter, the attorney also concluded that a valid policy cancellation release from Miranda terminated the policy, ending any Fireman\u2019s Fund liability for Haslam\u2019s negligence. She relied on the August 1988 cancellation form to make this finding and recommended denial of the claim. She did not know that the date was not on the cancellation form at the time that Miranda signed it. If the cancellation was invalid, the policy would still be in force, she testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">At the close of Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s evidence, Haslam moved for a directed verdict on extracontractual damages\u2014the $800,000 portion of the settlement that was in excess of the $250,000 policy limit. The motion was denied. The trial court did grant his motion for directed verdict on the issue of punitive damages, declining to instruct the jury on this issue. It denied Haslam\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on causes of action for fraud and fraudulent breach of fiduciary duty, but granted Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s motion to dismiss these claims. In his defense, Haslam put on evidence that Fireman\u2019s Fund unilaterally and involuntarily cancelled Miranda\u2019s insurance in violation of statute; that Fireman\u2019s Fund should have reformed the policy once it learned of the error on the application; and that he had been within his rights to use Honrado as a broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In effect, Haslam urged that he was not at fault\u2014that Fireman\u2019s Fund incurred its extracontractual damages because it acted in bad faith by denying Miranda\u2019s claim. The insurer should have accepted his recommendation to reform Miranda\u2019s insurance policy and pay the claim. He also argued that the policy cancellation was involuntary and was not legally effective because Fireman\u2019s Fund did not comply with applicable statutory procedures. Haslam argued that he could not be held liable for the insurer\u2019s improper acts, while Fireman\u2019s Fund urged the jury to find that its denial of Miranda\u2019s claim was proximately caused by Haslam\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Ultimately, the jury\u2019s special verdict awarded Fireman\u2019s Fund $1,050,000 from Haslam. The jury found that Haslam was negligent when he incorrectly filled out Miranda\u2019s application for insurance, that Fireman\u2019s Fund was not negligent, and that Haslam\u2019s negligence was the legal cause of $250,000 damage to Fireman\u2019s Fund, the policy limits. The jury also found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>Haslam was liable for negligent misrepresentation for improperly executing the cancellation form and failing to advise Fireman\u2019s Fund of this fact. These acts, the jury found, caused the delay in payment of the Miranda claim and resulted in Fireman\u2019s Fund settling with Miranda for an additional $800,000. Haslam\u2019s request for stay of judgment was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Fireman\u2019s Fund moved for and obtained attorney fees and prejudgment interest from Haslam. Haslam moved for a new trial, judgment notwithstanding the verdict, remittitur, to vacate the judgment and to tax costs without success. Judgment for Fireman\u2019s Fund against Haslam was entered in December 1992.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">II. Indemnity</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">First, Haslam contends an insurer may not be permitted to obtain indemnification for payments made in settlement of bad faith claims. He argues that the issue of whether an insurance carrier may seek indemnity for its own bad faith exposure from an agent who was found to be negligent in a manner other than claims-handling is a question of law that should not have been submitted to the jury to decide. He seeks to overturn that portion of the judgment holding him liable to Fireman\u2019s Fund for $800,000 in extracontractual damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">At trial, Haslam raised these points on several occasions, in vain. The trial court noted that some of Haslam\u2019s arguments would have been persuasive if Fireman\u2019s Fund had cross-complained against him for bad faith, but because Fireman\u2019s Fund sought indemnity, it found those arguments distinguishable. In Haslam\u2019s posttrial motions, he again argued that Fireman\u2019s Fund was not legally entitled to indemnity for any extracontractual damages\u2014again, without success.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The common law equitable indemnity doctrine relates to the allocation of loss among multiple tortfeasors. <em>(American Motorcycle Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 578, 583, 592 [146 Cal.Rptr. 182, 578 P.2d 899] [joint tortfeasors].) The duty to indemnify may arise and indemnity may be allowed when in equity and good conscience the burden of a judgment should be lifted from a person seeking indemnity to one from whom indemnity is sought. The right depends on the principle that everyone is responsible for the consequences of his or her own wrong, and if others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>have been compelled to pay damages which ought to have been paid by the wrongdoer, they may recover from him or her. <em>(Herrero </em>v. <em>Atkinson </em>(1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 69, 74 [38 Cal.Rptr. 490, 8 A.L.R.3d 629]; see <em>American Motorcycle Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at p. 593; see also 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Torts, \u00a7 89, pp. 162-163.) Under the doctrine of equitable indemnity, one tortfeasor may obtain partial indemnity from another tortfeasor on a comparative fault basis. <em>(Far West Financial Corp. </em>v. <em>D &amp; S Co. </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 796, 805 [251 Cal.Rptr. 202, 760 P.2d 399]; see <em>American Motorcycle Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at pp. 591, 598, 608.) Thus, liability for the injury is borne by each individual tortfeasor in direct proportion to his or her respective fault. <em>(American Motorcycle Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at p. 598.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In our case, the jury was instructed that Fireman\u2019s Fund could recover on its cause of action for indemnity if the insurer had paid damages to Miranda, if Haslam was the legal cause of those damages, and if Fireman\u2019s Fund paid damages in excess of its own fault. The first amended cross-complaint alleged that Haslam acted negligently when he filled out the insurance application, when he failed to obtain replacement coverage and a valid cancellation of the policy, and when he remained silent about facts pertaining to the cancellation,  Although Haslam argues that Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s indemnity cause of action holds him liable for the insurer\u2019s bad faith, we are satisfied that Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s case, the trial court\u2019s instructions and the jury\u2019s verdict were all based on claims of Haslam\u2019s negligence and negligent misrepresentations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The first amended cross-complaint alleged that Haslam was Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s agent. When an insurance agent negligently induces its principal to assume coverage on which the principal then suffers a loss, the agent may be held liable for that loss. <em>(United States Liab. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Haidinger-Hayes, Inc. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 586, 594 [83 Cal.Rptr. 418, 463 P.2d 770]; <em>New Hampshire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sauer </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 454, 460 [147 Cal.Rptr. 879].) By analogy, an insurance company may recover damages paid in settlement of a delayed payment of an insured\u2019s claim incurred as a result of its agent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>negligent acts. Specifically, Fireman\u2019s Fund has a right to recover damages from Haslam for all sums paid to Miranda if a jury determines that its agent negligently failed to obtain replacement coverage, failed to obtain a properly executed cancellation form and negligently misrepresented facts pertaining to the cancellation to his principal\u2014if Fireman\u2019s Fund relied on those omissions and misrepresentations when it denied Miranda\u2019s initial claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s first amended cross-complaint properly pleads that agent Haslam is liable for all losses caused by his acts\u2014including damages paid by Fireman\u2019s Fund for the delay in paying the claim\u2014because Haslam\u2019s acts were the legal cause of the delay and no fault was attributed to Fireman\u2019s Fund. Fireman\u2019s Fund alleged that Haslam breached duties owed to it as Haslam\u2019s principal\u2014duties to exercise due care in filling out Miranda\u2019s insurance application and obtaining replacement coverage and a valid policy cancellation, as well as to accurately represent the facts of the cancellation to Fireman\u2019s Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The jury found Haslam liable to Fireman\u2019s Fund for both negligence and negligent misrepresentation. Haslam was held, liable for the losses sustained by Fireman\u2019s Fund under the policy as well as those damages paid as a result of the delay in paying Miranda\u2019s claim. The jury necessarily found that the settlement amount paid to Miranda was solely attributable to Haslam\u2019s breach of duty when it attributed 100 percent of those damages to Haslam. It also necessarily rejected Haslam\u2019s argument that Fireman\u2019s Fund had acted in bad faith. As such, the trial court properly entered judgment in favor of Fireman\u2019s Fund against Haslam for the full amount of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">III. Public Policy Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">In the alternative, Haslam contends that even if Fireman\u2019s Fund can state a cause of action for equitable indemnity, public policy considerations preclude application of this doctrine. He argues that it is against public policy to require him to indemnify Fireman\u2019s Fund because he owed no contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing to Miranda.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Amicus curiae National Association of Professional Insurance Agents filed a brief in support of Haslam\u2019s public policy argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">This argument is predicated on our acceptance of Haslam\u2019s underlying assumption that liability was imposed based on a breach of a duty that Haslam owed to Miranda not to act in bad faith. This, however, was not the basis of liability. The jury found, and substantial evidence supports the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>verdict, that Haslam was liable because he breached duties owed directly to his principal, Fireman\u2019s Fund, and that this breach of duty by the agent caused loss to the principal. (See pt. II., <em>ante.) </em>In short, Haslam\u2019s negligence caused Fireman\u2019s Fund damages for which Haslam, as agent, is liable to his principal. Thus, whether or not Haslam owed any additional or special duty to Miranda is irrelevant because it was not the breach of any such duty that formed the basis of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">IV., V.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Anderson, P. J., and Poch\u00e9, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 29, 1994, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied Feburary 16, 1995.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-9\">The jury also concluded that Honrado was not negligent and that Haslam was not entitled to any indemnification from him. Judgment was entered in Honrado\u2019s favor. Although Haslam\u2019s notice of appeal challenges Honrado\u2019s judgment, this aspect of the appeal has been abandoned. Thus, Honrado is no longer a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b540-6\">As part of the settlement of Miranda\u2019s claim against Fireman\u2019s Fund, Miranda assigned his rights in his action against Haslam to Fireman\u2019s Fund. Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s first amended cross-complaint alleged causes of action based on Haslam\u2019s breach of his duty to Fireman\u2019s Fund as well as to Miranda. However, the jury was not instructed on Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s right to assert any assigned claims, but was instructed that Fireman\u2019s Fund had the burden to establish that Haslam misrepresented facts to Fireman\u2019s Fund. The jury was also instructed that Haslam owed no duty of good faith to Miranda. Thus, we conclude that Fireman\u2019s Fund proceeded against Haslam on causes of action based on the broker\u2019s breach of duty owed directly to the insurer rather than pursuing the bad faith cause of action assigned to it by Miranda.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Haslam submitted a letter brief citing an unpublished decision of the United States District Court in support of this argument.
