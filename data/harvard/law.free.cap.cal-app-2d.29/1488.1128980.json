J.</author>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Plaintiff appeals from a judgment entered after the trial court determined, on a summary judgment motion, that plaintiff\u2019s attorney malpractice action was time barred. The applicable statute of limitations (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 340.6)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is tolled during that period \u201c[t]he attorney continues to represent the plaintiff regarding the specific subject matter in which the alleged wrongful act or omission occurred . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 340.6, subd. (a)(2).) In the court below, defendant asserted that his representation of plaintiff ceased, as a matter of law, more than one year before plaintiffs action was filed, as plaintiff lost confidence in him and consulted with another attorney. Plaintiff, on the other hand, claimed that defendant continued to represent her until 11 months before she filed suit. As the evidence presented at the summary judgment hearing discloses a triable issue of material fact regarding the date on which defendant\u2019s representation of plaintiff ended, summary judgment was not properly granted. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">II. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">In November 1982 plaintiff\u2019s mother executed a last will and testament, leaving her Morgan Hill home, which was essentially the whole of her estate, to plaintiff, Dorthia L. Worthington, \u201cfor the duration of her life or until she remarries, whichever occurs first, . . . with the remainder over to my children above-named who survive me at the time of my death. [Plaintiff] also has the power to sell the property prior to the expiration of her life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1492\">*1492</page-number>estate determinable upon terms and conditions acceptable to her. However, the net proceeds from the sale shall be divided equally among my children above-named who survive me at the time of my death.\u201d The will named plaintiff as executrix. Plaintiff\u2019s mother died on May 5, 1988, survived by six children.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">On May 7,1988, plaintiff retained attorney Ernest Rusconi<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to probate her mother\u2019s estate. Plaintiff alleges Rusconi \u201cput [his] interests ahead of [her] interests [] by recommending and advising that she would have to give up her life estate. [He] concealed from her at that time the fact that, by her giving up her life estate, [he] would make more money in probating the estate and secure a source of funds for the payment of [his] fees.\u201d As a result of Rusconi \u201ccausing] her to renounce her interest in the life estate,\u201d plaintiff alleges she was damaged in a sum in excess of $150,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The record on appeal shows that plaintiff, on January 26, 1989, signed a \u201cPartial Disclaimer of Interest in Realty\u201d that was filed in the Santa Clara County Superior Court on January 30, 1989.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The disclaimer, after describing the property, states: \u201cThe portion that I disclaim pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 275, et seq., California Probate Code, consists of my life estate in said realty, but I retain a term of one year only from the date of this instrument in this real property. ...[][] I retain the equal one-sixth (1/6) interest that I have with my brothers and sisters pursuant to said Paragraph Fifth of the will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Two months later, plaintiff signed an agreement with her siblings, essentially reiterating the provisions in the disclaimer of interest in realty. The agreement provided that plaintiff could live in the house rent free until it was sold or for one year, whichever occurred sooner, and would receive a one-sixth undivided interest in the property, in exchange for giving up her life estate in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Plaintiff continued to live in the Morgan Hill home through early 1991. At that time two of her siblings discovered that she had turned down a $300,000 offer on the home. They filed a petition for suspension of powers and removal of executrix and for appointment of a successor personal representative, pursuant to Probate Code section 8500. In response to these actions by her siblings, plaintiff sought out new counsel, Douglas Allen.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Rusconi states, in a declaration submitted in support of his summary judgment motion, that Allen called his office on or about March 14, 1991. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1493\">*1493</page-number>When Rusconi attempted to return the call, he was unable to reach Allen. He did talk to plaintiff, however. Furthermore, according to his declaration, \u201c[subsequent to March 14, 1991, [he] performed no legal services for plaintiff and had no further contact with her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">This last statement in Rusconi\u2019s declaration under penalty of perjury is flatly contradicted by a letter Rusconi sent to plaintiff on April 5, 1991.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the letter he makes no mention of a change of counsel. Instead, he suggests to plaintiff how they should proceed with the probate action, as follows: \u201cI have some new thoughts which I have not discussed with you, so will do so in this letter. I believe it would be a good idea to close the estate and distribute the property to the 7 heirs, so you are all joint owners. Then when you come to sell the house, you could sell directly without any court supervision or court proceedings. Since there is no money in the estate to pay your fees and my fees, we would get a note secured by a deed of trust on the property payable in two years or on sale of the property, whichever occurred sooner. We would ask the court to approve 10% interest on the note, which is the amount of interest that judgments bear. [][] By closing the estate, we would resolve the problems of the claims your brothers and sisters are making that you should be paying rent now. I believe we can justify not paying rent because of your duties to keep up the property for if vacant, even the fire insurance would be canceled, and also that it is to the benefit of all the heirs to not sell at a lower price for real estate prices are now beginning to move up. [f] In that connection, I have not heard from any realtor and am wondering if you have listed it again, and whether that realtor is showing the property. []Q Please give me your thoughts regarding this new proposal after you have had a chance to think it over. Please let me hear from you in about a week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">On May 1, 1991, plaintiff and her new attorney signed a substitution of attorneys form. Rusconi signed it the next day. The form was then filed in the probate court on May 14, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Eleven months later\u2014on April 2, 1992\u2014plaintiff filed the instant legal malpractice action against Rusconi and his firm. In depositions taken in connection with the malpractice lawsuit, plaintiff admitted that she sought alternate counsel because she was dissatisfied with the way Rusconi was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1494\">*1494</page-number>handling her case. She felt she \u201chad been misrepresented\u201d by him with respect to her \u201clifetime estate.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Rusconi moved for summary judgment, claiming that plaintiff\u2019s action was time barred pursuant to section 340.6. Although subdivision (a)(2) tolls the statute of limitations for the period the attorney continues to represent the client, Rusconi asserted his representation of plaintiff ceased when, on or about March 14, 1991, Attorney Allen called his office. Plaintiff argued in opposition to the motion that Rusconi\u2019s representation continued until May 14, 1991, when the formal substitution of attorney form was filed. The trial court found Rusconi\u2019s position to be the more persuasive and granted summary judgment. From the ensuing judgment, plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"A5N\">A. <em>Summary Judgment: Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Defendant Rusconi\u2019s contention that the granting of a summary judgment motion is \u201cleft to the sound discretion of the trial court\u201d and \u201cwill not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a clear showing of abuse of discretion\u201d is patently incorrect. (See <em>Barisich </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 12, 14-16 [275 Cal.Rptr. 331].) As this court explained in <em>AARTS Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crocker National Bank, </em>\u201c[s]ince a summary judgment motion raises only questions of law regarding the construction and effect of the supporting and opposing papers, we independently review them on appeal . . . .\u201d <em>(AARTS Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crocker National Bank </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 1061, 1064 [225 Cal.Rptr. 203].)</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The matter to be determined by the appellate court is \u201cwhether facts have been presented which give rise to a triable factual issue. The court may not pass upon the issue itself.\u201d <em>(Parker </em>v. <em>Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 176, 181 [89 Cal.Rptr. 737, 474 P.2d 689, 44 A.L.R.3d 615].) \u201cThe motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (\u00a7 437c, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">B. <em>Tolling of the Statute of Limitations: Continuing Representation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">The sole issue on appeal is whether Rusconi established as a matter of law that his representation of plaintiff ceased more than a year before she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1495\">*1495</page-number>filed suit. Relying primarily upon the Third District Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion in <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Caietti </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1165 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 837], Rusconi asserts that the malpractice limitations period commenced in this case no later than March 14, 1991, when plaintiff consulted another attorney after losing confidence in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">As noted earlier, section 340.6, subdivision (a)(2) tolls the attorney malpractice limitations period for as long as the attorney \u201ccontinues to represent the plaintiff regarding the specific subject matter in which the alleged wrongful act or omission occurred.\u201d The purpose of this \u201ccontinuous representation\u201d rule, the Supreme Court observed in <em>Laird </em>v. <em>Blacker </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 606 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 550, 828 P.2d 691], is to \u201c \u2018avoid the disruption of an attorney-client relationship by a lawsuit while enabling the attorney to correct or minimize an apparent error, and to prevent an attorney from defeating a malpractice cause of action by continuing to represent the client until the statutory period has expired.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 618, quoting Sen. Com. on Judiciary, 2d reading analysis of Assem. Bill No. 298 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 17, 1977.)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">In <em>Hensley, </em>the court determined that the question of representation should be viewed from the <em>client\u2019s </em>perspective. Once the client believes the relationship with his or her attorney is over and acts on that belief by hiring replacement counsel, the purpose of the tolling provision, which is to prevent disruption of the attorney-client relationship, is no longer served. Under these circumstances, the court held, \u201capplication of the tolling provision . . . should be applied no further.\u201d <em>(Hensley </em>v. <em>Caietti, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 1171.)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The facts in <em>Hensley </em>supported this finding. Defendant attorney represented plaintiff in a dissolution of marriage action. The attorney\u2019s alleged malpractice consisted of convincing plaintiff to enter into a marital settlement agreement that was not to her liking. After the terms of the stipulation were put on the record and the court examined the parties under oath, it approved the settlement agreement effective immediately and ordered defendant to prepare the judgment. When plaintiff met with defendant on November 3, 1989, to go over the judgment, she complained that she had not been aware of the terms recited in open court because of her husband\u2019s verbal abuse. Plaintiff and defendant then had a \u201cterrible argument,\u201d plaintiff refused to sign the judgment, and defendant yelled at her to get out of his office. Plaintiff considered the relationship over at that time, and hired replacement counsel within three days.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">The defendant attorney in <em>Hensley </em>argued that section 340.6, subdivision (a)(2) is a statutory embodiment of the \u201ccontinuous representation\" rule first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1496\">*1496</page-number>developed under New York common law and, hence, \u201cthe standard for termination of the attorney-client relationship under Code of Civil Procedure section 340.6, subdivision (a)(2)\u201d should be the same as the standard that has been used in various New York and Ohio cases. <em>(Hensley </em>v. <em>Caietti, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 1172.) The <em>Hensley </em>court agreed. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Under the \u201cNew York rule\u201d \u201c \u2018continuous representation\u2019 \u2019\u2019 lasts only so long as the attorney-client relationship is \u201c \u2018 \u201congoing, continuous, developing and dependent . . . , marked with trust and confidence,\u201d \u2019 \u201d and involves a \u201c \u2018 \u201ccontinuity of the professional services from which the alleged malpractice stems.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Hensley </em>v. <em>Caietti, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1171-1172, citing <em>Shapero </em>v. <em>Fliegel </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 842, 848 [236 Cal.Rptr. 696]; see also <em>Rubinstein </em>v. <em>Barnes </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 276, 283 [240 Cal.Rptr. 535]; <em>Gurkewitz </em>v. <em>Haberman </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 328, 333 [187 Cal.Rptr. 14].)</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The facts in <em>Hensley </em>were undisputed: the client stated that in her view, \u201cthe . . . relationship was over at the point of her acrimonious departure from Caietti\u2019s office.\u201d <em>(Hensley </em>v. <em>Caietti, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 1172.) By subsequently asking another attorney to represent her, the court found, she had acted \u201cunmistakably\u201d to end the relationship. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1173.) Thus, the purpose of the tolling provision\u2014to avoid unnecessarily disrupting the attorney-client relationship\u2014no longer applied. Accordingly, based on the facts of that case, the court held \u201cthat the question of representation should be viewed from the perspective of the client. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1172.)</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">However, while cases construing \u201cthe New York rule\u201d are helpful in our analysis of section 340.6, subdivision (a)(2), they are by no means binding. Ours is a statutory provision to which ordinary rules of statutory construction apply. In contrast, \u2018the continuous representation doctrines in New York and Ohio,\u201d the First District Court of Appeal recently observed in <em>O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>Tichy </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 114, 120 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 162], \u201cexist by virtue of common law rather than statute.\u201d According to one well-respected commentator, the New York rule was adopted as \u201ca direct reaction to the illogical requirement of the occurrence rule which compels the client to sue his attorney even though the relationship continues and there has not been and may never be any damage.\u201d (2 Mallen &amp; Smith, Legal Malpractice (3d ed. 1989) Statutes of Limitations, \u00a7 18.12, p. 115.)</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Hence, before we look to sister-state authorities construing common law continuous representation rules, we must first look to the statute itself. If the language of a statute is clear, its plain meaning should be followed. <em>(Great Lakes Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of El Segundo </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 152, 155 [137 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1497\">*1497</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 154, 561 P.2d 244].) \u201cWhen a statute is unambiguous, \u2018\u201cthere is no need for construction, and courts should not indulge in it.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>King </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 882, 887 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 723].) \u201cIn construing statutory provisions, a court may not speculate that the Legislature meant something other than what it said or rewrite a statute to make it express an intention not expressed therein.\u201d <em>(In re Jodi B. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1322, 1328 [278 Cal.Rptr. 242].)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Section 340.6, subdivision (a)(2) does not state that the statute of limitations is tolled so long as, from the client\u2019s perspective, \u201cthe attorney continues to represent [him or her] regarding the specific subject matter in which the alleged wrongful act or omission occurred.\u201d Neither, of course, does it state that the statute is tolled if, from the attorney\u2019s perspective, the representation has ceased. Rather, the statutory language requires an objective determination of whether the representation has ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">\u201cOrdinarily, an attorney\u2019s representation is not completed until the agreed tasks or events have occurred, the client consents to termination or a court grants an application by counsel for withdrawal.\u201d (2 Mallen &amp; Smith, Legal Malpractice, Statutes of Limitations, supra, \u00a7 18.12, p. 120.) \u201cThe rule is that, for purposes of the statute of limitations, the attorney\u2019s representation is concluded when the parties so agree, and that result does not depend upon formal termination, such as withdrawing as counsel of record.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>atp. 121; accord, <em>Shapero </em>v. <em>Fliegel, supra, </em>191 Cal.App.3d at p. 848 [the failure to formally withdraw as attorney of record, standing alone, will not toll the statute of limitations under the rubric of continued representation]; <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Caietti, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 1173 [\u201c[t]he period of tolling should not turn upon the fortuity of the time of delivery of notice of discharge to counsel . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Applying an objective standard to determine whether an attorney\u2019s representation has ended would have resulted in the same conclusion reached by the <em>Hensley </em>court in that case. The attorney there ordered the client out of his office, the client believed the relationship was over, and a new attorney was retained within three days. These objective criteria establish the mutual termination of the attorney-client relationship,  In the instant case, in contrast, the attorney-client relationship was not in obvious jeopardy. Although plaintiff admitted she had lost confidence and trust in her attorney by the time she first met with Mr. Allen, she did not manifest a desire to end Rusconi\u2019s representation of her at that point. Furthermore, \u201c\u2018trust and confidence,\u2019 \u201d while arguably part of the New York rule, \u201care not stated requirements of the continuous representation tolling provision of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1498\">*1498</page-number>340.6, subdivision (a)(2).\u201d <em>(O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>Tichy, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th at p. 120.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Continuity of representation ultimately depends, not on the client\u2019s subjective beliefs, but rather on evidence of an ongoing <em>mutual </em>relationship and of activities in furtherance of the relationship.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n                   Here plaintiff provided evidence of the ongoing nature of her attorney-client relationship with Rusconi\u2014his April 5, 1991, letter advising her how to proceed on the probate action. Although not every contact between an attorney and his or her client will amount to representation <em>(Gurkewitz </em>v. <em>Haberman, supra, </em>137 Cal.App.3d at p. 334),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the language Rusconi employed in his April 5th letter clearly manifested an ongoing mutual relationship and the giving of legal advice in furtherance of that relationship. Rusconi proposed, for example, \u201cWe would ask the court to approve 10% interest on the note . . . .\u201d He then suggests that by closing the estate, \u201cwe would resolve the . . . claims your brothers and sisters are making . . . .\u201d As her advocate, Rusconi opined, \u201cI believe we can justify not paying rent because . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In summary, we disagree with Rusconi\u2019s contention, based on <em>Hensley, </em>\u201cthat the attorney-client relationship ends when there is a lack of trust or confidence and a belief on the part of the client that the relationship has terminated.\u201d We believe that a better approach is to analyze the facts from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1499\">*1499</page-number>objective point of view. If this analysis discloses, as here, a triable issue of material fact, summary judgment may not be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed. Costs on appeal are awarded to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Elia, J., and Bamattre-Manoukian, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Respondents\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 25, 1995.
