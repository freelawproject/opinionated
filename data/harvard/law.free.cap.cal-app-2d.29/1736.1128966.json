Loche became an informal citizen informant working directly under Goudarzi. A personal relationship also developed. Prior to October 13, 1990, the two had sex on three or four occasions at Goudarzi\u2019s condominium, always while Goudarzi was off duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">Loche claimed that following a period of intimidation and coercion, Goudarzi performed acts of sexual battery upon her person on October 13, 1990. She filed a complaint against Goudarzi and the City alleging six causes of action: (1) battery; (2) civil rape; (3) rape by fear and fraud; (4) civil assault with the intent to commit rape and administering stupefying drugs with the intent to commit a felony; (5) negligence<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; and (6) punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">Goudarzi formally requested the City to defend him pursuant to section 995.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The City refused to provide this defense citing section 995.2, subdivision (a)(1) and (2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The POA provided Goudarzi\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1740\">*1740</page-number>Only the battery cause of action survived nonsuit motions. In the underlying action the jury rendered a general verdict<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that no battery was committed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The question of course and scope of employment was never reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Goudarzi and the POA brought this declaratory relief action under section 996.4 to recover their costs incurred defending the Loche action. Section 996.4 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-8\">\u201cIf after request a public entity fails or refuses to provide an employee or former employee with a defense against a civil action or proceeding brought against him and the employee retains his own counsel to defend the action or proceeding, he is entitled to recover from the public entity such reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, costs and expenses as are necessarily incurred by him in defending the action or proceeding if the <em>action or proceeding arose out of an act or omission in the scope of his employment </em>as an employee of the public entity, but he is not entitled to such reimbursement if the public entity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1741\">*1741</page-number>establishes (a) that he acted or failed to act because of actual fraud, corruption or malice, or (b) that the action or proceeding is one described in Section 995.4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-6\">\u201cNothing in this section shall be construed to deprive an employee or former employee of the right to petition for a writ of mandate to compel the public entity or the governing body or an employee thereof to perform the duties imposed by this part.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">During the bench trial, the court stated: \u201cJust a second, counsel. The Court is taking Judicial Notice of the record below. I told you that at the outset. You could rehash this if you want to, but I heard that and recall that and I base my decision upon that entirely.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">No transcript was ever prepared of the testimony adduced in the Loche jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">Goudarzi, the only witness called in this action, testified he was on vacation from October 1, 1990, through October 26, 1990, did not have his City car, but was subject to being called in at any time. He believed all his sexual encounters with Loche were strictly personal business and had nothing to do with his employment with the City. Every time Goudarzi had sex with Loche it was at Goudarzi\u2019s condominium while off duty. Goudarzi never threatened Loche.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">After the POA and Goudarzi rested, the City moved for a nonsuit. The motion was taken under submission. After the City rested, the court found Goudarzi was not acting within the \u201ccourse and scope\u201d of his employment on October 13, 1990, and entered judgment for the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">The City contends POA lacks standing, but cites no authority for their conclusion. Having paid for Goudarzi\u2019s defense in the Loche action, POA is the real party in interest here. We assume, without deciding, POA has standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b887-15\">The central issue is whether the Loche action arose out of an act or omission in the scope of Goudarzi\u2019s employment as a police officer within the meaning of section 996.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1742\">*1742</page-number>Ordinarily, scope of employment is a factual question. When the operable facts are undisputed, it becomes a question of law. <em>(Mary M. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 202, 213 [285 Cal.Rptr. 99, 814 P.2d 1341]; <em>White </em>v. <em>County of Orange </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 566, 570 [212 Cal.Rptr. 493].) Here, the facts in our limited record are undisputed. We therefore apply a de novo review.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">In <em>Alma W. </em>v. <em>Oakland Unified School Dist. </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 133, 139 [176 Cal.Rptr. 287], the court, quoting <em>Clark Equipment Co. </em>v. <em>Wheat </em>(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 503, 520 [154 Cal.Rptr. 874], stated: \u201c \u2018The determination as to whether an employee committed a tort during the course of his employment turns on whether or not: 1) the act performed was either required or \u2018incident to his duties,\u2019 or 2) the employee\u2019s misconduct could be reasonably foreseen by the employer in any event. . . .\u2019 . . .\u201d (Citations deleted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">This test was applied in <em>White </em>v. <em>County of Orange, supra, </em>166 Cal.App.3d 566, 571. In <em>White, </em>Loudermilk, a deputy sheriff, while on duty, in uniform, driving a marked patrol unit, stopped an automobile driven by White. Loudermilk placed White in his car and drove her around for several hours in secluded areas, all the while threatening her with rape and murder. The County of Orange moved for summary judgment claiming Loudermilk\u2019s actions were beyond the scope of employment as a matter of law. The motion was granted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">The Court of Appeal reversed, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-8\">\u201cOur decision turns on the interpretation of the term \u2018incident to his duties.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-9\">\u201cA police officer is entrusted with a great deal of authority. This authority distinguishes the situation here from the facts of <em>Alma W. </em>Unlike a school custodian, the police officer carries the authority of the law with him into the community. The officer is supplied with a conspicuous automobile, a badge and a gun to ensure immediate compliance with his directions. The officer\u2019s method of dealing with this authority is certainly incidental to his duties; indeed, it is an integral part of them. Here, unlike <em>Alma W., </em>the wrongful acts flowed from the very exercise of this authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-10\">\u201cIt follows that the employer/govemment must be responsible for acts done during the exercise of this authority. In <em>Clark Equipment Co. </em>v. <em>Wheat </em>(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 503 [154 Cal.Rptr. 874], the court, quoting the Restatement Second of Agency, stated: \u2018If the principal places the agent in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1743\">*1743</page-number>position to defraud, and the third person relies upon his apparent authority to make the representations, the principal is liable even though the agent was acting for his own purposes [citations]. The theory is that the agent[\u2019s] position facilitates the consummation of the fraud, in that from the point of view of the third person the transaction seems regular on its face and the agent appears to be acting in the ordinary course of the business confided to him. It is immaterial that the principal receives no benefits from the transaction. [Citation.]\u2019 <em>{Clark, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.3d 503, 521, italics deleted.)\u201d (166 Cal.App.3d at p. 571.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">A similar result was reached by the California Supreme Court in <em>Mary M. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 202. There, Sergeant Schroyer, an on-duty, uniformed police officer driving a marked patrol car, stopped Mary, who was driving home alone. After she failed a field sobriety test, Schroyer drove Mary to her home where he raped her. Schroyer threatened to take Mary to jail if she resisted. The court reasoned the police officer was in a unique position of authority. When he committed a sexual assault through misuse of his authority, the public employer must be held accountable. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 221.) Even tortious conduct that violates an employee\u2019s official duties or disregards the employer\u2019s express orders can be within the scope of employment. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 209.)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Justice Baxter, concurring in the judgment but not in the court\u2019s reasoning, notes the same rationale could apply equally to an off-duty, nonuniformed police officer who misuses official authority to commit misconduct. (54 Cal.3d at p. 241.)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">However, when an employee substantially deviates from his duties for personal purposes, the employee is not acting within the scope of employment. (54 Cal.3d at pp. 218-219.) Whether an employee substantially deviated, and, therefore, acted outside the scope of employment, requires an inquiry into whether the wrongful act was committed in the course of a series of acts of the agent which were authorized by the principal, not whether the act itself was authorized. The employee\u2019s conduct must be viewed as a whole. <em>{Perez </em>v. <em>Van Groningen &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 962, 970 [227 Cal.Rptr. 106, 719 P.2d 676]; <em>Mary M. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at pp. 218-219.)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">The <em>Mary M. </em>court reasoned Schroyer was acting within the scope of his employment when he detained Mary, had her perform a field sobriety test, and when he ordered her into his police car. Schroyer then misused his official authority by raping Mary and threatening to take her to jail if she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1744\">*1744</page-number>resisted. The court viewed the transaction as a whole in concluding the officer was acting within the scope of his employment when he raped Mary. (54 Cal.3d at p. 219.)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Goudarzi was not in the course of a series of authorized or official acts on the night in question, and we have no evidence of any misuse of official authority. Goudarzi was on vacation, at home, having sex with Loche on October 13, 1994. The only connections between the facts and Goudarzi\u2019s employment were that Loche was an informal informant and Goudarzi was a vacationing police officer subject to being called to duty. These circumstances do not bring their sex acts within the scope of Goudarzi\u2019s employment. We have no evidence Goudarzi misused his official authority to coerce Loche into their sexual relationship. Goudarzi, the only witness, testified he never threatened Loche and that their sex had nothing whatsoever to do with his employment as a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\"> POA and Goudarzi argue we should not focus only on the events of October 13. The alleged prior threats are the acts which would have made the sex wrongful. While this could be true, we have no evidence of any threats. POA and Goudarzi chose not to include a transcript of the testimony in the Loche action in the record. The allegations in Loche\u2019s verified complaint are not evidence and afford no proof acts occurred within the scope of Goudarzi\u2019s employment. Evidence Code section 140 provides: \u201c \u2018Evidence\u2019 means testimony, writings, material objects, or other things presented to the senses that are <em>offered to prove the existence or nonexistence of a fact.\u201d </em>Loche\u2019s verified complaint was never offered into evidence to prove the existence or nonexistence of any facts. Pleadings are merely formal allegations. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 420.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">POA and Goudarzi reason once the jury found against Loche, there was no basis left for a determination whether Goudarzi was acting within the scope of his employment. They maintain it is impossible to prove acts occurred within the scope of Goudarzi\u2019s employment in the face of the finding of no misconduct. Because of this alleged paradox, they invite us to interject insurance law concepts on the duty to defend into the statutory scheme. We are asked to determine the scope of employment issue based upon the allegations in the Loche complaint. No authority is cited for this method of implementing section 996.4, and we decline the invitation for such innovation. This court previously held the Government Code provides an adequate framework for the protection of an officer\u2019s defense interests when an issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1745\">*1745</page-number>exists as to whether an officer was acting within the course and scope of his employment. <em>(Laws </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 189, 199-200 [267 Cal.Rptr. 921].) We reaffirm that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">In a January 2, 1963, report, the California Law Revision Commission, proposing adoption of section 996.4, stated: \u201cA second remedy should, therefore, be available to the defendant when the public entity fails or refuses to defend him: He should be given a cause of action against the public entity to recover the reasonable expenses he necessarily incurs in defending the action or proceeding <em>if he establishes that the act or omission occurred in the scope of his public employment </em>and the public entity fails to establish that he was guilty of actual fraud, corruption or actual malice.\u201d[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] (Recommendation Relating to Sovereign Immunity, No. 4, Defense of Public Employees (Jan. 1963) 4 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1963) pp. 1305, 1308, italics added, fn. deleted.) The California Law Revision Commission\u2019s use of the word \u201coccurred\u201d indicates it envisions actual occurrences in the scope of public employment, not mere allegations of such occurrences. The commission was also aware of the potential availability of civil remedies such as malicious prosecution when unfounded proceedings are brought against public personnel. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1309.)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Section 996.4 simply provides no remedy for an officer who is sued for acts which, although alleged to be, were not within the scope of the officer\u2019s employment. Any desire for modification of section 996.4 should be directed to tiie Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">Kremer, P.
