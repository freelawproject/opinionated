Hunt (\u201cRespondent\u201d) was admitted to the Bar of the District of Columbia on November 1, 1999, and at all times relevant to this case, maintained a law office in Washington, D.C.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland (\u201cPetitioner\u201d), filed a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action against Respondent on February 27, 2015. Petitioner requested that this Court take appropriate disciplinary action against Respondent for violating the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) (Md. Rule 16-812) during his unauthorized representation of Jaimel Fatin Peace (\u201cMr. Peace\u201d) in the District Court. Petitioner alleged violations of MLRPC 1.1 (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), 1.4 (Communication), 5.5 (Unauthorized Practice of Law, Multijurisdictional Practice of Law), 8.1 (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters), and 8.4 (Misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">This Court, by an order dated March 17, 2015, transmitted the action to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, and designated the Honorable Albert W. Northrop (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law. On November 2, 2015, a hearing was held, and on November 25, 2015, the hearing judge issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. The hearing judge found that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 5.5(a) and (b), 8.1(a), and 8.4(a), (b), (c), and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">On March 4, 2016, we heard oral argument. For the reasons outlined below, we uphold the hearing judge\u2019s Find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>ings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and order that Respondent be suspended from the practice of law for 60 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">a. The hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The hearings judge\u2019s findings of fact, beginning with Respondent\u2019s representation of Mr. Peace, were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">On March 13, 2013, Jaimel Fatin Peace (\u201cMr. Peace\u201d) was arrested for possession of controlled dangerous substances (\u201cCDS\u201d) \u2014 not marijuana. On April 8, 2013, Respondent appeared on Mr. Peace\u2019s behalf for a preliminary hearing ... in the District Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Respondent represented Mr. Peace on a <em>pro bono </em>basis. During the April 8, 2013, hearing, Respondent filed a Motion to Dismiss on Mr. Peace\u2019s behalf as his attorney. Respondent\u2019s Motion to Dismiss did not contain a Certificate of Service. During the April 8, 2013, preliminary hearing, the court set Mr. Peace\u2019s criminal hearing for June 27, 2013. On or about June 11, 2013, Respondent filed a \u201cMotion to Withdraw as Counsel for Defendant\u201d in Mr. Peace\u2019s case. Respondent\u2019s Motion to Withdraw did not contain a Certificate of Service. On June 12, 2013, Respondent\u2019s Motion to Withdraw was denied because it did not have a Certificate of Service. Mr. Peace\u2019s criminal proceeding occurred on June 27, 2013. Although Respondent was still counsel of Record for Mr. Peace, he was not present during the June 27, 2013 hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">On July 2, 2013, the Honorable Thomas J. Love issued a Show Cause Order for Respondent to appear before him in court on August 29, 2013 due to Respondent\u2019s failure to appear at the June 27, 2013 hearing. Judge Love also rescheduled Mr. Peace\u2019s criminal hearing for August 29, 2013. On or about July 24, 2013, Respondent filed a Motion to request that the court dismiss the Show Cause order and grant his Motion to Withdraw from Mr. Peace\u2019s case. Respondent\u2019s Certificate of Service for his July 24, 2013 Motion listed Mr. Peace\u2019s address instead of opposing counsel\u2019s address. On or about August 6, 2013, the court denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Respondent\u2019s July 24, 2013 Motion. Respondent failed to appear at the Show Cause hearing scheduled on August 29, 2013.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\">On October 3, 2013, Judge Love filed a complaint with the Attorney Grievance Commission \u2014 Office of Bar Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">On December 13, 2013, Bar Counsel wrote to Respondent stating <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cIf you are not a Maryland Attorney, please advise this office whether you were admitted <em>pro hac vice </em>in the underlying matter of <em>State v. Jaimel Fatin Peace.\u201d </em>On February 4, 2014, Respondent sent Bar Counsel a response to its December 13, 2013 letter. Respondent stated in his February 4, 2014 letter: \u201cHowever, please be advised that I am not an attorney licensed in Maryland, but was being admitted <em>pro hac vice </em>in the underlying matter of <em>State v. Jaimel Fatin Peace </em>before Mr. Peace informed me that he [sic] longer wanted me to repr[e]sent him in the above-referenced matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">Respondent testified in his deposition for this matter that he contacted Maryland attorney Bruce Johnson, Esquire sometime during mid-2013 concerning Mr. Johnson sponsoring his <em>pro hac vice </em>admission to Maryland. However, Respondent failed to take any discernable steps to file a <em>pro hac vice </em>motion in Maryland before representing Mr. Peace.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az6\">Citations omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">b. The hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Based on the above findings of fact, the hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 5.5(a) and (b), 8.1(a), and 8.4(a), (b), (c), and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Rule 1.1</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">MLRPC 1.1 requires that \u201c[a] lawyer ... provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d The hearing judge concluded that \u201cRespondent\u2019s admitted ignorance of the Maryland Rules and repeated errors in filing his Motions violated [MLRPC] 1.1.\u201d The hearing judge ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>served that Respondent had filed motions lacking certificates of service, and failed to send the motions to opposing counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The hearing judge also noted that \u201cRespondent testified in his deposition that he believed his appearance in Mr. Peace\u2019s case had essentially been struck once he filed a Motion to Withdraw with the District Court.\u201d Respondent was obviously mistaken, and according to the hearing judge, Respondent had a duty to \u201ckeep abreast of changes in the law and its practice,\u201d <em>see </em>comment 6 to MLRPC 1.1, yet Respondent \u201chad little to no knowledge of the Maryland Rules because he was not admitted to the Maryland Bar.\u201d The hearing judge opined that \u201c[cjlaimed ignorance of ethical duties ... is not a defense in disciplinary proceedings.\u201d (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Rule 1.3</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">MLRPC 1.3 provides that \u201c[a] lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d The hearing judge concluded that, because the District Court denied Respondent\u2019s Motion to Withdraw as Counsel for Mr. Peace, Respondent violated MLRPC 1.3 by failing to attend the June 27, 2013 hearing. The hearing judge also concluded that MLRPC 1.3 was violated by Respondent\u2019s failure to attend the August 29, 2013, show cause hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Rule 1.4</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">MLRPC 1.4(a)(2) requires that a lawyer \u201ckeep [his] client reasonably informed about the status of the matter[.]\u201d The hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.4(a)(2) by not informing Mr. Peace that Respondent was still counsel of record on June 27, 2013, the day of Mr. Peace\u2019s criminal hearing. While Mr. Peace allegedly terminated Respondent\u2019s representation on April 8, 2013, Respondent remained counsel of record because the District Court denied his Motion to Withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Rule 5.5<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">MLRPC 5.5(a) prohibits an attorney from engaging in the practice of law \u201cin a jurisdiction in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction^]\u201d In determining \u201cwhether an individual has engaged in the practice of law, the focus of the inquiry should be on whether the activity in question required legal knowledge and skill in order to apply legal principles and precedent.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hallmon, </em>343 Md. 390, 397, 681 A.2d 510, 514 (1996). MLRPC 5.5(b)(2) provides that \u201c[a] lawyer who is not admitted to practice in this jurisdiction shall not ... hold out to the public or otherwise represent that the lawyer is admitted to practice law in this jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The hearing judge found that Respondent\u2019s representation of Mr. Peace required \u201clegal knowledge and skill[,]\u201d and was therefore prohibited by MLRPC 5.5(a). The hearing judge noted that the Motion to Dismiss filed on Mr. Peace\u2019s behalf argued \u201cthat there was no probable cause and that the State violated [Mr. Peace\u2019s] Fourth Amendment rights by illegally searching and seizing his property[.]\u201d According to the hearing judge, \u201cRespondent\u2019s motions [were] replete with legal arguments that an attorney, not a lay person, would normally argue.\u201d The hearing judge also observed that Respondent held himself out as an attorney when he checked a box marked \u201cattorney\u201d in his Motion to Dismiss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Rule 8.1(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">MLRPC 8.1(a) prohibits a lawyer from \u201cknowingly mak[ing] a false statement of material fact[]\u201d in connection with a disciplinary matter. The hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.1(a) by informing Bar Counsel that he was \u201cbeing admitted <em>pro hac vice </em>in the underlying matter of <em>State v. Jaimel Fatin Peace </em>[.]\u201d The hearing judge noted that \u201cRespondent never filed a <em>pro hac vice </em>motion in Mr. Peace\u2019s case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Rule 8.4</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">MLRPC 8.4 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[i]t is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">(a) violate or attempt to violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>duce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\">(b) commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">(e) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated each of the aforementioned subsections.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Regarding MLRPC 8.4(a), the hearing judge relied on the previously mentioned ethical violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Relative to MLRPC 8.4(b), the hearing judge noted that the unauthorized practice of law is prohibited by Md.Code (1989 Repl.Vol.2010), \u00a7 10-601(a) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article (\u201cBus. Occ. &amp; Prof.\u201d). Bus. Occ. and Prof. \u00a7 10-602 also prohibits a person not barred in Maryland from \u201crepresenting] to the public, by use of a title, including \u2018lawyer\u2019, \u2018attorney at law\u2019, or \u2018counselor at law\u2019, by description of services, methods, or procedures, or otherwise, that the person is authorized to practice law in the State.\u201d The hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated \u00a7 10-601(a) and \u00a7 10-602 by \u201crepresenting Mr. Peace at his preliminary hearing, filing motions on his behalf, and otherwise engaging in the unauthorized practice of law[.]\u201d Such violations are classified as misdemeanors, thus Respondent\u2019s representation of Mr. Peace was a criminal violation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Bus. Occ. and Prof. \u00a7 10-606.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Regarding MLRPC 8.4(c), the hearing judge found that Respondent\u2019s statement to Bar Counsel \u2014 that he was \u201cbeing admitted <em>pro hae vice </em>in the underlying matter of <em>State v. Jaimel Fatin Peace </em>\u201d \u2014 involved \u201cdishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d MLRPC 8.4(c). As discussed in the factual findings, Respondent never filed a <em>pro hac vice </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Concerning MLRPC 8.4(d), the hearing judge described conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">Behavior that may seriously impair public confidence in the entire profession, without extenuating circumstances, may be conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Childress, </em>860 Md. 378, 381, 758 A.2d 117, 121 (2000). An attorney\u2019s material misrepresentation to the client, his failure to act on the client\u2019s case for over three years and failure to expedite litigation, to the client\u2019s detriment, is conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. Failure to represent a client in an adequate manner and lying to a client constitute a violation of Rule 8.4(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">(quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. 209, 222, 892 A.2d 533, 540-41 (2006)). The hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by 1) failing to provide competent representation, 2) failing to appear for the show cause hearing, and 3) assuming that the Motions to Withdraw were granted, or failing to exercise due diligence in ascertaining their status.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Mitigating and Aggravating Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The hearing judge did not find any aggravating circumstances, and opined that there was \u201cno evidence ... to support any mitigating factors.\u201d Nonetheless, the hearing judge noted that Respondent was caring for his elderly mother in North Carolina for a portion of the summer of 2013. The hearing judge also observed that Respondent admitted the alleged violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">a. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">This Court must determine whether Bar Counsel proved the allegations in the disciplinary petition by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 16 \u2014 757(b). In doing so, \u201c[w]e accept a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact unless we determine that they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Edib, </em>415 Md. 696, 706, 4 A.3d 957, 964 (2010) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 50, 891 A.2d 1085, 1095 (2006)). Uncontested findings of fact may be accepted \u201cas conclusively established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707, 4 A.3d at 964 (citing Md. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A) (\u201cIf no exceptions are filed, the Court may treat the findings of fact as established ----\u201d)). However, \u201c \u2018[a]ll proposed conclusions of law by the hearing judge ... are subject to <em>de novo </em>review by this Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Thomas, </em>409 Md. 121, 147, 973 A.2d 185, 201 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">b. Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">Neither party noted exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law. Accordingly, we accept the findings of fact as established. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Good, </em>445 Md. 490, 513, 128 A.3d 54, 67 (2015) (noting that \u201cwe shall accept the hearing judge\u2019s \u2018findings of fact as established for the purpose of determining appropriate sanctions\u2019 \u201d where neither Petitioner nor Respondent noted any exceptions) (citing Md. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A)). In addition, having reviewed the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number><em>novo, </em>we agree that Petitioner demonstrated, by clear and convicting evidence, that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1,1.3, 1.4, 5.5(a) and (b), 8.1(a), and 8.4(a), (b), (c) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">c. This Court\u2019s sanction<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The purpose of this Court\u2019s sanction in an attorney discipline proceeding is to \u201cprotect the public rather than to punish the attorney .... \u201d <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Weiss, </em>389 Md. 531, 547, 886 A.2d 606, 615 (2005) (citations omitted). In furtherance of this goal, we impose a sanction that \u201cdemonstrates to members of the legal profession the type of conduct that will not be tolerated .... \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sperling, </em>380 Md. 180, 191, 844 A.2d 397, 404 (2004) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Myers, </em>333 Md. 440, 447, 635 A.2d 1315, 1318 (1994)). To determine the appropriate sanction, we consider the facts and circumstances of an individual case, \u201cthe nature of the ethical duties violated,\u201d and \u201cany aggravating or mitigating circumstances.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shephard, </em>444 Md. 299, 339, 119 A.3d 765, 788 (2015) (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Paul, </em>423 Md. 268, 284, 31 A.3d 512, 522 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Petitioner requests that this Court indefinitely suspend Respondent from the practice of law. According to Petitioner, Respondent\u2019s unauthorized practice of law (MLRPC 5.5), along with his misrepresentations to Bar Counsel and the District Court (MLRPC 8.1(a) and 8.4), warrant such a sanction. In contrast, Respondent proposes a 30 day suspension. In seeking their respective sanctions, both Petitioner and Respondent rely on <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harris-Smith, </em>356 Md. 72, 737 A.2d 567 (1999), where we imposed a 30 day suspension for the unauthorized practice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>law by a non-Maryland attorney, and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Barneys, </em>370 Md. 566, 805 A.2d 1040 (2002), where we imposed disbarment. However, as explained below, the misconduct in <em>Barneys </em>and the misconduct in <em>Harris-Smith </em>represent opposite ends of the unauthorized practice spectrum, with Respondent\u2019s conduct falling in between. Because Respondent\u2019s misconduct was not as egregious as that involved in <em>Barneys, </em>yet slightly more culpable than that involved in <em>Harris-Smith, </em>we shall suspend Respondent from the practice of law for 60 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harris-Smith, </em>Ms. Harris-Smith maintained a law office in Maryland, with several Maryland attorneys as partners. 356 Md. at 74, 737 A.2d at 568. However, Ms. Harris-Smith was only licensed to practice in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland and several out-of-state jurisdictions. <em>Id. </em>In violation of MLRPC 5.5(a), Ms. Harris-Smith performed screening interviews with potential Maryland clients who called her law office, and engaged in the practice of law by providing legal advice based on the facts presented. <em>Id. </em>at 77, 737 A.2d at 570; <em>see Hallmon, </em>343 Md. at 397, 681 A.2d at 514 (stating that, when determining whether an attorney engaged in the practice of law, \u201cthe focus of the inquiry should \u2018be on whether the activity in question required legal knowledge and skill in order to apply legal principles and precedent,\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted). Ms. Harris-Smith also violated MLRPC 5.5(b) by holding herself out as a Maryland attorney through her business card and radio advertisements, which \u201cfailed to disclose that her practice was limited to bankruptcy law and the [federal district court].\u201d <em>Harris-Smith, </em>356 Md. at 78, 737 A.2d at 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In imposing a sanction for Ms. Harris-Smith\u2019s unauthorized practice of law, we recognized several factors justifying a lesser sanction. We first observed that the hearing judge found in favor of Ms. Harris-Smith on the alleged violations of MLRPC 8.4(b) and (c) (Misconduct), which are \u201cserious violations going to the attorney\u2019s integrity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90, 737 A.2d at 577. We also observed that Ms. Harris-Smith made several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>attempts \u201cto practice within the limits of her admission to the bar of the federal district^]\u201d by referring clients requiring representation in Maryland state courts to her partners, appearing only on behalf of those clients with bankruptcy matters in federal district court, and by including her jurisdictional limitation on her law firm\u2019s letterhead. <em>Id. </em>at 78, 90, 737 A.2d at 570, 577. We reasoned that Ms. Harris-Smith\u2019s case was distinguishable from those where we imposed disbarment, because those cases presented \u201cpurely a territorial issue, with no federal <em>overlay\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., the Respondents in those cases was not barred in Maryland or the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. <em>Id. </em>at 91, 737 A.2d at 577 (discussing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harper, </em>356 Md. 53, 737 A.2d 557 (1999) and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. James, </em>353 Md. 681, 728 A.2d 697 (1999)). Lastly, regarding our goal of deterring future misconduct, we noted that Ms. Harris-Smith had dissolved her Maryland practice, and maintained an office in the District of Columbia where she was licensed to practice. <em>Id. </em>at 90-91, 737 A.2d at 577. We therefore imposed a 30 day suspension from the practice of law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 90, 737 A.2d at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Barneys, </em>also involving a non-Maryland attorney, stands in stark contrast to <em>Harris-Smith. </em>In that case, Mr. Barneys violated MLRPC 5.5(b) by establishing the \u201cLaw Offices of Bradford J. Barneys, P.C.\u201d in Maryland, and referencing his practice as such in his letterhead, business cards, and signage at his office. <em>Barneys, </em>370 Md. at 571, 805 A.2d at 1043. While Mr. Barneys\u2019 application to the Maryland Bar was pending, he also committed several violations of MLRPC 5.5(a) by representing five clients in the District Court, and the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. <em>Id. </em>at 572, 805 A.2d at 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>In addition to his unauthorized practice of law, Mr. Barneys made several false statements in violation of MLRPC 8.1(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWU\">[Mr. Barneys] made a false statement on his Petition for Admission to the Maryland Bar-representing that he practiced only in the District of Columbia, when he actually had an office in Maryland and was engaging in the unauthorized practice of law; [Mr. Barneys] told [Bar Counsel\u2019s] investigator that he had only one Maryland client; and [Mr. Barneys] entered his appearance, without special permission and while not a Maryland lawyer, ... and otherwise represented those clients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 574, 805 A.2d at 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">We also observed that Mr. Barneys violated MLRPC 8.4(b), (c), and (d), by making a material misrepresentation to a bail bonds company in securing the bond of one of his clients, and by being \u201cdeceitful and dishonest to the judges of the District and Circuit Courts of Prince George\u2019s County by entering his appearance on behalf of clients when he knew that he was not authorized to practice law in the state of Maryland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Regarding the bail bonds company, we noted that a Mr. Sanchez, Mr. Barneys\u2019 client, was detained on a $150,000 bond pending CDS violations. <em>Id. </em>at 572, 805 A.2d at 1043. To secure Mr. Sanchez\u2019s bond, Mr. Barneys proposed that Gates Bail Bonds \u201c \u2018accept an assignment of Mr. Sanchez\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation settlement proceeds,\u2019 \u201d and in return, post Mr. Sanchez\u2019s bond. <em>Id. </em>When an agent of Gates Bail Bonds agreed to this arrangement, \u201c[Mr. Barneys] provided a document titled \u2018Assignment of Settlement Proceeds,\u2019 which was signed by [Mr. Barneys] and purportedly Mr. Sanchez.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, Mr. Barneys did not represent Mr. Sanchez in the workers\u2019 compensation matter, and the attorney who did represent Mr. Sanchez was entirely unaware of this agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 572-73, 805 A.2d at 1043. As a result, the bail bonds company forfeited the posted bond because Mr. Sanchez received the settlement proceeds from the other attorney, and did not contact Gates Bail Bonds or appear for trial. <em>Id. </em>at 573, 805 A.2d at 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>In determining the appropriate sanction, we observed that Mr. Barneys\u2019 misconduct was distinguishable from <em>Harris-Smith. </em>First, we noted that Ms. Harris-Smith never represented a client in a Maryland court, whereas Mr. Barneys did so on at least five occasions. <em>Id. </em>at 589, 805 A.2d at 1053. Second, contrary to the federal overlay involved in <em>Harris-Smith, </em>there was no plausible reason why Mr. Barneys would have believed that he was permitted to establish a law office in Maryland. <em>Id. </em>Third, Ms. Harris-Smith had attempted to practice within her jurisdictional limits and \u201cceased to hold herself out as a Maryland attorney when she corresponded with the [her] firm\u2019s clients,\u201d because Ms. Harris-Smith\u2019s letterhead disclosed her jurisdictional limitation. <em>Id. </em>at 590, 805 A.2d at 1053. To the contrary, Mr. Barneys \u201cheld himself out as an authorized Maryland attorney by means of his business cards, his letterhead, and signs in the building immediately outside his office suite.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 590, 805 A.2d at 1053.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">We also discussed our sanctions in several attorney discipline matters involving the unauthorized practice of law\u2014 including <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harper, </em>356 Md. 53, 737 A.2d 557 (1999), and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Johnson, </em>363 Md. 598, 770 A.2d 130 (2001) \u2014 where we imposed disbarment. In <em>Harper, </em>we observed that Mr. Harper, a District of Columbia barred attorney, had engaged in \u201cdeliberate and persistent\u201d violations of MLRPC 5.5(a) by setting up a law office in Baltimore City \u201c \u2018to wring whatever value he could out of the inventory of pending cases of a disbarred lawyer____\u2019 \u201d <em>Barneys, </em>370 Md. at 584-85, 805 A.2d at 1050 (quoting <em>Harper, </em>356 Md. at 70, 737 A.2d at 566). We noted that Mr. Harper\u2019s motivation to establish this Baltimore law office was simply greed. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Harper, </em>356 Md. at 70, 737 A.2d at 566).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">We also discussed <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Johnson, </em>363 Md. 598, 770 A.2d 130 (2001), where Mr. Johnson was barred in the District of Columbia and Virginia, but established a Maryland law office with a partner who was barred in Maryland. <em>Barneys, </em>370 Md. at 585, 805 A.2d at 1050 (citing <em>Johnson, </em>363 Md. at 625, 770 A.2d at 146). We observed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Mr. Johnson met with and advised clients in his Maryland office, and misled the public and his clients by neglecting to include his jurisdictional limitations on his letterhead. <em>Id. </em>at 585, 805 A.2d at 1051 (citing <em>Johnson, </em>363 Md. at 631, 770 A.2d at 150). We also observed that Mr. Johnson violated MLRPC 8.4(a), (b), and (c) by forging the signatures of a Maryland couple on a bankruptcy petition, which he filed without the couple\u2019s knowledge. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Johnson, </em>363 Md. at 631, 770 A.2d at 150).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">We concluded that Mr. Barneys\u2019 conduct was most similar to those cases where we imposed disbarment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">Overall, our review of the unauthorized practice cases resulting in disbarment leads us to believe that they have more elements in common with [Mr. Barneys\u2019] case than does his case with <em>Harris-Smith. </em>For example, although Harper seemed to have represented many more clients than [Mr. Barneys], the cases share at least two common features. First, both attorneys held themselves out as admitted in Maryland, in violation of M[L]RPC 7.5.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] In fact, one of Harper\u2019s regular letterheads indicated his jurisdictional practice limitations, while none of [Mr. Barneys\u2019] letterheads did. Second, the description of the misconduct as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>\u201cdeliberate and persistent,\u201d relied on by this Court in <em>Harper </em>... and cited again in <em>Johnson, </em>appears to be an apt description of [Mr. Barneys\u2019] conduct, wrongfully representing five clients in Maryland state court proceedings and pretending to represent [Mr.] Sanchez in a workers\u2019 compensation matter when he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">[Mr. Barneys\u2019] conduct regarding Mr. Sanchez also highlights his deceptive tendencies, making his case like <em>Johnson, </em>where we found the attorney \u201crepeatedly engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation.\u201d Both Johnson and [Mr. Barneys] forged signatures of purported clients, and both caused significant damage to third parties; in [Mr. Barneys\u2019] case, the losses incurred by Gates Bail Bonds[ ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">In addition, whether the facts of a particular case sustain related or companion violations of M[L]RPC 8.4 seems also to be an influencing factor in our choice of sanction in at least some of the unauthorized practice cases under M[L]RPC 5.5(a). Specifically, in <em>Harris-Smith </em>we found that the attorney\u2019s conduct did not reach the level of a M[L]RPC 8.4 violation, which \u201cwould be [a] serious violation going to the attorney\u2019s integrity.\u201d By comparison, Harper was found in violation of M[L]RPC 8.4(b) and (d), and Johnson in violation of M[L]RPC 8.4(a), (c), and (d). Both were attorneys who, like [Mr. Barneys], had not been admitted in Maryland previously, and who, like [Mr. Barneys], undertook actual representation of clients in Maryland state court matters. Because [Mr. Barneys] violated M[L]RPC 8.4(b), (c), and (d), violations that are arguably more serious than in either <em>Harper </em>[] or <em>Johnson, </em>we should not shy away from disbarment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 591-92, <em>805 A.2d </em>at 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Turning to the case at bar, Respondent\u2019s misconduct is meaningfully distinguishable from the misconduct in <em>Barneys, </em>and in some ways, less egregious than the misconduct in <em>Harris-Smith. </em>First, Respondent\u2019s representation was isolated to one client in the District Court, whereas both Ms. Harris-Smith and Mr. Barneys regularly engaged in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>unauthorized practice of law. <em>Cf. Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Lawson, </em>401 Md. 536, 583, 933 A.2d 842, 869 (2007) (noting that an aggravating factor considered by this Court in imposing a sanction is \u201ca pattern of misconduct[.]\u201d). Second, Respondent never held himself out as a Maryland attorney through advertisements, business cards, stationery, or a Maryland law office, as was the case in both <em>Barneys </em>and <em>Harris-Smith. See Barneys, </em>370 Md. at 591, 805 A.2d at 1054 (2002) (noting that, in cases where this Court has imposed disbarment, the attorney held himself out as admitted to practice law in Maryland, in violation of MLRPC 7.5). Lastly, Respondent agreed to represent Mr. Peace <em>pro bono, </em>whereas both Mr. Barneys and Ms. Harris-Smith were deriving income from their unauthorized practice. <em>Cf. Harper, </em>356 Md. at 70, 737 A.2d at 566 (imposing disbarment where Mr. Harper\u2019s unauthorized practice was motivated by greed); <em>Lawson, </em>401 Md. at 585, 933 A.2d at 871 (noting that one of the mitigating factors this Court considers in imposing a sanction is the \u201cabsence of a dishonest or selfish motive[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Notwithstanding the limited nature of Respondent\u2019s unauthorized practice of law, Respondent\u2019s misconduct is also similar to <em>Barneys, </em>and more severe than <em>Harris-Smith </em>in several regards. Like <em>Barneys, </em>Respondent deliberately and willfully violated MLRPC 5.5(a) by appearing on behalf of a client in the District Court. <em>See Barneys, </em>370 Md. at 592, 805 A.2d at 1054 (noting that we have imposed disbarment where the attorney \u201cundertook actual representation of clients in Maryland state court matters.\u201d). Furthermore, contrary to <em>Harris-Smith, </em>there was no \u201cfederal overlay\u201d indicating that Respondent reasonably believed he was authorized to practice law in Maryland. <em>See Harris-Smith, </em>356 Md. at 91, 737 A.2d at 577 (remarking that the cases where we have imposed disbarment involved \u201cpurely a territorial issue, with no federal overlay\u201d). Lastly, like <em>Barneys, </em>Respondent was dishonest with Bar Counsel and the District Court, and committed a misdemeanor offense that reflected adversely on his honesty. MLRPC 8.1(a) and 8.4(b) and (c); <em>see </em>Bus. Occ. and Prof. \u00a7\u00a7 10-601 and 10-606 (making the unauthorized practice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>law a misdemeanor offense); <em>Barneys, </em>370 Md. at 592, 805 A.2d at 1054 (commenting on the relevance of an attendant MLRPC 8.4 violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Had Respondent engaged in an ongoing pattern of dishonest conduct like Mr. Barneys, this Court would be inclined to impose disbarment or indefinite suspension, as requested by Bar Counsel. <em>See Barneys, </em>370 Md. at 591, 805 A.2d at 1054 (noting that disbarment is appropriate where \u201cthe attorney repeatedly engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 418, 773 A.2d 463, 488 (2001) (\u201c[I]ntentional[ly] dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character[.]\u201d). However, the isolated nature of Respondent\u2019s unauthorized practice, and the <em>pro bono </em>nature of his representation, does not warrant such a sanction. Instead, a 60 day suspension from the practice of law will deter Respondent and other non-Maryland attorneys from practicing law in Maryland courts without authorization, notwithstanding that such representation was on a limited, <em>pro bono, </em>basis. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Thomas, </em>440 Md. 523, 556, 103 A.3d 629, 648 (2014) (noting that \u201cthe chief purpose of the sanction is to protect the public.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MD.
