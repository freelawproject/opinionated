The issue is queued up in this case, because Laura Schmidt, Respondent, wife of Stephen Sieglein, Petitioner, delivered a child through in vitro fertilization (IVF)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> using donated sperm.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Mr. Sieglein, who the Circuit Court found to be the father of the child, was also determined to have voluntarily impoverished himself with respect to child support, as well as had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>injunctive relief entered against him based on harassment. He asks us to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">1. Whether the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of Md.Code Ann. \u2018ET\u2019 \u00a7 1 \u2014 206(b) can be interpreted to include a case of \u201cin vitro\u201d fertilization from a donated egg and donated sperm, as a result of which Petitioner has been declared a \u201cparent\u201d of the child and thereby liable for child support, even though the child has no genetic connection to either of the parties?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">2. Whether the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of Md.Code Ann. \u2018FL\u2019 \u00a7 1 \u2014 203(a)(2) can be interpreted to sustain a permanent injunction against Petitioner on the basis of \u201charassment\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">3. Whether the long settled meaning of \u201cvoluntary impoverishment\u201d has been ignored by the decisions of the Courts below?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-8\"><em>Seiglein v. Schmidt, </em>445 Md. 487, 128 A.3d 51 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">We shall hold that the term \u201cartificial insemination\u201d in Section 1 \u2014 206(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article encompasses in vitro fertilization utilizing donated sperm. We shall further hold that the Circuit Court Judge did not err in finding that Mr. Sieglein voluntarily impoverished himself nor in granting Ms. Schmidt\u2019s request for a permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">The facts of this case are, for the most part, undisputed. Stephen Sieglein and Laura Schmidt were married in 2008 in Havre de Grace, Maryland and resided together in Abingdon until 2012. Prior to the marriage, Mr. Sieglein had one biological child, an adult, from a previous relationship, as did Ms. Schmidt. After the birth of his child Mr. Sieglein had undergone a vasectomy. Although Ms. Schmidt desired to have another child, Mr. Sieglein refused to have his vasectomy reversed. He did, however, accompany Ms. Schmidt to the Shady Grove Fertility Reproductive Science Center (\u201cShady Grove\u201d) as well as support the process of obtaining medical assistance to conceive a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">Both Ms. Schmidt and Mr. Sieglein signed an \u201cAssisted Reproduction: In Vitro Fertilization, Intraeytoplasmic Sperm Injection, Assisted Hatching, and Embryo Freezing Consent\u201d form in January of 2010. The form required both parties to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>indicate which \u201celements of the IVF treatment you agree to undertake in your upcoming TVF treatment cycle.\u201d Ms. Schmidt and Mr. Sieglein agreed to undertake In Vitro Fertilization,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Assisted Hatching <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Embryo Cryopreservation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Additionally, they both acknowledged by signature that they had been \u201cfully advised of the purpose, risk and benefits\u201d of the procedures to which they consented and were participating \u201cfree from pressure and coercion\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-4\"><em>JfWe </em>have been <em>fully advised of the purpose, risks and benefits of each of the procedures indicated above, </em>as well as Assisted Reproduction generally, and have been informed of the available alternatives and risks and benefits of such alternatives. This information has been supplemented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>my/our consultation with my/our medical team. I/We have had the opportunity to ask questions and all my/our questions have been answered to my/our satisfaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">I/We have read the Assisted Reproduction document in its entirety and have had ample time to reach my/our decision, <em>free from pressure and coercion, </em>and agree to proceed with my/our participation in Assisted Reproduction services as stated above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">A son was bom in 2012; his birth certificate listed Ms. Schmidt under the section for the mother\u2019s name and Mr. Sieglein under the section for the father\u2019s name. The parties separated shortly thereafter, however, and Ms. Schmidt filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Harford County for a limited divorce on the grounds of cruelty and vicious conduct against her and her children, as well based upon voluntary separation; she also requested child support. Mr. Sieglein generally denied the allegations of the complaint as well as that he was the father of the boy; he, thereafter, filed a motion requesting that the court determine \u201cwhether or not [he was] a \u2018parent\u2019 as that term is employed and understood under Maryland law, so as to obligate him under [Ms. Schmidt\u2019s] claim for child support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">A hearing on Mr. Sieglein\u2019s motion and Ms. Schmidt\u2019s request for child support was held in the fall of 2012. Judge William Carr of the Circuit Court for Harford County issued a memorandum opinion and order in which he found that Mr. Sieglein was the parent of the child and, therefore, was obligated to pay child support:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">[T]he Estates and Trusts Article unequivocally states that a child conceived via the artificial insemination of a married woman with the consent of her husband is the legitimate child of both spouses. Additionally, \u00a7 l-206(b) creates a presumption that a husband consented to the IVF process. * <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-10\">The facts the Defendant brings forth may demonstrate that he did not want to be a parent, but they do not rebut the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>presumption of consent to the IVF Treatment, and they do not show that he did not consent to creating a child. The Defendant married the Plaintiff in 2008. When the Plaintiff expressed a desire to have a child, the Defendant accompanied her to a fertility clinic to explore the IVF process, and they both signed the consent forms for the IVF treatment. The Defendant remained in the marital home with the Plaintiff throughout the pregnancy, and his name appears on the child\u2019s birth certif\u00edcate as the father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">[T]he presumption in \u00a7 1 \u2014 206(b) is that the Defendant consented to the artificial insemination process, making the child the legitimate child of the Defendant.... [He] jointly engaged in efforts with the Plaintiff to create a child, and it is in the best interest of the child to receive support and care from both parents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">(internal citations omitted). The court did not, however, determine the amount of the child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The parties appeared in December of 2012 before Judge Angela Eaves of the Circuit Court for Harford County for a <em>pendente lite </em>hearing on custody, visitation and child support. Prior to the hearing, Ms. Schmidt filed an amended complaint for limited divorce in which she sought sole legal custody of the boy, child support and injunctive relief under Section 1-203(a)(2) of the Family Law Article, which provides for the issuance of an injunction to \u201cprotect any party to the action from physical harm or harassment.\u201d Maryland Code (1974, 2012 Repl.Vol.), Section 1-203(a)(2) of the Family Law Article. In support of her amended complaint, Ms. Schmidt relied on a protective order issued by the District Court of Maryland for Harford County that ordered Mr. Sieglein to vacate the family home, to cease harassment of Ms. Schmidt, to refrain from contacting Ms. Schmidt and to stay away from her place of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">During the December 2012 hearing, Mr. Sieglein attempted to re-litigate the issue of parentage and iterated that he did not seek custody or visitation. Judge Eaves, however, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>dined to revisit the issue of paternity, stating that Judge Carr had previously addressed that issue, having determined that Mr. Sieglein was one of the boy\u2019s parents. Judge Eaves, however, did make a determination that Mr. Sieglein, who was unemployed at the time of the hearing, had voluntarily impoverished himself,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> based upon a number of factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">I am making a finding that he is voluntarily impoverished, first stating that he is not going to support [the child] in any way; second, from then having other assets and resources at his disposal that he has chosen to use only for his benefit, but not necessarily even in a way that\u2019s financially prudent. He has a renter that left ... [h]e has that property available. He has a mortgage of $800, but he chooses to then spend $350 a month to live elsewhere ... In this case, also the fact that he took out \u2014 used funds from the money market account in order to only pay his own living expenses and not pay anything towards the child\u2019s expenses[.] Even though he could incur a penalty for early withdrawals of the IRA account, he still has some ability there, but he has chosen not to undertake any responsibility whatsoever with respect to this child[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Mr. Sieglein\u2019s potential income became the focal point of the child support calculation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In January of 2013 sole physical and legal custody of the boy was granted to Ms. Schmidt, while Mr. Sieglein was ordered to pay monthly child support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>of $1049.00, An additional $100.00 per month was ordered to reduce Mr. Sieglein\u2019s child support arrearage of $7,171.00, covering the period from May 2012 to December 2012,</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Ms. Schmidt was granted an absolute divorce in 2013. A final hearing to determine child support and to address her request for injunctive relief was held in February of 2014. At the hearing, Mr. Sieglein testified that he was a college graduate, had been an employee of Sysco Food Services until resigning in 2012 and was unemployed from mid November 2012 until December of 2013. He acknowledged that he was the former husband of Ms. Schmidt and had recently started working as a driver for a frozen food delivery service. Mr. Sieglein also testified that while unemployed he received unemployment benefits and additional income from a rental property he owned prior to the marriage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Mr. Sieglein urged he had not voluntarily impoverished himself, but proffered evidence of his search for employment through copies of forms logging efforts to find work during his period of unemployment. Upon cross-examination, Mr. Sieglein admitted to making 90 contacts during his twelve-month term of unemployment, several of which were repeated. He also testified that he had been employed for eight days in August 2013 as a trainee with Business Machines, but that his position was terminated after he had requested that the company enter a later start date to enable him to continue to receive unemployment because of unpaid training time.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Ms. Schmidt testified in support of her request for a permanent injunction to protect her from physical harm or harassment. She recounted several instances of Mr. Sieglein\u2019s circling around her, getting in line near her and approaching and intimidating her at the church attended by both of them, in violation of the protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Eaves determined, after considering Mr. Sieglein\u2019s physical condition, education, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>employment changes, relationship to Ms. Schmidt, efforts to find and retain employment and past work history, that Mr. Sieglein had voluntarily impoverished himself, she stated that, \u201cThere is an effort to not \u2014 to not maintain employment to the extent that he was employed with Sysco ... a pattern of Mr. Sieglein not wanting to pay child support in this case for a child already determined to be his.\u201d She then calculated a child support payment from Mr. Sieglein to Ms. Schmidt of $1,007.00 monthly on behalf of the boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">With respect to Ms. Schmidt\u2019s request for a permanent injunction, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">[Mr. Sieglein\u2019s] credibility suffers with this Court. The manner in which he testifies, his ability only to recall events favorable to him in this case and the fact that he is less than honest in his dealings with respect to Ms. Schmidt____ Circling around her when he knows she is present ... There is a protective order in place. Getting in line behind her when you know it is her means that you walk away because there is a protective order in place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-10\">I do think [Mr. Sieglein] is playing fast and loose with the Court\u2019s order in this matter and accordingly, I\u2019m going to order him to stay 75 yards away from [Ms. Schmidt] and the children and to have no contact. No contact means not in person, by telephone, in writing or through third-parties in this case. And that will extend past the duration of the current protective order that is in effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">Mr. Sieglein appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed in a reported opinion, <em>Sieglein v. Schmidt, </em>224 Md.App. 222, 227, 120 A.3d 790, 793 (2015).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court, review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ing Section 1-206(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article, held that \u201ca child conceived via artificial insemination or IVF with the consent of the parties and born during a marriage is the legitimate child of the marriage and legal parentage is established as to both spouses\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 243, 120 A.3d at 802, because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZB\">By enacting ET \u00a7 l-206(b), the General Assembly evinced its intention to acknowledge the role of medically assisted, non-traditional conception of a child in establishing a parent\u2019s rights and obligations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 242, 120 A.3d at 802. The court further concluded that the circuit court had not abused its discretion in granting a permanent injunction to Ms. Schmidt nor in finding Mr. Sieglein had voluntarily impoverished himself. <em>Sieglein, </em>224 Md.App. at 246-52, 120 A.3d at 805-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The threshold question before us involves our interpretation of the term \u201cartificial insemination\u201d in Section 1-206(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">(a) A child born or conceived during a marriage is presumed to be the legitimate child of both spouses. Except as provided in \u00a7 1-207 of this subtitle, a child born at any time after his parents have participated in a marriage ceremony with each other, even if the marriage is invalid, is presumed to be the legitimate child of both parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">(b) A child conceived by <em>artificial insemination </em>of a married woman with the consent of her husband is the legitimate child of both of them for all purposes. Consent of the husband is presumed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">Maryland Code (1974, 2011 Repl.Vol.) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We have often articulated the process of statutory interpretation as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">In statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules. We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory. Further, an interpretation should be given to the statutory provisions that does not lead to absurd consequences. If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends. If, however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, or when the terms are ambiguous when it is part of a larger statutory scheme, it is ambiguous, and we endeavor to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-5\"><em>Anderson v. Council of Unit Owners of Gables on Tuckerman Condominium, </em>404 Md. 560, 571-72, 948 A.2d 11, 18-19 (2008) (internal citations omitted) (internal quotation omitted). Thus, our initial inquiry is whether the term \u201cartificial insemination\u201d in Section 1-206(b) is clear and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Mr. Sieglein argues that the term \u201cartificial insemination\u201d has a plain meaning that refers to only one procedure, specifically, that being intrauterine insemination.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He argues that in vitro fertilization, the procedure utilized in the present case, should be excluded from the definition because it was not a procedure known about in 1969, when the provisions of Section 1 \u2014 206(b) were introduced into our statutory scheme. Ms. Schmidt argues, conversely, that the term \u201cartificial insemination\u201d relates to any \u201cmedical process\u201d used to aid the woman in becoming pregnant \u201cwithout sexual intercourse,\u201d as currently reflected not only in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, www.merriam-webster.com,http://www.merriam-webster.com/ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>dictionary/artificial% 20insemination (https://perma.cc/ZT6DVCDY), but also in Magill\u2019s Medical Guide, Magill\u2019s Medical Guide 231 (6th ed. Salem Health 2011), in which \u201cartificial insemination\u201d is under the collective heading of \u201cAssisted Reproductive Technology.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The term \u201cartificial insemination\u201d is not defined anywhere in the Maryland Annotated Code. Past and present dictionary definitions abound regarding the term, in addition to Merriam-Webster\u2019s definition and the Magill Medical Guide. The 1961 edition of Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defined the term as the \u201cintroduction of semen into the uterus or oviduct by other than natural means.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary Unabridged, 124 (1961). \u201cInseminate\u201d in 1961 included two definitions; \u201cto sow or sow in\u201d and \u201cto introduce semen into (the female genital tract) by coitus or by other means.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary Unabridged, 1168 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Black\u2019s Medical Dictionary has provided that, \u201cArtificial insemination is the introduction of semen into the vagina by artificial means.\u201d Black\u2019s Medical Dictionary, 65 (26th ed. 1965). Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary defines \u201cartificial insemination\u201d as the \u201cintroduction of semen into the vagina other than by coitus.\u201d Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary, 982 (28th ed. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">In 1965, Black\u2019s Medical Dictionary, 65 (26th ed. 1965), recognized, \u201cThere are two forms of artificial insemination: AIH and AID. In AIH ... the semen is obtained from the husband. In AID ... the semen is obtained from a man other than the woman\u2019s husband.\u201d <em>See also </em>Ausman &amp; Snyder\u2019s Medical Library, Lawyer\u2019s Edition, \u00a7 1:32 (1988) (Homologous Insemination refers to the use of the husband\u2019s sperm while Heterologous Insemination deals with the use of donated sperm). In addition, multiple techniques for introducing the sperm into the woman also have existed; intrafollicular, intraperitoneal, intratubal and intrauterine.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>The term \u201cartificial insemination\u201d, thus, had and continues to have a number of meanings, generally related to artificial reproduction. Though one meaning referred specifically to the placement of sperm in a woman\u2019s body, the term has sometimes been used more broadly to refer to assisted reproduction. As a result, Mr. Sieglein\u2019s contention that artificial insemination has a plain meaning which referred only to one specific reproductive technique is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Rather, by reference to the legislative history of Section 1-206(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article we can glean its legislative intent. The Section was added in 1969 to Article 93 entitled \u201cDecedent\u2019s Estates\u201d, Chapter 3 of the Maryland Laws of 1969, in order to address the effect on legitimacy of the use of donated sperm.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Report of the Commission to Review and Revise the Testamentary Law of Maryland (\u201cGovernor\u2019s Commission\u201d) commented on the addition of Section 1-206(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">Subsection (b) is new. It is derived from 2-lll(b) (UPC). The Commission feels that this addition is desirable in view of the increased use of artificial insemination and the lack of any statute or case law on the subject in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Second Report of the Governor\u2019s Commission to Review and Revise the Testamentary Law of Maryland, Article 93 Decedent\u2019s Estates 8 (Dec. 5, 1968). Although the Report did not define the term \u201cartificial insemination\u201d, its reference to \u201c2-111(b) (UPC)\u201d was to the 1967 draft of the Uniform Probate Code (\u201cDraft UPC\u201d), which proposed language for \u201cLegitimacy; Effect of Illegitimacy on Intestate Succession.\u201d Third Working Draft Uniform Probate Code With Comments, Na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>tional Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, 70-71 (Nov. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Section 2-111(b) of the Draft UPC provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">Any child conceived following artificial insemination of a married woman with the consent of her husband shall be treated as their child for all purposes of intestate succession; consent of the husband is presumed unless the contrary is shown by clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 70. The Comment to that Section stated that, \u201c[the] section [was] designed to reflect the modem policy toward minimizing illegitimacy and its impact on inheritance rights, but with safeguards against abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 71. The Governor\u2019s Commission rewrote Section 2-11(b) using \u201cindigenous\u201d Maryland language, but closely followed the ideas expressed. The Uniform Probate Council, <em>Maryland Follows Uniform Probate Code, </em>4 Real Prop. Prob. <em>&amp; </em>Tr. J. 253 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">By 1967, concern about the implications of the use of donated sperm in artificial insemination had arisen from a growing awareness that donated sperm separated the husband from the child, biologically, and raised the specter that the child could be regarded as illegitimate, as well as the wife as an adulteress.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Allen D. Holloway, <em>Artificial Insemination: An Examination of the Legal Aspects, </em>43 A.B.A.J. 1089, 1090 (1957) (\u201cThe second type of artificial insemination \u2014 using the semen of a donor \u2014 is the one which poses the grave questions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">One of the \u201cgrave questions\u201d was whether the injection of a third-party donor\u2019s semen into a married woman could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>viewed as an act of adultery, as suggested in a Canadian case, <em>Orford v. Orford, </em>58 D.L.R. 251 (1921), involving a child born to a woman who claimed to have been artificially inseminated while apart from her husband. <em>Id. </em>at 1091. Although the court did not believe the child was the result of artificial insemination, but, rather, was due to the woman\u2019s infidelity, the court opined, \u201cSexual intercourse [with a man not her husband] is adulterous because in the case of the woman it involves the possibility of introducing into the family of the husband a false strain of blood. Any act on the part of the wife which does that would therefore be adulterous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1092. Condemnation of adultery, historically, thus, stemmed from its introduction of \u201cspurious heirs\u201d into the family, thereby redirecting the inheritance away from the husband\u2019s biologic children to those of a third party.

As a result of the introduction of the \u201cfalse strain of blood\u201d, the child could be deemed as illegitimate, unable to inherit from the husband\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Adultery, and the injection of \u201cbad blood\u201d into the family, uprooted the long-held presumption that a child born during the marriage was legitimate, as the biologic offspring of the wife and her husband. <em>See </em>C. Thomas Dienes, <em>Artificial Donor Insemination: Perspectives on Legal and Social Change, </em>54 Iowa L.Rev. 253, 279 (1968) (\u201cIt is universally recognized that a child born in wedlock is presumed legitimate.\u201d); Smith, 67 Mich. L.Rev. at 140 (\u201cThe presumption of a child\u2019s legitimacy is grounded in the English common-law concept that an offspring is deemed legitimate.\u201d). The presumption of legitimacy would be overcome, however, by a showing that the husband was impotent or absent at a time when conception could have occurred. Smith, 67 Mich. L.Rev. at 140. Proof that the wife was impregnated by artificial insemination with donor sperm, then, could overcome the presumption of legitimacy of a child born during a marriage.

Commentators in the period immediately before the passage of Section 1 \u2014 206(b), moreover, noted that \u201cartificial insemination\u201d was not an uncommon occurrence, as \u201cit has been estimated that between 10,000 and 250,000 issue of artificial insemination live in the United States today [1968-69]. A.I.D. has, in fact, become so prevalent in this country that it is big business!\u201d Smith, 67 Mich. L.Rev. at 133; <em>see also </em>Dienes, 54 Iowa L.Rev. at 255 (\u201cEstimates generally average about 150,000 living Americans born through AID, although some suggest the number may run to several hundred thousand.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Commentary also included reflection on the use of donated sperm in -artificial insemination, raising again the issue of adultery and questions regarding consent by a husband in order to legitimize the child and facilitate his or her inheritance rights. <em>See </em>Robert T. Jewett, <em>The Legal Consequences of Artificial Insemination in New York, </em>19 Syracuse L.Rev. 1009, 1010 (1968) (\u201cIt is the introduction of the semen of a third party donor in the AID process which creates most of the legal difficulties^]\u201d). One commentator, noting that \u201c[t]he trend [in 1965] [was] to narrow rather than enlarge the area in which children are labeled illegitimate[,]\u201d argued that children born through artificial insemination with donated sperm and the consent of the husband should not be \u201cstigmatized\u201d with illegitimacy, particularly if the husband\u2019s name was registered as the father. Elliott L. Biskind, <em>Legitimacy of Children Born by Artificial Insemination, </em>5 J. Fam. L. 39, 43 (1965). Others advocated for the introduction of a statutory solution to address the \u201cproblem [ ] raised by the expanding utilization and acceptance of artificial insemination\u201d. Harry D. Krause, <em>Bringing the Bastard into the Great Society </em>\u2014 A <em>Proposed Uniform Act on Legitimacy, </em>44 Tex. L.Rev. 829, 845 (1966); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number><em>see also </em>Smith, 67 Mich. L.Rev. at 143 (commenting on the unfortunate failure of proposals attempting to legalize the use of artificial insemination with donated sperm).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">As artificial reproduction developed and expanded to include in vitro fertilization, the same concerns regarding the use of donated sperm continued to be raised in the literature. <em>See </em>Emily McAllister, <em>Defining the Parent-Child Relationship in an Age of Reproductive Technology\u201d Implications for Inheritance, </em>29 Real Prop. Prob. <em>&amp; </em>Tr. J. 55 (1994); Helene S. Shapo, <em>Matters of Life and Death: Inheritance Consequences of Reproductive Technologies, </em>25 Hofstra L.Rev. 1093 (1997). In IVF, the sperm is combined with mature eggs in a lab, and one or more fertilized eggs (embryos) may be introduced into the woman\u2019s uterus a few days later. American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, http://www.acog.org/Patients/ FAQs/Treating-Infertility (https://perma.cc/5KEG-Y6GQ).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Section 1-206(b) originated in the midst of concerns regarding the effect of the use of donated sperm in artificial reproduction on legitimacy and inheritance, rather than on whether a specific reproductive technique was used. Clearly, the statute engendered a statutory consent by a husband to legitimize a child bom as a result of donated sperm, rather than as an emphasis on reproductive technique. This conclusion was presciently echoed by Emily McAllister in her discussion of early statutes confronting the use of artificial insemination, including Maryland\u2019s Section 1-206(b), when she stated, \u201cThere is a strong case for construing \u2018artificial insemination,\u2019 as used in [the Maryland statute], as encompassing other methods of assisted conception.\u201d McAllister, 29 Real Prop. Prob. &amp; Tr. J. at 69. The basis for her conclusion rested in the conceptual similarity between artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization when donated semen is used; \u201cthe only \u201cnoteworthy difference between IVF ... on the one hand and AID on the other is the fertilization site.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">As a result, we construe Section 1-206(b) to preserve the legitimacy of a child conceived through the use of donated sperm during an artificial reproductive technique, other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>surrogacy,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> provided the husband consents to the procedure. The term \u201cartificial insemination,\u201d then, in Section 1 \u2014 206(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article encompasses in vitro fertilization, the reproductive technique used in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Mr. Sieglein further asserts, in support of his position that he is not the legal parent of the child and should not be obligated to pay child support, that <em>In re Roberto d.B., </em>399 Md. 267, 923 A.2d 115 (2007), established that the proper test to be applied in determining parentage is whether the parent is genetically related to the child, which he is not. Mr. Sieglein also points to our holding in <em>Knill v. Knill, </em>306 Md. 527, 510 A.2d 546 (1986), in which we determined that a husband, whose wife had had a child by another man during the marriage yet treated the child as his own for twelve years, was not estopped from denying a duty to support the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\"><em>In re Roberto d.B. </em>involved a situation in which an unmarried father provided sperm that was combined with donated eggs and implanted into a gestational surrogate who was not the donor of the eggs nor married to the father. The process resulted in the birth of twins, and the surrogate\u2019s name was entered on the children\u2019s birth certificates. Neither the father nor the gestational surrogate wanted her name to appear on the birth certificate as the child\u2019s mother, as no relationship was intended between the children and the surrogate. The circuit court ruled that a trial court did not have the power to remove the surrogate\u2019s name and that it would not be in the children\u2019s best interests were it to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The primary issue before us, then, was whether the gestational surrogate\u2019s name could be removed from the children\u2019s birth certificates as mother under Section 5-1002 of the Family Law Article, part of the paternity statute, which was enacted to provide support for children \u201cborn out of wedlock.\u201d 399 Md. at 279, 923 A.2d at 122, quoting Section 5-1002 of the Family Law Article. The paternity statute, however, provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>only that a declaration of paternity could be set aside, without reference to the maternity of the woman who bore the child. Section 5-1038 of the Family Law Article provided, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a declaration of paternity in an order is final.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">(2)(i) A declaration of paternity may be modified or set aside:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">2. if a blood or genetic test done in accordance with \u00a7 5-1029 of this subtitle establishes the exclusion of the individual named as the father in the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">Maryland Code (2012 Repl.Vol.), Section 5-1038 of the Family Law Article. \u201cThus, the court has the power to declare that an alleged father has no paternal status when no genetic connection is found.\u201d 399 Md. at 277, 923 A.2d at 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">After establishing that under Maryland law a trial court was, in fact, authorized to order the removal of the mother\u2019s name from a birth certif\u00edcate, we permitted the gestational surrogate\u2019s name to be removed, because we interpreted the statute to \u201cextend the same rights to women and maternity as it applies ... to men and paternity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284, 923 A.2d at 125. While we acknowledged that, based on the language of the statute,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cthe Legislature did not contemplate anything outside of traditional childbirth____ [and] [t]he statute does not provide for ... a situation where children are conceived using an assisted reproductive technology,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 279, 923 A.2d at 122, we \u201cconstrued the statute to apply equally to both males and females.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283, 923 A.2d at 124-25. As such, under the applicable terms of the statute, the gestational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>surrogate could challenge the imposition of maternity on the basis of not having a biological connection to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">While Section 5-1038 provides a mechanism for the exclusion of a father, as well as a gestational mother, as a parent, Section 1-206(b), in play in the present case, specifies that the child born of artificial insemination <em>is </em>the legitimate child of both the mother and the husband when the husband, such as Mr. Sieglein, has consented to the artificial reproduction procedure and the child was born during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Mr. Sieglein also relies on <em>Knill, </em>306 Md. at 527, 510 A.2d at 546, in which a husband denied, during a divorce action, his obligation to support a boy, born during the marriage, but who was not his biologic child. The husband provided financial support for the boy until his wife sued for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">At the divorce hearing, the husband argued that he had no obligation to support the boy, because his relationship with the child was solely based on a voluntary act on his part, rather than a legal obligation. The trial court concluded that the husband was equitably estopped from denying his obligation to support the child. The husband appealed, and we issued a writ of certiorari before argument in the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">We noted that Section 5 \u2014 203(b)(1) of the Family Law Article provides that, \u201cThe parents of a minor child are jointly and severally responsible for the child\u2019s support----\u201d <em>Id., </em>306 Md. at 531, 510 A.2d at 548, quoting Maryland Code (1984), Section 5-203(b)(1) of the Family Law Article. \u201c[PJarents of a minor child\u201d in the statute referred to natural and adoptive parents. <em>Id., </em>citing Maryland Code (1984), Section 5-308(b) of the Family Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">We concluded that the evidence presented at trial did not support the inference that the wife had foregone her opportunity to seek child support from the natural father as a result of the husband\u2019s voluntary support and that the wife could still bring a paternity action against the natural father. Thus, \u201cwe believe[d] that [the husband] should not be penalized for his conduct under the circumstances as described[, and] ... [held] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>that [the husband was] not equitably estopped to deny a duty to support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539, 510 A.2d at 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">In the present case, the boy born during Mr. Sieglein\u2019s and Ms. Schmidt\u2019s marriage resulted from an artificial insemination procedure to which Mr. Sieglein consented. Unlike <em>Knill, </em>where the child was born as a result of the wife\u2019s infidelity and voluntarily supported by the husband, Mr. Sieglein consented to the use of artificial insemination and, under Section 1 \u2014 206(b), is the father of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Because we have determined that Mr. Sieglein is the father of the child under Section 1-206(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article, we now turn to the other two questions he presents. Mr. Sieglein first contends that the Circuit Court ignored the traditional meaning of \u201cvoluntary impoverishment\u201d when it found he had voluntarily impoverished himself, and based the child support payment on his potential income.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Section 12-204(b) of the Family Law Article provides for imputation of \u201cpotential\u201d income when the \u201cparent is voluntarily impoverished,\u201d but does not define voluntary impoverishment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Review of the legislative history in 1989 of Senate Bill 49 indicates that the term \u201cvoluntarily impoverished\u201d in the final version of Section 12-204(b) replaced earlier proposed language of \u201cvoluntarily unemployed or underemployed.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>We had acknowledged the importance of earning capacity-two decades earlier in <em>Pet v. Pet, </em>238 Md. 492, 497, 209 A.2d 572, 574 (1965), in an alimony context: \u201cThe rule of this Court ... is that an award of alimony is to be based on the earning capacity and financial worth of the husband at the time of trial.\u201d We expanded the notion to child support payments in <em>Chalkley v. Chalkley, </em>240 Md. 743, 744, 215 A.2d 807, 808 (1966) (\u201cOrdinarily, the awarding of alimony and support should be based on the earning capacity and financial worth of the husband and father and the circumstances of the wife and children as of the time of the award.\u201d). As a seminal matter, therefore, inclusion of the term \u201cvoluntarily impoverished\u201d anticipated voluntary unemployment or underemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Within a few years after the enactment of the statute, the Court of Special Appeals, in <em>Goldberger v. Goldberger, </em>96 Md.App. 313, 327, 624 A.2d 1328, 1335, <em>cert. denied, </em>332 Md. 453, 632 A.2d 150 (1993), recognized voluntary impoverishment as rendering oneself voluntarily without adequate resources:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">[A] parent shall be considered \u201cvoluntarily impoverished\u201d whenever the parent has made the free and conscious choice, not compelled by factors beyond his or her control, to render himself or herself without adequate resources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The court\u2019s characterization of voluntary impoverishment was based partly on the fact that it recognized that the issue had arisen most often when \u201ca parent reduce[d] his or her level of income to avoid paying support by quitting, retiring, or changing jobs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326, 624 A.2d at 1335. The traditional notion of voluntary impoverishment, thus, contemplated whether a parent had intentionally acted to reduce their income in an effort to minimize, or eliminate, their child support obligation. <em>Id. </em>at 327, 624 A.2d at 1335. To aid in its determination of whether a parent had freely and voluntary impoverished himself, the intermediate appellate court in <em>Goldberger </em>reiterated the factors to be considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">1. his or her current physical condition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-9\">2. his or her respective level of education;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>3. the timing of any change in employment or financial circumstances relative to the divorce proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\">4. the relationship of the parties prior to the divorce proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">5; his or her efforts to find and retain employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">6. his or her efforts to secure retraining if that is needed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">7. whether he or she has ever withheld support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-8\">8. his or her past work history;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-9\">9. the area in which the parties live and the status of the job market there; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-10\">10. any other considerations presented by either party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">In <em>Wills v. Jones, </em>340 Md. 480, 485, 667 A.2d 331, 333 (1995), we recognized that \u201c[t]he meaning of \u2018voluntary impoverishment\u2019 [in Section 12-204(b) had] not been previously addressed by this Court,\u201d but we determined that whether a parent is \u201cvoluntarily impoverished,\u201d under the traditional notion as expressed in <em>Goldberger, </em>requires the court to \u201cinquire as to the parent\u2019s motivations and intentions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489, 667 A.2d at 335. We also recognized in <em>Wills </em>that the pivotal issue was whether the parent had voluntarily impoverished himself, not whether he had done so in order to avoid child support:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-13\">In determining whether a parent is voluntarily impoverished, the question is whether a parent\u2019s impoverishment is voluntary, not whether the parent has voluntarily avoided paying child support. The parent\u2019s intention regarding support payments, therefore, is irrelevant. It is true that parents who impoverish themselves \u201cwith the intention of avoiding child support ... obligations\u201d are voluntarily impoverished. But, as the court recognized in <em>Goldberger ... </em>a parent who has become impoverished by choice is \u201cvoluntarily impoverished\u201d regardless of the parent\u2019s intent regarding his or her child support obligations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">340 Md. at 494, 667 A.2d at 338 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Unlike what Mr. Sieglein alleges, in the present case the circuit court judge applied the traditional notion of voluntary impoverishment when she utilized the <em>Goldberger </em>factors in order to determine whether Mr. Sieglein was avoiding employment or was underemployed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">[T]he Court has to consider the individual\u2019s current physical condition, prospective level of education, the timing of any change in employment for financial circumstances relative to the proceedings, the relationship of the parties prior to the proceedings, efforts to find an retain employment, efforts to secure retraining, if that is needed, whether they have ever withheld support, any relevant past work history, the areas in which the parties live, and the status of the job market and any other considerations presented by either party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnT\">Judge Eaves specifically found that Mr. Sieglein was in good health and that nothing precluded him from being employed. The Judge also noted that he had sufficient education to work in a managerial capacity. Characterizing the relationship between Mr. Sieglein and Ms. Schmidt as acrimonious, the Judge stated that \u201c[n]either one wants to have anything to do with the other.\u201d Regarding Mr. Sieglein\u2019s efforts to find and retain employment to the extent he had been employed with Sysco, the Judge concluded that his effort was insufficient. Although he had made efforts at finding employment, Judge Eaves determined that his repetitive contact with the same employers over a short period of time and his attempt to have Business Machines postdate the start of his employment constituted a lack of effort based upon his own actions. The Judge further explained that the area in which the parties lived and the job market overall were not a problem in this case. Mr. Sieglein\u2019s work history indicated that he had been steadily employed for 12 years with Sysco, and the testimony provided no reason for him to have left that position. Based upon its findings, the Circuit Court found Mr. Sieglein to be voluntarily impoverished and imputed an income of $4,052.00 per month, which we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">We finally turn to the issue of whether Section 1-203(a) of the Family Law Article supports the Circuit Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>issuance of a permanent injunction to Ms. Schmidt against Mr. Sieglein for \u201charassment.\u201d Section l-203(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-4\">(a) In an action for alimony, annulment, or divorce, an equity court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">(1) has all the powers of a court of equity; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">(2) may issue an injunction to protect any party to the action from physical harm or <em>harassment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Maryland Code (2012 Repl.Vol.), Section 1-203 of the Family Law Article (emphasis added). We \u201creview a trial court\u2019s determination to grant or deny injunctive relief for an abuse of discretion because trial courts, sitting as courts of equity, are granted broad discretionary authority to issue equitable relief.\u201d <em>State Com\u2019n on Human Relations v. Talbot County Detention Center, </em>370 Md. 115, 127, 803 A.2d 527, 534 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Mr. Sieglein asserts that the circuit court\u2019s grant of the permanent injunction by its February 2014 order was improper based on the evidence presented, even when taken in a light most favorable to Ms. Schmidt and, therefore, was an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. He posits that the allegations of harassment made by Ms. Schmidt amounted only to \u201cbare assertions of unrelated happenstance encounters\u201d and did not meet the requisite threshold for an injunction. In support, Mr. Sieglein points to the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion in <em>Cote v. Cote, </em>89 Md.App. 729, 735, 599 A.2d 869, 872 (1992), in which the court affirmed the entry of an interlocutory injunction barring the husband from the marital home, based on the risk of \u201cirreparable injury\u201d to the wife should the injunction be denied, a risk Mr. Sieglein contends is not present in this case. Mr. Sieglein bolsters his argument against the permanent injunction by referring to a comment included in <em>Cote </em>to the effect that: \u201cThe trial judge stated that the injunction would \u2018remain in full force and effect until further Order of the Court.\u2019 Therein lies our concern. This injunction has been in force well over a year and no further order of the court has been forthcoming.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739, 599 A.2d at 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Section 1-203(a) of the Family Law Article finds its origins in Section 3-603(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Article. Maryland Code (1974, 1977 Supp.). Section 3-603(b) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-4\">A court of equity sitting in an action for divorce, alimony, or annulment, in addition to exercising all the powers of a court of equity, may issue an injunction to protect any party to the action from physical harm or harassment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Maryland Code (1974, 1977 Supp.). We had occasion to review Section 3-603(b) shortly after it was enacted and the trial court\u2019s authority to issue an injunction. <em>Winston v. Winston, </em>290 Md. 641, 431 A.2d 1330 (1981). In <em>Winston, </em>we reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of an injunction, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">... [T]he General Assembly was unambiguously endowing the equity court sitting in divorce, alimony and annulment proceedings with all the general powers normally exercised by that court in other matters. In addition, the enactment specifies that this authority is extended so as to encompass the right to enjoin a party in domestic relations proceedings from physically harming or harassing another party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 648, 431 A.2d at 1333.

In that case, the husband filed for divorce and, on the same day, the wife filed a petition for a protective order citing domestic violence, which was granted after a hearing and barred the husband from entering the family home. <em>Id. </em>at 731, 599 A.2d at 870. Shortly thereafter, the wife moved for an <em>ex parte </em>injunction to bar her husband from the home. Evidence introduced at the hearing for the injunction indicated harassment from both parties, which included \u201cgoing into each other\u2019s cars, going to each other\u2019s residences, and making harassing telephone calls.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732, 599 A.2d at 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">The Court of Special Appeals, citing two elements necessary for injunctive relief \u2014 irreparable injury from a denial of the injunction and retention of the court\u2019s ability to grant relief in the divorce action \u2014 determined that \u201ca risk of irreparable injury that could occur, namely, future physical abuse of and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>by both parties\u201d was present and that \u201cthe injunction prevented both parties from going to or entering each other\u2019s residences; it in no way compromised the court\u2019s ability to grant complete relief in the divorce action.\u201d <em>Cote, </em>89 Md.App. at 735, 599 A.2d at 872. As such, the intermediate appellate court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion when it issued the injunction barring the husband from the home. <em>Id. </em>at 737, 599 A.2d at 873. The concern of the court regarding the length of the injunction in <em>Cote </em>has no bearing on the present case in which a permanent injunction was appropriately entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<judges id=\"b703-6\">WATTS, J., concurs.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-10\">.

I would not hold, however, that Md.Code Ann., Est. <em>&amp; </em>Trusts (1974, 2011 Repl.Vol.) (\u201cET\u201d) \u00a7 1-206(b)\u2019s reference to \u201cartificial insemination\u201d includes the circumstance where a child is conceived through in vitro fertilization (\u201cIVF\u201d) using a donated egg and donated sperm, <em>ie., </em>that artificial insemination includes IVF. I think that the Court need not make this determination. Instead, I would hold that ET \u00a7 l~206(a) applies to the circumstances of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>case, and that an individual may be declared a parent pursuant to ET \u00a7 1-206(a) where a child is conceived during the marriage, and with the consent of both parties, through IVF using a donated egg and donated sperm, and where the individual has failed to present good cause sufficient to rebut the statutory presumption of legitimacy. Rather than judicially interpreting ET \u00a7 1-206(b)\u2019s definition of artificial insemination, I would commend the matter to the General Assembly to determine whether ET \u00a7 1 \u2014 206(b), a statute that was enacted before the existence of IVF, should be amended in light of numerous advances in reproductive medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">As an initial matter, I would conclude that, because this case involves a child who was bom during Sieglein\u2019s and Schmidt\u2019s marriage, the statutes in Subtitle 10 (Paternity Proceedings) of Title 5 (Children) of the Family Law Article do not apply. As Md.Code Ann., Fam. Law (1984, 2012 Repl.Vol.) (\u201cFL\u201d) \u00a7 5-1002(b) makes clear, the purpose of Subtitle 10 is, among other things, \u201cto promote the general welfare and best interests of children born out of wedlock\u201d and \u201cto impose on the mothers and fathers of children bom out of wedlock the basic obligations and responsibilities of parenthood[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>See also Evans v. Wilson, </em>382 Md. 614, 634, 856 A.2d 679, 691 (2004) (\u201c[O]ne of the purposes of the paternity act is to promote the general welfare and best interests of children born <em>out of wedlock.\u201d </em>(Citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original)). In any event, even within Subtitle 10 is a presumption of legitimacy. Specifically, FL \u00a7 5-1027(c)(1) provides: \u201cThere is a rebuttable presumption that the child is the legitimate child of the man to whom its mother was married at the time of conception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Rather, because the child was born during the marriage, ET \u00a7 1-206 applies. This Court has explained that \u201can action to establish paternity is more appropriately brought under the Estates <em>&amp; </em>Trusts Article when the child at issue has been born during a marriage.\u201d <em>Evans, </em>382 Md. at 627-28, 856 A.2d at 687 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, \u201cwhere a child is presumed legitimate^] and where two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>men each acknowledge paternity of that child, the procedure for considering the issue of paternity under the Estates and Trusts Article is preferable because it presents the more satisfactory and less traumatic means of establishing paternity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628, 856 A.2d at 687 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). To be sure, this is not a case in which two men are claiming paternity of a child born during a marriage. However, because the child was born during the marriage and not out of wedlock, I would conclude as an initial matter that ET \u00a7 1-206 is the statute that governs in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">ET \u00a7 1-206, concerning the presumption of legitimacy, provides, in its entirety, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">(a) Marriage of parents. \u2014 A child born or conceived during a marriage is presumed to be the legitimate child of both spouses. Except as provided in [ET] \u00a7 1-207 ..., a child born at any time after his parents have participated in a marriage ceremony with each other, even if the marriage is invalid, is presumed to be the legitimate child of both parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">(b) Artificial insemination. \u2014 A child conceived by artificial insemination of a married woman with the consent of her husband is the legitimate child of both of them for all purposes. Consent of the husband is presumed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">Thus, ET \u00a7 1-206(a) creates a statutory presumption of legitimacy for children who are born to a married mother. And, ET \u00a7 1-206(b) extends that presumption of legitimacy to children who are conceived by artificial insemination of a married mother with the consent of her husband. As this Court explained in <em>Evans, </em>382 Md. at 629, 856 A.2d at 688, \u201ca blood or genetic test may be ordered only upon a showing of good cause\u201d sufficient to overcome the statutory presumption of legitimacy under ET \u00a7 1-206, and, in \u201cmaking the determination of good cause, the [trial] court must weigh the various interests of the parties and, in particular, consider whether blood or genetic testing would be in the best interests of\u2019 the child. In any event, in my view, there is no need even to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>consider whether ET \u00a7 1-206(b) includes children who are conceived through IVF as opposed to artificial insemination because ET \u00a7 1-206(a) applies in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Importantly, in my view, Sieglein has not presented any evidence to rebut ET \u00a7 1-206(a)\u2019s presumption of legitimacy. Indeed, absent evidence of fraud or duress, no parent who voluntarily consented to the use of IVF with an anonymous donor to conceive a child during marriage could overcome the presumption of legitimacy that is established by ET \u00a7 1-206(a). For example, in this case, Sieglein has not alleged that Schmidt acted unilaterally in undergoing IVF, or that his signature on the consent form with the Shady Grove Fertility Reproductive Science Center was forged or made under duress. Indeed, by all accounts, the record reveals that Sieglein was an active participant in the couple\u2019s decision to pursue IVF. And, once the child was conceived and born, Sieglein was identified on the child\u2019s birth certificate as the child\u2019s father, and Sieglein participated in the care of the child immediately following the child\u2019s birth. Sieglein has not alleged that his participation was involuntary, or that his consent was obtained by any manner of fraud or coercion. The donor process was anonymous, and there is no other putative father who contests the child\u2019s parentage. Thus, I would have no difficulty in concluding that, under ET \u00a7 1-206(a)\u2019s plain language, Sieglein is the parent of the child who was conceived during the marriage, with the consent of both parties, through IVF using a donated egg and anonymously donated sperm, where Sieglein has failed to present good cause to rebut the statutory presumption of legitimacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">To conclude otherwise \u2014 that a child who is conceived during a marriage and with the consent of both parties through IVF using a donated egg and donated sperm is not presumed to be the legitimate child of both spouses \u2014 would be contrary to the statutory presumption of legitimacy. This simply could not have been the General Assembly\u2019s intent. Rather, by enacting ET \u00a7 1-206(a)\u2019s predecessor in 1969, the General Assembly clearly and unequivocally demonstrated an intent to extend a statutory presumption of legitimacy to children who are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>bom or conceived during a marriage. Accordingly, I would hold that, under ET \u00a7 1-206(a), because the child was conceived and born during Sieglein\u2019s and Schmidt\u2019s marriage, the presumption of legitimacy applies, the child is presumed to be the child of both Sieglein and Schmidt, and the presumption has not been rebutted. In other words, Sieglein is the child\u2019s father and legal parent, and thus is \u201cjointly and severally responsible for the child\u2019s support, care, nurture, welfare, and education\u201d under FL \u00a7 5-208. Because I would resolve this case through application of ET \u00a7 1-206(a), I would refrain from engaging in an analysis of whether ET \u00a7 1-206(b)\u2019s reference to \u201cartificial insemination\u201d includes IVF. Recognizing that IVF did not exist at the time that ET \u00a7 1-206(b) was enacted and that this circumstance casts serious doubt on the General Assembly\u2019s intent to have artificial insemination include IVF and other advances in reproductive medicine, I would refer the matter of amending the decades-old statute to the General Assembly for its consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">For the above reasons, respectfully, I concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-9\">.
