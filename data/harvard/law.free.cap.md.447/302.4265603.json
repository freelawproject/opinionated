The Wicomico County Bureau <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>of Support Enforcement (\u201cBureau\u201d), Respondent, in 2011, had filed a Complaint for Child Support against Mr. Davis, in which it alleged that Mr. Davis was responsible for support, because he had attested that he was the father of the twins; Mr. Davis, in turn, requested a paternity test and denied parentage of the children, alleging that his signature on the affidavit had been obtained through fraud or misrepresentation. Judge David B. Mitchell, then retired but specially sitting in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County, ordered Mr. Davis to pay child support; he also denied the request for a paternity test, because Mr. Davis had executed the affidavits of parentage and there was \u201cnothing in this record and before this Court today that would even broach the subject of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact.\u201d Mr. Davis did not note an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Two years later, Mr. Davis, however, filed a \u201cComplaint for Blood Test, to Challenge Finding of Paternity (By Affidavit of Parentage), and to Set Aside Child Support Order\u201d in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County. Judge Donald C. Davis denied the request for a paternity test, concluding that \u201c[Mr. Davis] has no absolute right to blood or genetic testing under FL \u00a7 5-1088; even if he did, he has waived his right by failing to appeal the trial judge\u2019s decision in 2011; and there is no other meritorious basis asserted to grant [Mr. Davis] his requested relief,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Mr. Davis then appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which, in a reported opinion, affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 222 Md.App. 280, 112 A.3d 1024 (2015). Our brethren concluded that Mr. Davis\u2019s claims were barred by res <em>judicata, </em>but also reached the merits. Judge Patrick L. Woodward, writing on behalf of the Court, in interpreting the statutes in issue, held that \u201cthe plain language and the legislative history of FL \u00a7\u00a7 5-1028 and 5-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>1038 support the trial court\u2019s determination\u201d that Mr. Davis \u201cis not entitled to a blood or genetic test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246, 112 A.3d at 1033.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">We granted <em>certiorari, </em>444 Md. 638, 120 A.3d 766 (2015), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">1. Is blood or genetic testing mandated when demanded by a putative father who, from the beginning of the legal process, presents evidence of fraudulent affidavits of parentage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">2. Does extrinsic evidence of fraud exist where the state\u2019s attorney actively participates in the deception and fraud without disclosing it to the putative father or to the trial court during two trials? [<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">With respect to the seminal issue of <em>res judicata </em>as to whether the 2011 child support order from which Mr. Davis did not appeal precludes him from relitigating the same claims in 2013, we have defined <em>res judicata </em>as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">[A] judgment between the same parties and their privies is a final bar to any other suit upon the same cause of action, and is conclusive not only as to all matters that have been decided in the original suit, but as to all matters which with propriety could have been litigated in the first suit....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-9\"><em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Brent, </em>414 Md. 334, 342, 995 A.2d 672, 677 (2010), quoting <em>MPC, Inc. v. Kenny, </em>279 Md. 29, 32, 367 A.2d 486, 488-89 (1977). The requirements of the doctrine of res judicata are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\">(1) that the parties in the present litigation are the same or in privity with the parties to the earlier dispute; (2) that the claim presented in the current action is identical to the one determined in the prior adjudication; and (3) that there was a final judgment on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number><em>Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Community Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>361 Md. 371, 392, 761 A.2d 899, 910 (2000). <em>Res judicata </em>\u201cavoids the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits, conserves the judicial resources, and fosters reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibilities of inconsistent decisions.\u201d <em>Cochran v. Griffith Energy Services, Inc., </em>426 Md. 134, 140, 43 A.3d 999, 1002 (2012), quoting <em>Anne Arundel County. Bd. of Educ. v. Norville, </em>390 Md. 93, 106-07, 887 A.2d 1029, 1037 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Mr. Davis does not dispute that the parties in the 2011 and 2013 cases are the same, nor that the claims were identical in both. Rather, he argues that <em>res judicata </em>should not bar his 2013 Complaint, because the equitable, remedial nature of paternity actions requires continuous vigilance by the judiciary, so that there cannot be a final judgment against which <em>res judicata </em>is measured.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">A final judgment is \u201ca judgment, decree, sentence, order, determination, decision, or other action by a court ... from which an appeal ... may be taken\u201d, according to Section 12 \u2014 101(f) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. We have stated that, \u201c[a] ruling of the circuit court, to constitute a final judgment, must, among other things, be an \u2018unqualified, final disposition of the matter in controversy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Addison v. Lochearn Nursing Home, LLC, </em>411 Md. 251, 262, 983 A.2d 138, 145 (2009), quoting <em>Gruber v. Gruber, </em>369 Md. 540, 546, 801 A.2d 1013, 1016 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In the present case, Judge Mitchell\u2019s order requiring Mr. Davis to pay child support and denying his request for a paternity test was a final judgment. Mr. Davis, of course, argues that because the Court continues to have jurisdiction over child support and parentage, that the order could not be final. Although we have specifically not opined about this subject, Judge Alan Wilner, then writing on behalf of the Court of Special Appeals, recognized that, \u201c[a]n order establishing child support, or determining any other matter over which a continuing jurisdiction exists, if possessing all other required attributes of finality, is a judgment <em>(see </em>Md. Rule 1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>202( [o]))....\u201d <em>Haught v. Grieashamer, </em>64 Md.App. 605, 611, 497 A.2d 1182, 1185 (1985). Maryland Rule 1-202(o) defines judgment as \u201cany order of court final in its nature entered pursuant to these rules.\u201d Therefore, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that <em>res judicata </em>would have barred the 2013 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The dissent, however, raises an argument never raised below before Judge Davis in 2013, nor before the Court of Special Appeals, that <em>res judicata </em>would not have barred the 2013 action, because Judge Mitchell in 2011 allegedly never addressed Mr. Davis\u2019s claim for genetic testing. In the 2011 action, however, there were two issues queued up for decision by Judge Mitchell: one brought on behalf of the twins as to whether Mr. Davis should be ordered to pay child support and the other raised by Mr. Davis, as to whether Mr. Davis should have been afforded a genetic test because of alleged fraud in Section 5 \u2014 1028(d)(2)(i) governing whether an affidavit of parentage was subject to attack. With respect to Mr. Davis\u2019s claim, he repeatedly argued that he had been the victim of fraud and requested genetic testing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">[BUREAU]: But it\u2019s my understanding Mr. Davis would like to present argument to the Court today to challenge the validity of those Affidavits under the Paternity Statute. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">[MR. DAVIS]: This is the whole reason we are here. The only thing I\u2019m asking for is a paternity test to prove that I actually have an obligation to these children legally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">[THE COURT]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">[MR. DAVIS]: That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m asking for. I\u2019m not asking for anything else. I\u2019m just asking for a paternity test to actually prove paternity. That\u2019s the only thing I want, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">* # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">[MR. DAVIS]: I\u2019m not sure \u2014 I\u2019m not sure on the actual timing. The only thing that I think is relevant here is the fact that I\u2019m just asking for a paternity test. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>not trying to get out of any \u2014 I just want a paternity test so you guys can see if I\u2019m actually the father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">[MR. DAVIS]: She could have deceived me when we were together. I\u2019m not \u2014 I wasn\u2019t with her 24/7. The only thing I\u2019m asking for once again, I reiterate is \u2014 is a paternity test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">[MR DAVIS]: I just want a paternity test to prove in front of the Judge and the eyes of the law to make it legal that I am the father \u2014 if you prove to me legally that I\u2019m the father, you can bring me back in here and I will pay all the child support you want____That\u2019s \u2014 I just want a paternity test. I\u2019m not asking to get out of something. I want \u2014 can you just prove to me that they\u2019re my children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">[MR. DAVIS]: So in this case, I\u2019m just asking for a paternity test. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m asking for a paternity test to actually prove paternity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">Judge Mitchell specifically responded to Mr. Davis\u2019s repeated requests for a paternity test when he denied the existence of fraud at the time Mr. Davis executed the affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">Thank you .... The statute authorizing the creation of these affidavits is found in Family Law Article Section 5-1028. In essence, for a period of 60 days after you sign the affidavit, you have the right to rescind it. You can rescind it in writing, or you can rescind it in a judicial proceeding provided that proceeding occurs within 60 days of the birth of the child or the execution of the affidavit. Beyond that 60-day period of time, the statute provides that you may rescind the Affidavit of Paternity and its contents only upon a showing of fraud, duress, or a material mistake of fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-13\">The issue in this case is not the fatherhood of the child. The issue in this ease is whether there is the presence of fraud, mistake, or duress that would justify the rescission of an Affidavit signed by you and acknowledged to be signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>by the defendant wherein he confesses to the paternity of these two children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">There is no dispute that the mother and the defendant executed these documents. There is no suggestion of the presence of any fraud or any duress at the time they executed the document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">There is testimony from the mother before the Court that she advised the defendant prior, seven months actually, prior to the birth of the children that he was not the biological father. That\u2019s interesting but irrelevant. It\u2019s irrelevant because the defendant armed with whatever knowledge he had chose to voluntarily execute an affidavit establishing him as the father of these children. We have heard nothing in this record and before this Court today that would even broach the subject of fraud, duress or material mistake of fact ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">We don\u2019t slip in and slip out. You were clearly \u2014 you meaning, both mother and father, were clearly advised, don\u2019t sign if you have a doubt. You can get assistance if you want because you don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re about to sign. But the moment you affix your pen to that paper and sign your name, you have obligated yourself to these children. And it is the finding of this Court that there is no fraud, duress, or mistake of material fact that would justify the rescission of the Affidavits of Parentage properly executed. These are your children by law, and that\u2019s the end of the story.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Although the dissent argues that res <em>judicata </em>would not apply because genetic testing was not a specific claim in issue, Mr. Davis\u2019s suit in 2013 for paternity testing to challenge the finding of paternity was barred, either under claim preclusion <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or issue preclusion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because the issue was litigated in 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>In a case analogous to the instant case, <em>Hardy v. Hardy, </em>2011 Ark. 82, 380 S.W.3d 354 (2011), Mr. Hardy sought to set aside a divorce decree, which included provisions addressing child custody and his support of the children, on a theory of fraud. In the divorce proceedings, his wife\u2019s complaint alleged that two children had been born of the marriage. <em>Id. </em>at 355. Mr. Hardy denied paternity of one of the children who had been conceived prior to, but born during, the marriage, and asked for a paternity test. <em>Id. </em>The trial court denied Mr. Hardy\u2019s request for a paternity test, awarded him visitation, and ordered him to pay child support. <em>Id. </em>at 358. Mr. Hardy did not appeal from \u201cthe denial of his motion for paternity testing or from the divorce decree that required him to make child-support payments for [the child].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Mr. Hardy, however, years later, moved to set aside the divorce decree, arguing that he was not the father of the child based on a paternity test he had commissioned. <em>Id. </em>The trial court denied Mr. Hardy\u2019s motion for declaratory judgment, and Mr. Hardy appealed, arguing that <em>res judicata </em>did not bar the second proceeding because the divorce proceeding did not involve \u201can express finding that he was the father of [the child].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Arkansas Supreme Court determined, as we do here with respect to Mr. Davis, that Mr. Hardy\u2019s relitigation of the issue of paternity was barred by the claim preclusion aspect of <em>res judicata </em>because the \u201ccase is based on the same events as the subject matter of the previous lawsuit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358. The court reasoned that, \u201cthe issue of paternity was clearly litigated in the divorce proceeding\u201d, there was a final judgment and Mr. Hardy\u2019s failure to appeal the rulings in the divorce proceeding \u201cforeclose^] his present collateral attack upon the finding of paternity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>We, however, did not take this case to address <em>res </em>judicata, but, rather, to determine whether a paternity test is mandated when \u201cdemanded\u201d four years after the birth of twins by a father who had executed an affidavit of parentage when the children were bom.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">When Mr. Davis executed the Affidavit of Parentage, Section 5-1028 of the Family Law Article of the Maryland Code (1984, 2006 Repl.

Pursuant to Section 5-1028 of the Family Law Article, Mr. Davis did not, however, rescind the affidavit within 60 days of its execution, nor did he appeal the 2011 judgment that determined that the affidavit of parentage was not procured through fraud, duress or material mistake of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Mr. Davis, nevertheless, argues that he is entitled to a blood or genetic test as a result of his attempt to modify his paternity attestation, pursuant to our holding in <em>Langston v. Riffe, </em>359 Md. 396, 754 A.2d 389 (2000), which involved declarations of paternity entered by the circuit court and the effect of Section 5-1038 of the Family Law Article when a putative father requests modification or abdication of the order. Section 5-1038 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a declaration of paternity in an order is final.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">(2)(i) A declaration of paternity may be modified or set aside:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">1. in the manner and to the extent that any order or decree of an equity court is subject to the revisory power of the court under any law, rule, or established principle of practice and procedure in equity; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">2. if a blood or genetic test done in accordance with \u00a7 5-1029[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] of this subtitle establishes the exclusion of the individual named as the father in the order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>(ii) Notwithstanding subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, a declaration of paternity may not be modified or set aside if the individual named in the order acknowledged paternity knowing he was not the father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">(b) Except for a declaration of paternity, the court may modify or set aside any order or part of an order under this subtitle as the court considers just and proper in light of the circumstances and in the best interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A24\">Essentially, Mr. Davis urges that his attestation of paternity under Section 5-1028 is equivalent to a declaration of paternity entered by a circuit court under Section 5-1038 so that he is entitled to a blood or genetic test. The Bureau, conversely, argues that there are significant distinctions between the statutory sections, evidenced by their plain language and history. The Court of Special Appeals concurred with the Bureau when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">We agree with the trial court that the plain language of the statutes shows that the only way for [Mr. Davis] to set aside the finding of paternity established by his affidavit of parentage under FL \u00a7 5-1028 is fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact, and not by a blood test as requested by [Mr. Davis].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\"><em>Davis v. Wicomico County Bureau of Support Enforcement, </em>222 Md.App. 230, 244, 112 A.3d 1024, 1032 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">The plain language of Sections 5-1028 and 5-1038 differs significantly. Most importantly, Section 5-1028 permits rescission of the affidavit of parentage <em>only </em>\u201con the basis of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact.\u201d To permit Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Davis to pursue blood or genetic testing in the face of the self-limiting language totally eviscerates the word \u201conly.\u201d We, however, augment plain meaning analysis with the legislative history of the two statutes, which cements our conclusion that Mr. Davis cannot seek blood or genetic testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The historical origins of Section 5-1038 emanate from criminal statutes regarding bastardy and fornication, which, as early as 1781, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">Be it enacted, by the general assembly of Maryland, that from and after the end of this present session of assembly, it shall and may be lawful for any justice of the peace within this state, as often as he shall be informed of any female person having an illegitimate child, to issue his warrant to the constable of the hundred in which such person resides, who is hereby required to carry such person before some justice of the peace of the county, who shall call on her for security to indemnify the county from any charge that may accrue by means of such child, and, upon neglect or refusal, to commit her to the custody of the sheriff of the county, to be by him safely kept until she shall give such security, but in case she shall on oath discover the father, then the said justice is hereby required to discharge her from such warrant, and directed to call such father, if a resident of the county, before him, and shall cause him to give security in the sum of thirty pounds current money, to indemnify the county from all charges that may arise for the maintenance of such child; but in case the father be a resident of any other county within this state, then the justice shall transmit, under his hand and seal, a copy of the proceedings in such case had, and the justices to whom the said proceedings shall be sent, shall forthwith proceed against the father in manner and form as is before directed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">Provided always, that in case any person charged with being the father of a bastard child should think himself aggrieved by the judgment aforesaid, it shall and may be lawful for the said justice, and he is hereby required, to cause such person to enter into recognizance for his appearance at the next county court; and the justices of the said county court are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>hereby directed to take cognizance thereof, and such proceedings, shall thereupon be had as in other criminal cases; and if the person so charged be found guilty by the verdict of a jury, the court shall immediately order such person to give security to indemnify the county from any charges that may accrue for the maintenance of the said child; and if he shall neglect or refuse to give such security, he shall be committed to the custody of the sheriff until he comply; and any person swearing falsely in the premises shall suffer the same pains and penalties as persons guilty of willful and corrupt perjury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">1781 Maryland Laws, Chapter 13. Essentially, the mother of an illegitimate child was \u201carrested\u201d and called upon to support the child, or in the alternative to identify the father, who was required to provide support or be successful in defeating the paternity claim after trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Bastardy proceedings continued until the early 1960s when the Commission to Study Problems of Illegitimacy among the Recipients of Public Welfare Monies in the Program for Aid to Dependent Children explored how to facilitate both the emotional and financial support of illegitimate children. The recommendations to the Legislature included the rejection of bastardy laws,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which had survived since 1781, as well as the adoption of procedures to establish paternity, which would result in court orders after trial or after a settlement between the parties without the father having to admit paternity. Final Report of the Commission on the Problems of Illegitimacy 22-24 (December 6, 1961). Some of the pertinent language adopted by the Legislature in 1963 included the following:</p>\n<p id=\"AN_\">66B</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">(a) Except as hereinafter provided, every bill or petition filed pursuant to Section 66 of this Article with respect to an illegitimate child shall be supported by the oath of the woman who is pregnant with or has been delivered of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>child, whether or not she is a formal party to said proceedings. If the woman is dead or otherwise physically or mentally incapable of making said oath or is she refuses to become the complainant or petitioner or to disclose the father of the child or to make such oath, the bill or petition may be filed without an oath, but the fact of the pregnancy or birth shall be verified by the complainant or petitioner and the woman if living, shall be made a party defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">(b) No bill or petition shall be filed or received by the Clerk of the Court unless there is attached thereto the consent or authorization of the State\u2019s Attorney of the county or city where the same is to be filed, unless the Court directs otherwise after being satisfied by such affidavits and testimony as the Court deems sufficient that the complaint is bona fide and meritorious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">1963 Maryland Laws, Chapter 722. After a petition was filed, the court would hold a hearing in which the complainant had the burden of establishing that the putative father was in fact the father:</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">66F</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">(b) At any time after the birth of the child a hearing shall be held by the Court in which the bill or petition is filed without a jury, unless the defendant alleged to be the father of the child elects a jury trial as hereinafter provided.

The court was mandated to order the parties to submit to blood tests to determine whether the putative father could be excluded as the father, upon request by the putative father or upon the court\u2019s own motion:</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">66G</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>The Court, upon motion of the defendant alleged to be the putative father, or upon its own motion, shall order the mother and the child, as well as the defendant to submit to such blood tests as may be deemed necessary to determine whether or not the defendant can be excluded as being the father of the child____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">1963 Maryland Laws, Chapter 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Once a paternity finding was entered, Section 66H(a) mandated that the Court declare \u201cthe defendant to be the father\u201d and order him to pay child support for the maintenance of the child:</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">66H</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">(a) If the finding of the Court or jury, as the case may be, be against the defendant alleged to be the putative father, the Court shall pass an order declaring the defendant to be the father of said child and providing for the support and maintenance of the child. Such order shall specify the sum to be paid by the defendant weekly or otherwise until the child reaches the age of 21 years, dies, marries, or becomes self-supporting, which event first occurs; provided, that in any case where said child, having reached 21 years of age, is destitute of means and unable to support himself by reason of mental or physical infirmity, the Court shall have power to require payments to be made or continued during the continuance of such mental or physical infirmity. In addition to providing for the support and maintenance of the child, the order also may require the defendant to pay all or any part of the mother\u2019s medical and hospital expense for her pregnancy, confinement, and recovery, and for the funeral expenses if the child has died or dies; and in addition thereto, may award counsel fees to the attorney representing the complainant or petitioner....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">1963 Maryland Laws, Chapter 722.

The order was a final order and subject only to the revisory power of the Court as provided by \u201cstatute, rule of court, or the established principals of practice and procedure in equity\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">66H</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">(e) No order shall be entered against any person under this subtitle unless the person is or shall have been made a party to the proceedings and after reasonable notice to such party and an opportunity to be heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">* \u2756 <em>X</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">(g) A declaration of paternity contained in any order is final and not subject to the revisory power of the Court except in the manner and to the extent that any other order or decree of a court of equity in this State may be subject to the revisory power of the Court by virtue of any statute, rule of court, or the established principals of practice and procedure in equity. All other orders or parts of orders in the proceedings are subject to the further order of the Court, and the Court, from time to time thereafter, may annul, vary or modify the orders as to the Court may seem just and proper in the light of the then existing circumstances and in the best interests of the child or children involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>therein and also in accordance with the power of modification as provided in Section 66 of this Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">1963 Maryland Laws, Chapter 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Section 66L recognized the efficacy of a settlement entered into by the alleged father of a child either before or after the filing of a petition to establish paternity. The settlement would incorporate terms for the child\u2019s support and maintenance, which, after approval by the court, were to be incorporated in an order. Significantly, the alleged father did not have to admit paternity to enter into the agreement:</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">66L</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">Either before or after the filing of a bill or petition to establish paternity and to charge the putative father of an illegitimate child or children with his or their support and maintenance, the person alleged to be the father of the child or children, whether he admits or denies paternity, may propose to make a settlement with respect to his or their support and maintenance, either in a lump sum, installments, or otherwise. If the complainant or petitioner agrees to accept the settlement and the State\u2019s Attorney is satisfied that the amount and terms of the settlement are fair and reasonable and that the complainant or petitioner has been properly advised in the premises and is competent to accept the settlement, an agreement shall be prepared and duly executed and submitted to the Court for approval. In the event the Court approves the agreement, the terms thereof shall be incorporated in an order to be passed by the Court, which order shall be enforceable in all respects and to the same extent as any other order passed after a hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">1963 Maryland Laws, Chapter 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">All of the cited provisions were enacted, among others, and ultimately included in the codification of Article 16 of the Annotated Code of Maryland and entitled \u201cPaternity Proceedings.\u201d Eventually, as part of the ongoing code revision process, in 1984, the provisions of Article 16 were recodified, without substantive change, as Sections 5-1001 <em>et seq. </em>of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Family Law Article. <em>See </em>1984 Maryland Laws, Chapter 296. Section 66H, specifically, was divided and recodified as Sections 5-1035, 5-1037 and 5-1038 of the Family Law Article. Section 66L became Section 5-1016 of the Family Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Section 5-1038 was amended in 1995 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to permit a court to set aside or modify a declaration of paternity \u201cin the manner and to the extent that any order or decree of an equity court is subject to the revisory power of the court\u201d or \u201cif a blood or genetic test done in accordance with \u00a7 5-1029\u201d established the definite exclusion of the man named as the father in the order. The amendment also included the provision that \u201ca declaration of paternity may not be modified or set aside if the individual named in the order acknowledged paternity knowing he was not the father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In <em>Langston v. Riffe, </em>359 Md. 396, 754 A.2d 389 (2000), we had occasion to determine that the 1995 amendment should be applied retroactively. We also concluded in <em>Langston </em>that a putative father seeking a revision of a paternity order under Section 5-1038 could only do so were he afforded blood or genetic testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\"><em>Langston </em>had involved three paternity cases involving two fathers, Tyrone W. and William Carl Langston. Tyrone W. had entered into a paternity agreement with Danielle R. in which he acknowledged that he was the father of T.R., while Mr. Langston had entered into separate consent decrees of paternity for two children of two different mothers, although paternity had not been established by blood or genetic testing. The three paternity agreements led to the entry of three declarations of paternity in the circuit court, which subsequently led to the entry of orders of child support against Tyrone W. and Mr. Langston. Subsequently, Tyrone filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Complaint to Set Aside Declaration of Paternity, pursuant to Section 5-1038(a)(2)(i)2 of the Family Law Article, alleging that he was not the father of T.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In one of the two paternity cases involving Langston, the Circuit Court for Harford County ordered a blood test upon the request of the Harford County Department of Social Services, which was unaware that a declaration of paternity had been entered previously in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. When the results of the blood test excluded Mr. Langston as the biological father, he filed a complaint to set aside the paternity declaration based on Section 5 \u2014 1038(a)(2)(i)2 of the Family Law Article. In the second case, ultimately consolidated with the first, a show cause order had been issued to Mr. Langston for failure to pay child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\"><em>Langston v. Riffe, </em>then, presented us with the issue of whether declarations of paternity, based on a paternity agreement, as well as two consent decrees, could be set aside,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It was our decision in <em>Langston </em>to set aside the paternity declarations but, most especially our determination that \u201ca blood or genetic test is to be triggered automatically when any party, including the putative father, moves to have testing conducted\u201d, <em>Langston, </em>359 Md. at 425, 754 A.2d at 404, upon which Mr. Davis relies to pursue a paternity test.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Mr. Davis\u2019s reliance on <em>Langston, </em>however, is misplaced, because the statute governing affidavits of parentage, Section 5-1028, has a significantly different narrative rooted in federal mandates than the governing statute in <em>Langston, </em>Section 5-1038. The origins of Section 5-1028 can be found in the federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which mandated that every state, in order to continue to receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>federal funds, establish a method by which unmarried fathers could voluntarily acknowledge paternity \u201cduring the period immediately before or after the birth of a child.\u201d Pub.L. No. 103-66, \u00a7 13721, 107 Stat. 659 (1993), codified at 42 U.S.C. 666(a)(5).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Congress had \u201cpreviously tried to make evasion of paternity more difficult for non-custodial fathers\u201d, and the voluntary paternity acknowledgment programs mandated by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act were initiated to take advantage of the \u201cmagic moment\u201d immediately after birth when \u201cmany unmarried fathers visit their children in the hospital \u2014 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Pamela C.

Not only were financial costs of concern, however, but it was more likely that an earlier paternity acknowledgment would result in the child having \u201caccess to more emotional/psychological, social entitlement and financial resources than their peers without legal fathers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. Initially, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, significantly, provided that a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity created a rebuttable presumption of paternity or, at the state\u2019s option, a conclusive presumption of paternity. Pub.L. No. 103-66, \u00a7 13721, 107 Stat. 659 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In the same year, the Maryland General Assembly enacted Chapter 197 of the Maryland Laws of 1993, which originated as House Bill 459 (\u201cH.B. 459\u201d) and Senate Bill 350 (\u201cS.B. 350\u201d), and later became codified as Section 5-1028 of the Family Law Article. Chapter 197 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">(a) An unmarried father and mother shall be provided an opportunity to execute an affidavit of parentage in the manner provided under \u00a7 4-208 of the Health-General Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">(b) The affidavit shall be completed on a standardized form developed by the department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">(c) The completed affidavit of parentage form shall contain:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">(1) in ten point bold face type a statement that the affidavit is a legal document and constitutes rebuttable presumption of parentage in a paternity proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>(2) the full name and the place and date of birth of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\">(3) the full name of the attesting father of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">(4) the full name of the attesting mother of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">(5) the signatures of the father and the mother of the child attesting, under penalty of perjury, that the information provided on the affidavit is true and correct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">(6) a statement by the mother consenting to the assertion of paternity and acknowledging that her cosignatory is the only possible father;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">(7) a statement by the father that he is the natural father of the child[ ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-9\">(8) the social security numbers provided by each of the parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">(d) An executed affidavit of parentage constitutes a rebuttable presumption of parentage in a paternity proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-11\">(e) The Administration shall prepare written information to be furnished to unmarried mothers under \u00a7 4-208 of the Health \u2014 General Article concerning the benefits of having the paternity of their children established, including the availability of child support enforcement services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-12\">(f) The Department shall make the standardized affidavit forms available to all hospitals in the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-13\">(g) The Secretary, in consultation with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the Maryland Hospital Association, shall adopt regulations governing the provisions of this section and \u00a7 4-208 of the Health \u2014 General Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">The purpose of the enactment of Chapter 197 was to take advantage of federal funding through the federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and to \u201caccelerate the collection of child support payments by three months.\u201d <em>See </em>Revised Fiscal Note, Department of Fiscal Services, Bill File S.B. 350. Its supporters also posited that, \u201c[establishing paternity at birth will eliminate the need for court ordered paternity establishment, thus releasing the court from the costly and time consuming responsibility of hearing these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>cases.\u201d Testimony of Meg Sollenberger of the Department of Human Resources, House Judiciary Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Importantly, when Chapter 197 was enacted, a \u201crebuttable presumption of paternity\u201d arose after the father completed the affidavit, in which he attested to his parentage. The rebuttable presumption, according to supporters of the bills, \u201ccould be set aside should blood or DNA test or other evidence show paternity is unlikely.\u201d Letter to House Judiciary Committee, Bill File, S.B. 350. Chapter 197 was subsequently codified as Section 5-1028 of the Family Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Section 5-1028 importantly, however, was amended in 1997 to remove the rebuttable presumption of paternity and to replace that presumption with a more restricted ability to challenge the acknowledgment, temporally, 60 days, and thereafter, only upon proof of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact. The amendment was enacted to adhere to federal mandates under the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Personal Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>sponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 replaced the federal Aid to Families with Dependent Children program with a program of block grants to states for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (\u201cTANF\u201d). A state\u2019s participation in the Program is voluntary, although when a State chooses to participate it must comply with the Social Security Act\u2019s Title IV-D\u2019s provisions regarding child support enforcement, which requires states to establish procedures for a voluntary paternity acknowledgment that, when executed, is a \u201clegal finding of paternity\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">(C) VOLUNTARY PATERNITY ACKNOWLEDGMENT.\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">(i) Simple Civil Process</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">Procedures for a simple civil process for voluntarily acknowledging paternity under which the State must provide that, before a mother and a putative father can sign an acknowledgment of paternity, the mother and the putative father must be given notice, orally and in writing, of the alternatives to, the legal consequences of, and the rights (including, if one parent is a minor, any rights afforded due to minority status) and responsibilities that arise from, signing the acknowledgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">(D)(ii) Legal Finding of Paternity</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-9\">Procedures under which a signed voluntary acknowledgment of paternity is considered a legal finding of paternity, subject to the right of any signatory to rescind the acknowledgment within the earlier of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-10\">(I) 60 days; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>(II) the date of an administrative or judicial proceeding relating to the child (including a proceeding to establish a support order) in which the signatory is a party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">(iii) Contest</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">Procedures under which, after the 60-day period referred to in clause (ii), a signed voluntary acknowledgment of paternity may be challenged in court only on the basis of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact, with the burden of proof upon the challenger, and under which the legal responsibility (including child support obligations) of any signatory arising from the acknowledgment may not be suspended during the challenge, except for good cause shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">42 U.S.C. 666 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">In Maryland, House Bill 1074 and Senate Bill 636 were introduced in 1997 in order to comply with the federal mandate.

[establishing that an affidavit of parentage constitutes a legal finding of paternity, rather than a rebuttable presumption; [allowing a legal finding of paternity established by affidavit to be set aside only if it is rescinded within a specific time period and the party challenging it proves that the affidavit was executed because of fraud, duress, or a material mistake of fact</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">Enactment of Chapter 609 of the Laws of Maryland of 1997 as codified resulted in the version of Section 5-1028, which at the time Mr. Davis executed his affidavit (and now), provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai\">(a) An unmarried father and mother shall be provided an opportunity to execute an affidavit of parentage in the manner provided under \u00a7 4-208 of the Health-General Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>(b) The affidavit shall be completed on a standardized form developed by the Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-4\">(e)(1) The completed affidavit of parentage form shall contain:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">(1) in ten point boldface type a statement that the affidavit is a legal document and constitutes a legal finding of paternity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">(ii) the full name and the place and date of birth of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">(iii) the full name of the attesting father of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">(iv) the full name of the attesting mother of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">(v) the signatures of the father and the mother of the child attesting, under penalty of perjury, that the information provided on the affidavit is true and correct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">(vi) a statement by the mother consenting to the assertion of paternity and acknowledging that her cosignatory is the only possible father;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-11\">(vii) the Social Security numbers provided by each of the parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-12\">(2) Before completing an affidavit of parentage form, the unmarried mother and the father shall be advised orally and in writing of the legal consequences of executing the affidavit and of the benefit of seeking legal counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-13\">(d)(1) An executed affidavit of parentage constitutes a legal finding of paternity, subject to the right of any signatory to rescind the affidavit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-14\">(1) in writing within 60 days after execution of the affidavit; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-15\">(ii) in a judicial proceeding relating to the child:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-16\">1. in which the signatory is a party; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-17\">2. that occurs before the expiration of the 60-day period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-18\">(2)(i) After the expiration of the 60-day period, an executed affidavit of parentage may be challenged in court only on the basis of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>(ii) The burden of proof shall be on the challenger to show fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">(iii) The legal responsibilities of any signatory arising from the affidavit, including child support obligations, may not be suspended during the challenge, except for good cause shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">(e) The Administration shall prepare written information to be furnished to unmarried mothers under \u00a7 4-208 of the Health \u2014 General Article concerning the benefits of having the paternity of their children established, including the availability of child support enforcement services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">(f) The Department shall make the standardized affidavit forms available to all hospitals in the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">(g) The Secretary, in consultation with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the Maryland Hospital Association, shall adopt regulations governing the provisions of this section and \u00a7 4-208 of the Health \u2014 General Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">1997 Maryland Laws, Chapter 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">The legislative history of both Sections 5-1038 and 5-1028, thus, reflects that Section 5-1038 was amended in 1995 to weaken the finality of a paternity declaration even after a putative father had executed a paternity agreement, which did not require him to admit to paternity. The General Assembly, however, amended Section 5-1028 in 1997 to eviscerate the rebuttable presumption and replace it with the more constricting \u201clegal finding of paternity\u201d after the father executes an affidavit of parentage, thereby <em>strengthening the finality </em>of the affidavit of parentage. The basis of the latter was to comport with federal funding mandates, and most importantly, to limit the ability of a father who voluntarily acknowledged his paternity to thereafter, possibly years later, as in the instant case, obtain post-judgment blood or genetic testing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>The limitations of a father\u2019s ability to challenge an affidavit of paternity only on the grounds of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact was recognized by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Burden v. Burden, </em>179 Md.App. 348, 945 A.2d 656 (2008). Our intermediate appellate court held that the father could not disestablish paternity when his signing of the Affidavit did not involve fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 369, 945 A.2d at 669. Our conclusion also comports with the decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois in <em>People ex rel. Dept. of Public Aid v. Smith, </em>212 Ill.2d 389, 289 Ill.Dec. 1, 818 N.E.2d 1204 (2004), when that court, interpreting the same language as our Section 5-1028, ruled out a challenge when a father, who had executed an affidavit of paternity, actually found out that he was not the father; the court was emphatic that \u201ca man who voluntarily acknowledges paternity can later challenge the <em>voluntariness </em>of the acknowledgment if he can show that it was procured by fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact, but the Parentage Act does not allow him to challenge the conclusive presumption of paternity with con <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>trary evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>289 Ill.Dec. 1, 818 N.E.2d at 1213 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">To conflate Sections 5-1038 and 5-1028, as Mr. Davis would have us do, violates the essence of Section 5-1028. It is clear that Sections 5-1028 and 5-1038 are not coterminous and that there are limited opportunities to challenge an Affidavit of Parentage under Section 5-1028, which Mr. Davis took but lost. Mr. Davis now is not entitled to a blood or genetic test to contest the parentage he established after execution of his Affidavit of Parentage.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

The history of this world has demonstrated on too many occasions for us to recount that children born of two parents can emerge into the world looking like they did generations past.

It will happen tomorrow. The basis of parentage is not how they look, but do you acknowledge them. Now, perhaps, a saying that can be found in many nations of Africa applies. In the United States, we used to call it children who were bom out of wedlock illegitimate. In those African nations, the statement is that there are not illegitimate children.

The dissent asserts, without citation to authority, that the legislative history of Section 5-1028 does not support it having been amended to comport with federal mandates that required the omission of a rebuttable presumption when they did. Rather, the dissent, to support its proposition, relies upon a version of the Uniform Parentage Act, which was proposed in 2000, <em>after </em>Section 5-1028 was amended to remove the rebuttable presumption. Therefore, the 2000 version of that Act has no bearing on the legislative history of Section 5-1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Even if the 2000 version of the Uniform Parentage Act were to have applied, the provisions contained in the Uniform Parentage Act relevant to the establishment of paternity by affidavit provide that: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in Section 307 and 308, a valid acknowledgment of paternity filed with the [agency maintaining birth records] is equivalent to an adjudication of paternity of a child and confers upon the acknowledged father all of the rights and duties of a parent\u201d, <em>see </em>\u00a7 305(a). The rescission provisions for a paternity affidavit in the Uniform Parentage Act mirror Maryland's provisions in that they provide for rescission of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGk\">an acknowledgment of paternity ... by commencing a proceeding to rescind before the earlier of (a) 60 days after the effective date of the acknowledgment []; or (2) the date of the first hearing, in a proceeding to which the signatory is a party, before a court to adjudicate an issue relating to the child, including a proceeding that establishes support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-9\"><em>See </em>\u00a7 307. The only distinction is a two year rescission provision as adverse to a 60 day time period. <em>See </em>\u00a7 308. The adjudication provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>sion relied on by the dissent, thus, only comes into play where a father who had signed an affidavit attempted to rescind during the applicable time period of two years from the execution of the affidavit, or under circumstances of fraud, duress or material mistake of fact. The Uniform Parentage Act, thus, embodies the same conclusive presumption in the absence of a timely challenge or one based on fraud, duress or material mistake of fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b360-11\">. The dissent argues that a piece of the testimony of Mr. Clifford Layman, the then Executive Director of the Maryland Child Support Enforcement Administration, relative to the amendment to Section 5-1028 enacted in 1997 supports the notion that anyone who executes an Affidavit of Parentage is thereafter entitled to a genetic test; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>conclusion is unwarranted. The testimony of Mr. Layman, a miniscule portion of the sixteen pages of which is in the dissent, supports that the rebuttable presumption of paternity was being eviscerated from the Maryland statute in order to comply with federal mandates. Mr. Layman points out that <em>contested </em>proceedings encompass genetic testing, \"[ujnder the Act State IV-D agencies must be able (without further order from any other judicial or administrative tribunal) to: [o]rder genetic tests in contested patterning proceedings.\u201d <em>Child Support Enforcement Procedures: Hearing on S.B. 636 Before the S.

He recognized, however, the <em>conclusive </em>presumption that would attach to an Affidavit of Parentage executed in the hospital, such as in the present case, under proposed Section 5-1028:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">A signed paternity affidavit becomes a legal finding within 60 days unless challenged for fraud, duress, or mistake of fact. The success of Maryland\u2019s in-hospital paternity affidavit program demonstrates that unwed parents will volunteer to legally protect their children by establishment paternity. Under this new provision, parents will be able to establish conclusive paternity for children bom out of wedlock administratively without the costs and delays associated with the judicial process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 12-13.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b362-9\">ADKINS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-1\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">Respectfully, I concur with the Majority. I would be joining the Dissent, in its analysis on the merits of how to interpret the relevant statutes, were this case an appeal from the 2011 judgment that Davis was not entitled to genetic testing. At that point, I would have reversed on grounds that he was so entitled. My decision would rest on the careful and thoughtful interpretation of the legislation that is delineated in the Dissent. This would surely be the equitable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">But the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>is fundamental to our jurisprudence, and I do not agree with the Dissent\u2019s analysis regarding the <em>res judicata </em>effect of the 2011 judgment. As both the Majority and the Court of Special Appeals say, the 2011 judgment of the Circuit Court denied Davis\u2019s request for genetic testing to determine parentage. In the 2011 litigation, Davis repeatedly told the judge that he sought genetic testing, but the judge denied his request on grounds of his Affidavit of Parentage. Without a doubt, the question of whether he was entitled to a paternity test is a matter that was decided in the 2011 case. It was sufficient for the judge to state that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>making his ruling against Davis based on the Affidavit of Parentage and the absence of fraud at the time Davis made the Affidavit, without specifically stating that in doing so, he effectively denied the requests for a paternity test. If Davis disagreed with that ruling, he should have appealed the 2011 final judgment. That judgment bars any re-litigation of the issue of Davis\u2019s paternity. <em>See Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Community Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>361 Md. 371, 392, 761 A.2d 899 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">With regret that we cannot afford equitable relief in violation of the firmly settled doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>I join the judgment of the Majority.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b363-5\">McDONALD, j.,</author>\n<p id=\"AF7\">dissenting, which BARBERA, C.J., and WATTS, J., join.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Petitioner Justin Davis seeks a genetic test under Maryland Code, Family Law Article,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 5-1029 and 5-1038, in order to determine whether he is the father of twins born to Jessica Cook in 2009. According to Mr. Davis, Ms. Cook led him to believe, at the time of the birth, that he was the biological father and he executed affidavits of parentage to that effect. It is undisputed that Ms. Cook herself never believed that they were Mr. Davis\u2019 offspring.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The Majority opinion holds that Mr. Davis cannot get a genetic test because he is precluded by his unsuccessful attempt to avoid a finding of paternity in 2011, which was predicated on his execution of the affidavits of parentage (rather than anything to do with a paternity test). Even though the Majority opinion disposes of the case on that ground, it goes on and suggests that no one who has signed an affidavit of parentage (even if incorrectly led to believe he was the biological father of the child) can ever get a genetic test to determine paternity. I disagree with both of these conclusions. To explain that disagreement, it is helpful to elaborate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>in somewhat greater detail the context, both factual and legal, of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Because this case was decided against Mr. Davis on summary judgment, we must view the facts in the light most favorable to Mr. Davis. <em>Serio v. Baltimore County, </em>384 Md. 373, 388, 863 A.2d 952 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Mr. Davis and Ms. Cook began a romantic relationship around December 2008. They broke up for a short time in 2009 \u2014 Mr. Davis testified that it was three weeks \u2014 and then got back together around May 2009. When they got back together, Ms. Cook informed Mr. Davis that she was pregnant. According to Ms. Cook\u2019s testimony, she was two months pregnant at that time, which is consistent with the fact that the children, who were twins, were born seven months later in December 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">At an evidentiary hearing in the Circuit Court, Ms. Cook testified about her conversations with Mr. Davis about her pregnancy. According to Ms. Cook, she told Mr. Davis that there was a possibility that he was not the children\u2019s biological father. Later in her testimony, however, she explained that she had not explicitly told him that, but rather had simply assumed that he understood that another man was her children\u2019s biological father. Speaking over some interruptions, in response to questions from Mr. Davis (who was appearing <em>pro </em>se), she testified: \u201cIf you wanted a relationship ... I had to tell you that I was pregnant. You didn\u2019t ask me whether it was yours or not at that time. I just assume[d] that you knew that since we weren\u2019t together and we hadn\u2019t been together, and I was pregnant that it wouldn\u2019t have been yours.\u201d For his part, Mr. Davis testified that he believed that the children were his at the time that he and Ms. Cook resumed their relationship. At the summary judgment stage, we must resolve this in favor of Mr. Davis: he did not know that the children were not his, although apparently Ms. Cook did. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>(According to Ms. Cook\u2019s testimony, the father of her children is a man who now resides in Sweden.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Mr. Davis and Ms. Cook moved in together shortly before the birth of the children. On December 23, 2009, shortly after the twins were born, Mr. Davis and Ms. Cook were presented at the hospital with an affidavit of parentage for each baby. They signed both affidavits. Above Ms. Cook\u2019s signature, each affidavit read, in part, \u201cI consent to the admission of paternity and acknowledge that the man named above is the only possible father of my child.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Above Mr. Davis\u2019 signature, each affidavit read, in part, \u201cI acknowledge that I am the natural father of the child named above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Sometime later, the babies\u2019 physician pointed out to Mr. Davis the disparity in appearance between him and the children. In Mr. Davis\u2019 words, the children are \u201cvisibly, visibly Caucasian\u201d and Mr. Davis is not. Mr. Davis became concerned that the children were not actually his, and confronted Ms. Cook. As a result, Mr. Davis concluded that the children were not his, and their relationship ended. As noted above, Ms. Cook later confirmed, both in testimony and in filings under oath, that Mr. Davis is not the biological father of the two boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">On July 25, 2011, the Wicomico County Bureau of Support Enforcement filed a Complaint for Child Support against Mr. Davis in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Bureau <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>rested its case entirely on the two affidavits of parentage executed by Mr. Davis at the time of the birth. Mr. Davis responded in writing and denied paternity. On September 16, 2011, the case went to trial in the Circuit Court. Mr. Davis, who was <em>pro se </em>in this trial,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> denied that he was the father of the children and repeatedly asked for a genetic test to show that the children were not his.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In introducing the case to the court at the outset of the trial, counsel for the Bureau submitted the affidavits of parentage and advised the court that Mr. Davis was challenging the validity of the <em>affidavits </em>\u2014 ie., making a claim under \u00a7 5-1028 relating to affidavits of parentage. During the trial the Bureau\u2019s counsel never addressed, in either argument or evidence, Mr. Davis\u2019 request for a genetic test. The court apparently accepted the framing of the issues presented by the Bureau\u2019s counsel and did not address Mr. Davis\u2019 request for a genetic test, much less decide the merits of that request.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After testimony from Mr. Davis and Ms. Cook, the Circuit Court found that Mr. Davis had not met the statutory standard to rescind the affidavits of parentage. As a result, the Circuit Court held that Mr. Davis was the father of Ms. Cook\u2019s children and ordered Mr. Davis to pay child support.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Mr. Davis did not appeal that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>On September 10, 2013, now with the assistance of counsel, Mr. Davis filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County asking that the court order a genetic test as authorized by statute (\u00a7 5-1029) and, assuming that the test confirmed that he was <em>not </em>the father, that the declaration of paternity and the child support order be set aside, as also provided by statute (\u00a7 5-1038). After dealing with several motions not relevant here, the Circuit Court held a hearing on December 13, 2013, at which it received documentary evidence, took judicial notice of court records, and heard legal argument. The Circuit Court subsequently granted summary judgment against Mr. Davis on December 20, 2013. The court held that Mr. Davis was not entitled to a genetic test because: (1) Mr. Davis was attempting to challenge the affidavits of parentage, but a genetic test is not one of the ways to challenge an affidavit of parentage; (2) Mr. Davis was precluded from challenging the two affidavits due to the 2011 proceedings; and (3) Mr. Davis was precluded from pursuing his claim for a genetic test due to the 2011 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Mr. Davis appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed in a reported decision. 222 Md.App. 230, 112 A.3d 1024 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">At issue before us is the Circuit Court\u2019s award of summary judgment denying Mr. Davis\u2019 request for a genetic test pursuant to statute. An award of summary judgment necessarily depends on the resolution of a legal issue. Accordingly, it is reviewed without deference to the lower court. <em>Serio, </em>384 Md. at 388, 863 A.2d 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The Majority opinion correctly notes that we issued a writ of <em>certiorari </em>in this case to analyze the relationship between an affidavit of parentage and a request for a genetic test. Majority op. at 343, 135 A.3d at 425. Accordingly, I will discuss that issue first. Then I will explain why I believe the Majority opinion\u2019s decision to reject Mr. Davis\u2019 claim on the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>res judicata either misunderstands or misapplies the principles of claim preclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\n<em>B. Whether an Affidavit of Parentage Precludes a Genetic Test</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\n<em>Statutory Structure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">This case involves construction of the statutes concerning genetic tests to prove or disprove paternity \u2014 and the relationship of those statutes to the statute providing for affidavits of parentage. As always, statutes must be construed in context. <em>Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 276, 987 A.2d 18 (2010) (\u201cthe plain language must be viewed within the context of the statutory scheme to which it belongs\u201d). Accordingly, one must consider the statutory scheme in which these provisions appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The provision that pertains to the affidavit of parentage is located in Family Law Article, Title 5 (Children), Subtitle 10 (Paternity Proceedings), Part V (Hearing on Complaint).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Part V describes the procedure for determining paternity when it is contested. It begins with \u00a7 5-1024, which describes the consequences of a defendant\u2019s failure to appear. Next, \u00a7 5-1025 requires that the trial be held after the birth of the child, and describes the procedure to follow when a complaint is filed before the birth of the child. The next two sections, \u00a7\u00a7 5-1026 and 5-1027, set some parameters for trial of the matter: no jury is required, ordinary civil rules apply, comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify is prohibited, the burden of proof is on the complainant, there is a rebuttable presumption that a man to whom the mother is married at the time of conception is the father, and a defendant may not be compelled to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Section 5-1028 concerning an affidavit of parentage also appears in Part V (Hearing on Complaint). It provides that \u201c[a]n executed affidavit of parentage constitutes a legal finding of paternity,\u201d subject to rescission by any signatory within 60 days. \u00a7 5-1028(d)(1). After 60 days, the affidavit of parentage may be challenged only on the grounds of \u201cfraud, duress, or material mistake of fact.\u201d \u00a7 5-1028(d)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">The main provision for genetic tests also appears in Part V: \u201cOn the motion of the [Child Support Enforcement Administration of the Maryland Department of Human Resources], a party to the proceeding, or on its own motion, the court <em>shall order </em>the mother, child, and alleged father to submit to blood or genetic tests to determine whether the alleged father can be excluded as being the father of the child.\u201d \u00a7 5-1029(b) (emphasis added). This language is mandatory: when a proper person or entity makes a proper motion, the court <em>must </em>order the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The next part of the statutory scheme \u2014 Part VI (Court Order) \u2014 describes the judicial order that follows from the proceedings in Part V. First, \u201c[i]f the court finds that the alleged father is the father, the court shall pass an order that: (1) declares the alleged father to be the father of the child; and (2) provides for the support of the child.\u201d \u00a7 5-1032. Subsequent provisions detail how the court shall determine who owes what to whom. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5-1033 (child support and other expenses); \u00a7 5-1036 (court costs); \u00a7 5-1034 (who receives payment). Other items that may be contained in the order are also detailed, and a provision describes the result of finding for the alleged father. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5-1035 (miscellaneous provisions in order); \u00a7 5-1039 (finding for alleged father).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">It is in Part VI that a key provision, \u00a7 5-1038, appears. It provides that a declaration of paternity is final except, as pertinent here, \u201cif a blood or genetic test done in accordance with \u00a7 5-1029 ... establishes the exclusion of the individual named as the father in the order.\u201d \u00a7 5-1038(a)(2)(i)(2). It is notable that such a challenge to a declaration of paternity is subject to an exception: \u201ca declaration of paternity may not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>modified or set aside if the individual named in the order acknowledged paternity knowing he was not the father.\u201d \u00a7 5-1038(a)(2)(ii). This suggests that an individual who acknowledges <em>paternity </em>\u2014 e.g., by executing an affidavit of parentage\u2014 <em>without knowledge </em>that he is not the father may overturn a finding of paternity with the results of a genetic test.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\n<em>The Roles of the Affidavit of Parentage and the Genetic Test</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In the context of this statutory structure, the role of an affidavit of parentage becomes clear. The provision describing an affidavit of parentage as constituting a \u201clegal finding of paternity,\u201d \u00a7 5-1028, appears in Part V, which describes the hearing on the complaint and procedures for proving or disproving paternity. This placement indicates that an affidavit of parentage serves to preempt the usual trial process: the parties can either have a full bench trial, as described in \u00a7\u00a7 5-1024 through 5-1027, or a party can short-circuit that process by presenting an affidavit of parentage under \u00a7 5-1028. In essence, given its location in the statutory scheme, \u00a7 5-1028 appears to be an alternative procedure to establish legal paternity. Indeed, in this case, the Bureau\u2019s entire case consisted of submission of the affidavits of parentage executed by Ms. Cook and Mr. Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Either way, once the hearing is complete, if the court finds that the alleged father is the father, then the court issues an order under the provisions in Part VI. This order includes a declaration of paternity under \u00a7 5-1032 and anything else appropriate under that Part. That is, there are two ways to reach a declaration of paternity under \u00a7 5-1032: a bench trial under the first four sections of Part V or an affidavit of parentage under \u00a7 5-1028, also in Part V. Both paths lead to the same destination: a declaration of paternity under \u00a7 5-1032.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>In this context, the role of \u00a7 5-1038 also becomes clear: by its terms, \u00a7 5-1038 provides the grounds for modifying or setting aside a \u201cdeclaration of paternity in an order\u201d \u2014 that is, a declaration of paternity in an order under \u00a7 5-1032. Because \u00a7 5-1029, which is referenced in \u00a7 5-1038, is located in Part V (Hearing on the Complaint), and Part V describes court procedure, it must be possible to request this test during the court proceedings. Also, because \u00a7 5-1038 refers to \u201cmodifying] or set[ting] aside\u201d an order, it must be possible to request this genetic test after the court issues the order, as this Court has held. <em>See Langston v. Riffe, </em>359 Md. 396, 754 A.2d 389 (2000) (allowing a genetic test nine years after the court order).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">\n<em>The Relationship Between the Affidavit of Parentage and a Genetic Test</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">It may seem strange that the standard in \u00a7 5-1038 for setting aside a judicial order is so different from the standard in \u00a7 5-1028 for setting aside an affidavit of parentage. After all, it is possible for an alleged father to satisfy the standard in \u00a7 5-1038 \u2014 he signed the affidavit of parentage believing that he was the father, but he would like a genetic test now that doubt has arisen, and the genetic test shows that he is not the father \u2014 even if he cannot meet the standard in \u00a7 5-1028 for rescission of the affidavit \u2014 there was no fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact. The alleged father might have honestly but mistakenly believed he was the father without legally meeting the standards of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact. Indeed, that may be this case: the alleged father\u2019s misunderstanding may have arisen because of miscommunication, rather than intentional deception.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>In such a situation, the affidavit of parentage is not rescinded, but the judicial order declaring paternity and requiring child support may be set aside if the genetic test excludes the alleged father. Once the order declaring paternity is set aside, the court must enter judgment for the alleged father. The alleged father is <em>not </em>the father, because the genetic test proved that he was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\n<em>Legislative Purpose</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Ultimately, we are seeking to carry out the legislative purpose in construing these statutes. Legislative history can shed light on the purpose of a statute, and this Court ordinarily considers the lineage of a statute when attempting to discern that purpose. <em>See Rose v. Fox Pool Corp., </em>835 Md. 351, 359-60, 643 A.2d 906 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The General Assembly most recently amended \u00a7 5-1028 concerning the effect of an affidavit of parentage in 1997. <em>See </em>Chapter 609, Laws of Maryland 1997. As the Majority opinion explains, prior to that amendment, an affidavit of parentage established a <em>rebuttable presumption </em>of paternity. <em>See </em>Majority op. at 330, 135 A.3d at 435. The 1997 law amended the statute so that an affidavit of parentage now creates a <em>legal finding </em>of paternity. This was in response to the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, a major welfare reform bill that required states, among other things, to make certain changes to their paternity establishment procedures as a condition of the receipt of funding for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. <em>See </em>Testimony of Alvin C. Collins, Secretary of Human Resources, before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee concerning Senate Bill 636 (1997) (February 25, 1997). The goal of the federal law was to increase the number of children supported by both parents and thereby decrease the support required from the general public. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 104-651 at 1326 (1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2183, 2383 (\u201cIn the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>absence of paternity establishment, taxpayers are left to pay literally billions of dollars in welfare expenses that are the obligation of delinquent parents.\u201d). Specifically, the change that an affidavit of parentage becomes a legal finding of parentage was intended to \u201csimplify voluntary paternity establishment\u201d by providing a formal method of acknowledgement by the father. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">The Majority opinion suggests that the federal law required states to create paternity establishment procedures that would accord greater standing to an affidavit of parentage than to a judicial declaration of paternity after trial and that would preclude a finding of paternity based on such an affidavit being overturned by the results of a genetic test. Majority op. at 330-35, 135 A.3d at 435-39. In fact, the federal law supports neither proposition. Indeed, when the Uniform Law Commissioners revised the Uniform Parentage Act to incorporate the requirements of the federal welfare reform legislation, the commissioners provided that the \u201cpaternity of a child having a presumed, <em>acknowledged, </em>or adjudicated father\u201d could be overturned by results of genetic testing that excluded the putative father. 9B Uniform Laws Annotated, Uniform Parentage Act (2000) \u00a7 631 (emphasis added); <em>see also id., </em>Comment (\u201cThis section establishes the controlling supremacy of genetic test results in the adjudication of paternity ... \u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The legislative history of the 1997 Maryland legislation reveals the concerns that resulted in the amendment of the statute concerning affidavits of parentage. First, the State legislation echoed the importance that the federal law placed <em>parental </em>support for children over public support. As the testimony before the Legislature indicated, the establishment of paternity in cases of unmarried mothers was not simply a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>matter of securing monetary support for the child. The Director of Child Support Enforcement testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">Not only does a legal parental link open the doors to benefits such as social security, gifts of inheritance, and medical coverage, but also to less quantifiable benefits such as the value to the child of knowing his or her father, an opportunity for extended family ties, and access to medical history and genetic information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Testimony of Clifford Layman, Executive Director, before Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee concerning Senate Bill 636 (February 25, 1997) at p. 11.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Because the goal of the legislation was to hold parents responsible for their own children and to establish a connection between parent and child, it seems entirely contrary to the legislative intent to hold <em>non-parents </em>responsible for <em>other people\u2019s </em>children. <em>See Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 399 n. 12, 788 A.2d 609 (2002) (\u201cOur Legislature never stated that the \u2018decent support of children\u2019 should be imposed upon those who are found, conclusively, not to be the child\u2019s parent ... \u201d). Denying a paternity test to a person who signed an affidavit of parentage runs the risk of doing precisely the opposite of what the General Assembly intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Second, it is true that finality was another legislative concern. Changing the consequence of an affidavit of parentage from a rebuttable presumption of paternity to a legal finding of paternity increases the finality of an affidavit of parentage, but it does not suggest that finality always trumps accuracy. When a genetic test can easily prove (or disprove) paternity with a high degree of accuracy, the legislative history does not provide any reason to think that the General Assembly would prefer that a court avoid finding out the truth regarding a child\u2019s parentage. In urging the Legislature to pass the 1997 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>amendments, the Secretary of Human Resources noted the \u201clinkage\u201d of expedited paternity establishment procedures with genetic testing. Stating that genetic testing was a \u201ckey element to streamlining the paternity establishment process,\u201d the Secretary concluded that paternity could be \u201cessentially resolved\u201d through such testing due to the high degree of accuracy. <em>See </em>Testimony of Alvin C. Collins, Secretary of Human Resources, before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee concerning Senate Bill 636 (1997) (February 25, 1997) at p. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The bottom line is evident: an affidavit of parentage is not meant to conclusively prove that which is false. Rather, an affidavit of parentage is meant to correctly establish paternity by a formal acknowledgement so that unwed fathers provide financial, emotional, and social support to their biological children. <em>See </em>Pamela C. Ovwigho, Catherine E. Born, &amp; Shafali Srivastava, <em>Maryland\u2019s Paternity Acknowledgment Program: Participant Entries into the Public Child Support and Welfare Systems, </em>at 6, October 2002, available at https:// perma.cc/363W-8YUC. Thus, when an alleged father is not the biological father of the children, using an affidavit of parentage to establish paternity incorrectly over the protest of the alleged father not only unfairly saddles an individual with responsibility for children unrelated to that individual, but also deprives the children of the connection with their biological father that the affidavit of parentage was supposed to encourage and protect. Such an interpretation seems contrary to the purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Hence, as the statutory text explains and the legislative history confirms, when an alleged father signs an affidavit of parentage on the basis of a genuine but incorrect belief that he is the father of the children, and he later requests a genetic test to show whether is in fact the father of the children, he is entitled to one. Then, if the test conclusively shows that he is not the father of the children, he no longer has the legal responsibilities that a father must have.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>\n<em>The Plight of Mr. Davis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In my view, the Circuit Court erred in denying Mr. Davis a genetic test. At this stage of the proceedings, we are to regard the evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Davis\u2014 that he signed an affidavit of parentage based on an honest but mistaken belief that he was the father of Ms. Cook\u2019s children. The Circuit Court in 2011 properly recognized that the affidavit of parentage constituted a legal finding of paternity. However, when Mr. Davis requested a genetic test in 2011, the court should have granted that request. The court resolved the case \u2014 without ever saying explicitly that the request for a genetic test was denied \u2014 on the basis that Mr. Davis failed to produce anything that would allow him to rescind the affidavits of parentage after the 60-day window. However, that decision answered the wrong question (and the Majority opinion appears to make the same mistake).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Mr. Davis was not asking, under the terms of \u00a7 5-1028(d)(2)(i), to rescind the affidavits of parentage. He was asking, under the terms of \u00a7 5-1038(a)(2)(i)(2) and \u00a7 5-1029(b), for a genetic test.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As the preceding discussion shows, those standards are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>entirely different; finding that Mr. Davis had not met the standard in \u00a7 5-1028 has nothing to do with whether he can meet the standards in \u00a7 5-1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">In <em>Langston, supra, </em>this Court held that individuals who had previously formally acknowledged paternity in court\u2014 including in a consent decree \u2014 could later seek a genetic test pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 5-1029 and 5-1038. In my view, there is no basis in the statutes or their legislative history to conclude that an acknowledgement made in an affidavit of parentage executed shortly after a birth should be considered more impregnable from scientific verification than a formal acknowledgement made in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">In particular, on these facts, the only relevant basis for denying Mr. Davis a genetic test is set forth in \u00a7 5-1038(a)(2)(ii): if the court found that Mr. Davis did in fact know that the children were not biologically his when he signed the affidavits, then the declaration of paternity may not be modified or set aside.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Hence, a genetic test would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>futile under those circumstances, and a court could properly refuse to grant one. However, the Circuit Court never analyzed this issue at all; it examined \u00a7 5-1028, not \u00a7 5-1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\n<em>C. Whether a Genetic Test is Precluded by Res Judicata in this Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Finally, there is the basis on which the Majority opinion actually decides this <em>case </em>\u2014 res <em>judicata, </em>also called, perhaps more precisely, \u201cclaim preclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\n<em>The Standard for Claim Preclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Claim preclusion is \u201cbased upon the judicial policy that the losing litigant deserves no rematch after a defeat fairly suffered, in adversarial proceedings, on issues raised, or that should have been raised.\u201d <em>Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Cmty. Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>361 Md. 371, 391, 761 A.2d 899 (2000). If, long after a case has completed, a party comes up with a better argument than it previously made in the case, that party does not get a do-over. Likewise, claims that were required to be joined in the original case are waived unless they are asserted at that time; a party cannot begin a new case based on claims that should have been asserted before. <em>See Rowland v. Harrison, </em>320 Md. 223, 577 A.2d 51 (1990) (discussing the relationship between mandatory counterclaims and claim preclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">The Majority opinion quotes a rough rule of thumb for the application of claim preclusion that includes all matters that \u201ccould have been litigated in the first suit.\u201d Majority op. at 307, 135 A.3d at 422 <em>(quoting Prince George\u2019s County v. Brent, </em>414 Md. 334, 342, 995 A.2d 672 (2010)).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, the test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>for claim preclusion is not (and has never been) whether a matter \u201ccould have been litigated in the first suit.\u201d Otherwise, there would be no such concept as the permissive joinder of claims \u2014 a party would be compelled to join all possible claims and counterclaims (at the risk of waiving a claim that <em>could </em>have been joined in an earlier case). <em>See Kent Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. Bilbrough, </em>309 Md. 487, 497, 525 A.2d 232 (1987) (\u201cTo make the scope of \u201cclaim\u201d co-extensive with permissive joinder of claims in pleadings would have the same effect as a mandatory joinder for pleading purposes of all claims which the original plaintiff has against any original defendant.\u201d). Thus, this quoted phrase is not a definitive statement of claim preclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Instead, claim preclusion applies when (1) the parties in the present litigation are the same or in privity with the parties to the earlier dispute, (2) the claim presented in the current action is identical to the one determined in the prior adjudication and (3) there was a final judgment on the merits on the claim in the prior litigation. <em>See Powell v. Breslin, </em>430 Md. 52, 64, 59 A.3d 531 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\n<em>Claim Preclusion as to Rescission of the Affidavits of Parentage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">I agree with the Majority opinion that this standard would be met to the extent that the Circuit Court construed the 2011 litigation as a contest over rescission of the affidavits of parentage on the grounds of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact. Certainly, the parties are the same: Mr. Davis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>and the Bureau were parties in 2011. The Circuit Court in 2011 found \u201cthat there is no fraud, duress, or mistake of material fact that would justify the rescission of the affidavits of Parentage properly executed.\u201d Hence, given the identical parties, identical claim, and final judgment on the merits in the previous action, Mr. Davis is precluded from advancing a fraud claim that would allow him to rescind the affidavits of parentage.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\n<em>Claim Preclusion as to the Request for a Genetic Test</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">That does not end this case, however. The core reason that claim preclusion does not apply to Mr. Davis\u2019 request for a mandatory genetic test under \u00a7 5-1038 is that there was no final judgment on the merits of that claim.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Majority describes the Circuit Court\u2019s order in 2011 as \u201cdenying\u201d Mr. Davis\u2019s request for a genetic test, Majority op. at 307, 135 A.3d at 422, but the order did not say that. The court simply issued an order requiring child support based on a finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>paternity. The order said nothing one way or the other about the genetic test claim, and claim preclusion does not arise out of nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Nor did the Circuit Court\u2019s oral ruling deny Mr. Davis\u2019 claim, as the Majority argues. The Majority opinion accurately points out that Mr. Davis asked for a genetic test several times during the 2011 proceeding and contends that the Circuit Court \u201cspecifically responded to Mr. Davis\u2019s repeated requests for a paternity test\u201d in its oral ruling. Majority op. at 309-11, 135 A.3d at 423-25. However, the block quotation that follows that assertion in the Majority opinion only discusses whether the affidavits of parentage could be rescinded under \u00a7 5-1028. Indeed, as part of that passage, the Circuit Court explicitly says that it is addressing <em>only </em>the \u00a7 5-1028 issue. In particular, the Circuit Court says, \u201cThe issue in this ease is not the fatherhood of the child. The issue in this case is whether there is the presence of fraud, mistake, or duress that would justify the rescission of an Affidavit____\u201d That is how the Bureau framed the case at the opening of the proceeding. At no point in the 2011 proceeding did the Circuit Court say anything at all about Mr. Davis\u2019 request for a genetic test. It simply did not address that issue.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">This fact distinguishes <em>Hardy v. Hardy, </em>2011 Ark. 82, 380 S.W.3d 354 (2011), which the Majority opinion cites as analogous to this case. In <em>Hardy, </em>a trial court in an earlier case had issued an order explicitly denying the father\u2019s motion for paternity testing because it was not in the child\u2019s best interest. <em>See Hardy, </em>380 S.W.3d at 356. In those circumstances, claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>preclusion properly followed from the final judgment on the merits in the earlier case. Here, however, neither the oral ruling nor the subsequent order said one word about a paternity test, so the claim is not precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\n<em>The Effect of the Order under \u00a7 5-1032</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">At the conclusion of the 2011 proceeding, there was a final order declaring paternity under \u00a7 5-1032. However, \u00a7 5-1038, by its very terms, describes an exception to the rules of finality as to paternity judgments. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5 \u2014 1038(a)(1) <em>(\u201cExcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, </em>a declaration of paternity in an order is final.\u201d) (emphasis added). Because a judgment is preclusive insofar as it is final as to an issue, this exception to finality also necessarily implies an exception to preclusion: an order under \u00a7 5-1032 does not preclude assertion of a right to a genetic test under \u00a7 5-1038. If it did, then no one could <em>ever </em>set aside an order based on a genetic test, because the order itself would preclude the genetic test, but the statutory text and our precedents both clearly show that such an order may be set aside based on a genetic test. <em>See Langston, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">A court may issue an order under \u00a7 5-1032 that is final, subject to the exceptions in \u00a7 5-1038. Such an order does not preclude a genetic test under \u00a7 5-1038, so it need not resolve any such claim before the court at that time; the claim can be reasserted later to set aside the order. When the court issued such an order regarding Mr. Davis in 2011, it left Mr. Davis\u2019 genetic test claim hanging: the claim had neither been granted nor denied.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Thus, when Mr. Davis came to court again in 2013 and asked for a genetic test to set aside the declaration of paterni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>ty, claim preclusion did not bar his request for that test (although it did bar an attempt to rescind the affidavits of parentage). The court should have either granted Mr. Davis\u2019s request or given a reason under \u00a7 5-1038 that Mr. Davis was not eligible for a paternity test. It was legal error to fail to do so, because, as noted above, \u00a7 5-1038 references \u00a7 5-1029, and the language in \u00a7 5-1029 requiring a test is mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">After signing an affidavit of parentage acknowledging that he was the father of Ms. Cook\u2019s children, which, according to Mr. Davis, he believed was true at the time, Mr. Davis learned that he might have been misled and that someone else was the children\u2019s father. (Ms. Cook herself apparently agrees that the father is another man). Since that time, Mr. Davis has consistently maintained that he is not the father of Ms. Cook\u2019s children and has requested a genetic test.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The Circuit Court in 2011 did not address his request for a genetic test and instead ruled on a completely different issue, so its ruling was not a final judgment on the merits of his genetic test claim. Hence, when Mr. Davis returned to court in 2013 and again requested a genetic test, he was not precluded from bringing this claim. As this Court has held in the past, genetic tests may be requested long after the judicial order that they are intended to challenge, and the statutory language provides that a court <em>must </em>grant a proper request for a genetic test, so there was no basis for denying Mr. Davis\u2019s request in 2013, at least at the summary judgment stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Unless the Circuit Court were to find that Mr. Davis is not credible when he says that, at the time he signed the Affidavit of parentage, he did not know that Ms. Cook\u2019s children were not his \u2014 a fact determination that is entrusted to the Circuit Court in the first instance \u2014 Mr. Davis should be granted a genetic test to determine, once and for all, whether he is the father of Ms, Cook\u2019s children.</p>\n<judges id=\"b383-8\">Chief Judge BARBERA and Judge WATTS advise that they join this opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\">.

According to the Circuit Court, the only issue before it was whether the affidavits should be rescinded. The court concluded that the answer was \"no\u201d and held that the children \"are [Mr. Davis\u2019] children by law, and that\u2019s the end of the story.\u201d In \"ending the story\u201d at that <em>point </em>\u2014 i.e., whether the affidavits should be rescinded \u2014 it never addressed the merits of whether Mr. Davis was entitled to a genetic test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b366-9\">.

The affidavit of parentage also has some significance independent of a contest over paternity and a court order.

But this is essentially no different than the fact that the name of the husband of a married mother appears on a child's birth certificate consistent with the statutory presumption. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5-1027(c); Maryland Code, Estates &amp; Trusts Article, \u00a7 1-206.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b371-7\">. While Mr. Davis' counsel has argued that Ms. Cook purposely misled Mr. Davis and committed fraud \u2014 presumably in an effort to satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\u201cfraud\u201d criterion for rescinding an affidavit of parentage \u2014 we need not reach that conclusion to hold that he is entitled to a genetic test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b373-6\">. The Majority opinion appears to concede that the Uniform Parentage Act (2000), like the amendments to \u00a7 5-1028, was drafted to comply with the federal welfare reform legislation. Majority op. at 330-31 n. 14, 135 A.3d at 435-36 n. 14. The Majority does not explain how it came to such a different understanding from the drafters of the uniform law as to how federal law contemplates that a request for a genetic test relates to a formal acknowledgement of paternity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\">. The Majority opinion includes other portions of Mr. Layman\u2019s testimony in a footnote. <em>See </em>Majority op. at 334-35 n. 15, 135 A.3d at 438-39 n. 15. Those excerpts simply confirm the analysis of the statutory structure set forth in pp. 309-15, 135 A.3d at 423-27 above and says nothing about precluding genetic testing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b376-6\">. Perhaps this is because the Bureau has consistently characterized Mr. Davis' position as challenging the validity of the affidavits under \u00a7 5-1028. It did so when Mr. Davis was <em>pro se </em>in the first proceeding in 2011, referring to Mr. Davis's claim as one to \"challenge the validity of those Affidavits under [\u00a7 5-1028],\u201d and it has continued to do so throughout this case, including in its brief before us in which it stated that \"Mr. Davis, however, seeks not to rescind a judicial paternity declaration under \u00a7 5-1038, but rather to rescind the affidavits of parentage that established his legal paternity under \u00a7 5-1028.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">This is simply mistaken. Mr. Davis never asked to rescind the affidavits in the 2011 proceeding. He said, \"I\u2019m not asking for anything else. I\u2019m just asking for a paternity test to actually prove paternity.\u201d Although his counsel did argue before us that there was a basis for rescinding the affidavits, his opening brief clearly continued to seek a paternity test quite independently of the validity of the affidavits \u2014 in particular, one of the headers of his opening brief was, \"Sections 5-1029 and 5-1038(a)(2)(i)(2) of the Family Law Article and <em>Langston v. Riffe </em>Entitle Appellant to Obtain a Paternity Test.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b376-8\">. At the time that Mr. Davis made his first request, during the hearing in the 2011 case, there was not yet a declaration of paternity to modify or set aside, However, \u00a7 5-1029 has no explicit time limits; a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>may request a genetic test during or after the proceeding. One might conclude from the respective placements of \u00a7 5-1029 and \u00a7 5-1038 that a genetic test requested during the proceeding is for use during the bench trial under \u00a7\u00a7 5-1024 through 5-1027 and a genetic test requested after the proceeding is to set aside an order under \u00a7 5-1038, so Mr. Davis should have waited until the order issued before he requested a test. However, it seems very odd to require a litigant to sandbag a court; it seems more plausible that the General Assembly intended that one can request a genetic test that will be used under \u00a7 5-1038 even before the order has been issued. Hence, Mr. Davis could make his request when he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">As a related point, the Circuit Court in 2013 wrote that there never was an order declaring that Mr. Davis was the father of Ms. Cook\u2019s children. However, while the 2011 order never explicitly said that Mr. Davis was the father, it did say, \u201cthe Defendant [Mr. Davis] has a legal obligation to support the children identified in the Complaint for Child Supportf.]\u201d The basis of this statement was the court\u2019s prior oral ruling, \"These are your children by law, and that\u2019s the end of the story.\u201d As a result, the Circuit Court\u2019s written order, based on its clear oral ruling, was sufficient to constitute a declaration of paternity under \u00a7 5-1032.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\">. At the 2011 hearing the Bureau attempted, somewhat unsuccessfully, to establish that Mr. Davis knew that he was not the father at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>time he executed the affidavits, which would have rendered his request for a genetic test moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b378-11\">. The original version of this quotation was more qualified in describing this rule of thumb:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-12\">The doctrine of res judicata is that a judgment between the same parties and their privies is a final bar to any other suit upon the same cause of action, and is conclusive, not only as to all matters that have been decided in the original suit, but as to all matters which with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>propriety could have been litigated in the first suit, <em>-where the court had jurisdiction, proceedings were regular, and his omission -was due to his own negligence.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-9\"><em>Alvey v. Alvey, </em>225 Md. 386, 390, 171 A.2d 92 (1961) (emphasis added). Even if this were a complete statement of the law, Mr. Davis would not be precluded on his paternity test on the ground that the paternity test \"could have been litigated in the first suit\u201d in 2011, because Mr, Davis did not omit any claims due to his own negligence (he asked for a paternity test), and arguably the proceedings here were not regular in any event, because the judge did not rule explicitly on a significant claim before the court. However, this is not a complete statement of the law. The actual legal standard differs significantly from this rough description, as outlined in the text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\">. The Majority asserts that this is \"an argument never raised below before [the Circuit Court] in 2013, nor before the Court of Special Appeals[.]\u201d Majority op. at 307, 135 A.3d at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">However, in the complaint initiating the 2013 case, Mr. Davis alleged, \"The Court did not address the repeated requests made by Mr. Davis throughout the proceeding for a blood test to prove he was not the biological father <em>(see </em>Family Law Article Sections 5-1029 and 5-1038) and made no decision regarding his requests.\u201d Counsel for the Bureau understood this contention, because Bureau counsel began oral argument at the 2013 hearing by saying, \"The other allegation in the Complaint is the Court didn\u2019t address the Defendant\u2019s request for blood test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Before the Court of Special Appeals, Mr. Davis argued in his opening brief, \"The Circuit Court [in 2013] erred by ... relying on Judge Mitchell\u2019s reasoning and analysis, when section 5-1038(a)(2)(i)2 was never considered and certainly never addressed by Judge Mitchell.\u201d Before us, too, Mr. Davis stated in his opening brief, \"Judge Mitchell never considered Davis's multiple requests for a paternity test, and he never made any express ruling on the issue.\u201d He added in his reply brief, \"Because that court refused to consider any fact or issue other than Davis having signed the affidavits of Parentage, there was no hearing on issues involved in the section 5 \u2014 1038(a)(2)(i)2 claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">It is evident from the record that Mr. Davis has argued from the beginning of the instant case that the 2011 trial never decided the \u00a7 5-1038 claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b381-9\">. To the extent that the Majority opinion believes that the trial court\u2019s silence concerning Mr. Davis\u2019 request for a genetic test means that the court implicitly decided that issue when it held that there was no showing of fraud that would justify rescission of the affidavits of parentage, such a belief cannot be based on the law governing genetic tests or affidavits of parentage. There is no requirement to show fraud to obtain a genetic test under \u00a7 5-1029 and \u00a7 5-1038, so the court\u2019s ruling on that issue did not decide the genetic test claim. And, as <em>Langston </em>illustrated, the fact that a paternity order is otherwise final does not disqualify one from later seeking a genetic test. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s ruling concerning the affidavits of parentage did not necessarily decide anything as to the request for a genetic test. The supposition that the trial court intended to do so is sheer speculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b382-9\">. In this respect, the Majority opinion misconstrues the reason that I do not think that Mr. Davis is precluded here. It is not, as the Majority opinion suggests, that I think that \"genetic testing was not a specific claim in issue\u201d in 2011. Majority op. at 310, 135 A.3d at 424. Mr. Davis certainly had asserted this claim. Rather, the Circuit Court never <em>resolved, </em>this issue, because it never said anything about the claim. Hence, there was never a final judgment on the merits of this claim, and claim preclusion cannot apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
