At the core of this case is whether the admission of this evidence likely influenced the jury\u2019s determination of liability for Perry\u2019s injuries. Petitioner, Moran Perry (\u201cPerry\u201d) filed suit against Respondent, Asphalt Concrete Services, Inc. (\u201cACS\u201d), Higher Power Trucking, LLC (\u201cHigher Power\u201d) and William Johnson, II (\u201cJohnson\u201d) for injuries he suffered when he was struck by a dump truck owned by Higher Power and operated by Johnson. The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County allowed into evidence witness testimony regarding Johnson\u2019s lack of liability insurance coverage at the time of the accident. We conclude that this was legal error. Evidence of lack of insurance coverage had no causal relationship to the injuries suffered by Perry and was thus irrelevant to both the claims of negligent hiring and ordinary negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">On April 28, 2009, Perry was crossing the intersection of Opossumtown Pike and Thomas Johnson Drive in Frederick, Maryland when he was struck by a 2007 Kenworth dump truck operated by Johnson, and owned by Higher Power. As a result of the accident, Perry suffered head trauma and rib fractures. ACS had hired Higher Power to haul asphalt and stone to St. John\u2019s Regional Catholic Church, where ACS was paving a children\u2019s play pad. A preliminary investigation by Officer Joseph Palkovic revealed that neither Johnson nor Higher Power had liability insurance covering the truck because of a lapse in payment on the insurance policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>On April 11, 2012, Perry filed his initial complaint in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Perry alleged negligence against Higher Power, Johnson, and ACS.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also alleged that ACS was negligent in its hiring and supervision of Higher Power. After the completion of discovery, ACS filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on August 30, 2013 contending there was no dispute that Johnson and ACS did not have an employer-employee relationship. ACS also contended that even if it should have known of Johnson\u2019s license and insurance status, this was not the proximate cause of the accident.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court denied ACS\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment. On September 20, 2013, ACS filed a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to exclude evidence that Johnson had a suspended license and that the truck was uninsured at the time of the accident. With respect to lack of insurance, ACS argued that it was inadmissible because \u201c[liability insurance, based on [Maryland Rule] 5-411, generally speaking can\u2019t be admitted [ ] on the issue of proximate cause of an accident or negligence.\u201d The court decided to reserve its ruling on this motion until it had \u201cmore of a factual basis,\u201d indicating that if the evidence of insurance came in, it would be \u201cstrictly [for] the limited purpose of the negligent hiring and whether a reasonable hirer would have determined that and acted accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">On September 27, 2013, Perry filed a \u201cMotion for Leave to File First Amended Complaint\u201d to reflect that Higher Power \u201cwas not in good standing according to the publicly available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>records of the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation at the time of the accident.\u201d Thus, Perry sought to dismiss Higher Power as a separately named defendant because Higher Power \u201cwas simply a trade name under which [Johnson] was unlawfully operating his dump truck business.\u201d The proposed first amended complaint alleged the same counts of negligence and negligent hiring but substituted Johnson for Higher Power in the negligent hiring count. The court granted Perry\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The first amended complaint contained the following assertions:</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">COUNT I (Negligence \u2014 All Defendants)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">* * $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">11. Johnson, as the operator of the truck which struck Perry, at all times material to this Complaint, was the agent, servant and/or employee of ACS, acting at the direction and control of ACS and for the financial benefit of ACS. As such, ACS and Johnson owed duties of care to Perry and members of the public at large to lawfully operate the truck in a safe and reasonable manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\">12. On or about April 28, 2009, ACS and Johnson breached the duties of care owed to Perry by (1) failing to operate the vehicle in a reasonably safe manner; (2) failing to travel at a safe speed; (3) failing to stop or avoid Perry while he was a pedestrian; (4) operating the vehicle in violation of Maryland law regarding registration, licensure and insurance; and (5) being otherwise careless while operating his vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\">13. As a result of ACS\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s breaches of the duties of care owed to Perry, he sustained substantial damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">$ H*</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>COUNT II (Negligent Hire and Supervision \u2014 ACS)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-4\">15. At all times material to this Complaint, ACS hired Johnson to act for its financial benefit and Johnson was subject to ACS\u2019s direction and control. As such, ACS owed Perry and members of the public at large [a duty] to take reasonable measures, both at the time it hired Johnson and throughout its employment of Johnson, to ensure that Johnson conducted himself in [a] lawful and prudent manner while operating vehicles on behalf of ACS. Those duties include, but are not limited to, ACS\u2019s duty to make sure that Johnson was a properly licensed driver, operating a lawfully registered and insured vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">16. On or about April 28, 2009, ACS breached the duties of care it owed to Perry by employing Johnson, who was not a properly licensed driver and was unlawfully operating an unregistered and uninsured dump truck which struck Perry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">17. As a result of ACS\u2019s breaches of the duties of care owed to Perry, he sustained substantial damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Trial began on October 7, 2013. Perry was the first witness. He testified about the extent of his injuries, the effect the injuries had on his everyday activities, and his medical treatment following the accident. After Perry\u2019s testimony, in a conversation with the court that occurred outside the presence of the jury, ACS repeated the argument it made in its September 20, 2013 motion <em>in limine </em>that evidence of lack of insurance through the testimony of Officer Joseph Palkovic should not be admitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\">[THE COURT]: Well, one of the problems I have had in thinking this through is this. I think part of what you said is a hundred percent correct because really before the jury can reach a verdict on the negligent hiring they first have to reach a verdict on the negligence. If the jury finds [Johnson] was not negligent in the operation of that vehicle then obviously .... how could there be a negligent hiring. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>the two are being tried together.... So that\u2019s the issue I have is that I think it\u2019s relevant to the hiring count, the negligent hiring count, but not particularly to the negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: May I? Your Honor, you\u2019re way ahead. The issue first is whether or not he\u2019s our employee or an independent contractor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">[THE COURT]: Well, yeah, that\u2019s of course the big issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP-\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s the prime \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s the huge issue. And if we get in evidence through a police officer that says this guy was uninsured, the bell\u2019s rung, the prejudice is done, and we\u2019ve got a mistrial on our hands....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI\">[THE COURT]: Well, no you don\u2019t get \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t get a mistrial granted because that\u2019s what I was just about to say. I mean there might be a curative instruction right now.... I mean it\u2019s only admissible against [ACS] \u2014 if they find that Johnson, II was an agent or an employee, only then is it admissible for the negligent hiring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Right. But there\u2019s no basis\u2014 there\u2019s no foundation for that to be introduced at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXS\">[THE COURT]: What do you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: There\u2019s no evidence that he was our employee. So the jury\u2019s going to hear it and assume that \u2014 you know, it was introduced that he\u2019s our driver and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">[THE COURT]: Well, I assume they\u2019ll tie it up, that there will be evidence that it (sic) was the employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I mean \u2014 Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-10\">[THE COURT]: I understand you say he\u2019s not, but their evidence \u2014 because they say he is.... I mean the rule or the principle exists to prevent the jury from knowing that there is insurance on the theory that it would encourage \u2014 so what is the point of not having insurance.... [Perry is] trying to get in the opposite[,] that there was no insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhY\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:]: Right. In the effort to show that we are the insured party____Which is totally inadmis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>sible____the implication is that if [Johnson] doesn\u2019t that we do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">[THE COURT]: Well, no that\u2019s ... [t]o say someone didn\u2019t have it doesn\u2019t mean to say everyone else has it____That\u2019s not a logical inference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: In this case he [Johnson] actually did have a policy of insurance. That\u2019s I guess the big issue. There was a policy of insurance. He did have one through Progressive, and it covered this accident. It just simply lapsed for nonpayment a month before. What does the fact that he \u2014 the insurance lapsed for nonpayment have to do with any issue in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">[THE COURT]: When was he hired to do this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af6\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: This particular job? Two weeks before April 28th. They had an ongoing relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av\">[THE COURT]: So a check would have revealed the insurance had lapsed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Wait a minute. How would a check reveal that his insurance had lapsed? To us? I can\u2019t check your insurance to find out whether or not it\u2019s valid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab\">[THE COURT]: Well, you can ask me. Show me your insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And he did. He gave us the policy and said it was valid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-12\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, no, he never provided any proof of insurance at all until after the accident. And that\u2019s the testimony from the ACS employees. And that\u2019s what ACS\u2019s file indicates. And also, what we\u2019re doing here is ... establishing it right through the ACS employees\u2019 testimony that, look, hey, when we hire a driver we check two things: he\u2019s got a valid license and he\u2019s got insurance [ ] And what I\u2019m trying to demonstrate is they violated their own policies when they hired this guy because he didn\u2019t produce any proof of insurance____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">The court decided that Perry should call ACS\u2019s employees to establish a foundation for an employment relationship before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>it would rule on the admissibility of the evidence of lack of insurance \u201c[b]ecause there\u2019s too many factual disputes here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ao\">Burt Maggio (\u201cMaggio\u201d), President of ACS at the time of the accident, was next to testify. Perry produced a fax cover sheet dated April 3, 2009 and asked Maggio to read a message on the sheet. Upon ACS\u2019s objection, the parties approached the bench and the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It was identified. I understand, but it wasn\u2019t moved into evidence, so I didn\u2019t want him reading from it. But the more important thing is, the issue as I understand what they\u2019re trying to prove is the fact that Higher Power didn\u2019t have liability insurance. This demonstrates that there\u2019s (unintelligible) to produce a W-9. And a W-9 is a certificate of liability insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">[THE COURT]: All right. I\u2019m missing something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: There\u2019s no duty to require that of an independent contractor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">[THE COURT]: Well, the issue is \u2014 the date here is April 3rd?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">[THE COURT]: When was the accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: April 28th. And this was the second request. The original request was on March 6th, and then we can show all the job tickets of them working with this (unintelligible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\">[THE COURT]: Why were they requesting this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That was part of their policy to request it ____ [w]hether we request it or not, it is a requirement in Maryland \u2014 it\u2019s the law that [a] trucking company has, one, liability insurance, and two, uses licensed drivers. We\u2019re not required to enforce that law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-13\">[THE COURT]: All right. I\u2019m going to overrule your objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">Maggio read the message on the fax cover sheet to the jury in open court: \u201cHi. On March 11th, I sent you a request for a revised W-9 and certif\u00edcate of liability insurance. I still have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>not received either of these from you. Please send them to us ASAP. Thanks, Samantha.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Maggio stated that prior to using a truck operator on a project, ACS would request the truck operator provide, among other things, a certificate of liability insurance because the State of Maryland requires that vehicles be insured and \u201cto make sure that they [the truck operators] had insurance.\u201d Maggio was then asked to read into the record some handwritten notes contained in the April 3 fax cover sheet: \u201cHigher Power. Still have not received anything from them. Second request. I called and LM [left message] too.\u201d He further stated that ACS required proof of insurance because some of their customers required them to show proof of insurance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Next, Maggio testified to the nature of ACS\u2019s dealings with Higher Power. Based on how many trucks it needed for a project and how many hours it needed the trucks to operate, an ACS dispatcher would call various hauling companies to determine if they were available. ACS compensated Higher Power on an hourly basis. According to Maggio, a truck operator\u2019s \u201cclock starts\u201d when he or she picks up the first load from the materials supplier and heads to the job site. He pointed out that the only instruction ACS would give to truck operators was where to dump the material after they arrived at the job site. A truck operator would be free to go if the load dropped off satisfied the requirements of a project, otherwise, an ACS dispatcher or superintendent would ask them to go back to the supplier to pick up another load. Further, ACS does not dictate the route a truck operator uses to get to a site. Truck operators had the discretion to go to McDonald\u2019s for lunch, take a cigarette break, or do another job prior to completing ACS\u2019s job. Maggio also stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>ACS reserved the right to dock a truck operator\u2019s hourly pay if it felt the operator took too long to complete a job.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">On cross-examination, Maggio stated that in April 2009, ACS had fifteen employees and that Johnson was not an employee, but instead worked for Higher Power. He stated that ACS employees received a salary, health care benefits, 401 (k) participation, paid holidays, and other perks such as free driveway repairs. Johnson did not receive any of these benefits from ACS.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">After Maggio\u2019s testimony, Perry made a request to call Officer Joseph Palkovic as the next witness and the following exchange occurred outside the presence of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I mean, Your Honor, we still have the same issue with the insurance....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">[THE COURT]: Well, you don\u2019t have the same foundation issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: In terms of employment? Is that what\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">[THE COURT]: Well, I mean, you don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough information to generate a genuine jury issue as to that [the existence of an employment relationship]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No, Your Honor. I do disagree that there is enough information____ Obviously we noted our objection[,] so that\u2019s obviously going to be subject to your ruling [ ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">The court, finding that there was now enough evidence to establish a foundation as to ACS and Johnson\u2019s employment relationship, and over ACS\u2019s objection, granted Perry\u2019s request. The jury returned to the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">Officer Palkovic testified that he responded to the scene of the accident on April 28, 2009, where Johnson identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>himself as the driver who struck the person in the intersection. He stated that Johnson produced evidence of insurance. Over ACS\u2019s objection, the court allowed Officer Palkovic to testify that a further investigation revealed that the insurance policy on the truck Johnson drove was not valid due to a lapse in payment. On cross-examination, Officer Palkovic testified that he determined Higher Power was the owner of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">Next, Perry called Blake Wood, project manager for ACS at the time of the accident. Mr. Wood stated that he requested Johnson\u2019s certificate of insurance and driver\u2019s license, and expected that the office manager would notify him if the paperwork was not received. He elaborated that he would not have hired Johnson without a certif\u00edcate of insurance because it would be illegal and insurance is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Prior to resting his case, Perry called additional witnesses to testify on the subject of insurance. First, he called Samantha Mentzer, an ACS employee who worked in the front office at the time of the accident. She testified that her handwriting on the fax cover sheet introduced during Maggio\u2019s testimony read, \u201cHigher Power, still have not received anything from them. Second request. I called and ... left message too.\u201d Second, Perry called Diane Moses, a claims specialist with Progressive Insurance Company.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court overruled ACS\u2019s objections, and allowed Moses to testify that Higher Power was listed as the insured party on the certificate of insurance providing comprehensive coverage for the 2007 Kenworth truck. She elaborated that this policy did not provide liability coverage and had been canceled on March 14, 2009 for nonpayment. Based on her review of the insurance file, Progressive did not provide ACS with documentation regarding the policy prior to the date of the accident. Progressive also did not send documentation to ACS regarding the policy\u2019s lapse on March 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>After Perry rested his case and while the jury was excused from the courtroom, ACS moved that Perry\u2019s requested jury instruction regarding the requirement of liability insurance<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> be stricken. ACS\u2019s attorney explained that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t be even discussing liability insurance because it\u2019s not relevant to the issue of whether or not ... Mr. Johnson was negligent.\u201d The court then called the jury back into the courtroom to hear closing arguments. The court gave the jury, in pertinent part, the following instructions regarding the law, effectively overruling ACS\u2019s request to strike Perry\u2019s proposed jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-4\">The violation of a statute which is a cause of plaintiffs injuries or damages is evidence of negligence. I\u2019m going to read you some motor vehicle statutes that if you find [they] were violated and the violation was the cause of the injuries, it is evidence of negligence.... <em>Motor vehicles must be covered by a liability insurance policy which provides for the applicable amount of coverage required by Maryland law. A person who knows or has reason to know that a motor vehicle is not covered by a liability insurance policy as required may not drive the vehicle, or if he is the owner of the vehicle knowingly permit another person to drive it. </em>All right, negligence is deemed something that a person using reasonable care would not do, or not doing something that a person using reasonable care would do. Reasonable care means that caution (indiscernible) skill a reasonable person would use under similar circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">An employer has a duty not to employ any person who poses an unreasonable risk to other persons who would foreseeably come into contact with that employee because of the employment relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">An employer who breaches this duty is responsible for any foreseeable injuries or damages caused by the conduct or actions of any such employee. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>For the plaintiff to recover damages, the defendant\u2019s negligence must be a cause of the plaintiffs injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\">$ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\">All right, in the event that you find for the plaintiff on the issue of liability, then you must go on to consider the question of damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">(emphasis added). The jury returned a verdict in favor of Perry. The verdict sheet indicated that the jury found: (1) Johnson was the agent, servant, and/or employee of ACS; (2) ACS was negligent in its hiring of Johnson; (3) Johnson was negligent in failing to properly operate his vehicle on April 28, 2009, and that his negligence was a proximate cause of the injuries to Perry; and (4) Perry was not contributorily negligent. It awarded Perry $29,500 for past medical expenses and $500,000 for pain and suffering, physical impairment, diminished quality of life, and inconveniences in the past and future.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">On October 22, 2013, ACS filed a \u201cMotion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict or, in the alternative, a Motion for New Trial.\u201d The trial court denied this motion on November 7, 2013. ACS appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which, in a reported opinion, reversed the judgment entered in favor of Perry.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The intermediate appellate court concluded that \u201c[bjecause there was no causal link shown between Mr. Johnson\u2019s lack of insurance and the accident, [ ] lack of insurance was not relevant to the claim of negligent hiring, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>and the court erred in admitting it.\u201d <em>Asphalt &amp; Concrete Servs., Inc. v. Perry, </em>221 Md.App. 235, 266, 108 A.3d 558, 576 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">On April 17, 2015, this Court granted a writ of certiorari, <em>Perry v. Asphalt &amp; Concrete Servs., </em>442 Md. 515, 113 A.3d 624 (2015), to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">Did the trial court commit an abuse of discretion by admitting the evidence of insurance?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">As explained below, we shall hold that, for the purposes of the instant case, evidence of lack of insurance coverage was inadmissible because it was not the proximate cause of the complaining party\u2019s injuries. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals for the reasons explained in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Our standard of review on the admissibility of evidence depends on whether the \u201cruling under review was based on a discretionary weighing of relevance in relation to other factors or on a pure conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Parker v. State, </em>408 Md. 428, 437, 970 A.2d 320, 325 (2009) (quoting <em>J.L. Matthews, Inc. v. Md.-Nat'l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>368 Md. 71, 92, 792 A.2d 288, 300 (2002)). Generally, \u201cwhether a particular item of evidence should be admitted or excluded is committed to the considerable and sound discretion of the trial court\u201d and reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Ruffin Hotel Corp. of Md., Inc. v. Gasper, </em>418 Md. 594, 619, 17 A.3d 676, 691 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, we determine whether evidence is relevant as a matter of law. <em>State v.

Perry claims that the evidence of Johnson\u2019s lack of insurance demonstrates it was more likely than not that ACS violated its duty to use reasonable care in hiring Johnson because it knew or should have known of Johnson\u2019s inability to lawfully operate a dump truck. In response, ACS contends that admission of this evidence is contrary to Maryland Rule 5-411 which prohibits the admission of evidence of insurance to prove fault or liability and is irrelevant to the claim of negligent hiring. We shall discuss the admissibility of evidence of insurance generally and as it pertains to a party\u2019s liability for negligent hiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Relevance of Liability Insurance Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Under Maryland Rule 5-411, \u201c[ejvidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible upon the issue [of] whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully.\u201d Evidence of liability insurance may, however, be admissible if \u201coffered for another purpose, such as proof of agency, ownership, or control, or bias or prejudice of a wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>ness.\u201d Md. Rule 5-411. Derived from Federal Rule of Evidence 411, Rule 54:11 is designed to prevent the undue prejudice that may result when liability insurance is admitted because \u201cthe inference of fault from the fact of insurance coverage is a tenuous one, as is its converse.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 411 Notes of Advisory Committee. This rationale is consistent with the general framework of Maryland Rules 54102 and 5-403 which state, respectively, that \u201c[ejvidence that is not relevant is not admissible\u201d and \u201c[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\u201d In other words, when evidence of insurance is being offered for a purpose not prohibited by Rule 5-411, the court has broad discretion to admit or exclude evidence under the general principles of relevancy and Rule 54:03. 2 Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence, \u00a7 411.02 (Mark S. Brodin, ed., Matthew Bender 2d ed. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Establishing Liability for Negligent Hiring</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">An important issue at trial was determining the relationship between Johnson and ACS: was Johnson (1) an agent, servant, and/or employee of ACS (i.e., in an employment relationship where ACS was the employer) or (2) an independent contractor? The type of relationship is significant, because it would impact any determination of liability. Under the doctrine of <em>respondeat-superior, </em>an employer is vicariously liable for the acts of its employee, within the scope of employment, even if the employer does not commit any negligent acts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See Barclay v. Briscoe, </em>427 Md. 270, 282-83, 47 A.3d 560, 567-68 (2012). An employment relationship exists when the servant is subject to the master\u2019s control. <em>Globe Indem. Co. v. Victill Corp., </em>208 Md. 573, 581, 119 A.2d 423, 427 (1956). Contrast the employer relationship with that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>of an independent contractor: \u201c[pjersons who render service but retain control over the manner of doing it are not servants,\u201d but independent contractors. <em>Id. </em>When one engages an independent contractor, one \u201cis not responsible for incidental negligence while such agent is conducting the authorized transaction.\u201d <em>Gallagher\u2019s Estate v. Battle, </em>209 Md. 592, 602, 122 A.2d 93, 98 (1956). There are exceptions, however, to the general rule that one who hires an independent contractor is ordinarily not liable for that contractor\u2019s negligence. For example, an employer is liable for the acts of an independent contractor under the theory of negligent hiring if the harm is caused by \u201csome quality in the contractor which made it negligent for the employer to entrust the work to him.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 411 cmt. b (Am. Law Inst. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">At trial, the jury found Johnson to be the agent, servant and/or employee of ACS. Therefore, even if Perry failed to prove the negligent hiring count, ACS was liable under the doctrine of <em>respondeat-superior. </em>The trial court found there was enough evidence presented for the jury to determine the type of employment relationship that existed between Johnson and ACS. As we will later discuss, it is likely that the admission of the evidence of lack of insurance impacted the jury\u2019s verdict on this issue and as a result, the determination of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">To determine whether evidence is relevant to a claim of negligent hiring, we must analyze the elements of the claim. For a cause of action based in negligence, such as negligent hiring, \u201ca plaintiff must prove the existence of a duty owed by a defendant to him (or to a class of which he is a part), a breach of that duty, a legally cognizable causal relationship between breach of duty and the harm suffered, and damages.\u201d <em>Cramer v. Housing Opportunities Comm\u2019n of Montgomery Cty., </em>304 Md. 705, 712, 501 A.2d 35, 39 (1985). One is negligent if he or she breaches a duty he or she owes to another. \u201c[T]hat negligence is actionablef, however,] only if it is a proximate cause of the damage.\u201d <em>Cramer, </em>304 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>712-13, 501 A.2d at 39. Specifically, to establish liability in a negligent hiring claim, \u201cthe plaintiff must prove two links in the causal chain.\u201d <em>Cramer, </em>304 Md. at 713, 501 A.2d at 39. First, the plaintiff must show that the failure of an employer to undertake a reasonable inquiry resulted in the contractor\u2019s hiring. <em>Id. </em>Next, even \u201cif a negligent hiring is shown, the plaintiff still must prove that the hiring was a proximate cause of the [plaintiffs] injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As we look to the elements of the claim, we keep in mind that relevant evidence is \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-401.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">A. Negligent Hiring: Employer\u2019s Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Generally, an employer has a duty \u201cto use reasonable care to select employees competent and fit for the work assigned to them and to refrain from retaining the services of an unfit employee\u201d regardless of whether one engages an agent or independent contractor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Henley v. Prince George\u2019s Cty., </em>305 Md. 320, 336, 503 A.2d 1333, 1341 (1986). This duty extends to \u201cmembers of the public who would reasonably be expected to come into contact\u201d with the person or persons hired. <em>Id. </em>Truck drivers are reasonably expected to come into contact with pedestrians and other motorists. Thus, ACS owed a duty of reasonable care to those who came into contact with Johnson while he was transporting materials at the request of ACS.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Both Perry and the intermediate appellate court cite <em>Puckrein v. ATI Transport, Inc. </em>for the proposition that lack of liability insurance is relevant to the issue of whether ACS employed a competent person to work as a truck driver. 186 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>N.J. 563, 897 A.2d 1034 (2006). In <em>Puckrein, </em>the New Jersey Supreme Court concluded that evidence of a waste disposal company\u2019s failure to verify a truck company\u2019s insurance coverage was relevant to the truck driver\u2019s competence. Because New Jersey law requires every owner of a motor vehicle to maintain motor vehicle liability insurance coverage, insurance is \u201cthe <em>sine qua non </em>to the transport of goods on the roadways.\u201d <em>Puckrein, </em>897 A.2d at 1043. <em>See </em>N.J. Stat. Ann. 39:6B-1 (West 2012). Consequently, evidence of insurance was relevant to the driver\u2019s competence \u201cto haul waste and recyclables across state lines.\u201d <em>Puckrein, </em>897 A.2d at 1043. Citing <em>Puckrein, </em>the intermediate appellate court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-4\">ACS employees appeared to agree that they were \u201cnot allowed to\u201d have truck operators who did not produce insurance information \u201cbecause of the nature of the work\u201d they did. Accordingly, under the circumstances of this case, Mr. Johnson\u2019s lack of liability insurance was relevant to whether ACS employed a competent person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-5\"><em>Asphalt &amp; Concrete Servs., Inc., </em>221 Md.App. at 260-61, 108 A.3d at 573. The Court of Special Appeals noted, however, that \u201c[this] is not the end of the inquiry.\u201d <em>Asphalt &amp; Concrete Servs., Inc., </em>221 Md.App. at 261, 108 A.3d at 573. \u201cTo be relevant to the claim of negligent hiring, the employer\u2019s negligence in hiring someone with no liability insurance must be the proximate cause of Mr. Perry\u2019s injuries.\u201d <em>Asphalt &amp; Concrete Servs., Inc., </em>221 Md.App. at 261, 108 A.3d at 573-74. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Like New Jersey, Maryland requires vehicles to be covered by liability insurance. Transportation Article \u00a7 17-103. The purpose of this law \u201cis to ensure that those who own and operate motor vehicles registered in the State are \u2018financially able to pay compensation for damages resulting from motor vehicle accidents.\u2019 \u201d <em>Enterprise Leasing Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>341 Md. 541, 549, 671 A.2d 509, 514 (1996) (quoting <em>Pa. Nat\u2019l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 154, 416 A.2d 734, 736 (1980)). ACS hired Higher Power for the specific purpose of transporting materials to job sites. There was testimony from ACS that its policy and the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>of other companies in the industry is to make sure the truck drivers that are hired maintain insurance coverage on their vehicles. This policy is in place to ensure compliance with the law. The evidence at trial showed that ACS reached out to Higher Power twice to verify its insurance coverage. It follows that a trucking company or individual that does not have insurance coverage on its vehicles lacks one of the qualifications necessary to be \u201ccompetent\u201d for the job of hauling supplies. Clearly, this evidence is relevant to the issue of whether ACS breached its duty when it hired Higher Power for a job, despite never receiving proof of liability insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">B. Negligent Hiring: Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Next, we discuss the causation element of a negligent hiring claim. As the intermediate appellate court recognized, the negligent hiring must be the proximate cause of Perry\u2019s injury to be relevant to a negligent hiring claim. <em>Asphalt &amp; Concrete Servs., Inc., </em>221 Md.App. at 261, 108 A.3d at 573-74. Similarly, the crux of ACS\u2019s argument focuses on proximate cause. It argued that for an employer to be liable under a negligent hiring claim, the very quality that renders an employee \u201cincompetent\u201d must be the cause of the harm. Perry cites <em>Snowhite v. State, Use of Tennant, </em>243 Md. 291, 221 A.2d 342 (1966) to support his contention that the evidence of Johnson\u2019s lack of insurance is admissible because it is \u201cprobative on the issue of whether ACS exercised due care in hiring Johnson to transport paving materials to its job site.\u201d As previously discussed, we agree that the evidence of lack of insurance is relevant to the standard of care exercised by ACS but note that Perry\u2019s arguments do not address the element of proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Proximate cause consists of \u201c1) a cause in fact, and 2) a legally cognizable cause.\u201d <em>Pittway Corp. v. Collins, </em>409 Md. 218, 243, 973 A.2d 771, 786 (2009) (citation omitted). The \u201crequirement that specific negligent conduct be a legally cognizable cause\u201d involves a determination of whether it was foreseeable that the negligent act would cause the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>injury complained of in the case. <em>Henley, </em>305 Md. at 333, 503 A.2d at 1340. Section 435(2) of the Restatement (Second) of Torts states that an \u201cactor\u2019s conduct may be held not to be a legal cause of harm to another where after the event and looking back from the harm to the actor\u2019s negligent conduct, it appears to the court highly extraordinary that it should have brought about the harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">In <em>Cramer v. Hous. Opportunities Comm\u2019n of Montgomery Cty, </em>we held that evidence of the county housing commission\u2019s ready access to an employee\u2019s criminal and arrest records was admissible because the evidence was relevant to whether the commission was negligent as well as to the issue of causation. 304 Md. 705, 501 A.2d 35 (1985). The Housing Opportunities Commission of Montgomery County (\u201cHousing Commission\u201d) hired a building inspector despite the applicant\u2019s incomplete employment application, and without calling the applicant\u2019s listed references or conducting a criminal background check. At the time he was hired, the applicant had been charged with first degree burglary, sodomy, rape, and robbery. During a home inspection, the building inspector impermissibly learned that a particular residence, a townhouse rented from the Housing Commission, was occupied by a single mother and her two children. The building inspector later returned to the residence and raped the mother. We noted that \u201can employer may be guilty of negligence without incurring liability for the harm claimed.\u201d <em>Cramer, </em>304 Md. at 718, 501 A.2d at 41. We provided the following example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">An employer who hires an armed security guard without being possessed of any information concerning his fitness, and without conducting any investigation, is negligent. However, if it is a fact that the guard has an unblemished record and excellent reputation for trustworthiness, and that no potentially disqualifying information would have been obtained through the conduct of an appropriate inquiry, the employer has not been guilty of a <em>negligent hiring.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). In the example above, an employer, although negligent, will not be liable to a third party for harms later committed by the security guard because a rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>sonable inquiry of the applicant\u2019s fitness for the job at the time of hiring would not have provided the employer with knowledge of any adverse tendencies. Similarly, \u201cif [the building inspector] had been negligently hired but had assaulted a tenant of the [Housing Commission] previously unknown to him, in a nearby shopping center and during off-duty hours, there would be no causal relationship between the hiring and the assault\u201d because the hiring of the building inspector, though negligent, did not enable him to commit the wrongful act. <em>Cramer, </em>304 Md. at 713, 501 A.2d at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">In <em>Snowhite v. State, Use of Tennant, </em>we concluded that the references to an employer\u2019s truck liability insurance policy did not constitute prejudicial error. 243 Md. 291, 221 A.2d 342 (1966). Clarence Henderson, employee of Harold Snowhite,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> was delivering fuel in Snowhite\u2019s truck when he collided with decedent. The accident and decedent\u2019s death were the result of Henderson\u2019s negligent driving and driving while intoxicated. Henderson began drinking heavily two years prior to the accident and had a series of moving violations. During any given workday, Henderson frequented a bar on the same street where Snowhite\u2019s office was located. Testimony indicated that Snowhite went to this bar and asked Henderson to make a delivery on an occasion when Henderson appeared intoxicated. <em>Snowhite, </em>243 Md. at 299, 221 A.2d at 346. There, we identified three exceptions to the general rule of law prohibiting evidence that a defendant is insured against liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">1. Where the evidence is relevant to the cause of the accident or the liability of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">2. Where the reference to insurance is made by the defendant or his witness, in which event the testimony is admissible and is subject to legitimate comment and argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">3. Where the evidence is relevant to an issue of which of two or more defendants was the employer of the operator of the vehicle involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>Snowhite, </em>243 Md. at 302, 221 A.2d at 348 (citations omitted). At trial, Henderson testified to a statement made by Snowhite that if Henderson had additional accidents, Snowhite\u2019s company would no longer be able to retain its liability insurance. This Court concluded that this statement was admissible because it fell within the first exception to the general rule. Henderson\u2019s reference to insurance was in response to a question regarding Snowhite\u2019s knowledge of Henderson\u2019s driving record. Because Henderson\u2019s negligent driving and his driving while intoxicated were the very instrumentalities causing the accident, testimony about insurance was appropriate. Unlike <em>Snowhite, </em>in the case before us, lack of insurance coverage alone, without more, should not, and did not give ACS an indication of Johnson\u2019s abilities to operate a dump truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">We hold that for evidence of insurance to be admissible in a negligent hiring claim, the evidence must also be relevant to the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries. Here, the negligent hiring of Higher Power/Johnson was not, as a matter of law, the proximate cause of the accident. As testimony indicated, it was ACS\u2019s policy to hire independent drivers with liability insurance, but ACS\u2019s failure to comply with its policy was not the cause of Perry\u2019s injuries. By analogy, an individual lawfully operating a vehicle covered by liability insurance may nonetheless have a long accident history due to negligent driving or poor driving skills. Just as it would be illogical to assert that this individual\u2019s driving was prudent on a particular occasion because he or she had liability insurance coverage at the time, one cannot conclude the converse that an individual is a poor driver because insurance coverage had lapsed due to missed payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">In contrast to <em>Snowhite </em>and <em>Cramer, </em>where it was determined that the employer knew or should have known about a \u201cspecific quality\u201d of the independent contractor, and that quality was relevant to the cause of the plaintiffs injury, the alleged basis of the negligent hiring here, i.e., the lack of liability insurance coverage, was not the cause and effect of Perry\u2019s injury. Rather, this evidence may have been admissi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>ble if Perry demonstrated that the evidence of lack of insurance was relevant to ACS\u2019s actual or constructive knowledge of a specific quality of Johnson\u2019s that later contributed to Perry\u2019s injuries. Johnson\u2019s lack of liability insurance coverage was irrelevant to the claim of negligent hiring because it was not relevant to the proximate cause of Perry\u2019s injuries, and did not fall within any exceptions to the general rule against admitting evidence of insurance. Rule 5-402 provides that irrelevant evidence is not admissible. Thus, it was legal error for the trial court to admit the evidence of lack of insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s requirement that Perry establish a foundation of an employer-employee relationship prior to admitting evidence of lack of insurance did not address the element of proximate cause and was therefore, an improper basis for admitting the evidence. A court\u2019s \u201cfailure to consider the proper legal standard in reaching a decision constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Wilson-X v. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>403 Md. 667, 675, 944 A.2d 509, 514 (2008) (citing <em>Pasteur v. Skevofilax, </em>396 Md. 405, 433, 914 A.2d 113, 130 (2007)). The trial court disregarded its requirement that Perry establish a foundation when it allowed Perry to elicit testimony about notes on a fax sheet. These notes demonstrated that ACS had knowledge of Higher Power\u2019s failure to produce proof of insurance after two requests. Maggio\u2019s testimony regarding ACS\u2019s dealings with Higher Power/Johnson was germane to whether an employer-employee relationship existed. Over ACS\u2019s objection, however, the trial court allowed Maggio to read into the record notes on the fax cover sheet <em>before </em>Perry elicited testimony about the nature of ACS\u2019s dealings with Higher Power/Johnson.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> By allowing the evidence to be presented in a sequence that violated its own prerequisite, the court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Prejudicial Effect of Admitting Inadmissible Evidence of Lack of Insurance</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Even where evidence is wrongly admitted, under Maryland Rule 5 \u2014 103(a), \u201c[e]rror may not be predicated upon a ruling that admits ... evidence unless the party is prejudiced by the ruling.\u201d ACS argues that the admission of evidence prejudiced the jury\u2019s assessment of liability and damages because liability for the cause of the accident and Johnson\u2019s alleged agency relationship with ACS were in dispute. ACS reasons that because lack of liability insurance was not the proximate cause of the injury, that evidence unfairly prejudiced the jury\u2019s assessment of liability. As discussed above, we agree there was no causal relationship between the evidence of liability insurance or lack thereof and Perry\u2019s injuries. We emphasize that this result does not create a presumption of prejudice \u2014 there is prejudice only if the error complained of was not harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Next, ACS contends that the admission of evidence of insurance was prejudicial because it, in violation of Rule 5-411, suggested to the jury that ACS was the only insured defendant. Accordingly, ACS maintains, Perry would only receive compensation for his injuries if the jury found ACS liable. Because ACS did not point to any facts to support this contention,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we agree with the trial court that ACS\u2019s argument is flawed. The only way the jury would know that ACS was insured is if evidence of its insurance had been admitted. ACS also states that the trial court acknowledged the prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>lems that could arise from admitting the evidence of lack of insurance when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\">I think part of what you said is a hundred percent correct because really before the jury can reach a verdict on the negligent hiring they first have to reach a verdict on the negligence. If the jury finds [Johnson] was not negligent in the operation of that vehicle, then obviously____how could there be a negligent hiring. But the two are being tried together.... So that\u2019s the issue I have is that I think it\u2019s relevant to the hiring count, the negligent hiring count, but not particularly to the negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Despite this recognition, ACS notes that the trial court failed to give a curative instruction to the jury, an instruction, we note that all parties neglected to request timely. ACS further notes that the trial court failed to avoid prejudice by not taking action under Rules 2-502<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> or 2-503(b).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> ACS\u2019s brief before this Court merely cites these rules to support its statement that the trial court did not take steps to avoid the prejudice resulting from admission of the evidence of insurance. Because ACS does not explain how the trial court\u2019s action under these rules would have avoided prejudice, we find the argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Concluding that the admission of the evidence that Johnson lacked insurance coverage was prejudicial, the Court of Special Appeals cited <em>Derrick v. Rock, </em>218 Ark. 339, 236 S.W.2d 726, 729 (1951), where \u201cthe Supreme Court of Arkansas recognized that, when \u2018there are two or more defendants it is improper to show that one of them is not protected by insurance, and the admission of this evidence was reversible error because the jurorsf] minds likely were not indifferent to this fact in determining liability.\u201d <em>Asphalt &amp; Concrete Servs., Inc., </em>221 Md.App. at 266, 108 A.3d at 577. The Court of Appeals of Georgia has similarly recognized that evidence of a defendant\u2019s liability insurance coverage \u201cis not admissible in the trial of an action in tort, and it is the general rule that such evidence is not only irrelevant and immaterial but harmful and prejudicial.\u201d <em>McRee v. Atlanta Paper Co., </em>84 Ga.App. 181, 65 S.E.2d 832, 832 (1951). This Court has also discussed the prejudicial effect that the admission of irrelevant and immaterial evidence may have on a jury\u2019s determination of the issues in a case. In <em>Balt. Belt R.R. Co. v. Sattler, </em>105 Md. 264, 270, 65 A. 752, 754 (1907), the Court concluded that in a cause of action for trespass, evidence of defendant Baltimore Belt Railroad Company\u2019s violation of certain ordinances is \u201cnot only wholly irrelevant and immaterial, but would tend to prejudice the defendants in the trial of the real issues involved,\u201d It explained that violation of certain ordinances is evidence of breach of duty in negligence, a cause of action not raised in the pleadings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">As described previously, in the present case, evidence of lack of insurance was irrelevant and immaterial to the claim of negligent hiring. Because references to Johnson\u2019s lack of insurance coverage were not stricken from the record, the admission of that evidence probably influenced the jury in its determination of liability, resulting in prejudice to ACS.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">All parties and the trial court agreed that the evidence of laek of insurance was not admissible to establish the claim of ordinary negligence. The absence of an instruction to the jurors to disregard the evidence of lack of insurance and discount its relevance to the question of ACS\u2019s liability makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>it highly probable that the jury considered this evidence in violation of Rule 5-411\u2019s prohibition against admitting evidence of liability insurance or lack thereof for \u201cthe issue [of] whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully.\u201d When multiple individuals testified that ACS hired Johnson in violation of its company policy \u2014 ACS failed to verify Johnson\u2019s insurance coverage \u2014 this greatly increased the likelihood that the jury improperly inferred fault, as a result of the irrelevant evidence of Johnson\u2019s lack of insurance coverage, and considered that evidence in finding ACS liable under the theory of <em>respondeat-superior. </em>Evidence that ACS failed to verify Higher Power/Johnson\u2019s insurance coverage was not probative of ACS\u2019s control of Johnson\u2019s on-the-job performance, which is crucial in determining an alleged employer\u2019s liability under <em>respondeat-superior.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Therefore, the admission of such evidence was highly prejudicial to ACS because its consideration had no purpose but to lead the jury to draw impermissible inferences as to liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">As to the negligent hiring claim, the court explained to the parties, but not the jury, that the evidence of insurance was limited to the purpose \u201cof the negligent hiring and whether a reasonable hirer would have determined that and acted accordingly.\u201d It further noted that \u201cthere might be a curative instruction right now\u201d because the evidence was only admissible for the negligent hiring claim if the jury found \u201cJohnson, II was an agent or an employee\u201d of ACS. The court did not give this instruction or any other instruction to the jury to disregard the evidence of lack of insurance. Absence of such an instruction leaves a void in which the implication arises that the jury considered the evidence of lack of insurance to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>relevant to the issues of duty, breach, causation, and damages. For reasons previously discussed, this was an inaccurate application of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The evidence of lack of insurance was brought up repeatedly during trial. The testimony of Burt Maggio and Samantha Mentzer highlighted the fact that ACS hired Higher Power/Johnson despite Higher Power\u2019s failure to submit proof of insurance after two requests, in violation of ACS\u2019s internal policy. As a matter of law, ACS\u2019s apparent negligence in hiring Higher Power/Johnson to haul asphalt without verifying that Higher Power maintained liability insurance was not a proximate cause of Perry\u2019s injuries. Consequently, the court\u2019s admission of this evidence was an error. Because the determination of liability was a prime issue in the case and the jury was not instructed to disregard the evidence of lack of insurance in reaching its verdict, there is a reasonable probability that the jury considered the irrelevant evidence in finding ACS liable for Perry\u2019s injuries. As a result, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals and conclude that a new trial is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY MORAN PERRY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-9\">. The preliminary investigation also revealed that Johnson had a suspended driver's license and the registration on the truck had expired. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>The intermediate appellate court did not address the admissibility of the evidence of the driver's license and registration because these issues \u201cmay not arise in a new trial.\u201d <em>Asphalt &amp; Concrete Servs., Inc. v. Perry, </em>221 Md.App. 235, 266 n. 6, 108 A.3d 558, 577 n. 6 (2015). Perry appeals only the issue of the admissibility of evidence with regard to liability insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b63-6\">. Neither Higher Power nor Johnson responded to the initial complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b63-7\">. As ACS describes and we later discuss, proximate cause is a necessary element in actions of negligence, including a claim of negligent hiring. ACS asserts that the element of proximate cause is not satisfied because \"the fact that someone is uninsured ... does not make it more likely than not that they will be involved in an accident.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b64-10\">. Proceeding on the fact that Higher Power was essentially Johnson, and vice versa, the effect of the amended complaint was to remove Higher Power as a named defendant and to treat Johnson and Higher Power as one and the same. Even though Higher Power was no longer a party to the case, at trial, witnesses testified to their dealings with Higher Power as an entity. For purposes of clarity, we refer to Higher Power and Johnson separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b69-5\">. Samantha Mentzer worked in the ACS office at the time of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b69-6\">. Prior to his position as President of ACS, Maggio was president of another paving and concrete business, O\u2019Leary Asphalt, Maggio stated that O\u2019Leary Asphalt also required proof of insurance for vehicles on job sites for the same reasons as ACS.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b70-13\">. Maggio gave the following example: If it takes a truck operator 2.5 hours to complete a 30 minute job and the operator says \"hey, traffic was slow, the dispatcher would then get in his truck and try to find out, well, where did you go?\u201d If a dispatcher discovered a truck operator is parked at McDonald\u2019s with an active load, ACS would not compensate for that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b71-6\">. On October 7, 2013, ACS filed a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to preclude testimony of Diane Moses anticipating that \u201cPlaintiff will attempt to elicit testimony from Ms. Moses that there was no insurance on the 2007 Kenworth dump truck as of April 28, 2009.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\">.

ACS presented four questions on appeal to the intermediate appellate court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-9\">1.

Did the [CJircuit [C]ourt err in denying ACS\u2019s motion to dismiss Mr. Perry's initial complaint?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-11\">3.

While most claims of negligent hiring or retention arise in a context where'the employer-employee relationship is undisputed, we noted in <em>Evans v.

ACS cites <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Weddington, </em>320 Md. 674, 579 A.2d 762 (1990) for this proposition. In <em>Morris, </em>after the jury heard the defendant was uninsured, the jury award to the plaintiffs was <em>significantly below </em>the amount of damages proven during trial. 320 Md. at 681, 579 A.2d at 765. Based on these objective facts, this Court held that \"the mere mention of the lack of [ ] insurance so contaminated the trial that the motion for mistrial should have been granted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An application of <em>Morris </em>to the present case yields a conclusion counter to ACS's assertion because here, evidence of lack of insurance would have been prejudicial if the jury gave Perry a <em>lesser </em>award than what he proved. Neither party asserts that Perry received a lower award than what was proven at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b86-8\">, Maryland Rule 2-502 is an expansive rule and it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">If at any stage of an action a question arises that is within the sole province of the court to decide, whether or not the action is triable by a jury, and if it would be convenient to have the question decided before proceeding further, the court, on motion or on its own initiative, may order that the question be presented for decision in the manner the court deems expedient. In resolving the question, the court may accept facts stipulated by the parties, may find facts after receiving evidence, and may draw inferences from these facts.

The court noted that \"[t]he most important test in determining whether an employment relationship exists is whether the employer has the right to control or direct the manner of work.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
