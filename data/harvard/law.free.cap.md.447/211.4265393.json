In both cases, the Commission concluded that under Md. Code (1991, 2008 Repl. Vol., 2015 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 9-806 of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cLE\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the amount owed to the Subsequent Injury Fund (\u201cthe SIF\u201d or \u201cthe Fund\u201d) by the employers, the Maryland Transit Administration (\u201cthe MTA\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Baltimore County (\u201cthe County\u201d), is 6.5% of the Commission\u2019s award of compensation prior to the deduction of any statutory offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">In the first case, the employer, the MTA, filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City a petition for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision in the MTA\u2019s case. On April 21, 2014, after a hearing, the Honorable Pamela J. White of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City entered an Order affirming the decision of the Commission. The MTA filed a timely Notice of Appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In the second case, the employer, the County, filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County a petition for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision in the County\u2019s case. Subsequently, both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>County and the SIF filed Motions for Summary Judgment. A hearing was held on July 29, 2014 before the Honorable Ruth A. Jakubowski of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Judge Jakubowski found that there were no issues of disputed fact and that the issue was strictly a matter of legal interpretation. On the same day, Judge Jakubowski entered an Order granting the SIF\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and denying the County\u2019s. The County filed a timely Notice of Appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. On December 17, 2014, the Court of Special Appeals granted the MTA\u2019s and the County\u2019s Joint Motion to Consolidate the cases. In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgments of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. <em>Injured Workers\u2019 Ins. Fund v. Subsequent Injury Fund, </em>222 Md.App. 347, 112 A.3d 1092 (2015). The MTA and the County each filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court in the cases of <em>Injured Workers\u2019 Ins. Fund v. Subsequent Injury Fund, </em>443 Md. 234, 116 A.3d 474 (2015) and <em>Baltimore Cty. v. Subsequent Injury Fund, </em>443 Md. 234, 116 A.3d 474 (2015), respectively. We granted <em>certiorari </em>in both cases and consolidate them in this opinion to address the common question, which we have rephrased:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\">Should the SIF assessment under LE \u00a7 9-806 be calculated based on the amount of an award prior to the statutory offsets granted by \u00a7\u00a7 9-610 and 9-503(e)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">We shall answer this question in the affirmative and affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The SIF originated in Chapter 637 of the Acts of 1945.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It was created by the General Assembly for the purpose of encouraging employers to employ disabled individuals \u201cby limiting the [employer\u2019s] liability ... in the event the previously disabled or injured individual sustained a subsequent occupational injury, although not of itself disabling, but which, coupled with previous impairment, rendered the individual permanently disabled.\u201d <em>Anchor Motor Freight, Inc. v. Subsequent Injury Fund, </em>278 Md. 320, 324, 363 A.2d 505, 508 (1976) (citing <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Pack, </em>250 Md. 306, 308, 242 A.2d 506, 508 (1968)). In the event an employee with a previous impairment suffers a subsequent injury on the job, the employer is liable to the employee only for injuries attributable to the work-related injury. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9-802.

He subsequently filed a claim with the Commission. After a hearing, the Commission issued an Award of Compensation on September 11, 2012. It found that Glorioso sustained permanent partial disability \u201camounting to 30% industrial loss of use of the body as the result of an injury to the back.\u201d To compensate for this permanent partial disability, the Commission awarded weekly payments of $307.00 for a period of 150 weeks, for a total award of $46,050.00. The MTA was, however, entitled to an offset under LE \u00a7 9-610<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> because Glorioso also received disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>retirement benefits from the MTA. The offset of $118.27 per week lowered the final amount of compensation to $28,390.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">On August 9, 2013, the SIF filed Issues with the Commission, stating \u201c[t]he Employer and Insurer refuse to pay the 6.5% assessment on the award dated 9/11/12.\u201d The SIF took the position that \u201cthe assessment is due on the amount of the award regardless of any offset for retirement benefits\u201d and requested a hearing on the issue. Following a hearing, the Commission issued an Order on December 17, 2013 requiring the MTA to pay the 6.5% assessment on the amount of compensation prior to offset. It stated that, \u201c[t]he Commission gave or awarded the claimant 30% industrial loss of use of the body as a result of injuries to the back.\u201d Basing its decision on the rules of statutory construction,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>that \u201cthe <em>6.5% </em>assessment is on the amount that the Commission gave to the claimant!,] which is 30%.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">In the December 17, 2013 Order, the Commission also addressed the MTA\u2019s argument that the assessment should be on the amount payable, i.e., the amount the employer owes after the offset. The Commission concluded that \u201c[a]n assessment on an amount payable is <em>only </em>for a settlement agreement.\u201d (emphasis in original). It noted that LE \u00a7 9-806(a)(1) distinguishes between settlement agreements and awards for permanent disability or death, using the phrase \u201camount payable\u201d to impose the assessment on settlement agreements, but not to impose the assessment on awards for permanent disability or death.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, it reasoned that the phrase \u201camount payable\u201d is inapplicable to the present case which involved an award of compensation for permanent disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The County Award</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">On May 13, 2002, claimant, a Baltimore County (\u201cCounty\u201d) firefighter, Gary Shipp (\u201cShipp\u201d),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> became disabled as a result of hypertension and coronary artery disease. He filed a claim with the Commission. After a hearing, the Commission issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>an Award of Compensation on March 5, 2012. It found that Shipp sustained permanent partial disability \u201camounting to 50% industrial loss of use of the body as the result of injuries to the body (hypertension) and coronary artery disease.\u201d To compensate for this permanent partial disability, the Commission awarded weekly payments of $525.00 for a period of 333 weeks, for a total award of $174,825.00. The County filed a request for rehearing when it realized the March 5, 2012 Award of Compensation did not account for the statutory offset that it was entitled to under LE \u00a7 9-503(e). The County pointed out that it had been paying Shipp service retirement benefits.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> LE \u00a7 9-503(e) provides an offset to prevent the weekly total retirement benefits and occupational disease compensation from exceeding an employee\u2019s weekly salary. The Commission issued a new Award of Compensation on March 29, 2012 and rescinded the March 5, 2012 Award. The new Award of Compensation accounted for the LE \u00a7 9-503 offset. Shipp received service retirement benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>in the amount of $605.55 per week, which was subtracted from an average weekly salary of $800.00. This offset lowered the County\u2019s weekly rate of compensation to $194.45 per week for a period of 333 weeks, for a final compensation amount of $64,751.85.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The County paid the SIF 6.5% of the compensation amount after the statutory offset, $4,208.87. On January 28, 2013, the SIF filed Issues with the Commission, stating that \u201c[t]he Employer and Insurer failed to pay the assessment of $11,363 or 6.5% of the award dated 5/5/12[sic].\u201d Following a hearing, the Commission issued an Order on December 12, 2013.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As in the MTA\u2019s case, the Commission based its decision on the rules of statutory construction,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> explaining that \u201cthe 6.5% assessment is on the amount that the Commission gave to the claimant, which is 50%.\u201d In the Commission\u2019s December 12, 2013 Order, using language identical to that used in the MTA Order, the Commission explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">Finally, the employer/insurer argue that the assessment should be on the amount payable, which is the actual amount the employer/insurer owe[s] after offset. On the contrary, subsection [LE \u00a7 9-806(a)(l) ](ii) provides for an assessment of 6.5% on each amount payable by an employer or its insurer under a settlement agreement. An assessment on an amount payable is <em>only </em>for a settlement agreement. The parties agree that the order in this case was an award of compensation and not a settlement agreement. Therefore, the \u201camount payable\u201d language is inapplicable,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj\">(emphasis in original). It ordered Baltimore County and its insurer to \u201cpay the assessment of 6.5% on the award of 50% loss of use of the body, as awarded under [the] Order dated March 29, 2012.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">In an appeal from the judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision, \u201cwe look through the decisions of the circuit courts and intermediate appellate court, and evaluate the agency decision directly.\u201d <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Swedo, </em>439 Md. 441, 452-53, 96 A.3d 210, 217 (2014). Pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-745(b), in each court proceeding under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the decision of the Commission is presumed to be prima facie correct. \u201c[T]his presumption does not extend to questions of law, which we review independently.\u201d <em>Montgomery Cty. v. Deibler, </em>423 Md. 54, 60, 31 A.3d 191, 194 (2011). We have explained, however, that \u201c[t]he Commission\u2019s interpretation of the statute it is charged with administering will be given deference unless its conclusions are based upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Wal Mart Stores, Inc. v. Holmes, </em>416 Md. 346, 359, 7 A.3d 13, 21 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Both the MTA and the County argue that the SIF assessment should be calculated based on the amount payable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>claimant after the statutory offsets provided by LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-610 and 9-503(e) have been applied. The MTA first contends that the Commission\u2019s award is not limited to paragraph two, which grants permanent partial disability benefits. Rather, to determine the amount of the award, the separately numbered paragraphs, including the paragraph describing the offset, must be read together.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As a result, the final award accounts for any deductions due to the statutory offset and is the amount payable to the claimant. Meanwhile, the County argues that in cases where there is a presumption of occupational disease pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-503, the County pays an inflated assessment if the SIF assessment is applied to the award prior to the offset. It reasons that because the application of the offset under LE \u00a7 9-503(e) only reduces the workers compensation benefit, rather than the claimant\u2019s service retirement benefits, applying the SIF assessment to the award prior to the offset is essentially an application of the assessment to the service retirement benefits. This, the County contends, is not authorized by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>In response, the SIF argues that the language, structure, purpose and history of LE \u00a7 9-806 support the Commission\u2019s interpretation that the SIF assessment applies to the entire award, regardless of any statutory offsets. The SIF reasons that LE \u00a7 9-806 specifically provides that the Commission must impose a 6.5% assessment on each award for permanent disability or death. It states that the intermediate appellate court correctly recognized, \u201cthe \u2018award\u2019 itself is based on the claimant\u2019s \u2018permanent disability,\u2019 which does not change simply because the employer is entitled to an offset for some other reason.\u201d <em>Injured Workers\u2019 Ins. Fund, </em>222 Md.App. at 356, 112 A.3d at 1098. Therefore, the offset has no effect on the claimant\u2019s percentage loss to the body because the award for permanent disability itself remains the same even if the final amount payable by an employer is reduced by an offset. <em>Injured Workers\u2019 Ins. Fund, </em>222 Md.App. at 357, 112 A.3d at 1098.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">All parties cite LE \u00a7 9-806 as the statute providing for the SIF assessment.

Md-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>348 Md. <em>2, </em>702 A.2d 690 (1997), the MTA contends that the court should apply the ordinary and natural meaning of the term \u201caward\u201d under \u00a7 9-806(a)(1)(i) because \u201caward\u201d is not defined by the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. In an effort to demonstrate the ordinary and natural meaning of the term \u201caward,\u201d the MTA provides various dictionary definitions of the word.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Based on the definitions the MTA puts forth, it reasons that the award consists of what was ultimately paid to the claimant after the deduction for the offsets. The MTA\u2019s reference to dictionary definitions of the term \u201caward\u201d misconstrues the canons of statutory interpretation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>It is true that \u201cin deciding what a term\u2019s ordinary and natural meaning is, we may, and often do, consult the dictionary.\u201d <em>State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation, </em>348 Md. at 14, 702 A.2d at 696. We, however, keep in mind that \u201c[t]he cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to give effect to the legislative purpose or policy.\u201d <em>State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation, </em>348 Md. at 13, 702 A.2d at 696. The canons of statutory construction are firmly established in the State of Maryland. The primary source from which we determine legislative intent \u201cis the language of the statute itself.\u201d <em>Schweitzer v.

We have also previously stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\">We [ ] do not read statutory language in a vacuum, nor do we confine strictly our interpretation of a statute\u2019s plain language to the isolated section alone. Rather, the plain language must be viewed within the context of the statutory scheme to which it belongs, considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the Legislature in enacting the statute. We presume that the Legislature intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law, and, thus, we seek to reconcile and harmonize the parts of a statute, to the extent possible consistent with the statute\u2019s object and scope.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\"><em>Bd. of Educ. of Prince George\u2019s Cty. v. Marks-Sloan, </em>428 Md. 1, 19, 50 A.3d 1137, 1148 (2012). Furthermore, where a case involves the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u201cwe also endeavor to interpret its provisions liberally, where possible, in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>effectuate the broad remedial purpose of the statutory-scheme.\u201d <em>W.M. Schlosser Co. v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>414 Md. 195, 203, 994 A.2d 956, 961 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">As the SIF points out, the MTA\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201caward\u201d ignores the fact that LE \u00a7 9-806(a)(1)(i) specifically states that \u201can assessment of 6.5%, payable to the Subsequent Injury Fund\u201d applies to \u201ceach award ... for permanent disability or death\u201d rather than the term \u201caward\u201d in the abstract. Citing Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary 86 (11th ed. 2003), the Commission in both the MTA and the County Orders defined \u201caward\u201d as \u201cto give by judicial decree.\u201d Paragraph two of both the MTA and the County Awards of Compensation describes the award for permanent partial disability in terms of a percentage of industrial loss of use to the body as a result of injuries to the body. Based on this percentage, the claimant is entitled to a certain amount of weekly payments. As the Court of Special Appeals duly noted, \u201cthe \u2018award\u2019 itself is based on the claimant\u2019s \u2018permanent disability,\u2019 which does not change simply because the employer is entitled to an offset for some other reason.\u201d <em>Injured Workers\u2019 Ins. Fund, </em>222 Md.App. at 356, 112 A.3d at 1098. A construction of LE \u00a7 9-806(a)(1)(i) \u201cso as to give effect to each word so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory\u201d demonstrates clear and unambiguous legislative intent that the SIF assessment of 6.5% is determined based on each award for permanent disability or death prior to any statutory offsets. <em>Foley v. K. Hovnanian at Kent Island, LLC, </em>410 Md. 128, 152, 978 A.2d 222, 237 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">As the Commission correctly expressed, the language used in LE \u00a7 9-806(a)(1) provides further proof of the General Assembly\u2019s intent to have the SIF assessment calculated based on the amount of an award prior to any statutory offsets for retirement benefits. Whereas pursuant to subsection (i), LE \u00a7 9 \u2014 806(a)(1) imposes \u201can assessment of 6.5%\u201d on <em>\u201ceach award </em>... for permanent disability or death\u201d pursuant to subsection (i), it imposes the same assessment on \u201ceach <em>amount payable ... </em>under a settlement agreement\u201d pursuant to subsection (ii). (emphasis added). In both cases, the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>mission noted this contrasting language, and concluded: \u201cAn assessment on an amount payable is <em>only </em>for a settlement agreement. The parties agree that the order in this case was an award of compensation and not a settlement agreement. Therefore, the \u2018amount payable\u2019 language is inapplicable.\u201d (emphasis in original). The General Assembly chose to use different language to impose the SIF assessment on awards for permanent disability or death as compared to settlement agreements. This evidences the clear intent of the General Assembly to have the 6.5% assessment applied to the entire award for permanent disability or death rather than the amount payable after deductions are made for offsets.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The Commission\u2019s interpretation is also consistent with the purpose of the SIF as well as the purpose of the statutory offsets. The SIF assessment \u201cis essential to the Fund\u2019s solvency.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Wicomico Cty., Dep\u2019t of Pub. Works, </em>284 Md. 576, 583, 398 A.2d 1237, 1241 (1979). When an individual with a pre-existing condition is injured on the job, an employer\u2019s liability is limited by \u201callocating to the employer liability for the effects of the subsequent injury and to the Fund the liability for the effects of the prior impairment.\u201d <em>C. &amp; P.

Impos <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>ing the SIF assessment on each award for permanent disability or death prior to deduction of the statutory offsets pursuant to LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-503 and 9-610, fits within the statutory scheme of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. The offsets fulfill the General Assembly\u2019s goal of preventing an employee from obtaining double recovery for one injury while ensuring the survival of the SIF. Accordingly, the MTA and the County\u2019s interpretation of LE \u00a7 9-806 cannot stand because if the SIF assessment is calculated based on the amount the employer pays after the deduction of the statutory offsets, the SIF would lose a significant amount of revenue. A loss of revenue would hinder the SIF\u2019s ability to reduce the amount an employer or its insurer pays in workers\u2019 compensation in cases where an employee with a pre-existing condition suffers a subsequent injury. As the Court of Special Appeals concluded, calculating the SIF assessment based on the pre-offset award \u201cdoes not place a double burden on the public employer ... because the employer or its insurer pays no more to [the] SIF than it would have paid had the employee not received any offsetting disability retirement benefits.\u201d <em>Injured Workers\u2019 Ins. Fund, </em>222 Md.App. at 358, 112 A.3d at 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">The Commission\u2019s interpretation of LE \u00a7 9-806 in the MTA and the County\u2019s cases is supported by the plain language of LE \u00a7 9-806 and permits the statute to coexist harmoniously with \u00a7\u00a7 9-610 and 9-503(e). Therefore, we hold that the SIF assessment under LE \u00a7 9-806 is calculated based on the amount of an award prior to the deduction of the statutory offsets for retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE PETITIONERS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-10\">.

At its inception, the Fund was known as the Second Injury Fund.

The MTA reasons that \"award\u201d clearly refers to the amount payable after the pension offset is applied because LE \u00a7 9 \u2014 610(c)(ii) provides that the Commission may \u201cmake an award against the employer or the Subsequent Injury Fund or both to provide an additional benefit that equals the difference between the benefit provided by the employer and the benefits required by this title.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b249-5\">. Both the MTA and the County also focus on the stock language which appears at the end of every Commission\u2019s Award of Compensation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">This award is subject to a total assessment of sk and one-half percent (6.5%) ON THE AMOUNT PAYABLE PURSUANT TO LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT ARTICLE, \u00a7 9-806 (Subsequent Injury Fund Assessment); Annotated Code of Maryland. The employer or insurer shall pay the assessment to the subsequent INJURY FUND WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF INVOICE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS THEREON.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">The MTA contends that the phrase \u201camount payable\u201d in this stock language indicates that the \"award\u201d for purposes of calculating the SIF assessment is based on the post-offset amount that the employer actually pays to the claimant. Meanwhile, the County argues that the use of \"amount payable\u201d in the stock language indicates that the Commission has rendered conflicting decisions in its interpretation of LE \u00a7 9-806. As we will discuss, the language of LE \u00a7 9-806 clearly and unambigu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>ously indicates that the SIF assessment is calculated based on the amount of the award prior to the statutory offsets of \u00a7 9-610 and 9-503(e). Further, the SIF correctly indicates that the stock language at the bottom of each award is not part of the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the statute. Rather, the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the statute is contained in the December 17, 2013 and December 12, 2013 orders it issued in the MTA\u2019s and the County\u2019s cases, respectively. Neither of these orders contain the aforementioned stock language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b251-4\">. The MTA cites to Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary 86 (11th ed. 2003) for several definitions of \"award,\u201d which differs depending on the use of the term:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">v[erb] <em>t [ransitive] </em>1: to give by judicial decree or after careful consideration 2: to confer or bestow as being deserved or merited or needed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\"><em>n [oun </em>] 1 <em>a: </em>a judgment of final decision; <em>esp: </em>the decision of arbitrators in a case submitted to them <em>b; </em>the document containing the decision of arbitrators 2: something that is conferred or bestowed especially on the basis of merit of need</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAT\">We note that \"award\u201d as defined by Black's Law Dictionary 164 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 10th ed, 2014) is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\"><em>n [oun </em>]. A final judgment or decision, esp. one by an arbitrator or by a jury assessing damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\"><em>v [er </em>]b. To grant by formal process or by judicial decree.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\">. The MTA also cites numerous other provisions in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to support its interpretation that LE \u00a7 9-806 requires calculating the SIF assessment on the amount payable post-offset. It cites LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-610(a)(2), 9-731, 9-804(b), and 9-656, and, 9-806(c). In citing LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-806(c), 9-656, and 9-731, the MTA essentially argues that the use of the term \u201ccompensation\u201d in these statutes indicates that the payment of the assessment under \u00a7 9-806 should be based on the amount payable. In citing the language of LE \u00a7 9-804(b), the MTA argues that in making an award against the SIF, the Commission must deduct the amount of all prior permanent disability payments received by the covered employee from the award. From this language, the MTA states that it would be illogical to make a deduction under \u00a7 9-804(b) on amounts the claimant did not receive. The MTA then analogizes this with the facts of its case without any further explanation. Finally, the MTA states that based on LE \u00a7 9-610(a)(2), when there is a complete offset of benefits, it cannot be the case that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>employer must pay the SIF assessment when the \"claimant and claimant's attorney are not receiving any monetary compensation from the award.\u201d We are unpersuaded by this argument because, as we will discuss, the MTA\u2019s interpretation of LE \u00a7 9-806 contravenes the statutory scheme of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
