The Petition was bi\u2019ought as a reciprocal discipline matter pursuant to Maryland Rules 16-751 (petition for disciplinary or remedial action) and 16-773 (reciprocal discipline or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>inactive status). Attached to the Petition were certified copies of the Opinion and Order of the Committee on Grievances for the United States District Court, Southern District of New York (\u201cGrievance Committee\u201d) dated April 10, 2013 and the Opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dated April 4, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">By Order dated April 10, 2013, the Grievance Committee suspended Respondent from the practice of law in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York for seven years, <em>nunc pro </em>tunc<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to April 10, 2008. Respondent appealed the Grievance Committee\u2019s April 10, 2013 Order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. By Opinion and Order dated April 4, 2014, the Second Circuit affirmed the April 10 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In issuing its sanction, the Grievance Committee adopted the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the Honorable Lisa Margaret Smith, United States Magistrate Judge for the Southern District of New York (\u201cmagistrate judge\u201d), who presided over Respondent\u2019s evidentiary hearing. The magistrate judge found knowing and intentional misconduct in violation of the New York Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cNYRPC\u201d), 3.3(a)(1);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3.4(c);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 8.4(c) and (d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>The filing of the Petition by Bar Counsel was precipitated by events occurring in the spring of 2007, in connection with Respondent\u2019s representation as lead counsel of the plaintiff in <em>Wolters Kluwer Fin. Servs. Inc. v. Scivantage et al., </em>Case No. 07 Civ. 2352 in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, while she was a partner at Dorsey &amp; Whitney, LLP (\u201cDorsey <em>&amp; </em>Whitney\u201d). The Petition alleges that Respondent\u2019s misconduct in New York constitutes violations of the following Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d): 3.3(a)(1) (Candor Toward the Tribunal), 3.4(c) (Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel), and 8.4(a), (c), and (d) (Misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">On August 6, 2015, we issued an order directing Bar Counsel and Respondent to show cause pursuant to the grounds outlined in Md. Rule 16-773(e),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> why corresponding discipline should not be imposed by this Court. Following receipt of the parties\u2019 responses, on August 20, 2015, this Court ordered Respondent indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in this State, pending further order of this Court, pursuant to Md. Rule 16-773(d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This matter was not transmitted to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>hearing judge to hold an evidentiary hearing and render findings of fact and conclusions of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On January 12, 2016, we heard oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">On January 29, 2016, Respondent filed with this Court, a \u201cMOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE STATEMENT CORRECTING MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS MADE BY DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL DURING ORAL ARGUMENT ON JANUARY 12, 2016\u201d (\u201cMotion for Leave\u201d), alleging that Bar Counsel made a variety of misrepresentations regarding the reciprocal actions taken in other courts and bars, as well as the magistrate judge\u2019s findings. Bar Counsel filed a response to Respondent\u2019s motion on February 4, 2016, stating that the misstatements and misrepresentations alleged by Respondent were addressed, or could have been addressed, in her rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Bar Counsel further maintained that the substance of Respondent\u2019s motion was not a pleading attempting to correct the record, but rather, an attempt \u201cto supplement her oral argument with additional facts and legal argument.\u201d On February 12, 2016, Respondent filed a reply (\u201cReply\u201d) in further support of her Motion for Leave, asserting that Bar Counsel\u2019s response to her motion failed to correct the misstatements and misrepresentations proffered during oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that Respondent violated MLRPC 3.3(a)(1), 3.4(c), and 8.4(a), (c), and (d), and the appropriate sanction for Respondent\u2019s misconduct is disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The magistrate judge made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law, which we summarize:</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Respondent has been an attorney since 1988. She was admitted to the Bar of the District of Columbia in 1988, the Bar of Maryland in 1998, the Bar of New York in 2000, and the Bar of Connecticut in 2007.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> She has been in inactive status in Maryland since July 2015. Respondent is also a former partner of the law firm Dorsey &amp; Whitney and currently maintains a law office in Stamford, Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">In April 2007, Respondent was lead counsel for Dorsey &amp; Whitney\u2019s client, Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc. (\u201cWolters Kluwer\u201d), in its suit filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, against four of its former employees (\u201cNew York action\u201d). The complaint alleged that former Wolters Kluwer employees had taken proprietary information and disclosed it to their new employer, the technology company Scivantage. At the close of extensive discovery conducted under orders of confidentiality, Dorsey <em>&amp; </em>Whitney voluntarily dismissed the suit and refiled a substantially identical suit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (\u201cMassachusetts action\u201d) after Scivantage contested personal jurisdiction in the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Dorsey &amp; Whitney subsequently filed a motion in the Massachusetts action seeking injunctive relief and attached some of the discovery material produced by defendants in the New York action. Following a hearing on the voluntary dismissal and the use of the discovery material, <em>inter alia, </em>the presiding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>judge, the Honorable Harold Baer, Jr., (\u201cJudge Baer\u201d), issued an opinion imposing non-monetary sanctions on Dorsey &amp; Whitney, Respondent, Marc Reiner (\u201cMr. Reiner\u201d), a former partner at Dorsey <em>&amp; </em>Whitney who worked on the matter, and Wolters Kluwer. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the imposition of non-monetary sanctions on Respondent as a result of her misconduct, but reversed the sanctions imposed on Dorsey <em>&amp; </em>Whitney and Mr. Reiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">The New York disciplinary matter commenced when Judge Baer forwarded a copy of his decision to the Grievance Committee. Thereafter on January 30, 2008, the Grievance Committee issued an \u201cOrder to Show Cause\u201d alleging that Respondent violated NYRPC 3.3(a)(1), 3.4(c), 8.4(c) and (d),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> based upon the following three charges of misconduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">(1) [Respondent] \u2018instructed an associate in her firm to alter or amend documents for the purpose of preventing their discoverability and attempted to mislead the [c]ourt as to these events;\u2019 (2) [Respondent] \u2018participated in a conference with the [c]ourt to adjourn a [Temporary Restraining Order] [ (\u201cTRO\u201d) ] hearing and discuss future depositions at a time when [she] knew that those depositions and the TRO hearing would not take place;\u2019[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] and (3) [Respondent] \u2018copied transcripts and ordered additional copies of transcripts in intentional disregard of court orders, and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>used the transcripts in an action in Massachusetts in violation of the [cjourt\u2019s Confidentiality Order.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">On April 10, 2008, the Grievance Committee issued an interim suspension order.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Over a year later on June 5, 2009, the Grievance Committee determined that Respondent should be disbarred, but allowed her to submit mitigation evidence. On August 6, 2009, the Grievance Committee reduced the sanction from disbarment to a seven-year suspension. Respondent appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On April 25, 2011, the Second Circuit vacated the Grievance Committee\u2019s interim suspension order and remanded the matter for further proceedings, including an independent evidentiary hearing on the charges against Respondent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">A hearing was conducted before the magistrate judge in the Southern District of New York for eleven days during the months of June through August, 2012. The magistrate judge received hundreds of exhibits and heard testimony of several witnesses at Dorsey &amp; Whitney, including Respondent. On January 23, 2013, the magistrate judge submitted a 118-page Report and Recommendation, concluding that Respondent violated NYRPC 3.3(a)(1), 3.4(c), and 8.4(c) and (d), and recommended the imposition of a five-year suspension, <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to April 10, 2008. The Grievance Committee adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, but ultimately imposed a seven-year suspension, <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>In support of its sanction, the Grievance Committee concluded that Respondent\u2019s conduct was <em>sui </em>generis,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> because her conduct involved \u201cthe corruption of a young and inexperienced lawyer, over whom she had power and authority,\u201d she exhibited a lack of remorse for her inappropriate behavior, and she had a \u201chabit of twisting the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>The magistrate judge made the following findings of fact relative to the charges, which we summarize in reverse order to remain consistent with the sequence of events:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Charge Three<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">On April 12, 2007, Judge Baer entered a \u201cConfidentiality Stipulation and Protective Order\u201d (\u201cthe Confidentiality Order\u201d), which was sent via fax and e-mail to counsel for both parties in the Wolters Kluwer litigation. Of relevance to the allegations in the instant disciplinary matter, the Confidentiality Order outlined the following stipulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">[information designated as \u2018CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\u2019 or \u2018ATTORNEYS\u2019 EYES ONLY INFORMATION\u2019 (\u201cProtected Material\u201d), could be \u2018used solely for purposes of the prosecution and defense of the above-entitled litigation____\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">Protected Material was not to be \u2018used in any other litigation proceeding____\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">\u2018The obligations created by this Order shall survive the termination of this lawsuit unless otherwise modified\u2019 by the [cjourt and that \u2018[t]he [c]ourt,\u2019 defined as \u2018the United States District Court, Southern District of New York,\u2019 \u2018shall retain jurisdiction, even after termination of this lawsuit, to enforce this Order and to make such amendments and modifications to this Order as may be appropriate____\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">The \u201cATTORNEYS\u2019 EYES ONLY\u201d designation meant that protected material could only be disclosed to attorneys at Dorsey <em>&amp; </em>Whitney, defendants\u2019 firms, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer <em>&amp; </em>Feld, LLP and Sullivan &amp; Worcester, LLP, the court reporters and videographers who covered the depositions, and independent experts retained by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">In addition to prior document production, the defendants produced three CD-ROMs with electronic discovery to Dorsey &amp; Whitney on the evening of April 13, 2007, which was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>same day the firm filed a voluntary dismissal of the New York action. Subsequently on April 15, 2007, after counsel for the defendants became aware of Dorsey &amp; Whitney\u2019s transfer of the New York action and subsequent dismissal of same, they contacted Respondent and requested return of all their discovery documents and copies thereof. However, Respondent refused. On April 16, after Respondent was made aware by Mr. Reiner of a conference call with Judge Baer and defendants\u2019 counsel to resolve the matter, Respondent replied, \u201cI am going to want a copy made of the discs no matter what this judge says ... I will take the heat for that decision, but I am going to want a copy made no matter what[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">In efforts to address both the defendants\u2019 concern regarding Respondent\u2019s resistance to their demands and Respondent\u2019s concern of spoliation issues if she returned same to the defendants, Judge Baer issued an oral order directing return of all documents in Dorsey <em>&amp; </em>WTdtney\u2019s possession to the court within twenty-four hours. After Mr. Reiner informed Respondent of Judge Baer\u2019s order, Respondent stated, \u201c[t]his is exactly what I thought would happen which is why I told you I want copies of the disc[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Shortly thereafter, Respondent contacted Eve Morris, head of the secretarial staff at Dorsey &amp; AVhitney, to arrange to have copies made of all hard-copy documents and the CDROMs produced by the defendants. Respondent then used the copies in a motion for protective order submitted to Judge Baer seeking permission to send copies of the defendants\u2019 document production to the judge in the Massachusetts action.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">On April 17, 2007, after Judge Baer became aware that Dorsey &amp; Whitney made copies of the defendants\u2019 document production, he sent an e-mail to the firm ordering that all discovery in plaintiffs possession be delivered to defendants by noon the following day. Thereafter on April 19, 2007, Judge Baer issued an oral order to Zachary Carter (\u201cMr. Carter\u201d), head of the New York Trial Group at Dorsey &amp; Wfiiitney, directing the firm to return all deposition transcripts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>taken during the course of the Wolters Kluwer litigation to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The following day, in response to an e-mail from Deidre Sheridan (\u201cMs. Sheridan\u201d), an associate at Dorsey &amp; Whitney, suggesting that the firm \u201cconsider a middle g[r]ound\u201d that would allow Judge Baer to hold the transcripts, but release them for use in their motions with the court, Respondent declined. The deposition transcripts were eventually delivered to the court, beyond Judge Baer\u2019s deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">On April 21, 2007, after confirming delivery of the deposition transcripts to the court, Respondent e-mailed in-house counsel at Wolters Kluwer, stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthe next step\u201d was \u201csending the transcripts to the new judge.\u201d (emphasis omitted). Shortly thereafter, Respondent e-mailed the court reporter from Veritext who covered the depositions for the defendants, to request copies of the discs with the deposition transcripts, claiming that she \u201cmisplaced\u201d the four discs containing the deposition transcripts. Respondent did not disclose this request to Judge Baer or anyone at Dorsey <em>&amp; </em>Whitney.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">On or about April 23 or 24, 2007, Respondent was confronted by Jonathan Herman (\u201cMr. Herman\u201d), a partner at Dorsey <em>&amp; </em>Whitney assigned to oversee Respondent\u2019s work, regarding Respondent\u2019s knowledge that associates had not returned deposition transcripts to the court. A few days prior on April 20, associates Ms. Sheridan and Jordan Brackett (\u201cMr. Brackett\u201d) informed Mr. Carter that they each still possessed folders containing working copies of the transcripts that have been marked up and tabbed. Mr. Carter spoke to Respondent about the deposition transcripts on or about April 26 or 27, and Respondent spoke to Ms. Sheridan regarding Mr. Carter\u2019s decision to not return them on April 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">After Respondent\u2019s discussion with Mr. Herman, she refused to return the deposition transcripts, claiming work product privilege. Respondent subsequently sent Judge Baer\u2019s law clerk an e-mail citing caselaw from associates in support of her use of the discovery from the New York action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>in the Massachusetts case, contending that the latter was a \u201ccontinuing matter.\u201d However, in correspondence to colleagues at Dorsey &amp; Whitney, Respondent consistently referred to the Massachusetts action as a new case.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">On April 24, 2007, Respondent assisted with drafting a motion titled, \u201cMotion for Order to Show Cause and for Expedited Discovery and Preservation of Documents and Information to be filed in the District of Massachusetts^\u201d which included a supporting memorandum of law and a declaration by Respondent. The motion was submitted to the judge in the Massachusetts action. Attached to the motion were over one-hundred pages of excerpts from the deposition transcripts in the New York action, which were designated \u201cATTORNEYS\u2019 EYES ONLY.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Although the motion requested, <em>inter alia, </em>an order requiring Judge Baer to return the deposition transcripts in his custody to Wolters Kluwer, or to allow Wolters Kluwer \u201cto request duplicate transcripts from the [ejourt reporter for use in the Massachusetts action[,]\u201d the memorandum of law did not reflect that Respondent previously requested duplicate transcripts from the court reporter on April 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Charge One (\u201cThe Brackett Charge\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Subsequently on April 24, 2007, Judge Baer\u2019s law clerk sent an e-mail to Respondent, copying defendants\u2019 counsel, and forwarded same to other members at Dorsey &amp; Whitney involved in the Wolters Kluwer litigation. The law clerk requested a representation as to whether either firm was in current possession, or possession since April 20, any copies, in any format, of any deposition transcripts taken in the matter. The parties were directed to return any remaining deposition transcripts to the court by April 25,11:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Upon receipt of the e-mail, Mr. Brackett uncovered the folder in his office containing deposition transcripts with markings and flags, as well as several clean deposition transcripts, which should have been returned on April 20. Mr. Brackett apprised Respondent by phone immediately thereaf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>ter, to which she replied that she was discussing the matter with another partner. Mr. Brackett left the folder containing the deposition transcripts in his office for Respondent to retrieve, but returned to his office the next day to discover that Respondent had not collected it. Mr. Brackett had the deposition transcripts sent to Respondent by messenger that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Although Respondent received clarification from Judge Baer\u2019s law clerk that the parties were not required \u201cto go through its pleadings files and remove all exhibits from its pleadings[,]\u201d in response to the law clerk\u2019s request, she did not inform the law clerk that Dorsey <em>&amp; </em>Whitney had already used the deposition transcripts in its filings in Massachusetts. Ultimately, none of the deposition transcripts in the firm\u2019s possession were returned to the court by the 11:00 a.m. deadline. On April 26, following a discussion between Mr. Herman and Mr. Brackett regarding his deposition transcripts, Respondent asked Mr. Brackett to accompany her to the office, where the deposition transcripts remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">As they proceeded to review the deposition transcripts, Respondent stated to Mr. Brackett, \u201cI\u2019ll leave the office for a few minutes, you should scribble all over them so that they\u2019ll be deemed work product and we won\u2019t have to return them.\u201d Respondent then left her office for approximately two to three minutes and Mr. Brackett proceeded to make small markings on the first page of each of the remaining clean deposition transcripts. Later that day, Mr. Brackett informed Mr. Herman of what transpired in Respondent\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">When confronted by partners at Dorsey &amp; Whitney of the Brackett allegation, she did not deny her statement, but stated that she was \u201cjoking\u201d and made the statement in a mocking and sarcastic fashion. Both Respondent and her former secretary, Eileen Brennan, provided conflicting versions of the events. Apart from Respondent\u2019s directive to Mr. Brackett, both versions exculpated Respondent of any wrongdoing. The magistrate judge rejected both versions and credited Mr. Brackett\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>On April 26, 2007, after becoming aware of the Brackett allegation, Judge Baer issued a subsequent order by e-mail to Respondent, directing the return of any copies of deposition transcripts to the court that evening. However, the deposition transcripts were not delivered to the court until April 27. Respondent attached a cover letter to the deposition transcripts mischaracterizing her knowledge of the matter, stating \u201c[s]ome of the attached [deposition] transcripts that were brought to my attention yesterday for the first time do not appear to be work product privileged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Although Respondent ultimately facilitated Dorsey &amp; Whitney\u2019s compliance with Judge Baer\u2019s oral orders, several times throughout that period, she maintained that his orders were \u201cnot valid.\u201d Respondent has also maintained that she was not obliged to comply with Judge Baer\u2019s orders. However, in other instances she reiterated that she was lead counsel and that all matters pertaining to the Wolters Kluwer litigation must \u201cgo through\u201d her.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In rendering her conclusions, the magistrate judge relied upon her extensive record-based findings, which were largely based upon the credibility of the witnesses, including Respondent, who testified during the eleven-day hearing. In sum, the magistrate found overwhelming evidence to support her conclusion that (1) in connection with Charge One, Respondent did, in fact, instruct Mr. Brackett, a first-year associate at Dorsey &amp; Whitney, to place handwritten \u201cmarks\u201d on deposition transcripts to claim attorney work-product privilege against court orders, and then attempted to mislead the court as to these events; (2) in connection with Charge Three, Respondent copied deposition transcripts and ordered additional copies of same, and then used them in the Massachusetts action, in defiance of court orders; and (3) Respondent\u2019s \u201crepeated attempts to circumvent the proper legal process established] that she acted with a culpable state of mind\u201d while engaging in the misconduct for which she has been charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">The manner in which this Court handles reciprocal disciplinary cases is well established. Pursuant to Md. Rule 16 \u2014 773(g), \u201cthe factual findings and conclusions of law of the sister jurisdiction(s) are treated generally as conclusive evidence of an attorney\u2019s misconduct.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Adams, </em>441 Md. 590, 605, 109 A.3d 114, 123 (2015) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Katz, </em>429 Md. 308, 315, 55 A.3d 909, 913 (2012)). \u201cThe introduction of such evidence does not preclude, however, the introduction of additional evidence that shows \u2018cause why no discipline or lesser discipline should be imposed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Katz, </em>429 Md. at 316, 55 A.3d at [913]); Md. Rule 16-773(g).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This Court has discretion, under Md. Rule 16-773(e), \u201cto impose a discipline consistent with the sister jurisdiction\u2019s factual findings and conclusions, or to order a different or more serious alternative based on the existence of \u2018exceptional circumstances[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Adams, </em>441 Md. at 605-06, 109 A.3d at 123 (quoting <em>Katz, </em>429 Md. at 316, 55 A.3d at 913).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\u201cExceptional circumstances\u201d precluding an order of reciprocal discipline include, <em>inter alia, </em>that the attorney\u2019s misconduct \u201cdoes not constitute misconduct in this State or it warrants substantially different discipline in this State[.]\u201d Md.

Respondent\u2019s argument is immaterial, in light of this Court\u2019s decision to invoke Md. Rule 16-773(e), <em>infra, </em>and impose a substantially different sanction than that of the Southern District of New York. Respondent also asserts that Bar Counsel misrepresented to this Court that she failed to report her prior discipline to the District of Columbia Bar, when she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>noted in a June 1, 2015 correspondence to Bar Counsel that she informed the bar of her discipline in the Spring of 2015. However, Respondent clarified this fact before the Court in her rebuttal oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Respondent contends that Bar Counsel \u201cmisreported to the Court that there was a finding that [she] testified that Judge Baer would destroy evidence[.]\u201d However, the Court quoted verbatim from the magistrate judge\u2019s Report, her summation of Respondent\u2019s testimony during the hearing, which confirmed the accuracy of Bar Counsel\u2019s statement. The Report indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">At the hearing, [Respondent] testified that while she was away in Turkey, she was concerned that Judge Baer would \u2018return the documents to the people who were the spoliators and then they would get destroyed pursuant to a provision in the confidentiality order that permitted them expressly to destroy documents at the conclusion of the case.\u2019 [Respondent] further testified that she doubted whether the [c]ourt would do the right thing with respect to the preservation of evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Accordingly, we reject Respondent\u2019s attempt to deflect the meaning of her statements, specifically, that she never stated that Judge Baer would destroy the discovery, but that he would return it to the defendants who would, in turn, destroy same. It was reasonable for the magistrate judge and Bar Counsel to conclude based upon the evidence that Respondent doubted Judge Baer\u2019s ability to ensure preservation of the discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Respondent contends that Bar Counsel \u201cincorrectly reported that this case was a misrepresentation case with findings by the Magistrate [judge] that would justify disbarment under <em>[Vanderlinde], </em>...\u201d as the magistrate judge \u201cacknowledged that case precedent could not justify even a five-year suspension[.]\u201d This argument is also immaterial, in light of this Court\u2019s decision to invoke Md.

The record reflects that subsequent to the time all orders of discipline were issued by other jurisdictions, Respondent failed to ever notify Bar Counsel in Maryland of the disciplinary actions, in violation of Md. Rule 16-773(a).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">In Respondent\u2019s Reply, she reiterated the lesser sanctions imposed in other courts and state bars,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> in an attempt to persuade this Court that <em>nunc pro tunc </em>discipline is the appropriate sanction for her misconduct. Respondent also asserted that Bar Counsel failed to take any accountability for the alleged misstatements and misrepresentations made during oral argument in its response to her Motion for Leave. However, in light of the conclusions stated <em>infra, </em>neither of her arguments meaningfully impacts this Court\u2019s decision to impose a substantially different sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">As this Court held in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mixter, </em>441 Md. 416, 527, 109 A.3d 1, 68 (2015), when determining appropriate sanctions for violation of the MLRPC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">[I]t is well settled that the purpose of attorney discipline is to protect the public, not punish the attorney. Attorney discipline is also directed at deterring other lawyers from violating the [MLRPC] and to maintain the integrity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>legal profession. We evaluate an attorney grievance matter on its own merits and impose sanctions \u2018that are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed.\u2019 Therefore, we consider the nature of the ethical duties violated in light of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">(citations omitted). \u201cSanctions accomplish these goals by deterring intolerable conduct and keeping those unfit to practice law from doing so.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Zimmerman, </em>428 Md. 119, 144, 50 A.3d 1205, 1220 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In response to the show cause order issued by this Court on August 6, 2015, Bar Counsel asked that reciprocal discipline not be imposed, and recommended disbarment. Bar counsel submits that a deviation from the sanction imposed by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York is warranted because \u201cRespondent\u2019s serious misconduct, infested with dishonesty, warrants substantially different discipline in Maryland than was ordered.\u201d Respondent, in her response to the show cause order, avers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">Respondent meets each one of [the exceptions outlined in Md. Rule 16-773(e) ] to reciprocal discipline. Every bar or court considering reciprocal discipline has imposed either no discipline or lesser discipline <em>[nunc pro tunc], </em>in some cases resulting in only a few days suspension. In fact, Connecticut \u2014 the state of Respondent\u2019s primary residence and the bar where she has principally practiced for the last seven years \u2014 has held that no discipline should be imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABO\">Respondent requests that this Court follow the decision of Connecticut and impose no discipline, or alternatively, follow the other state and federal bars, which imposed reciprocal discipline <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>which would, in essence, result in no discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">We disagree. Respondent\u2019s conduct involved dishonesty and deceit, without compelling extenuating circumstances, which carries the risk of the ultimate sanction of disbarment by this Court. <em>See Zodrow, </em>419 Md. at 304, 19 A.3d at 392. \u201c[Disbarment follows as a matter of course, \u2018when a member <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>of the bar is shown to be willfully dishonest for personal gain by means of fraud, deceit, cheating or like conduct, absent the most compelling extenuating <em>circumstancesId. </em>(quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Guberman, </em>392 Md. 131, 137, 896 A.2d 337, 340-41 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Before this Court, in conformance with the conduct evidenced in the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, Respondent continued to deflect, minimize her actions, and shift blame onto others at Dorsey &amp; Whitney. Respondent merely restated the evidence previously considered by the magistrate judge and challenged the credibility determinations, which were entitled to substantial deference. <em>See Adams, </em>441 Md. at 605, 109 A.3d at 123 (\u201c[T]he factual findings and conclusions of law of the sister jurisdiction(s) are treated generally as conclusive evidence of an attorney\u2019s misconduct.\u201d) (quoting <em>Katz, </em>429 Md. at 315, 55 A.3d at 913).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">In some instances, Respondent also mischaracterized Maryland caselaw to bolster her position. One example relates to her reliance on <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Midlen, </em>395 Md. 628, 911 A.2d 852 (2006), for the proposition that \u201cevidence that [an] attorney voluntarily ceased to practice in Maryland mitigates in favor of <em>nunc pro tunc </em>discipline.\u201d Respondent avers that because she has not practiced in this State for approximately seventeen years, we should apply this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Midlen </em>and impose a term of suspension similar to the Southern District of New York and other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Respondent\u2019s argument is without merit. In <em>Midlen, </em>the District of Columbia Court of Appeals suspended the attorney from the practice of law for a period of eighteen months for violation of certain rules of professional conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 637-38, 644, 911 A.2d at 858-59, 862. The attorney reported his suspension to Maryland Bar Counsel, who promptly filed a petition seeking reciprocal discipline for violations of MLRPC 1.15, 1.16, and 8.4(a), (c), and (d). <em>Id. </em>at 630, 911 A.2d at 853-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Acknowledging that the imposition of corresponding discipline from the date of our mandate would not be congruent because the attorney would remain suspended in Maryland more than a year after his suspension in the District of Columbia ended, we took into consideration mitigating factors. We opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\"><em>If an attorney who is suspended in another State promptly notifies Maryland Bar Counsel of that suspension, as required by [Md.] Rule 16-773(a), and promptly ceases the practice of law in Maryland during the period of that suspension, </em>any corresponding, reciprocal period of suspension ordered by us, <em>ordinarily, </em>should be concurrent with that imposed in the other State, whether through the device of retroactive commencement of the reciprocal discipline or by terminating our suspension upon termination of the suspension to which it is reciprocal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 651, 911 A.2d at 866 (emphasis added). Nonetheless, because it was unclear from the record when the attorney notified Maryland Bar Counsel of his suspension in the District of Columbia or whether he continued to practice law in Maryland thereafter, we concluded that the attorney\u2019s suspension would commence upon the issuance of the Court\u2019s opinion, through eighteen months. <em>Id. </em>at 652, 911 A.2d at 867. In the instant disciplinary matter, even if Respondent\u2019s assertion that she has not practiced law in this State for seventeen years is accurate, the record clearly demonstrates that she <em>never </em>notified Bar Counsel of her suspensions in other jurisdictions, but rather merely placed herself on inactive status in July 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Respondent\u2019s ai\"gument that the Maryland Client Protection Fund informed her that reciprocal discipline reporting obligations would only arise after she reactivated her membership does not obviate her failure to do so more than a year after the Second Circuit affirmed the Grievance Committee\u2019s order of suspension in April 2014, or orders of same from other courts and state bars, all of which occurred before she entered inactive status with Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Moreover, as we noted in <em>Midlen, </em>\u201cconcurrence is not a matter of right but of our own discretion and practice, to be used when the circumstances warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 651, 911 A.2d at 866. \u201cIf the attorney delays in notifying Bar Counsel of the out-of-state suspension, or declines to cease any practice of law in Maryland, or there is any other circumstances making a concurrent suspension inappropriate, that benefit will be unavailable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652, 911 A.2d at 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">We conclude that in addition to Respondent\u2019s failure to notify Bar Counsel <em>at all, </em>her misconduct alone justifies a deviation from <em>nunc pro tunc </em>reciprocal discipline. And we are not persuaded by Respondent\u2019s argument that her failure to report to Bar Counsel was due to her inability to \u201clitigate the reciprocal matter simultaneously in all the jurisdictions, states and bars, while at the same time faithfully meeting [her] client and family obligations and court deadlines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Bar Counsel directs this Court\u2019s attention to our opinion in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 773 A.2d 463 (2001), among other similar cases, which stands for the proposition that disbarment is ordinarily the sanction for intentional dishonest conduct. In <em>Vanderlinde, </em>the attorney, while working outside of the legal profession, \u201cembezzled, stole, [or] misappropriated\u201d $3,880.67 from her then-employer and used the proceeds for her own purposes, even after she resigned and accepted a legal position with a law firm. <em>Id. </em>at 381, 773 A.2d at 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The attorney attributed her misconduct to the pressures of her life and depression she was experiencing during that time. <em>Id., </em>773 A.2d at 466. Nonetheless, we concluded that the circumstances presented in that case were not \u201cso compelling,\u201d as to overcome the attorney\u2019s misconduct and violations of the MLRPC, thereby warranting the most severe sanction of disbarment. <em>Id. </em>at 414, 773 A.2d at 485. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKT9\">[I]n cases of intentional dishonesty, misappropriation cases, fraud, stealing, serious criminal conduct and the like, we will not accept, as \u2018compelling extenuating circumstances,\u2019 anything less than the most serious and utterly debilitating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>mental or physical health conditions, arising from any source that is the \u2018root cause\u2019 of the misconduct <em>and </em>that also result in an attorney\u2019s utter inability to conform his or her conduct in accordance with the law and with the [MLRPC]. Only if the circumstances are that compelling, will we even consider imposing less than the most severe sanction of disbarment in cases of stealing, dishonesty, fraudulent conduct, the intentional misappropriation of funds or other serious criminal conduct, whether occurring in the practice of law, or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 413-14, 773 A.2d at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In justifying the sanction of disbarment, we reasoned, \u201c[u]n-like matters relating to competency, diligence[,] and the like, intentional dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to such a degree as to make intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse. Honesty and dishonesty are, or are not, present in an attorney\u2019s character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418, 773 A.2d at 488. It is for these reasons, as well as this Court\u2019s interest in protecting the public and the integrity of the legal profession that we routinely invoke <em>Vanderlinde </em>when imposing sanctions for attorneys who engage in intentional dishonest conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">To further illustrate, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Byrd, </em>408 Md. 449, 970 A.2d 870 (2009), the attorney knowingly made false statements to a bankruptcy court by filing false business reports under oath during the proceeding, thereby violating MLRPC 8.4(b), (c), and (d). <em>Id. </em>at 483, 970 A.2d at 889. The attorney also violated MLRPC 3.4(c), when he intentionally contravened various orders of the bankruptcy court. <em>Id. </em>at 484, 970 A.2d at 890. Acknowledging that the attorney\u2019s conduct involved intentional dishonesty without any compelling extenuating circumstances, we concluded \u201c[o]nly the most severe sanction of disbarment will provide the protection to the public that this [attorney grievance] procedure is supposed to provide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485, 970 A.2d at 890 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). <em>See also Zodrow, </em>419 Md. at 299-300, 305, 19 A.3d at 389, 392-93 (disbarring attorney who acted with intentional dishonesty when, absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>compelling extenuating circumstances, he failed to make pertinent disclosures to the court during his personal bankruptcy-proceeding and gave false testimony during same, amongst other misrepresentations, in violation of MLRPC 3.3, 3.4, and 8.4.).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Another comparable case is <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Levin, </em>438 Md. 211, 91 A.3d 1101 (2014). In <em>Levin, </em>the attorney made false statements to his firm regarding the number of cases he was handling, the number of legitimate bills he had sent, and his expectation of payment. <em>Id. </em>at 215, 91 A.3d at 1103-04. The attorney also misrepresented to his firm the size of his caseload and the fee amounts he expected to receive from same. <em>Id. </em>at 216, 91 A.3d at 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In furtherance of those misrepresentations, the attorney created fictitious clients and drafted corresponding paperwork. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the attorney \u201csystematically engaged in a pattern of dishonest conduct[,]\u201d through misrepresentations that spanned several months, \u201cextending from communications with a colleague and personal acquaintance, to the creation of fictitious client papers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231-32, 91 A.3d at 1113. As a result of the attorney\u2019s willful misrepresentations and dishonest conduct, we ordered disbarment, <em>Id. See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Pursuant to Standard 9.22 of the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, this Court has recognized the following aggravating factors in attorney disciplinary cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\">(a) prior disciplinary offenses; (b) dishonest or selfish motive; (c) a pattern of misconduct; (d) multiple offenses; (e) bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency; (f) submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the disciplinary process; (g) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct; (h) vulnerability of victim; (i) substantial experience in the practice of law; (j) indifference to making restitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\"><em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bleecker, </em>414 Md. 147, 176-77, 994 A.2d 928, 945-46 (2010). This Court also recognizes the following mitigating factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">[Absence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-7\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Coppola, </em>419 Md. 370, 407, 19 A.3d 431, 453 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The magistrate judge acknowledged Respondent\u2019s \u201c[r]efusal to [acknowledge [the] [w]rongful [n]ature of [her] [c]onduct,\u201d her \u201c[s]ubmission of [fjalse [evidence, [f]alse [statements, or [o]ther [d]eceptive [p]ractices during the [disciplinary [process,\u201d her \u201c[b]ad [f]aith [obstruction of the [disciplinary [p]roceeding by [ijntentionally [flailing to [c]omply with [r]ules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>or [o]rders of the [disciplinary [a]gency,\u201d and her \u201c[sjubstantial [experience in the [practice of [l]aw,\u201d as aggravating factors. The magistrate judge accepted the following factors in mitigation: (1) the absence of a prior disciplinary record, (2) character and reputation testimony presented on Respondent\u2019s behalf, (3) Respondent\u2019s personal and emotional problems during the pendency of the litigation, (4) the prior pubic reprimand by Judge Baer for her misconduct, and (5) Respondent\u2019s mitigation statement offered to the Grievance Committee in July 2009 evidencing some remorse for her conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">However, such mitigation does not sufficiently obviate the serious nature of Respondent\u2019s violations of the MLRPC and the substantial aggravating factors to warrant a suspension. \u201cHonesty is of paramount importance in the practice of law.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Agbaje, </em>438 Md. 695, 715, 93 A.3d 262, 273 (2014) (citation omitted). Candor and truthfulness, therefore, are indispensable traits, which speaks to the heart of an attorney\u2019s fitness to practice law. <em>See generally id. </em>Respondent\u2019s repeated pattern of intentional dishonest conduct, misrepresentations, and deceit to the court and her colleagues, are contrary to these characteristics and undermine the integrity of the legal profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Even more troubling is Respondent\u2019s failure to present any credible explanation for her misconduct or sincere remorse for the events that transpired.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> These facts distinguish the instant disciplinary matter from those in which this Court determined that ordering a term of suspension or a lesser sanction was justified although the attorney engaged in intentional dishonest conduct. To illustrate, in a reciprocal discipline matter, <em>Gordon, </em>413 Md. 46, 991 A.2d 51 (2010), the attorney, while representing a client in a breach of contract claim, falsified his client\u2019s signature on documents submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>to the court in connection with a summary judgment matter, where the client\u2019s signature was a material issue. <em>Id. </em>at 50-51, 991 A.2d at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The attorney filed subsequent pleadings with the falsified signature and concealed this fact from the court until the time of trial, when the client\u2019s testimony recounted the events that actually occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 991 A.2d at 53-54. We concluded that the attorney\u2019s misrepresentations to the court were in violation of MLRPC 3.3(a)(1), 3.3(a)(4), and 8.4(c), and invoked Md. Rule 16-773(e) as a result of his intentional dishonest conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 63, 991 A.2d at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Acknowledging that the sanction for the attorney\u2019s conduct could range from either suspension or disbarment, we, nonetheless ordered a forty-five day suspension. <em>Id. </em>at 62-64, 991 A.2d at 60-61. In justifying the term of suspension, we reasoned, \u201c[Mr. Gordon] has no disciplinary record from his twenty years of practicing law, he has accepted full responsibility and expressed remorse for his actions, the misrepresentation does not appear to be part of a pattern of misconduct, and his actions were not financially self-serving.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64, 991 A.2d at 61. Although Respondent similarly has no prior disciplinary record, the mitigating factors presented in <em>Gordon, </em>are not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">We must adhere to the primary function of disciplinary matters, which is to protect the public and maintain the integrity of the legal profession. These objectives would be best served by disbarment. Respondent has repeatedly expressed her future plan to relocate to Maryland. She currently maintains property in Maryland, and asserts that she has refused case referrals in this State in light of the pendency of the instant disciplinary matter. Taking guidance from <em>Vanderlinde </em>and its progeny, and in light of this Court\u2019s discretion in reciprocal discipline cases to impose a different sanction than that imposed in a sister jurisdiction if exceptional circumstances exist, we hold that disbarment, rather than a term of suspension, is the appropriate sanction for Respondent\u2019s misconduct. Accordingly, we order Respondent disbarred.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MD.

She apparently has not been the subject of any other complaints of misconduct or sanctions except for the incident that resulted in this case. That incident occurred during a discovery dispute in a hotly contested commercial case in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York nearly a decade ago. According to the Respondent, that complaint was made by the judge assigned to that case after she complained, to the chief judge of the court, about derogatory remarks made to her by the assigned judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Of course, this is a reciprocal disciplinary action and it is not our role to retry the case. And we would not want to. The evidentiary hearing in this case in the Southern District of New York took 11 days and resulted in a detailed 118-page report by the Magistrate Judge who presided at that hearing. Ultimately, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York imposed a suspension, which triggered reciprocal disciplinary proceedings in numerous other jurisdictions. Not only does our Court reach a different result, but it is a result out of step with every other jurisdiction, including the jurisdiction in which the complaint was made and those in which hearings were conducted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">\u2022 In January 2013, the Magistrate Judge who heard all of the evidence and issued the lengthy report recommended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>suspension of five years that would have concluded less than three months after she issued her report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\">\u2022 In April 2013, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, where the conduct occurred, imposed a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>suspension of seven years, which has since expired. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York later imposed a concurrent suspension which has also expired. In April 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut imposed what was essentially a concurrent <em>nunc pro tunc </em>suspension that effectively suspended Respondent for a week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">\u2022 The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia imposed a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>suspension that expired before it was imposed and conditioned reinstatement on a showing that Respondent had been reinstated in the Southern District of New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">\u2022 The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, although it declined to reverse the Southern District\u2019s disciplinary action when Respondent appealed, took no disciplinary action of its own.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">\u2022 The State Bar of New York imposed reciprocal discipline in the form of a five-year <em>nunc pro tunc </em>suspension, which expired the month after it was imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">\u2022 In Connecticut, where Respondent has her practice, the court declined to impose any discipline. After conducting its own three-day hearing, the Connecticut court concluded that \u201ceven a retroactive suspension would serve no useful purpose.\u201d The court did require Respondent to report any future allegations of misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">The Majority opinion is well written, but it necessarily only skims the surface of the detailed facts that make up this case. In my view, disbarment is not appropriate. I would impose discipline more in line with that recommended or imposed by the courts that received the complaint and that conducted hearings concerning the circumstances of the violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>The discipline need not be the same, however. There is a rationale for imposing some additional discipline unique to Maryland.
