Generally, an employee\u2019s <em>Weingarten </em>right is the employee\u2019s right under the National Labor Relations Act \u201cto refuse to submit without union representation to an interview [that the employee] reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>fears may result in [the employee\u2019s] discipline[.]\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd. v. J. Weingarten, Inc., </em>420 U.S. 251, 256, 260, 95 S.Ct. 959, 43 L.Ed.2d 171 (1975). <em>Weingarten </em>does not grant the members of the union in this case the <em>Weingarten </em>right, because the National Labor Relations Act does not apply to an employee of a State or local government. Here, we use the phrase <em>\u201cWeingarten </em>right\u201d to refer to the right to a union representative that is embodied in Article 8.C. of the instant collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">This case emanates from the circumstance that Prince George\u2019s County (\u201cthe County\u201d), Respondent/Cross-Petitioner, terminated the employment of Marlon Ford (\u201cFord\u201d), a member of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Civilian Employees Association (\u201cthe Association\u201d), Petitioner/Cross-Respondent, after a criminal investigation during which Ford was questioned regarding alleged crimes and an internal affairs investigation during which Ford was questioned regarding alleged misconduct as an employee. Following Ford\u2019s termination, the Association filed a grievance on Ford\u2019s behalf, and the parties participated in arbitration. The arbitrator vacated the County\u2019s termination of employment, imposed a thirty-day suspension instead, and granted Ford back pay. The arbitrator based the arbitration award, in part, on the determination that the County had violated a collective bargaining agreement between the County and the Association because officers of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department\u2019s Criminal Investigations Division failed to advise Ford of the right to have a representative from the Association present during the criminal investigative interview that yielded information that later formed part of the basis for his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The case involves a total of four issues: (I) whether the County had the authority to enter into a collective bargaining agreement that requires a <em>Weingarten </em>advisement before a criminal investigative interview of one of the County\u2019s police civilian employees; (II) whether the provision in the collective bargaining agreement that mandates <em>Weingarten </em>advisements before investigatory interviews applies to criminal investigative interviews; (III) whether the arbitration award violates a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>public policy of effective law enforcement; and (IV) whether the arbitrator had the authority to award reinstatement and back pay to the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">We hold that, under the County\u2019s code, the County lacked the authority to enter into a collective bargaining agreement that requires a <em>Weingarten </em>advisement before a criminal investigative interview of one of the County\u2019s police civilian employees; thus, the arbitrator exceeded his authority by basing the arbitration award on the determination that the County had violated the collective bargaining agreement because officers of the Criminal Investigations Division failed to make a <em>Weingarten </em>advisement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Agv\">The Arbitration Award</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">On August 26, 2011, the County terminated the employment of Ford, who had been working in a motor pool of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department and who was a member of the Association. In issuing an award, the arbitrator construed Article 8.C. of the collective bargaining agreement to provide that Ford was entitled to a <em>Weingarten </em>advisement before the criminal investigative interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The arbitrator found the following facts, which we summarize. Article 8.C. of the collective bargaining agreement states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">When an employee ... is to be the subject of an investigatory interview or other meeting [that] may result in discipline, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>he/she shall be informed in writing at least five (5) working days prior to the start of the interview ... of his/her right to have present, upon request, a[n Association] representative\u2014 [I]f an immediate interview is required!],] and the designated [Association] representative is unavailable, the employee may select another [Association] representative who can be present during the investigatory interview.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Article 8.1. of the collective bargaining agreement stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">The [County] will not initiate disciplinary action against an employee later than ninety (90) calendar days after the occurrence (or after the [County] was aware of the occurrence) of the alleged infraction or violation of Departmental rules or regulations or of the Personnel Law____ These time limits shall apply to alleged infractions or violations [that] affect only the [County]-employee relationship. They shall not apply to alleged violations or infractions [that] are also criminal violations nor to non-criminal violations [that] are related to an active criminal investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Ford was the subject of two investigations: a criminal investigation of allegations of theft of a handgun, impersonation of a law enforcement officer, and use of law enforcement vehicles; and an internal affairs investigation of Ford\u2019s conduct as an employee. On May 15, 2011, a law enforcement officer reported that her handgun was missing. On May 16, 2011, after advising Ford of his <em>Miranda </em>rights<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (which Ford waived in writing), but without advising Ford of his <em>Weingarten </em>right, officers of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department\u2019s Criminal Investigations Division interviewed Ford. The interview took fourteen hours and lasted into the morning of May 17, 2011. With regard to the interview, the arbitrator found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">After a very brief exchange about the missing [hand]gun, the [interview] focused entirely on [Ford]\u2019s performance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>his job, especially whether [Ford] had on multiple occasions impersonated a [law enforcement] officer and had driven [law enforcement] vehicles as if he were an officer on duty, even pulling over speeding cars[ ] using [the law enforcement] vehicle\u2019s air horn____ [N]ot to characterize the [] interview ... as an investigatory interview that may [have] resulted] in discipline would be unrealistic.... [T]he inquiry became [about Ford]\u2019s behavior as an employee who, from time to time, drove, refueled[,] and maintained [law enforcement] vehicles[.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The arbitrator noted that, at the arbitration hearing, the County argued that the decision to discharge Ford was supported by Ford\u2019s own admissions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">On the same day, the officers of the Criminal Investigations Division also interviewed Khari Grooms (\u201cGrooms\u201d), an acquaintance of Ford\u2019s. Grooms told the officers of the Criminal Investigations Division that Ford had told Grooms that he was a law enforcement officer, and had taken Grooms on multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>\u201cride-alongs.\u201d The arbitrator found: \u201cMany of Grooms\u2019[s] assertions were denied by [Ford], but[,] ultimately[,], the [officers of the Criminal Investigations Division] believed Grooms\u2019[s] version of events.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">On May 17, 2011, Ford was placed on administrative leave due to the ongoing criminal investigation. In a written notice dated July 6, 2011, the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department\u2019s Internal Affairs Division notified Ford of an investigation regarding whether Ford had used law enforcement vehicles without authorization for personal reasons; in the notice, the Internal Affairs Division advised Ford of his <em>Weingarten </em>right. On the same day, with a representative from the Association present, a member of the Internal Affairs Division interviewed Ford. On July 19, 2011, with a representative from the Association present, a member of the Internal Affairs Division performed another interview of Ford. The arbitrator found: \u201cIt would be unrealistic to claim that [the May 1617 interview by the officers of the Criminal Investigations Division] was wholly unrelated to the [Internal Affairs Division] investigation that began on July 6,\u201d 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">On August 12, 2011, Ford was issued a \u201cNotice of Intent, Proposed Disciplinary Action (Conduct Related).\u201d On August 26, 2011, Ford was issued a \u201cNotice of Final Disciplinary Action (Conduct Related),\u201d which advised that he had been terminated because of nine alleged violations of State and local law. Specifically, the Notice of Final Disciplinary Action advised that Ford had been terminated for allegedly violating: Prince George\u2019s Cnty. Code (\u201cPGCC\u201d) \u00a7 18-160(b) (\u201cNo member of the Police Department, under any circumstances, shall make any ... intentional misrepresentation of facts.\u201d) by making a false statement during the May 16, 2011 interview and a false statement during the July 19, 2011 interview;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>PGCC \u00a7 18-160(a) (\u201cNo member of the Police Department shall intentionally violate any law of ... any state[.]\u201d) and Md.Code Ann., Crim. Law (2002, 2012 Repl.Vol.) (\u201cCR\u201d) \u00a7 7-203 (Unauthorized Removal of Property) by \u201ctak[ing] unmarked [law enforcement] vehicle[s] ... without authorization\u201d on six <em>occasions;</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and PGCC \u00a7 18-160(a) and Md.Code Ann., Pub. Safety (2003, 2011 Repl.Vol., 2015 Supp.) (\u201cPS\u201d) \u00a7 3-502 (Impersonating Police Officer) by falsely identifying himself to Grooms as a law enforcement officer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The arbitrator found that Ford had not intentionally engaged in criminal behavior, but had used bad judgment by acting in ways that caused others to assume that he was a law enforcement officer, and by not disavowing that impression when it clearly had been internalized by Grooms and perhaps by others. The arbitrator sustained Ford\u2019s grievance, vacated the County\u2019s termination of his employment, imposed a thirty-day suspension instead, and granted back pay to Ford. The arbitrator based the arbitration award on the following findings: (1) Ford never \u201cacted with the intent that would be required to prove that he [committed] the crimes [that were] enumerated in the charges against him\u201d; (2) the County\u2019s \u201cpersonnel procedures ... encourage progressive discipline\u201d; (3) the County\u2019s personnel \u201cprocedures also recommend that mitigating factors ... be taken into consideration,\u201d and Ford\u2019s misconduct was mitigated by his \u201cexcellent employment record\u201d; and (4) the County violated the collective bargaining agreement because the officers of the Criminal Investigations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Division failed to advise Ford of his <em>Weingarten </em>right.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The County filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award, which the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d) denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The County appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals vacated both the circuit court\u2019s judgment and the arbitration award and remanded for a rehearing before a new arbitrator, holding in pertinent part that the arbitration award was contrary to an explicit, dominant, and well-defined public policy of effective law enforcement. <em>See Prince George\u2019s Cnty., MD. ex rel. Prince George\u2019s Cnty. Police Dep\u2019t v. Prince George\u2019s Cnty. Police Civilian Emps. Ass\u2019n, </em>219 Md.App. 108, 137, 134, 98 A.3d 1094, 1111, 1109 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">In its analysis, the Court of Special Appeals did not address whether the County had the authority to enter into a collective bargaining agreement that requires a <em>Weingarten </em>advisement before a criminal investigative interview of one of the County\u2019s employees. Instead, the Court of Special Appeals held that \u201cexpanding the requirement of [the] <em>Weingarten </em>right[ ] to union employees [who] are the focus of a criminal investigation violates public policy[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 129-30, 98 A.3d at 1107; that \u201cthe arbitrator\u2019s award ... constrains the ability of the [Prince George\u2019s County Police Department] to conduct criminal investigations and interrogations of [Association] members[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 132, 98 A.3d at 1108; and that \u201c[t]he serious crime of theft of a [law enforcement] officer\u2019s [handgun] and impersonating a [law enforcement] officer cannot give way to an employee\u2019s <em>Weingarten </em>right[ ]. To do so ... would interfere with the [Prince George\u2019s County Police Department\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>ability to investigate crimes and violate the public policy of effective law enforcement,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 134, 98 A.3d at 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">In other words, although the Court of Special Appeals held that the arbitrator\u2019s award violated public policy, the Court of Special Appeals did not assess whether the County had the authority to bargain/contract away the ability to conduct criminal investigations without making <em>Weingarten </em>advisements; rather, the Court of Special Appeals held that the violation of public policy arose because giving the <em>Weingarten </em>advisement would interfere with the police department\u2019s ability to investigate crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Proceedings in this Court</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The Association petitioned for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>raising one issue: \u201c[Did] the Court of Special Appeals err[ ] when it declared a public policy that was contrary to well-established rules ... ?\u201d The County cross-petitioned for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>raising only the issue concerning reinstatement and back pay. This Court granted the petition and the cross-petition. <em>See Prince George\u2019s Cnty. Police Civilian Emps. v. Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>441 Md. 217, 107 A.3d 1141 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">On September 2, 2015, we heard oral argument as to these two issues. On November 24, 2015, we ordered supplemental briefing and reargument as to the following two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">1. Did the negotiators of the collective bargaining agreement between [the] County and the [ ] Association have the authority to enter into a contractual provision that extends a <em>Weingarten </em>right to criminal investigations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">2. As a matter of contract interpretation, does Article 8.C. of the collective bargaining agreement apply to criminal investigations?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">The parties filed supplemental briefs. On March 8, 2016, we heard reargument.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Agj\">The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">In its supplemental brief, the Association contends that the County had the authority to enter into a collective bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>agreement requiring that a criminal investigative interview of one of its civilian employees not occur without a <em>Weingarten </em>advisement being given to the employee. The Association relies on PGCC \u00a7 13A-109(a), which states in pertinent part: \u201cThe employer[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] and the exclusive [collective bargaining] representative ... shall negotiate in good faith with respect to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment [that] are subject to negotiation under this law[.]\u201d Specifically, the Association argues that a <em>Weingarten </em>advisement is a term or condition of employment that is subject to good faith negotiation under PGCC \u00a7 13A-109(a). Alternatively, the Association asserts that this Court cannot conclude that the County lacked the authority to enter into a collective bargaining agreement that requires a <em>Weingarten </em>advisement before a criminal investigative interview of one of the County\u2019s employees, as the County did not \u201csubmit th[e] question of negotiability to\u201d the Prince George\u2019s County Public Employee Relations Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">In its supplemental brief, the County responds that PGCC \u00a7 13A-109(a) does not confer upon the County the authority to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement that affects the manner in which the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department conducts criminal investigations. The County argues that PGCC \u00a7 13A-109(a) is unambiguous in that it cannot be construed to grant the County such authority. The County asserts that, to the extent that the collective bargaining agreement purports to mandate <em>Weingarten </em>advisements during criminal investigations, the collective bargaining agreement is <em>ultra vires.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">An appellate court reviews without deference a trial court\u2019s ruling on a petition to vacate an arbitration award. <em>See Balt. Cnty. Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 4 v. Balt. Cnty., </em>429 Md. 533, 565, 540-41, 57 A.3d 425, 443, 429 (2012) (This Court reviewed for \u201clegal[ ] correctness]\u201d a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in a case that was based on a complaint to vacate an arbitration award.).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u201c[Arbitration is favored and encouraged in Maryland because it provides an informal, expeditious, and inexpensive alternative to conventional litigation.\u201d <em>Amalgamated Transit Union v.

In <em>Downey, </em>428 Md. at 263, 51 A.3d at 582, this Court explained that the issue of whether an arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator\u2019s authority is not the same as the issue of whether the arbitration award was rational or legally correct. In <em>Downey, id. </em>at 256-57, 51 A.3d at 578, a trial court granted a petition to confirm an arbitration award. The Court of Special Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to vacate several findings within the arbitration award because the arbitrator exceeded his authority. <em>See id. </em>at 258-59, 51 A.3d at 579-80. The Court of Special Appeals reasoned that the arbitrator exceeded his authority because the arbitration award was \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d and in \u201cmanifest disregard of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262, 51 A.3d at 581-82. This Court disagreed with the reasoning of the Court of Special Appeals, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019[s] reliance on [CJ] \u00a7 3-224(b)(3), i.e., the statutory ground [for review] of an [arbitration] award [that] exceeds the arbitrator\u2019s powers, is ... misplaced____[A]n issue or matter [that is] resolved by an [arbitration] award may be rational and legally correct[,] but the arbitrator, under the arbitration agreement, may have had no power or authority to resolve the particular issue. On the other hand, an issue may have clearly been within the arbitrator\u2019s powers, but the arbitrator\u2019s resolution of the issue may have been irrational or manifestly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>erroneous as a matter of law.... Consequently, judicial review of an arbitrat[ion] award on the basis of \u201cirrationality\u201d or \u201cmanifest error of law\u201d does not fall within any of the grounds [ ] in [CJ] \u00a7 3-224(b)[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 263, 51 A.3d at 582 (emphasis added). Our holding in <em>Downey, id. </em>at 263, 51 A.3d at 582, makes clear that the issue of whether an arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator\u2019s authority is not the same as the issue of whether the arbitration award was legally correct. That said, none of this Court\u2019s precedent indicates that a court must give any deference to an arbitration award where the issue is whether the arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator\u2019s powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Indeed, this Court\u2019s precedent leads to the conclusion that an arbitrator exceeds the arbitrator\u2019s authority by issuing an award that arises out of a contract that one party lacked the authority to enter. In <em>Bd. of Educ. of Charles Cnty. v. Educ. Ass\u2019n of Charles Cnty., </em>286 Md. 358, 366-67, 359, 408 A.2d 89, 93, 89 (1979), this Court upheld an arbitration award where, several months after the arbitrator issued the arbitration award, a party challenged the arbitration award on the ground that the arbitrator had exceeded his powers by enforcing an illegal contract. This Court concluded that the party\u2019s challenge was untimely under CJ \u00a7 3-224(a)(1), which, both now and at the time of <em>Bd. of Educ. of Charles Cnty., </em>stated: \u201c[A] petition to vacate [an arbitration] award shall be filed within [thirty] days after delivery of a copy of the [arbitration] award to the petitioner.\u201d <em>Bd. of Educ. of Charles Cnty., </em>286 Md. at 366-67, 360, 408 A.2d at 93, 90. More broadly, this Court \u201ch[e]ld that the provisions of [CJ \u00a7] 3-227 [ (Confirmation of Award by Court) ],[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] as well as the provisions of [CJ \u00a7] 3-224, are mandatory. A trial court must confirm an arbitration award unless the [arbitration] award is challenged within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>the applicable time constraints.\u201d <em>Bd. of Educ. of Charles Cnty., </em>286 Md. at 366, 408 A.2d at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Both now and at the time of <em>Bd. of Educ. of Charles Cnty., id. </em>at 360, 408 A.2d at 90, CJ \u00a7 3\u2014224(b)(3) stated: \u201cThe court shall vacate an [arbitration] award if ... [t]he arbitrators exceeded their powers[.]\u201d Significantly, in <em>Bd. of Educ. of Charles Cnty., id. </em>at 366, 408 A.2d at 93, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apl\">The provisions and time constraints of [CJ \u00a7\u00a7] 3-227 and [ ] 3-224 apply equally, whether the arbitration award is challenged on the ground that the underlying contract is invalid because of fraud or on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his [or her] powers because the underlying contract was illegal\u2014 [CJ \u00a7\u00a7] 3-224 and 3-227 establish an orderly mechanism whereby a court, not an arbitrator, makes the final determination of the legality of a contract before an arbitration award is enforced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">(Emphasis added). Thus, in <em>Bd. of Educ. of Charles Cnty., id. </em>at 366, 408 A.2d at 93, although the legality of the underlying contract was not before us, we unequivocally stated that an arbitrator exceeds the arbitrator\u2019s powers by issuing an award where the underlying contract is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">With the above jurisprudence in mind, we address the issues of whether the County had the authority to enter into a collective bargaining agreement that requires a <em>Weingarten </em>advisement before a criminal investigative interview of one of the County\u2019s police civilian employees, and whether, as a result, the arbitrator exceeded his authority. As noted above, this Court has not previously considered whether a county has the authority to enter into a collective bargaining agreement that requires a <em>Weingarten </em>advisement before a criminal investigative interview of one of the county\u2019s police civilian employees. As such, we examine cases in which courts in other jurisdictions have addressed similar issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Our inquiry reveals that courts in two other States, Illinois and New York, have addressed the issue of whether public employees had the right to advisements of the right to union representation before interviews by criminal investigators. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>Ill. State Police v.

The members of the law enforcement agency\u2019s division of internal investigation advised the law enforcement officer of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, but not of his right to have a union representative present during the interview. <em>See id. </em>Although the law enforcement officer did not become the subject of criminal charges or disciplinary action, he filed a grievance in which he alleged that the law enforcement agency violated the collective bargaining agreement. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">On three occasions, members of the law enforcement agency\u2019s division of internal investigation interviewed a different law enforcement officer about alleged sexual relations with a fourteen-year-old. <em>See id. </em>During the first interview, the investigation was considered a criminal matter; members of the law enforcement agency\u2019s division of internal investigation advised the law enforcement officer of his constitutional rights; and, without a union representative present, the law enforcement officer made inculpatory statements. <em>See id. </em>During the second interview, the investigation was considered an administrative matter; a union representative was allowed to be present;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the law enforcement officer recanted his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>inculpatory statements. <em>See id., </em>256 Ill.Dec. 424, 751 N.E.2d at 1263-64. During the third interview, the investigation was still considered an administrative matter, and, again, a union representative was allowed to be present. <em>See id., </em>256 Ill.Dec. 424, 751 N.E.2d at 1264. The law enforcement agency terminated the law enforcement officer, who filed a grievance in which he alleged that the law enforcement agency had violated the collective bargaining agreement. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, the law enforcement officers\u2019 union submitted both officers\u2019 grievances to arbitration. <em>See id. </em>An arbitrator sustained both officers\u2019 grievances and determined that the law enforcement agency had failed to comply with the collective bargaining agreement as to the interviews that had been part of criminal investigations, <em>See id. </em>The law enforcement agency filed a complaint to vacate the arbitration award, and a trial court affirmed the arbitration award. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The Appellate Court of Illinois began its analysis by recognizing that \u201cjudicial review of an arbitration award is extremely limited.\u201d <em>Id., </em>256 Ill.Dec. 424, 751 N.E.2d at 1265 (citation omitted).

It bears mention that Maryland law encompasses these principles as well. <em>See Downey, </em>428 Md. at 268, 51 A.3d at 585 (\u201c[J]udicial review of an arbitration award is very narrowly limited!.]\u201d (Citation omitted)); CJ \u00a7 3-224(b)(3) (\u201c[A] court shall vacate an [arbitration] award if ...

First, the arbitrator exceeded his authority because the arbitration award \u201cwas not drawn from the essence of the\u201d collective bargaining agreement, <em>id., </em>256 Ill.Dec. 424, 751 N.E.2d at 1265; by its own terms, the relevant provision of the collective bargaining agreement did not apply to criminal investigations, <em>see id. </em>(\u201c[T]he terms of [the relevant provision of the collective bargaining agreement] suggest that they apply to disciplinary proceedings, not criminal investigations.\u201d). Second, the arbitrator exceeded his authority by \u201cruling that [the law enforcement agency could] not interrogate its employees regarding criminal matters unless it complie[d] with the\u201d collective bargaining agreement. <em>Id. </em>And third, the arbitration award \u201cviolate[d] the public policy of effective law enforcement.\u201d <em>Id., </em>256 Ill.Dec. 424, 751 N.E.2d at 1267.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Significantly, as to the second reason for vacating the arbitration award \u2014 namely, that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by ruling that the law enforcement agency could not interrogate its employees regarding criminal matters unless it complied with the collective bargaining agreement \u2014 the Appellate Court of Illinois explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>[A]n employer cannot by contract give its employees procedural rights and benefits regarding criminal investigations. The fact that the employer in this case is the Illinois State Police is immaterial.

State Police, </em>256 Ill.Dec. 424, 751 N.E.2d at 1266 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York reached a similar conclusion in <em>City of New York v. Uniformed Fire Officers Ass\u2019n, Local 854, IAFF, AFL-CIO, </em>263 A.D.2d 3, 699 N.Y.S.2d 355, 360 (1999), <em>aff'd, </em>95 N.Y.2d 273, 716 N.Y.S.2d 353, 739 N.E.2d 719 (2000). In <em>City of New York, </em>699 N.Y.S.2d at 356, the New York City Fire Department and the firefighters\u2019 union were parties to a collective bargaining agreement, under which a firefighter needed to be advised of the firefighter\u2019s right to have a union representative present during any interview in which the firefighter was \u201ca suspect in a departmental investigation^]\u201d The New York City Department of Investigation interviewed firefighters without allowing a union representative to be present. <em>See id. </em>at 357. The firefighters\u2019 union filed a grievance and demanded arbitration. <em>See id. </em>at 356. The New York City Board of Collective Bargaining determined that the grievance was arbitrable. <em>See id. </em>at 357. New York City initiated an action to enjoin arbitration of the grievance. <em>See id. </em>A trial court enjoined arbitration of the grievance. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment on the ground that arbitration of the grievance was barred by a public policy against \u201cany interference with the authority of the Department [of Investigation] to require a public employee to answer questions regarding activities that bear upon the performance of official actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360, 359. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York concluded that it was a \u201cfallacy\u201d to characterize New York City \u2014 as opposed to the Fire Department \u2014 as the firefighters\u2019 \u201cemployer\u201d for pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>poses of determining whether the ability to conduct criminal investigations without making certain advisements could have been bargained away. <em>Id. </em>at 859, The Court stated: \u201c[Wjhile the Fire Department may bargain away certain of its own management prerogatives in reaching a labor accord with the [firefighters\u2019 union], [the Fire Department] has no power to defeat or impair rights conferred upon another [New York] City agency[ \u2014 namely, the Department of Investigation \u2014 ]by statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Then, however, the Court acknowledged: \u201cRestrictions may be judicially imposed even upon the waiver of an agency\u2019s own prerogatives.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">The Court indicated that, even if it were New York City \u2014 as opposed to the Fire Department \u2014 that purportedly bargained away the ability to conduct criminal investigations without making certain advisements, arbitration would still be barred on public-policy grounds. <em>See id. </em>at 360 (\u201cThe [ ] discretion conferred upon the Department [of Investigation] to carry out its mandate would likewise be impermissibly compromised by the restrictions imposed upon its examination of witnesses by the collective bargaining agreement[.]\u201d). Significantly, the Court stated: \u201cBecause the prerogative of the Department [of Investigation] to employ such investigative procedures as it deems appropriate may not be bargained away, there is no reason to submit to arbitration the question of whether the employee rights provisions of the [ ] collective bargaining agreement are binding upon the [Department of Investigation].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Deriving guidance from <em>Ill. State Police, </em>256 Ill.Dec. 424, 751 N.E.2d at 1266, and <em>City of New York, </em>699 N.Y.S.2d at 360, we conclude the County lacked the authority to enter into a collective bargaining agreement that requires a <em>Weingarten </em>advisement before a criminal investigative interview of one of the County\u2019s police civilian employees, and, as such, the arbitrator exceeded his authority by basing the arbitration award, in part, on the determination that the County violated the collective bargaining agreement because officers of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Criminal Investigations Division failed to advise Ford of his <em>Weingarten </em>right. <em>Cf. Illinois State Police, </em>256 Ill.Dec. 424, 751 N.E.2d at 1266 (\u201c[A]n employer cannot by contract give its employees procedural rights and benefits regarding criminal investigations.\u201d); <em>City of New York, </em>699 N.Y.S.2d at 360 (\u201c[T]he prerogative of the Department [of Investigation] to employ such investigative procedures as it deems appropriate may not be bargained away[.]\u201d). To conclude otherwise would encroach upon the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department\u2019s statutorily mandated duty to \u201cenforce! ] th[e PGCC] and all other laws and ordinances[,]\u201d PGCC \u00a7 18-135(a)(5), which obviously includes conducting criminal investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">No provision of the Prince George\u2019s County Code gives the County the authority to enter into a collective bargaining agreement that requires a <em>Weingarten </em>advisement before a criminal investigative interview of one of the County\u2019s police civilian employees. Contrary to the Association\u2019s contention, PGCC \u00a7 13A-109(a) does not confer on the County the authority to enter into a collective bargaining agreement that requires a <em>Weingarten </em>advisement before a criminal investigative interview of one of the County\u2019s police civilian employees. PGCC \u00a7 13A-109(a) states in pertinent part: \u201cThe employer and the exclusive [collective bargaining] representative ... shall negotiate in good faith with respect to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment [that] are subject to negotiation under this law[.]\u201d Nothing in PGCC \u00a7 13A-109(a) even remotely contemplates that the County may require <em>Weingarten </em>advisements in criminal investigations. In other words, as the County asserts, nothing in PGCC \u00a7 13A-109(a) enables the County to \u201cby contract give its employees procedural rights and benefits regarding criminal investigations.\u201d <em>Illinois State Police, </em>256 Ill.Dec. 424, 751 N.E.2d at 1266. Where an employee is under investigation for having potentially committed a crime, by definition, the suspected criminal conduct, even if committed at the workplace, does not fall within the ambit of the employee\u2019s terms and conditions of employment. Stated otherwise, suspected criminal activity is not conduct that is related to an employee\u2019s \u201cwages, hours and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>other terms and conditions of employment^]\u201d PGCC \u00a7 13A-109(a). Indeed, in some instances, an employee may be the subject of a criminal investigative interview regarding criminal activity that is completely unrelated to his or her job. We agree with the County\u2019s counsel\u2019s assertion at oral argument that, for the County to have the authority to enter into a collective bargaining agreement that requires a <em>Weingarten </em>advisement before a criminal investigative interview of one of the its police civilian employees, there would need to be authority for the County to do <em>so </em>\u2014 e.g., a provision of the Prince George\u2019s County Code \u2014 that would grant the County such authority or, in other words, permit the County to engage in collective bargaining as to the County\u2019s duty to enforce the law. PGCC \u00a7\u00a7 13A-109(a) and 18-135 do not come close to conferring upon the County the authority that the Association attributes to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">We are unpersuaded by the Association\u2019s attempt to distinguish Il<em>l. State Police, </em>256 Ill.Dec. 424, 751 N.E.2d at 1266, and <em>City of New York, </em>699 N.Y.S.2d at 360, on the ground that those two cases involved \u201cpurely\u201d criminal investigations; by contrast, according to the Association, the instant investigation was not \u201cpurely\u201d criminal because, on May 16, 2011, Ford\u2019s supervisor \u201ccalled him into work [and] compelled him to answer questions[.]\u201d The Association contends that the County has the authority to bind itself to making <em>Weingarten </em>advisements in investigations that are not \u201cpurely\u201d criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The Association raises a distinction without a difference. It is immaterial whether an investigation is \u201cpurely\u201d criminal. Where an investigation is criminal \u2014 purely so or not \u2014 the County lacks the authority to bind itself to making <em>Weingarten </em>advisements. This is so because the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department has a duty to conduct criminal investigations, <em>see </em>PGCC \u00a7 18-135(a), regardless of whether the subject of a criminal investigation is an employee, and regardless of whether the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department conducts the criminal investigation as it would with a non-employee \u2014 for example, by visiting the employee at the employee\u2019s home and asking questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>At reargument, the Association\u2019s counsel asserted that the arbitrator found that, during the May 16-17, 2011 interview of Ford, the County was acting in its capacity as an employer, as opposed to its capacity as an entity that investigates crimes. The Association is mistaken; the arbitrator\u2019s findings of fact establish that the May 16-17, 2011 interview of Ford was part of a criminal investigation. Specifically, the arbitrator found that, on May 16-17, 2011, officers of the Criminal Investigations Division \u2014 not members of the Internal Affairs Division\u2014 interviewed Ford. Additionally, the arbitrator found that the interview concerned alleged crimes \u2014 namely, an alleged theft of a handgun, impersonation of a police officer, and unauthorized use of law enforcement vehicles. Although, in the arbitration award, the arbitrator stated that the interview later focused on matters that the arbitrator apparently believed were not criminal in nature, a fair reading of the arbitration award reveals that the arbitrator was well-aware\u2014 and, indeed, explicitly found \u2014 that the May 16-17, 2011 interview of Ford was part of a criminal investigation and was conducted by members of the Criminal Investigations Division of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">We note that the Maryland Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights has no effect upon our decision in this case. The Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights expressly allows counsel or another responsible <em>representative </em>\u2014 e.g., a union representative \u2014 to be present during an interrogation of the law enforcement officer. <em>See </em>PS \u00a7 3 \u2014 104(j)(1)(i) (\u201cOn request, the law enforcement officer under interrogation has the right to be represented by counsel or another responsible representative of the law enforcement officer\u2019s choice who shall be present and available for consultation at all times during the interrogation.\u201d). The Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights applies only to a law enforcement officer, which it defines as \u201can individual who[] in an official capacity is authorized by law to make arrests\u201d and \u201cis a member of one\u201d among a list of law enforcement agencies. PS \u00a7 3 \u2014 101(e)(1). Thus, the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights does not apply to Ford and other civilian employees of law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>agencies. Neither the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights, PGCC \u00a7 13A-109(a) (\u201cThe employer and the exclusive [collective bargaining] representative ... shall negotiate in good faith with respect to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment [that] are subject to negotiation under this law[.]\u201d), nor any other provision of the Prince George\u2019s County Code or the Code of Maryland contemplates, let alone expressly allows, that a union representative be present during a criminal investigative interview of a police civilian employee.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">The Association\u2019s reliance on the collective bargaining agreement between the State and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees \u2014 namely, the provision of that collective bargaining agreement that states: \u201cThe right to [union] representation does include a criminal investigation\u201d \u2014 for the proposition that the County had the authority to enter into a collective bargaining agreement that requires a <em>Weingarten </em>advisement before a criminal investigative interview of one of the County\u2019s employees is misplaced. In contending as much, the Association is not relying on any precedent or case law \u2014 instead, the Association simply raises the superficial argument that, if the State decided to require <em>Weingarten </em>advisements, then the County must have had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>authority to do the same. In contrast with the State\u2019s volitional extension of the <em>Weingarten </em>right to criminal investigations, the County contends that it had neither the authority nor the intent to enter into such an agreement, and argues that the plain language of the instant collective bargaining agreement does not support the conclusion that it did so. In sum, unlike the State, the County expressly asserts that the collective bargaining agreement does not confer upon its police civilian employees the right to a <em>Weingarten </em>advisement before a criminal investigative interview. As a practical matter, the State\u2019s collective bargaining agreement was executed on December 30, 2014, over two-and-a-half years after the County entered into the instant collective bargaining agreement on March 30, 2012. Thus, the circumstance that the State expressly contracted to provide union representation during criminal interviews is not subject to the interpretation that the County intended to mirror the State\u2019s collective bargaining-agreement but, for some reason, failed to include specific terms providing for union representation during criminal investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">That the State has chosen to knowingly and explicitly provide for union representation during criminal investigations does not confer upon the County the authority, when acting in the capacity of an employer in collective bargaining process, to contract regarding the manner in which the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department conducts its statutorily mandated duties as a law enforcement agency. <em>See </em>PGCC \u00a7 18-135(a) (\u201cThe Police Department functions shall be as follows: (1) The protection of life and property. (2) The preservation of peace and order. (3) The prevention of crime. (4) The arrest of all violators of the law. (5) The enforcement of th[e PGCC] and all other laws and ordinances.... \u201d (Paragraph breaks omitted) (emphasis added)). Stated otherwise, the State\u2019s decision to enter into a collective bargaining agreement establishing the opportunity for union representation for civilian employees during criminal investigations is not dispositive of the County\u2019s authority to do so. The circumstance remains that neither PGCC \u00a7 13A-109(a) (\u201cThe employer and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>exclusive [collective bargaining] representative ... shall negotiate in good faith with respect to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment [that] are subject to negotiation under this law[.]\u201d) nor any other provision of the Prince George\u2019s County Code or the Code of Maryland provides the County with the authority to engage in collective bargaining about matters that are related to the prevention of crime or the conducting of criminal investigations. Reaching a conclusion that is similar to that of the Appellate Court of Illinois in <em>Ill. State Police, </em>256 Ill.Dec. 424, 751 N.E.2d at 1266, we conclude that, when the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department is investigating an employee\u2019s criminal conduct, the police department is acting under its statutorily mandated duty to enforce the laws of Prince George\u2019s County. <em>See </em>PGCC \u00a7 18-135(a)(5) (\u201cThe Police Department functions shall be as follows: ... (5) The enforcement of th[e PGCC] and all other laws and ordinances.\u201d). The County lacked the authority in the collective bargaining process to grant contractual rights to police civilian employees in criminal investigations that the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department is required by statute to conduct. We decline to conclude that, because the State entered into a collective bargaining agreement extending the <em>Weingarten </em>right to criminal investigations, the County was therefore empowered to do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Our conclusion in this case does not at all undermine the well-established principles that \u201cjudicial review of an arbitration award is very narrowly limited,\u201d <em>Downey, </em>428 Md. at 268, 51 A.3d at 585 (citation omitted); that \u201c[m]ere errors of law ... do not ordinarily furnish grounds for a court to vacate ... an arbitration award[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 266, 51 A.3d at 583 (brackets, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted); and that a court may not substitute its interpretation of a contract for an arbitrator\u2019s, <em>see Amalgamated Transit Union, Div. 1300, </em>305 Md. at 388, 504 A.2d at 1136 (\u201c[S]o far as the arbitrator\u2019s decision concerns construction of the contract, the courts have no business overruling [the arbitration award] because their interpretation of the contract is different from [the arbitrator\u2019s].\u201d (Citation omitted)). Notably, CJ \u00a7 3-224(b)(3) states: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>\u201c[A] court shall vacate an [arbitration] award if ... [t]he arbitrators exceeded their powers[.]\u201d In determining whether an arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator\u2019s powers, a court does not review the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of a contract for legal correctness. <em>See Downey, </em>428 Md. at 263, 51 A.3d at 582 (\u201c[J]udicial review of an arbitration] award on the basis of ... \u2018manifest error of law\u2019 does not fall within any of the grounds [ ] in [CJ] \u00a7 3-224(b)[.]\u201d). Instead, in determining whether an arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator\u2019s powers, a court determines whether the arbitrator acted within the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s authority. <em>See id. </em>at 263, 51 A.3d at 582 (\u201c[A]n issue or matter resolved by an award may be rational and legally correct but the arbitrator, under the arbitration agreement, may have had no power or authority to resolve the particular issue.\u201d (Emphasis added)). Thus, our case law establishes a distinction between review of an arbitration award for correctness \u2014 as opposed to review of the validity of a collective bargaining agreement or whether the arbitrator exceed the arbitrator\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Finally, we dispose of the Association\u2019s contention that this Court cannot conclude that the County lacked the authority to contract away its ability to conduct criminal investigations without making <em>Weingarten </em>advisements, as the County did not \u201csubmit th[e] question of negotiability to\u201d the Prince George\u2019s County Public Employee Relations Board. The Prince George\u2019s County Public Employee Relations Board\u2019s duties include resolving negotiability disputes. <em>See </em>PGCC \u00a7 13A \u2014 110(f)(1) (\u201cThe [Unfair Labor Practices] Panel [of the Prince George\u2019s County Public Employee Relations Board] may issue a statement, accompanied by reasons therefor, indicating whether item in dispute is negotiable.\u201d). PGCC \u00a7 13A-110(a) defines a \u201cnegotiability dispute\u201d as occurring \u201cwhen a labor organization and an employer disagree on whether the collective bargaining agreement, applicable rules or regulations, this law, other law or the [Prince George\u2019s] County Charter, as the case may be, prohibits bargaining with respect to a specified matter.\u201d Significantly, PGCC \u00a7 13A-110(b) states: \u201c[Disputes over what is subject to a grievance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>procedure and what is arbitrable under such procedure shall not be resolved under the procedures set forth in\u201d PGCC \u00a7 13A-110. (Emphasis added). In other words, under PGCC \u00a7 13A-110, an arbitrator, not the Prince George\u2019s County Public Employee Relations Board, decides in the first instance whether a matter that arises out of a grievance is arbitrable. In turn, under CJ \u00a7 3-224(b)(3), a court reviews an arbitration award to determine whether an arbitrator \u201cexceeded [the arbitrator\u2019s] powers[.]\u201d Here, we have the statutory authority to review the arbitration award and decide whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">In sum, a careful review of Maryland case law and authority from other jurisdictions leads to the conclusion that an arbitration award may be vacated where an arbitrator exceeded his or her authority and that an arbitrator exceeds the arbitrator\u2019s authority by issuing an award where one of the parties lacked authority to enter into the underlying contract. For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that PGCC \u00a7 13A-109(a) does not confer upon the County the authority to enter into a collective bargaining agreement requiring that a police civilian employee be advised of a right to have a union representative present before a criminal investigative interview by the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department. The judgment of the Court of Special Appeals is hereby affirmed in part and reversed in part. We affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals vacating the judgment of the circuit court and remanding for further proceedings. We reverse, however, the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals insofar as the Court ordered that the case be remanded for the purpose of a rehearing before a new arbitrator. Rather, we hold that the case shall be remanded for consideration of an appropriate award by the same arbitrator based on the existing grounds supporting the award, absent the alleged <em>Weingarten </em>violation. The case shall be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART AS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>STATED IN THE OPINION.

The Appellate Court of Illinois\u2019s analysis of the issue as to public policy is an alternative holding, and, as such, is <em>dicta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Here, although the Association raised an issue as to public policy in the petition for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>courts in Illinois and New York have resolved similar cases primarily on the separate issue of the employers\u2019 ability to enter into the collective bargaining agreements. In determining that the arbitrators\u2019 awards were not enforceable, neither the Illinois court nor the New York court relied primarily on its analysis as to public policy. As such, we do not address the issue as to public policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b231-5\">. On a related note, the Association asserts that requiring <em>Weingarten </em>advisements would be good policy because such a requirement could boost employees\u2019 morale. The Association\u2019s assertion is beside the point. Regardless of whether a requirement of <em>Weingarten </em>advisements would be good for employee morale, the fact remains that no provision of the Prince George\u2019s County Code or the Code of Maryland contemplates that such a requirement would apply to civilian employees of law enforcement agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The Association also asserts that requiring <em>Weingarten </em>advisements could help protect employees' privilege against self-incrimination. Contrary to the Association\u2019s implication, employees' privilege against self-incrimination is already protected by the right to counsel, which applies to all custodial interrogations. <em>See State v.

Indeed, here, the officers of the Criminal Investigations Division advised Ford of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, which Ford waived in writing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b235-5\">. Although we do not decide the issue of back pay and reinstatement, we provide the following for guidance upon remand. Before this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Court, the County contended that the arbitrator lacked the authority to award reinstatement and back pay to Ford based at least partially on the County's violation of the collective bargaining agreement <em>(i.e., </em>the failure of the officers of the Criminal Investigations Division to advise Ford of his <em>Weingarten </em>right). The Association responded that the arbitrator had the authority to award reinstatement and back pay to Ford because the arbitrator based the award on multiple considerations, not just the failure of the officers of the Criminal Investigations Division to advise Ford of his <em>Weingarten </em>right.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In opposing the remedy of back pay and reinstatement based on an alleged <em>Weingarten </em>violation, the County relied on <em>Taracorp Indus., </em>273 N.L.R.B. 221, 223 (1984), in which <em>the </em>National Labor Relations Board held: \"[W]e are without authority to order reinstatement and back[ ]pay as a remedy for a <em>Weingarten </em>violation.\u201d <em>Taracorp </em>concerns the propriety of reinstatement and back pay based exclusively on a <em>Weingarten </em>violation, which is no longer a concern in this case given our holding. <em>Taracorp </em>has no value in assessing the propriety of an award of reinstatement and back pay where an alleged <em>Weingarten </em>violation is not sustained. Here, independent of the alleged <em>Weingarten </em>violation, the arbitrator based the award on the following considerations: (1) Ford never \"acted with the intent that would be required to prove that he [committed] the crimes enumerated in the charges against him\u201d; (2) the County\u2019s \"personnel procedures ... encourage progressive discipline\u201d; and (3) the County's personnel \"procedures also recommend that mitigating factors ... be taken into consideration,\u201d and Ford\u2019s misconduct was mitigated by his \u201cexcellent employment record[.]\"</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">CJ \u00a7 3-225(a) provides that \"[i]f any award is vacated on grounds other than those stated in [CJ] \u00a7 3-224(b)(5) of this subtitle, the court may order a rehearing before new arbitrators selected by the parties as provided by the agreement, or by the court in the absence of an agreement as provided in [CJ] \u00a7 3 \u2014 211[.]\u201d Upon setting forth CJ \u00a7 3-225(a), the Court of Special Appeals vacated the arbitrator's decision and award, stating: \u201cAfter rehearing, the decision of the new arbitrator will be the final award, subject to the very limited judicial review applicable to arbitration awards generally.\u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty., 219 </em>Md.App. at 137, 98 A.3d at 1111 (citations omitted). We disagree with the Court of Special Appeals that the case must be remanded for a rehearing pursuant to CJ \u00a7 3-225(a) before a new arbitrator. The arbitrator conducted a full hearing, made detailed findings of fact, and issued an award on four grounds, three of which exist independent of the alleged <em>Weingarten </em>violation. The case shall be remanded to the same arbitrator for consideration in light of our holding in this case. Specifically, on remand, the arbitrator shall determine whether the three grounds for the award that were independent of the alleged <em>Weingarten </em>violation- \u2014 lack of intent, progressive discipline, and mitigating factors \u2014 are or are not sufficient to support an award for back pay and reinstatement or a different award.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
