Cavanaugh to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law. On September 4, 2015, Judge Cavanaugh (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) sanctioned Respondent for failure to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s written discovery requests. The sanctions included, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number><em>inter alia, </em>precluding Respondent from producing any evidence/witnesses at the disciplinary hearing, and deeming that all allegations in the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action were admitted. On September 21, 2015, a hearing was held, and on October 22, 2015, the hearing judge issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. The hearing judge concluded \u201cthat there [was] clear and convincing evidence to support each of the charged violations[ ]\u201d in the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">On February 8, 2016, we heard oral argument. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the hearing judge did not abuse her discretion in imposing discovery sanctions, and we order that Respondent be disbarred.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">a. The hearing judge\u2019s discovery sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">On May 20, 2015, Charles J. Balint (\u201cMr. Balint\u201d), counsel for Respondent, accepted service of process, including a copy of the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action. Respondent thereafter obtained an extension of time to file a response to the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action until June 17, 2015, but did not file a response until June 18, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">On July 10, 2015, Mr. Balint and Deputy Bar Counsel (\u201cBar Counsel\u201d) appeared for a scheduling conference, and Bar Counsel hand delivered interrogatories and a request for production of documents to Mr. Balint. Mr. Balint and Bar Counsel agreed to several deadlines that were incorporated into a scheduling order. The order established a deadline for the completion of written discovery by August 17, 2015, and completion of all discovery by September 4, 2015. Respondent was not present at the scheduling conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">On September 2, 2015, Petitioner filed a Motion for Sanctions for Failure of Discovery, and an accompanying Motion to Shorten Time for Respondent to Respond. According to Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Sanctions, Respondent had thirty (30) days to respond to the interrogatories and request for produc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>tion of documents that were hand delivered on July 10, 2015, and thirty (30) days to respond to an additional request for production of documents that was mailed to Mr. Balint on July 24, 2015. <em>See </em>Md. Rules 2-421 (b) and 2-422(c). Despite an understanding between Bar Counsel and Mr. Balint that written discovery responses would be received by August 28, 2015,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> no responses were received as of September 1, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Petitioner alleged that the Motion to Shorten Time to Respond was necessary because \u201cRespondent\u2019s failure to provide written discovery greatly prejudiced] the ability of Petitioner\u2019s counsel to prepare to take Respondent\u2019s deposition[,]\u201d which was scheduled, by agreement of counsel, for September 8, 2015. Petitioner also contended that, \u201c[g]iven the short period of time allowed to conduct discovery prior to trial in disciplinary matters, compliance with discovery requirements and deadlines is imperative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The hearing judge granted the Motion to Shorten Time to Respond on September 2, 2015, and ordered a response by 11 a.m. on September 4, 2015. When no response was received by the September 4 deadline, the hearing judge imposed the following sanctions: the averments in the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action were deemed admitted; Respondent\u2019s Response to the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action was stricken; Respondent was precluded from calling any witnesses or presenting any documents at trial; and Respondent was prohibited from asserting any affirmative defenses, mitigation, or extenuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">On September 8, 2015, Respondent filed a Response to Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Sanctions and a Motion to Reconsider. In the Motion to Reconsider, Respondent alleged that Mr. Balint was not in his office from 12:50 p.m. on September 2, 2015, until 9:30 a.m. on September 4, 2015. Thus, Mr. Balint would not have been able to respond by the shortened dead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>line. In the Response to Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Sanctions, Respondent noted that he had been outside of Maryland and had electronically forwarded discovery material to Mr. Balint, who was unable to open the email attachment. The hearing judge denied the Motion to Reconsider without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">On September 21, 2015, the parties appeared for a hearing on the merits of Respondent\u2019s violations. At the outset of the hearing, Mr. Balint informed the judge that Respondent wanted to be heard on the discovery sanctions. Respondent explained that he advised Mr. Balint in June that he had a vacation scheduled on August 22 or 23, 2015. Respondent informed the hearing judge that he received the request for production of documents and interrogatories from Mr. Balint on Friday, August 14, 2015, and had three trials the following week. However, Respondent believed that he had until September 14, 2015, to complete the discovery responses because he thought that the requests had been received on August 14, 2015, the day Mr. Balint sent them to him. According to Respondent, he intended to finish his discovery responses when he returned from vacation on September 6, 2015, and was entirely unaware of the September 4, 2015, deadline for discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The hearing judge again denied Respondent\u2019s Motion to Reconsider the discovery sanctions, noting that Respondent had failed to provide \u201c[a] compelling reason to further delay these proceedings that are ... on a very tight timeline pursuant to the rules.\u201d The hearing judge granted Mr. Balint\u2019s motion to withdraw in light of Respondent\u2019s representations concerning his counsel. The hearing proceeded with Respondent <em>pro se, </em>and concluded later that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">b. Respondent\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">On October 14, 2015, after the conclusion of the hearing, Respondent filed a Motion for Reconsideration and for Appropriate Relief with the assistance of new counsel. Respondent requested that the hearing judge strike the order \u201cprecluding Respondent from submitting evidence in defense of Petitioner\u2019s allegations and deeming as admitted the averments in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action[.]\u201d Respondent again alleged that \u201cMr. Balint failed to provide him with Bar Counsel\u2019s written discovery requests in a timely manner and to otherwise represent him in a competent manner.\u201d Respondent alleged that reconsideration was appropriate where he participated in the September 8, 2015 deposition, \u201cprovided Answers to Interrogatories and produced many of the requested records\u201d after the hearing judge\u2019s imposition of sanctions, and was currently \u201cin the process of having reconciliations performed for his IOLTA and Trust bank accounts by an accounting/bookkeeping professional ]\u201d so that he could fully comply with Petitioner\u2019s request for documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">On October 22, 2015, the hearing judge filed a Memorandum Opinion denying Respondent\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The hearing judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">Respondent\u2019s discovery violations are severe, substantial and ongoing. To date, Respondent has yet to fully respond to the discovery served upon him on July 10 and July 17, 2015.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] Respondent proffers that he is \u201cin the process of having reconciliations performed for his IOLTA and Trust bank accounts by an accounting/bookkeeping professional. Respondent anticipates that these reports will be completed, and made available to Bar Counsel within the next twenty (20) days.\u201d See <em>Respondent\u2019s Motion at pp. 3-4. </em>However, Respondent has had formal notice of these proceedings for nearly five months \u2014 since May 20, 2015 \u2014 and actual notice of Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiry for many months more. Any reconciliation of Respondent\u2019s professional banking accounts in preparation for these proceedings should been initiated, at a minimum, before the scheduled hearing date in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Respondent initially claimed that his discovery failures were due to his counsel\u2019s failure to send him the discovery requests in a timely fashion; however, three months after those requests were served, discovery is still not complete. This court found Respondent\u2019s explanation for his discovery violations incredible at trial and the scant proof offered by Respondent to bolster his claim supports the court\u2019s conclusions. <em>See </em>[ ] <em>Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 1. </em>This court and Petitioner have both been severely prejudiced by Respondent\u2019s discovery failures which continue to the date of this opinion and are anticipated to continue, by Respondent\u2019s own estimate, through the filing date for this court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Therefore, the prejudice suffered by Petitioner, this court and Maryland\u2019s Court of Appeals due to Respondent\u2019s continued delay will not be cured by a simple continuance or postponement of this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">c. The hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">On October 22, 2015, the hearing judge filed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. The findings of fact were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">On January 27, 2005, John and Sally McClelland (husband and wife) signed a Trust Agreement drafted by Respondent as their attorney. This agreement established \u201cThe McClelland Family Revocable Living Trust\u201d (hereinafter \u201cthe McClelland Trust\u201d) with John and Sally McClelland designated as Trustees. John McClelland passed away on September 20, 2008. On October 11, 2010, Sally McClelland signed a Trustee Renunciation by which she relinquished her positon as the surviving Trustee of the McClelland Trust to Respondent, who was named in the original Trust Agreement to be appointed as Successor Trustee in the event John and Sally McClelland could no longer serve as trustee(s) \u201cdue to physical or mental incapacity, or death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As9\">On March 1, 2011, Respondent opened a checking account in the name of the McClelland Trust (account number ending in 8938) at First Mariner Bank. The McClelland Trust also held additional assets, including funds invested in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>a brokerage account. From the time he took over as Successor Trustee in October 2010, Respondent was responsible for McClelland Trust financial accounts and for managing any funds entrusted to him in the fiduciary role of trustee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">From the time he took over as trustee, Respondent regularly deposited funds he received on behalf of the McClelland Trust into his attorney escrow account, which was also maintained at First Mariner Bank (account number ending in 1962), instead of depositing such funds into the McClelland Trust checking account. Respondent\u2019s escrow account at First Mariner was an account maintained pursuant to Title 16, Chapter 600 of the Maryland Rules. From October 2010 through September 2013, Respondent incrementally deposited $281,651.95 of McClelland Trust funds into his attorney escrow account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">On December 17, 2010, Respondent made a loan in the amount of $40,000 to Mangia Bene, LLC, a business entity owned by Greg Orendorff, one of Respondent\u2019s clients, by issuing a check drawn on Respondent\u2019s attorney escrow account. Respondent designated this transaction as a loan of McClelland Trust funds from his escrow account. Respondent did not engage independent legal counsel to represent the McClelland Trust regarding the $40,000.00 loan he made as trustee to a legal clients\u2019 business entity, nor did he advise the loan recipient in writing of the desirability of seeking independent legal advice before entering into a financial transaction with Respondent in his capacity as trustee of the McClelland Trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">By November 2011, Respondent no longer maintained the accrued balance of McClelland Trust funds in his attorney escrow account. Bar Counsel\u2019s investigator, Mr. Fiedler, testified concerning his analysis of escrow account bank records obtained by subpoena from First Mariner Bank and the Quicken Register report Respondent provided in the course of Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation. From those records, Mr. Fiedler was able to compile a \u201cNegative Balance Chart\u201d (Tab 24 of Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1) demonstrating that on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>November 25, 2011, the overall balance in Respondent\u2019s escrow account was only $88,572.21 at a time when Respondent should have been holding $95,443.73 in the account solely for the McClelland Trust client matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">The McClelland Trust negative balance subsequently increased. By March 2012, Respondent\u2019s overall escrow account balance was drawn down to an amount under $17,000.00. No significant disbursements of McClelland Trust funds occurred during this period. As just one snapshot of the deficiency in McClelland Trust funds, on March 21, 2012, the overall balance in Respondent\u2019s escrow account was at $16,300.90. At that time, he should have still had $91,693.73 in the account solely for the McClelland Trust matter. Respondent therefore has an escrow account deficiency of $75,392.83 with regard to the individual client matter of the McClelland Trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">Mr. Fiedler pointed out in his testimony that Respondent personally benefited from the misappropriation of McClelland Trust funds. From November 17-25, 2011, Respondent issued four checks totaling $13,734.00 payable to himself, including two checks (numbered 3108 and 3113) with no memo notation identifying any client matter. This issuance of such checks contributed to the initial negative balance on McClelland Trust funds on November 25, 2011. Thereafter, throughout 2012 and 2013, Respondent continued to draw checks payable to himself, including many that included no memo notation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\"># * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">This court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent knowingly and intentionally misappropriated funds entrusted to him as trustee of the McClelland Trust and that he derived personal benefit from the use of the misappropriated funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">As averred in paragraph 10 of the original and amended petitions, Respondent also drew numerous checks to cash on his attorney escrow account!.] ... Petitioner does not contest that the cash obtained from these checks was deposited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>into Sally McClelland\u2019s personal checking account at Wachovia (later Wells Fargo) Bank during her lifetime, but the drawing of checks payable to cash nevertheless constituted a prohibited transaction under Maryland Rule 16-609b.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">Sally McClelland passed away on March 24, 2013. At the time of her death, the McClelland Trust checking account at First Mariner Bank had a balance of only $303.40. On April 24, 2013, Respondent deposited $41,664.87 to the McClelland Trust checking account, constituting the aggregate sum from three separate bank accounts maintained by Sally McClelland at the time of her death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">On April 24, 2013, Respondent issued check number 1204 drawn on the McClelland Trust checking account in the amount of $11,602.00 payable to Duda-Ruck Funeral Home of Dundalk in payment of Sally McClelland\u2019s funeral expenses. On the same date, he issued a check number 1203 drawn on the McClelland trust checking account in the amount of $3,000.00 payable to \u201cHerkimer Street LLC,\u201d a forfeited business entity of which Respondent and his wife Marjorie were the sole members. Respondent knowingly issued this check as an unauthorized disbursement of McClelland Trust funds for his personal benefit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">On May 11, 2013, Respondent issued a check number 1205 drawn on the McClelland Trust checking account in the amount of $10,000 payable to \u201cKenwalls II, LLC.\u201d The memo line on the check identified it as \u201cLoan.\u201d Kenwalls II, LLC is a business entity owned and organized by Brian E. Walls, Respondent\u2019s son-in-law, to purchase, remodel and sell homes. Respondent did not engage independent legal counsel to review the terms of the transaction on behalf of the McClelland Trust when making this loan to his son-in-law\u2019s business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">On May 31, 2013, Respondent authorized a $15,000.00 wire transfer of funds from the McClelland Trust checking account to Brian Walls. This transaction was designated as a loan secured by a mortgage on a parcel of real property Mr. Walls owned in Camden County, Missouri. Respondent did not engage independent legal counsel to review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>terms of the transaction on behalf of the McClelland Trust when making this personal loan to his son-in-law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\">In August 2013, legal counsel for First Mariner Bank wrote to Bar Counsel to report concerns about the activity in the McClelland Trust checking account, including issuance of the checks to Herkimer Street LLC and Kenwalls II LLC and the wire transfer to Brian Walls. In response to Bar Counsel\u2019s initial inquiry letter, Respondent, through counsel, falsely claimed that the $3,000.00 check to Herkimer Street LLC \u201cwas drawn on the wrong account\u201d in error. Only after receiving notice of the complaint did Respondent return $3,000.00 to the McClelland Trust checking account by depositing a check (drawn on the Kenwalls II, LLC checking account) on September 26, 2013.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">Following commencement of Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation. Respondent obtained repayments of the three outstanding loans of McClelland trust funds from Mangia Bene LLC, Kenwalls, II LLC and Brian Walls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">In the course of Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation, Respondent provided an accounting of McClelland Trust funds that did not accurately account for all funds entrusted to him in a fiduciary capacity. Respondent did not create and maintain a client matter record that complied with the requirements of Maryland Rule 16-606.1(a)(3) for the McClelland Trust funds in his attorney escrow account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">On April 4, 2013, Respondent deposited a check issued by Pershing/Founders Financial Securities LLC, payable to \u201cThe McClelland Family Rev. Trust\u201d in the amount of $15,000.00, into his attorney escrow account. Respondent did not include that deposit in the accounting of McClelland Trust funds provided to Bar Counsel\u2019s investigator in January 2014 during the investigation of the complaint prior to the filing of public charges (Tab 17 of Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1). Respondent added the $15,000.00 deposit to a revised \u2018McClelland-IOLTA Report\u201d (Tab 25) he produced to Petitioner when he appeared for his deposition in this matter on September 8, 2015.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>d. The hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Based on the above findings of fact, the hearing judge concluded that there was clear and convincing evidence that Respondent had violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.7, 1.8(a), 1.15(a) and (d), 8.1(a), 8.4(a)-(d), Maryland Rules 16-606.1 and 16-609, and Bus.

Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d The hearing judge concluded that \u201c[b]y failing to act in a manner consistent with the stated disposition objectives of the McClelland Trust Settlors (John and Sally McClelland), ... Respondent did not provide competent representation to the McClelland Trust.\u201d (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sachse, </em>345 Md. 578, 585-86, 693 A.2d 806, 810 (1997) (lawyer\u2019s failure to use knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for protection of trust or its beneficiaries violated Rule 1.1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Rule 1.7<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">MLRPC 1.7 prohibits representation involving a conflict of interest, which exists where \u201cthere is a significant risk that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer\u2019s responsibilities to another client, a former client or a third person or by a personal interest of the lawyer.\u201d MLRPC 1.7(a)(2); <em>see Sachse, </em>345 Md. at 588, 693 A.2d at 811 (\u201cConflicts of interest impair the trustee\u2019s ability to act on behalf of the beneficiaries with independent and disinterested judgment in the administration of the trust, the rationale being that it is generally not possible for the same person to act fairly in two capacities and on behalf of two interests in the same transaction.\u201d) (citation omitted). The hearing judge concluded that Respondent\u2019s loans of McClelland Trust funds to another client\u2019s business, his son-in-law\u2019s business, and his son-in-law individually, violated MLRPC 1.7. The hearing judge also observed that Respondent, \u201c[a]s the conflicted trustee\u201d, was incapable of waving the conflict of interest on behalf of the trust by giving informed consent. <em>See </em>MLRPC 1.7(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Rule 1.8<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">MLRPC 1.8(a)(3) prohibits an attorney from \u201center[ing] into a business transaction with a client unless ... the client is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>advised in writing of the desirability of seeking and is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent legal counsel[.]\u201d The hearing judge concluded that this rule was violated where Respondent made a $40,000.00 loan of McClelland Trust funds to another client\u2019s business entity (Mangia Bene LLC), without advising his client \u201cof the desirability of seeking independent legal advice concerning the financial transaction[.]\u201d (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Rule 1.15 and Md.

Frequently these factors overlap. They do not lend themselves to a compartmental analysis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Taliaferro v. State, </em>295 Md. 376, 390-91, 456 A.2d 29, 37 (1983)). The hearing judge should also consider whether the violations were persistent and deliberate. <em>Admiral Mortgage, </em>357 Md. at 545, 745 A.2d at 1032. Lastly, in reviewing the sanction imposed under the above factors, we only consider those grounds actually relied upon by the hearing judge. <em>N. River Ins. Co., </em>343 Md. at 47-48, 680 A.2d at 487 (noting that, in reviewing the hearing judge\u2019s discovery sanction for an abuse of discretion, we do not engage in \u201ca search of the record for grounds, not relied upon by the trial court, which the appellate court believes could support the trial court\u2019s action.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>In the case at bar, the hearing judge\u2019s sanctions were proportionate to Respondent\u2019s violations when considered in light of the <em>Taliaferro </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Timeliness of the ultimate disclosure</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Respondent did not provide any discovery responses until September 8, 2015, almost two months after the requests were served on Respondent\u2019s counsel on July 10, 2015. Additionally, as noted by the hearing judge in her Memorandum Opinion, Respondent had not fully responded to Petitioner\u2019s discovery requests as of October 22, 2015. Instead, Respondent was in the process of having reconciliations performed for his IOLTA and Trust bank accounts that would allow him to respond to Petitioner\u2019s request for documents. Therefore, after more than three months since the discovery requests were served, Respondent had not responded to all discovery requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Reasons for the violation</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The hearing judge \u201cfound Respondent\u2019s explanation for his discovery violations incredible at trial[.]\u201d The hearing judge also noted that \u201cthe scant proof\u2019 offered to support Respondent\u2019s claim confirms the \u201cincredible\u201d nature of his explanations.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The proof the hearing judge referred to consisted of a printout of an email chain between Respondent and Mr. Balint. This email chain consisted of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">\n<em>Email from, Respondent to Mr. Balint on September 3, 2015</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-11\">CJ, for what it\u2019s worth you didn\u2019t send the discovery until the 15th. There is no date on it so I thought you just received it and I had 30 days until you told me differently yesterday. I have most of the interrogatories done for review except the docs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-12\"><em>Email from Mr. Balint to Respondent on September 4, 2015 </em>No I did not tell you differently yesterday. I told you well before you left. <em>You knew that the answers were due on </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number><em>August 28, 2015 </em>and that I would be gone August 27 <em>&amp; </em>August 28.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">Your court schedule and your flooding problem the weekend of August 21 occupied your time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">If these aren\u2019t in today, I don\u2019t know what the Court may do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">Your deposition is September 8, 2015 at 2:00 p.m. at the Attorney Grievance Commission\u2019s office in Annapolis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APm\">[]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">(emphasis added). Notably, the email authored by Mr. Balint stating that \u201c[y]ou knew that the answers were due on August 28, 2015\u201d, contradicted Respondent\u2019s claim that he honestly believed he had until September 14, 2015 to complete his discovery responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">The \u201cincredible\u201d nature of Respondent\u2019s explanation was further confirmed by the fact that Respondent provided conflicting explanations for his discovery violations. In his Response to Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Sanctions, filed on September 8, 2015, Respondent noted that he \u201c[had been] out of the state and [had] electronically forwarded discovery material to [Mr. Balint,]\u201d but Mr, Balint was unable to open the email attachments and therefore unable to complete discovery. However, during the disciplinary hearing and in his post-hearing Motion for Reconsideration, Respondent blamed his discovery violations on Mr. Balint\u2019s failure to keep him apprised of the deadlines. The hearing judge acknowledged these conflicting narratives at the disciplinary hearing, remarking \u201cI don\u2019t know how these two tales really jive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b605-15\">The hearing judge remarked, in her Memorandum Opinion, that \u201c[t]his court and the Petitioner have both been severely prejudiced by Respondent\u2019s discovery failures[.]\u201d That finding was supported by Respondent\u2019s provision of incomplete discovery responses on the morning of his September 8, 2015, deposition, essentially depriving Petitioner of any meaningful opportunity to review the responses in advance. Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>also failed to provide complete discovery responses by the date of the hearing in the circuit court. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s discovery in advance of Respondent\u2019s deposition was entirely non-existent, while discovery prior to the disciplinary hearing was severely limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The possibility that prejudice could be remedied by a continuance</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">At the hearing in this matter, the hearing judge reminded Respondent that attorney disciplinary proceedings are \u201con a very tight timeline pursuant to the rules.\u201d Those rules provide that, \u201cthe hearing shall be completed within 120 days after service on the [Respondent of the order designating a judge[,]\u201d Md. Rule 16-757(a), and \u201cthe written or transcribed [findings of fact and conclusions of law] shall be filed with the clerk responsible for the record no later than 45 days after the conclusion of the hearing.\u201d Md. Rule 16 \u2014 757(c). The authority to extend these deadlines is held by this Court only. Md. Rule 16-757(a) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">At the time that the hearings judge imposed the discovery sanctions on September 4, 2015, the deadline for the completion of the hearing was September 22, 2015. That deadline had been established by an Order of this Court, which had already extended the time in which the hearing was to be held under Md. Rule 16-757(a). Additionally, at the time that Respondent filed his post-hearing Motion for Reconsideration on October 14, 2015, the hearing judge\u2019s findings and conclusions were due to be filed by November 4, 2015. According to Respondent\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration, he would need an additional 20 days from October 14 to complete his discovery responses because he was still waiting on a bookkeeping professional to perform a reconciliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Therefore, as illustrated above, the deadlines for the holding of a hearing and the filing of the findings/conclusions were fast approaching, and Respondent was unable to remedy his violations by either of these deadlines. The hearing judge was unable to ameliorate the prejudice that resulted from Respondent\u2019s discovery failures by continuing these deadlines, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>are set by the Maryland Rules and subject to extension by this Court only.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Persistence of Respondent\u2019s violations</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">In addition to the <em>Taliaferro </em>factors, we hold that the hearing judge properly exercised her discretion in imposing discovery sanctions where Respondent\u2019s violations persisted throughout the proceedings below. Had Respondent made a good faith effort to comply with discovery after receiving the requests in mid-August, Respondent would not have been waiting on a bookkeeping specialist to generate documents in late October. The fact that Respondent\u2019s violations persisted through such an extended period \u201cillustrates Respondent\u2019s dilatory approach to these proceedings[.]\u201d Therefore, while Respondent labels the hearing judge\u2019s sanction \u201cdraconian,\u201d the persistent nature of Respondent\u2019s violations, the prejudice experienced by Petitioner, and the constraints of the various deadlines on the hearing judge made such a sanction appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">c. Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Aside from the exception to the hearing judge\u2019s discovery sanctions discussed above, neither party noted exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law. Accordingly, we accept the findings of fact as established. <em>Edib, </em>415 Md. at 706-07, 4 A.3d at 964; <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Silk, </em>279 Md. 345, 347, 369 A.2d 70, 71 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hodes, </em>441 Md. 136, 105 A.3d 533 (2014), we adhered to this principle, and imposed disbarment for violations remarkably similar to those in the case at bar. In that case, Hodes had been a member of the Maryland Bar for approximately 40 years, and had significant experience in the practice of estates and trusts. <em>Id. </em>at 145, 105 A.3d at 538. Hodes came to represent an elderly client with declining health, and drafted a last will and testament containing \u201ccertain trust provisions for which [Hodes] was named as Trustee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 105 A.3d at 539. Hodes also prepared a durable power of attorney, naming Hodes and another attorney in his office as \u201cattomeys-in-fact, jointly or individually, with regard to [the client\u2019s] personal care and various financial and property transactions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Shortly after Hodes\u2019 client died from health complications, Hodes drew two checks on his client\u2019s checking account: one payable to a financial planning business owned by Hodes, and one payable to his wife. <em>Id. </em>at 151, 105 A.3d at 542. Hodes then backdated the checks to appear that they were issued prior to his client\u2019s death, and also drafted a fictitious invoice justifying these payments. <em>Id. </em>In addition, as a result of the last will and testament, the client\u2019s residuary estate was placed in a testamentary trust, and Hodes served as trustee. <em>Id. </em>at 153, 105 A.3d at 543. Under the terms of the will, Hodes was required to incorporate a charitable foundation and distribute the trust to the charitable foundation. <em>Id. </em>However, Hodes instead drew a check for $270,000 on the trust\u2019s checking account payable to a non-charitable business entity owned by him and his wife. <em>Id. </em>at 154, 105 A.3d at 544. The word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>\u201cloan\u201d was written on the memo line of this check. <em>Id. </em>The funds were thereafter transferred to a personal checking account in the name of Hodes and his wife, and used to pay-various personal debts owed by Hodes. <em>Id. </em>at 154-55, 105 A.3d at 544-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Based on the above findings, the hearing judge concluded that Hodes had violated MLRPC 1.7 (Conflict of Interest), 1.15(d) (Safekeeping of Property), 8.1(a) (Disciplinary Proceedings), 8.4(a)-(d) (Misconduct) and Bus Occ. and Prof. \u00a7 10-306. <em>Id. </em>at 167-68, 105 A.3d at 552. We agreed that Hodes violated MLRPC 1.7 (Conflict of Interest) when he \u201cremoved $270,000.00 ... from the Trust Account to benefit himself and his wife, to the detriment of the Trust beneficiaries to whom he owed a duty of loyalty[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197-98, 105 A.3d at 569. We held that Hodes had also violated MLRPC 1.15(d) (Safekeeping of Property) by neglecting to distribute the trust funds to a charitable foundation, as was required under terms of his clients will. <em>Id. </em>at 198, 105 A.3d at 570. Regarding Bus Occ. and Prof. \u00a7 10-306 (Trust Money Restrictions), we observed that Hodes \u201cwillfully and intentionally removed $270,000.00 from the [ ]Trust account to pay his personal debts and, therefore, violated Section 10-306.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200, 105 A.3d at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In discussing MLRPC 8.1(a) (false statement in disciplinary matters), we agreed with the hearing judge that Hodes had knowingly made a false statement of fact under oath when \u201che claimed that he had executed a personal Guaranty for repayment of the $270,000.00 that he removed from the Trust Account, when in fact, he executed the Guaranty after Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation begun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Regarding MLRPC 8.4(b), we noted that Hodes had committed \u201ca criminal act that reflected] adversely on [his] honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202, 105 A.3d at 572. In particular, we observed that Hodes had taken $270,000 of the trust\u2019s funds and used them to pay his personal debts, thereby violating Crim. Law \u00a7 7-113(a). <em>Id. </em>at 203, 105 A.3d at 572. Based on the same conduct, we also held that Hodes had violated MLRPC 8.4(c) (conduct involving fraud or deceit): <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>\u201c[a]n attorney\u2019s conduct constitutes a violation of Rule 8.4(c) when an attorney improperly removes funds and utilizes the money for his own personal gain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203, 105 A.3d at 573 (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Whitehead, </em>405 Md. 240, 257, 950 A.2d 798, 808 (2008)). Lastly, regarding MLRPC 8.4(d) (conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), we noted that Hodes\u2019 removal of trust funds to pay his personal debts \u201cundermin[ed] public confidence that an attorney will maintain entrusted funds as a fiduciary and as required by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204-05, 105 A.3d at 573 (quoting <em>Whitehead, </em>405 Md. at 260, 950 A.2d at 810).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">We held that, in addition to the above violations, several aggravating factors referenced in Standard 9.22 of the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions were implicated: \u201c[Hodes] has embodied a dishonest and selfish motive, engaged in a pattern of misconduct, committed multiple offenses, testified falsely during the grievance investigation and has refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206, 105 A.3d at 575, We concluded that disbarment was the appropriate sanction where \u201cHodes\u2019 conduct was intentionally dishonest, fraudulent and demonstrative of a lack of the fundamental qualities of a lawyer: honesty, integrity and respect for the legal system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211, 105 A.3d at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Turning to the case at bar, both Respondent and Hodes abused their respective fiduciary positions of trust in a remarkably similar manner. Therefore, consistent with our decision in <em>Hodes, </em>disbarment is the appropriate sanction. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Whitehead, </em>390 Md. 663, 674, 890 A.2d 751, 757 (2006) (\u201cEven though attorney discipline is for the primary purpose of protecting the public, the bar and public policy are served best by determinations consistent with other Maryland sanctions for similar misconduct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">First, like <em>Hodes, </em>Respondent engaged in the knowing misappropriation of his client\u2019s property. Respondent repeatedly withdrew unearned McClelland Trust funds from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>attorney escrow account for his own personal benefit, and also drew a $3,000 check on the McClelland Trust\u2019s checking account payable to Herkimer Street LLC, which was owned by Respondent and his wife. This criminal behavior reflected adversely on Respondent\u2019s fitness as a lawyer, MLRPC 8.4(b), was dishonest and fraudulent, MLRPC 8.4(c), and was \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d MLRPC 8.4(d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Prichard, </em>386 Md. 238, 247, 872 A.2d 81, 86 (2005) (holding that an attorney had violated Crim. Law \u00a7 7-113(a) by misappropriating client funds held in a fiduciary capacity, thereby establishing the criminal violation required under MLRPC 8.4(b)); <em>Hodes, </em>441 Md. at 203, 105 A.3d at 573 (\u201c[a]n attorney\u2019s conduct constitutes a violation of Rule 8.4(c) when an attorney improperly removes funds and utilizes the money for his own personal gain.\u201d); <em>Id. </em>at 204-05, 105 A.3d at 574 (noting that Hodes\u2019 removal of trust funds to pay his personal debts violated MLRPC 8.4(d) because it \u201cundermin[ed] public confidence that an attorney will maintain entrusted funds as a fiduciary and as required by law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Also similar to <em>Hodes, </em>the hearing judge found several violations of MLRPC 1.7 (conflict of interest) where Respondent loaned McClelland Trust funds to his brother-in-law, his brother-in-law\u2019s business, and another client\u2019s business. Although these loans did not involve the same type of self-dealing as the loan in <em>Hodes, </em>Respondent\u2019s duty of loyalty to the McClelland Trust was obviously compromised when he negotiated financial transactions between the trust, his family and other clients. <em>See Sachse, </em>345 Md. at 588, 693 A.2d at 811 (\u201cPerhaps the most fundamental duty of a trustee is that he must display throughout the administration of the trust complete loyalty to the interests of the beneficiarles] and must exclude all selfish interest and all consideration of the interests of third persons.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The above violations alone would justify disbarment, but again, like <em>Hodes, </em>Respondent made a knowingly false statement of fact to bar counsel in explaining the check made payable to Herkimer Street LLC. Respondent also acted with a dishonest or selfish motive, committed multiple offenses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>submitted a false statement during the disciplinary process, had substantial experience in the practice of law, and engaged in illegal conduct. <em>See Standard 9.22(b), (d), (f), (i) and (k) of the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions </em>(1992) (enumerating the aggravating factors in attorney disciplinary proceedings). In light of the similarities between the present case and the violations in <em>Hodes, </em>along with the significant aggravating factors implicated by Respondent\u2019s conduct, we order disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MD. RULE 16-761(b), FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST BRUCE AUGUST KENT.</p>\n<judges id=\"b613-5\">ADKINS, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-9\">.

While Respondent contends that the hearing judge ignored his explanation for the discovery violations in the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the hearing judge was not required to address Respondent's explanations at that time. The hearing judge had already addressed Respondent's explanations during the hearing on the morning of September 21, 2015, when Respondent ultimately dismissed Mr. Balint. The hearing judge also addressed Respondent\u2019s explanations in the Memorandum Opinion denying Respondent\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration of the discovery sanctions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b613-6\">ADKINS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIq\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Respectfully, I dissent from the Majority. Athough I expect that ultimately Mr. Kent should be disbarred for the conduct outlined in the Majority opinion, I am troubled by the orders of the hearing judge concerning discovery sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">First, I think the hearing judge erred in granting the Motion to Shorten Time to Respond to Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Sanctions to less than two full days when, at that time, Respondent was only three days late in providing responses to discovery. Neither Respondent nor his counsel should be expected to be prepared to file an answer on two days\u2019 notice. Second, the court was unduly harsh in the nature and extent of the sanctions imposed \u2014 prohibiting Respondent from presenting virtually all possible defenses, including mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">I do not condone in any way Respondent\u2019s underlying misconduct. My concern is for the precedent that we set in approving of such harsh sanctions for what began as a very minimal discovery violation. Athough it is cumbersome to remand at this point, particularly when the misconduct here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>appears so severe, I believe we must do so for the sake of maintaining fairness in this and future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">I would remand to the hearing judge and direct that Respondent be given the opportunity to put on a defense to the charges of misconduct.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
