Through the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (\u201cNPDES\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342, either the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) or an EPA-approved state, such as Maryland, may issue permits exempting a discharger from this prohibition. <em>See Piney Run Pres. Ass\u2019n v. Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Carroll Cnty., Md., </em>268 F.3d 255, 265 (4th Cir.2001). MDE is the authority in Maryland that administers the NPDES program. Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 26.08.04.07. An NPDES permit, however, does not give a discharger carte blanche. \u201cGenerally speaking, the NPDES requires dischargers to obtain permits that place limits on the type and quantity of pollutants that can be released into the Nation\u2019s waters.\u201d <em>S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist. v. Miccosukee Tribe, </em>541 U.S. 95, 102, 124 S.Ct. 1537, 158 L.Ed.2d 264 (2004). These limits are called effluent limitations. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(11) (defining an effluent limitation as \u201cany restriction established by a State or the Administrator on quantities, rates, and concentrations of chemical, physical, biological, and other constituents which are discharged from point sources into navigable waters, the waters of the contiguous zone, or the ocean, including schedules of compliance\u201d). The type of discharge determines the type of limitations the permit must impose on the discharger.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The Permits before us control stormwater pollutant dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>charge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Stormwater consists of the rain and snowmelt that filters through the soil and courses over surfaces \u2014 collecting pollutants along the way \u2014 before passing through the municipal storm sewer systems<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and into waterbodies. During the development of the Permits, the Water Groups explained the problems that stormwater poses, whether to the surface conditions of Maryland\u2019s waters, for humans who recreate and subsist on them, and for wildlife who live in them. <em>See </em>Letter with Comments on Draft MS4 Permit for Baltimore City from Blue Water Baltimore, Inc. and Earthjustice, to Brian Clevenger, MDE (Sept. 21, 2012). In recognition of extensive public commentary on the severity of the problems associated with stormwater, MDE stated: \u201c[i]t becomes fairly easy for all organizations, individuals, and government agencies to agree that urban stormwater is a problem that must be addressed.\u201d MDE, Response to Formal Comments for Montgomery County NPDES Permit (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Nevertheless, municipal stormwater discharge is \u201chighly intermittent,\u201d \u201cusually characterized by very high flows occurring over relatively short time intervals,\u201d and \u201cdepend[s] on the activities occurring on the lands.\u201d <em>See </em>National Pollutant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Discharge Elimination System Permit Application Regulations for Storm Water Discharges, 55 Fed.Reg. 47,990, 48,038 (Nov. 16, 1990) (codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.26). It is also difficult to discern the amount of pollutant that any one discharger contributes to a waterbody because municipalities have so many outfalls, or discharge points, leading into the waters. <em>See </em>MDE, Montgomery County NPDES Permit Fact Sheet (900 outfalls); MDE, Anne Arundel County NPDES Permit Fact Sheet (nearly 1,000 outfalls); MDE, Baltimore County NPDES Permit Fact Sheet (nearly 700 outfalls.); MDE, Prince George\u2019s County NPDES Permit Fact Sheet (more than 4,000 outfalls); MDE, Baltimore City NPDES Permit Fact Sheet (around 350 outfalls.); <em>see also </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.26(b)(5), (9) (outlining minimum diameters of pipes in major MS4 outfalls).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Because of the nature of municipal stormwater discharges, Congress adopted a flexible approach to the control of pollutants in MS4s. <em>See </em>55 Fed.Reg. at 48,038 (The Congressional Record from 1986 stated not only that \u201can end-of-the-pipe treatment technology is not appropriate for [the MS4] discharge\u201d but also that \u201c[MS4] controls may be different in different permits.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pursuant to 33 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u00a7 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii), municipal stormwater permits \u201cshall require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable, including management practices, control techniques and system, design and engineering methods ....\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Best management practices (\u201cBMPs\u201d) have been a longstanding control or effluent limitation<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in MS4 permits. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(k)(2) (BMPs \u201ccontrol or abate the discharge of pollutants when [a]uthorized under [33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(p) ]\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 122.44(k)(3) (BMPs are an appropriate control when \u201c[n]umeric effluent limitations are infeasible\u201d); <em>see also Tualatin Riverkeepers v.

Farm Bureau Fed\u2019n, </em>792 F.3d at 289 (\u201cTMDLs happen after a state enacts pursuant to its law (but required by the Clean Water Act) \u2018water quality standards.\u2019 \u201d). Because the EPA and the states interact throughout this process, it has been described as one of \u201ccooperative federalism.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288; <em>see Anacostia Riverkeeper, Inc. v. Jackson, </em>798 F.Supp.2d 210, 214-17 (D.D.C.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Water quality standards, as the term itself suggests, protect water quality. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.2(d); COMAR 26.08.02.01(A). Each state must set water quality standards by assigning a \u201cuse\u201d to a water, such as recreation or fishing, then developing criteria to protect those uses, as well as ensuring that higher quality waters do not degrade to the minimally accepted standard (also known as an anti-degradation policy). 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313; COMAR 26.08.02.01(B)(1). All water quality standards are subject to EPA review, and if the EPA does not approve of them, the EPA will set those standards itself. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">By way of example, the EPA approved a TMDL that MDE submitted for fecal bacteria for the Non-tidal Cabin John Creek Basin in Montgomery County in 2007. <em>See </em>MDE, Total Maximum Daily Loads of Fecal Bacteria for the Non-tidal Cabin John Creek Basin in Montgomery County, Maryland (Document version: Oct. 13, 2006) [hereinafter \u201cJohn Creek Basin TMDL\u201d]. These bacteria are microscopic organisms in animal waste. Fecal bacteria in water can raise the risk of illness in humans who recreate there. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1.0, at 1. To develop the WQS, MDE selected \u201cwater contact recreation and protection of aquatic life and public water supply\u201d as the use of the water and 126 MPN<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> per 100 milliliters as the criteria. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2.3, at 11 (citing COMAR 26.08.02.08(0) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>26.08.02.03-3). This figure (126) represents a mean density for this pollutant. <em>Id.; see </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.2(i) (\u201c[M]ass per time, toxicity, or [an]other appropriate measure\u201d may be used to express TMDLs.).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">After setting WQSs, the states establish effluent limitations in permits as the primary way to meet the WQSs because, as we have explained, effluent limitations restrict the discharge of pollutants. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(11). Nevertheless, we note, importantly, that <em>MSbs are not subject to </em>the requirement of imposing effluent limitations \u201cnecessary to meet water quality standards.\u201d <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(b)(1)(C); <em>see also Defenders of Wildlife v. Browner, </em>191 F.3d 1159, 1165 (9th Cir.1999); <em>cf. </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(p)(3)(A) (Industrial dischargers must comply with 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311.).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This important point notwithstanding, Congress requires that \u201c[e]ach State shall identify those waters within its boundaries for which the effluent limitations required by [33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311] are not stringent enough to implement any water quality standard applicable to such waters.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">This is where the TMDL comes into play. The TMDL tells a state what is the threshold amount of a pollutant that a body of water can tolerate before violating the WQS. <em>See In re City of Moscow, Idaho, </em>10 E.A.D. 135, 2001 WL 988721, at *4 (EAB July 27, 2001) (\u201cA TMDL is a measure of the total amount of a pollutant from point sources, nonpoint sources and natural background, that a water quality limited segment can tolerate without violating the applicable water quality standards.\u201d); EPA, Chesapeake Bay TMDL \u00a7 1.1, at 1-2 (\u201cA TMDL specifies the maximum amount of a pollutant that a waterbody can receive and still meet applicable WQS.\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>States must establish TMDLs \u201cat a level necessary to implement the applicable water quality standards,\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(d)(1)(C), when they identify those waters for which effluent limitations cannot implement the WQSs, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(d)(1)(A).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As with water quality standards, the states have the obligation of setting TMDLs and submitting them to the EPA for approval. <em>See supra </em>MDE, John Creek Basin TMDL (The EPA approved of MDE\u2019s TMDL in March 2007.). If the EPA disapproves of the TMDLs, the EPA will set them itself. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">For this case, wasteload allocations (\u201cWLAs\u201d) are the most critical part of the TMDL equation. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.2(i) (A TMDL is \u201c[t]he sum of the individual WLAs for point sources and LAs [load allocations] for nonpoint sources and natural background.\u201d). The WLA represents a water\u2019s \u201cloading capacity\u201d assigned to its \u201cpoint sources of pollution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 130.2(h). Continuing with our example, MDE set the TMDL for fecal bacteria at 176.36 billion MPN/day, the LA at 68.17 billion MPN/day, and the WLA at 108.19 billion MPN/ day. MDE, John Creek Basin TMDL.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Although TMDLs are informational tools, of which WLAs are a part, WLAs are more akin to restrictions. <em>See Am. Farm Bureau Fed\u2019n v. EPA </em>984 F.Supp.2d 289, 328 (M.D.Pa. 2013) (\u201cWLAs are not permit limits <em>per se; </em>rather they still require translation into permit limits ....\u201d) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original), <em>aff'd, </em>792 F.3d 281 (3d Cir.2015). Under 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(d)(1)(vii)(B), permitting authorities must ensure that effluent limitations \u201care consistent with the assumptions and requirements\u201d of any approved WLA.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">We conclude our introduction of TMDLs by noting that MS4s are subject to the MEP standard under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342. MS4s are not, however, required to impose effluent limitations necessary to meet water quality standards. The CWA still requires Maryland to set water quality standards and TMDLs \u2014 subject to the EPA\u2019s approval. Flowing from this obligation is the requirement that MS4s are subject to effluent limitations that are consistent with WLAs of EPA-approved TMDLs.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The Chesapeake Bay TMDL</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">As we will discuss in more detail, the Permits require the Counties to take actions to make progress in meeting the WLAs of many EPA-approved TMDLs.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> By far, though, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>most critical TMDL in this case is the Chesapeake Bay TMDL (\"Bay TMDL\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Regarded as a national treasure,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States, a product of flooding from the Susquehanna River over thousands of years.

Assemb. Reg. Sess. (Md.1982). As a result, each county and municipality in Maryland was required for the first time to \u201cadopt ordinances necessary to implement a stormwater management program\u201d by July 1, 1984. <em>See </em>EN \u00a7 4-202. Then authorized by the General Assembly, the Department of Natural Resources issued regulations setting forth minimum control requirements and design criteria for the counties and municipalities. <em>See </em>10 Md. Reg. 881, 884-85 (May 13, 1983) (to be codified at COMAR 08.05.05).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The regulations fostered the \u201cprimary goal\u201d of \u201cmaintaining] after development, as nearly as possible, the predevelopment runoff characteristics\u201d of the land. <em>See </em>EN \u00a7 4 \u2014 203(b)(1); <em>see also </em>EN \u00a7 4-204(a) (Development of land is prohibited without submitting a stormwater management plan and obtaining the municipality\u2019s or county\u2019s approval of the plan.)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Maryland entered a new phase of stormwater management in the early 2000s. Pursuant to EN \u00a7 4-203(b), MDE adopted regulations to \u201crectify the[] programmatic shortcomings\u201d of then-existing regulations that had provided \u201csparse guidance\u201d on \u201cwater quality enhancement.\u201d 27 Md. Reg. 1167, 1168 (June 16, 2000) (to be codified at COMAR 26.07.02). Amending the stormwater regulations, MDE intended to \u201cprovide water quality treatment of up to 90 percent of the average annual rainfall throughout the State, establish ground water recharge standards, and outline a channel erosion control strategy,\u201d as well as \u201cpromote environmentally friendly site design.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To fulfill this purpose, MDE incorporated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>reference the 2000 Maryland Stormwater Design Manual (\u201cthe Manual\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 1167, 1169.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> MDE required the counties and municipalities to revise their ordinances to incorporate the Manual\u2019s policies and practices by July 1, 2001. <em>Id. </em>at 1170.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The Manual \u201cprovide[d] designers a general overview on how to size, design, select and locate BMPs at a new development site to comply with State stormwater performance standards.\u201d Center for Watershed Protection (\u201cCWP\u201d) <em>&amp; </em>MDE, Manual, \u00a7 1.3, at 1.16.

H.B. 786, Gen. Assemb. Reg. Sess. (Md.2007). ESD is best understood as those practices, such as \u201csmall-scale stormwater management practices, nonstructural techniques, and better site planning,\u201d that \u201cmimic natural hydrologic runoff characteristics and minimize the impact of land development on water resources.\u201d EN \u00a7 4-201.1(b); <em>see, e.g., </em>note 9 (green roofs). MDE implemented regulations to this effect and explained that \u201c[t]he goal of the regulations is to maintain after development as nearly as possible, the predevelopment runoff characteristics of the site being developed using ESD to the MEP.\u201d 35 Md.

Now the State is moving into the implementation phase....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Before discussing these Permit provisions, we note additional Permit requirements that illustrate the breadth of the Counties\u2019 obligations. The Counties must implement management programs \u201cto control stormwater discharges to the maximum extent practicable.\u201d These programs include a stormwater management program (\u201cSWMP\u201d) and an erosion and sediment control program in accordance with state law; an \u201cillicit discharge detection and elimination\u201d program; requirements to reduce trash; obligations on the Counties to reduce pollutants associated with maintenance activities and on municipal facilities to submit pollution prevention plans; as well as a requirement to engage in public outreach activities to reduce stormwater pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The Permits also require the Counties to engage in thorough analyses of the water quality of their watersheds. Among other things, the watershed assessments oblige the Counties to identify and prioritize water quality improvement projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">MDE has also ensured that the Counties cannot use lack of adequate funding as a defense for failure to comply with Permit terms. The Permits explain that \u201c[l]ack of funding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>does not constitute a justification for noncompliance with the terms of this permit.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> To this end, the General Assembly enacted EN \u00a7 4-202.1 in 2012, requiring the Counties \u201cto adopt local laws or ordinances necessary to establish an annual stormwater remediation fee and a local watershed protection and restoration fund to provide financial assistance for the implementation of local stormwater management plans.\u201d H.B. 987, 2012 Gen. Assemb. Reg. Sess. (Md.2012); <em>see also </em>EN \u00a7 4-202.1(a)(1) (This \u201csection applies to a county or municipality that is subject to a [NPDES Phase I MS4 permit].\u201d).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> MDE had investigated the costs of meeting the Bay TMDL and commissioned a study that revealed that \u201cstormwater BMPs likely represent the largest costs to local governments in implementing the TMDL.\u201d H.B. 987, 2012 Gen. Assemb. Reg. Sess. (Md. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The Permits also contain annual reporting requirements for: (1) the components of the stormwater management programs, and (2) data pertinent to the assessment of progress in implementing the Permit requirements, such as impervious surfaces and pollutant load reductions. MDE will review the Counties\u2019 reports to assess \u201cprogress toward meeting WLAs developed under EPA approved TMDLs\u201d and the effectiveness of the programs in \u201creducing the discharge of pollutants to the MEP to protect water quality.\u201d MDE will require BMP and program modifications if the Counties fail to comply with the Permit or show progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The Permits also contain provisions setting forth sanctions for the violation of Permit conditions, including civil and criminal penalties. <em>See, e.g., </em>Montgomery County NPDES Permit Part VI.C (\u201cFailure to comply with a permit provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>constitutes a violation of the CWA and is grounds for enforcement action; permit termination, revocation, or modification; or denial of a permit renewal application.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Circuit Court and Court of Special Appeals Opinions</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">EN \u00a7 1-601 provides for judicial review of MDE\u2019s final determination to issue a permit.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The Water Groups<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> challenged the Permits in the various counties where MDE issued them.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The Circuit Court for Montgomery County remanded for MDE to revise the Permit in accordance with its opinion and order. In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>Md. Dep\u2019t of the Env\u2019t v. Anacostia Riverkeeper, </em>222 Md.App. 153, 157, 112 A.3d 979, 981 (2015), <em>cert. granted, </em>443 Md. 734, 118 A.3d 861 (2015). MDE filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The Circuit Court for Baltimore County, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, and the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County affirmed MDE\u2019s decision to issue those Permits. The Water Groups filed notices of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and, upon MDE\u2019s motion, the Court of Special Appeals consolidated these three cases. MDE then filed a petition for writ of certiorari to this Court with questions nearly identical to those MDE submitted in its petition for writ of certiorari with respect to the Montgomery County Permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Finally, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City also affirmed MDE\u2019s decision to issue the Baltimore City Permit. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Water Groups filed a notice of appeal, and the Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore (\u201cBaltimore City\u201d) filed a petition for writ of certiorari with a request that we consider this petition in conjunction with MDE\u2019s petitions. We granted the City\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">As the Water Groups state in their brief, \u201cthe underlying Permits are substantively identical\u201d and \u201care affected by the same legal defects.\u201d We agree that the Permits are so substantively similar that we will analyze the agreed upon questions brought before the Court with respect to all the challenged Permits. We have slightly rephrased the questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">1. Did the MS4 permits issued by MDE for the counties\u2019 municipal storm sewer system appropriately incorporate by reference publicly available materials and was the requirement for restoration of 20% of pre-2002 developed impervious surfaces specific, measurable, and enforceable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">2. Was MDE\u2019s final decision to issue the permits with a 20% restoration requirement based upon the State\u2019s Chesapeake Bay TMDL strategies, and a reporting requirement to establish strategies to address wasteload allocations, supported by substantial evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">3. Do the provisions of the MS4 permits that require that the public have an opportunity to review and comment on restoration plans intended to meet the wasteload allocations established for the permittees under applicable total maximum daily loads satisfy public participation requirements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">4. Do the provisions of the MS4 permits satisfy federal monitoring requirements?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">We uphold MDE\u2019s decision to issue the Permits on all grounds. Thus, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, which did not uphold the Montgomery County Permit, and we affirm the judgments of the circuit courts, which upheld the Permits in Anne Arundel County, Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Before 2009, challenges to the issuance or denial of a discharge permit were subject to a contested case hearing. Md.Code (1984, 2014 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222 of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d), which is part of Maryland\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act, delineates the grounds upon which a court can reverse an agency decision in a contested case. Specifically, SG \u00a7 10-222 provides that a court can reverse an agency decision in a contested case that \u201cis unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted\u201d or that \u201cis arbitrary or capricious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In 2009, the General Assembly changed the procedures for challenging a discharge permit. EN \u00a7 1-601 now permits direct judicial review of agency permitting decisions without a contested case hearing. Although this statute does not set forth a standard of review, the substantial evidence and arbitrary and capricious standards apply where an \u201corganic statute\u201d authorizes judicial review without a contested case hearing and does not set forth a standard of review. <em>See Supervisor of Assessments of Carroll Cnty. v. Peter &amp; John Radio Fellowship, Inc., </em>274 Md. 353, 355, 335 A.2d 93, 94 (1975) (\u201cOur cases have held that where no scope of review is thus provided, decisions of an administrative body will not be disturbed on appeal unless they are not supported by substantial evidence or are arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Med. Waste Assocs., Inc. v. Md. Waste Coal., Inc., </em>327 Md. 596, 621, 612 A.2d 241, 253 (1992) (\u201cIn an action for judicial review of an administrative decision granting a permit, however, the court determines not only whether the agency\u2019s decision to issue the permit was in accordance with law, but also whether the particular administrative decision was arbitrary, capricious or unsupported by substantial evidence in light of the record as a whole.\u201d). Thus, even though all challenges going to the merits of the Permits in these consolidated cases originated in the Circuit Courts,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>will review MDE\u2019s decision to issue the Permits under the substantial evidence and arbitrary and capricious standards of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Applying the substantial evidence standard of review to a case where no contested case hearing took place may seem anomalous because there is no formal record that was presented before an administrative law judge. EN \u00a7 1-606, however, expressly details the documents that can be included in a record. EN \u00a7 1-606(c)(1)-(9).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> For example, EN \u00a7 1-606 stipulates that any draft permit, comments submitted to MDE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>during the public comment period, transcripts of public hearings on the permit application, and responses to submitted comments constitute part of the administrative record. Thus, we are essentially reviewing the same record that we would have examined, excluding the administrative law judge\u2019s decision, had the merits of this case been subject to a contested case proceeding. Accordingly, our review of the issuance of the Permits fits within the substantial evidence standard of review contemplated by SG \u00a7 10-222.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">In a review for substantial evidence, we ask \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Najafi v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>418 Md. 164, 173, 12 A.3d 1255, 1261 (2011). We should accord deference \u201c \u2018to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences\u2019 \u201d when the record supports them. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted); <em>see Mayor &amp; Aldermen of City of Annapolis v.

This requirement \u201cuses percent impervious cover in a watershed as a surrogate TMDL target.\u201d ENSR, Pilot TMDL Applications Using the Impervious Cover Method \u00a7 1.0, at 1-1 (2005). Like so much of this case, we must unpack the science before we analyze the parties\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">As we develop on land, science has shown us that we profoundly impact our waters. Consider, for example, when \u201c[t]rees, meadow grasses, and agricultural crops that had intercepted and absorbed rainfall are removed.... \u201d CWP &amp; MDE, Manual, \u00a7 1.1, at 1.3. Problematically, \u201c[c]leared and graded sites erode, are often severely compacted, and can no longer prevent rainfall from being rapidly converted into stormwater runoff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These kinds of sites are known as impervious surfaces, surfaces \u201cthat do[ ] not allow stormwater to infiltrate into the ground,\u201d such as \u201crooftops, driveways, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>sidewalks, or pavement.\u201d EN \u00a7 4-201.1(d). \u201cImpervious surfaces accumulate pollutants deposited from the atmosphere,\u201d pollutants which are \u201crapidly delivered to downstream waters\u201d during storms. CWP &amp; MDE, Manual, \u00a7 1.1.1, at 1.5. The purpose of the 20% restoration requirement, then, is to use stormwater management practices to restore the natural, beneficial processes in our environment that we have changed by developing impervious surfaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">In other words, the 20% restoration requirement is a surrogate because the requirement does not control pollution reduction directly. <em>See </em>ENSR, Pilot TMDL Applications Using the Impervious Cover Method \u00a7 1.0, at 1-1. Rather, it is through restoring impervious surfaces with management practices that the Counties will reduce pollution. <em>See, e.g., </em>CWP <em>&amp; </em>MDE, Manual, \u00a7 1.2, at 1.13 (\u201c[Management practices] shall be designed to remove 80% of the average annual post development total suspended solids load (TSS) and 40% of the average annual post development total phosphorus load (TP).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">A. Maximum Extent Practicable</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The Water Groups argue that the 20% restoration requirement is too opaque to comply with 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii), the MEP standard. They so argue because, they contend, MDE \u201cfailed to provide a specific performance standard for restoration activities\u201d or a \u201cnumeric limitation ... for what pollution reductions must be accomplished by the permittees\u2019 twenty-percent restoration efforts.\u201d They also argue that MDE failed to explain what impervious surface is \u201cnot restored to the MEP.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">We disagree because (1) the applicable law does not impose a specific performance standard on MS4s and (2) MDE did actually select a performance standard for the Counties to adhere to. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">Permits for discharges from municipal storm sewers shall require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable, including management practices, control techniques and system, design and engineering methods, and such other provisions as the Administrator or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>the State determines appropriate for the control of such pollutants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">From the text, we discern that Congress established a broad requirement for MS4s. The list of required controls is not exclusive. <em>See 55 </em>Fed.Reg. at 48,038 (\u201c[MS4] controls may be different in different permits.\u201d). And the purpose of the controls \u2014 reducing the discharge of pollutants \u2014 exists alongside the flexible, undefined standard \u201cto the maximum extent practicable.\u201d <em>See City of Abilene v. EPA, </em>325 F.3d 657, 659-60 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. N.Y. State Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Conservation, </em>25 N.Y.3d 373, 406, 13 N.Y.S.3d 272, 34 N.E.3d 782 (N.Y.2015) (Rivera, J., dissenting in part) (\u201cThe CWA does not define the maximum extent practicable standard. However, it appears to provide broad authority to agencies to control stormwater pollution.\u201d); 55 Fed.Reg. at 48,038 (\u201cIn enacting section 405 of the WQA [Water Quality Act], Congress recognized that permit requirements for [MS4s] should be developed in a flexible manner to allow site-specific permit conditions to reflect the wide range of impacts that can be associated with these discharges.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii) imposes no minimum standard or requirement on MDE other than to establish controls for MS4s to reduce the discharge of pollutants. <em>See Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. EPA, </em>966 F.2d 1292, 1308 (9th Cir.1992) (\u201cCongress did not mandate [in \u00a7 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii) ] a minimum standards approach or specify that EPA develop minimal performance requirements.....Congress could have written a statute requiring stricter standards, and it did not.\u201d). Thus, we reject the Water Groups\u2019 argument that MDE committed legal error by \u201cfailing] to provide a specific performance standard for restoration activities.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Moreover, MDE tethered restoration to the practices in the Manual, which MDE incorporates into the Permits by reference. <em>See </em>Part III.E (\u201cThese management programs are designed to control stormwater discharges to the maximum extent practicable____\u201d); Part III.E.1 (\u201cAt a minimum, the County shall ... [i]mplement the stormwater management ... practices found in the [Manual]____\u201d). The Manual explains that the list of acceptable stormwater management practices is tied to the WQ,. \u201cThe Water Quality Volume (denoted as the WQy) is the storage needed to capture and treat the runoff from 90% of the average annual rainfall.\u201d CWP &amp; MDE, Manual, \u00a7 2.1, at 2.2.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The Manual further explains that the \u201cWQV is directly related to the amount of impervious cover created at a site.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, MDE chose a standard that relates to the very problem the 20% restoration requirement serves to abate: the increase in stormwater runoff and the discharge of pollutants because of the increase in impervious surfaces. <em>See </em>CWP &amp; MDE, Manual, \u00a7 1.1, at 1.4 (\u201cAs can be seen, the volume of stormwater runoff increases sharply with impervious cover\u201d). Thus, the record reflects that MDE has established a performance standard, WQV, that defines as acceptable those practices the Counties may choose from to fulfill the 20% restoration requirement. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2.7 (Acceptable Urban BMP Options).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Moreover, our discussion of restoration is instructive as to why, despite the Water Groups\u2019 contention, the \u201cimpervious surface area that is not restored <em>to the </em>MEP\u201d is sufficiently clear and measurable. (Emphasis added.) The area that is not restored to the MEP is the area without the restoration controls described in the Manual. Moreover, the Manual explains that impervious area refers to an area \u201cthat does not have vegetative or permeable cover.\u201d CWP <em>&amp; </em>MDE, Manual, \u00a7 2.1, at 2.4. Put together, the \u201cimpervious surface area that is not restored to the MEP\u201d refers to a defined type of area (impervious surface) lacking a type of stormwater management control (the BMPs in the Manual). By way of example, previous MS4 reports delineate these criteria so that MDE can evaluate whether Montgomery County (in this example) installed the required controls. <em>See </em>Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection, Annual Report for 2006 NPDES MS4 Permit F2, at III-64; <em>see also </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii) (MS4 permits \u201cshall require controls\u201d such as management practices.).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Because 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii) does not require a specific performance standard, and because the concepts of restoration and impervious surface \u201cnot restored to the MEP\u201d are sufficiently clear as to the controls that the Counties must install, the 20% restoration requirement in the Permits complies with the MEP standard. <em>See 33 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">B. Substantial Evidence and Arbitrary and Capricious</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The Water Groups also argue that MDE has not explained why it selected 20% as the restoration goal or how this Permit provision will promote necessary pollution reduction. The Water Groups contend that MDE ineffectively justifies its choice based on the Bay TMDL because the Permits do not assure that the Counties will achieve the Bay TMDL\u2019s objectives or reductions. Even accepting a connection between the 20% restoration requirement and the Bay TMDL, the Water Groups argue that MDE still failed to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>into account numerous other TMDLs related to the Counties\u2019 waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">We disagree with the Water Groups\u2019 position because (1) the applicable law affords permitting authorities flexibility in establishing controls for MS4s and (2) MDE has justified its decision based on a well-developed and vetted strategy. <em>Natural Res. Def. Council, </em>808 F.3d at 569 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). (\u201cWe must be \u2018satisfied from the record that the agency ... examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Congress established a flexible framework in 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii). As the text states, MS4s shall require controls \u201cand such other provisions as the Administrator or <em>the State determines appropriate </em>for the control of such pollutants.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii) (emphasis added). MDE has determined that the 20% restoration requirement is a key strategy in restoring the Chesapeake Bay. <em>See </em>Part VI.A (Chesapeake Bay Restoration by 2025.). The Permits in particular state that the Counties will carry out the 20% restoration requirement in order to comply with the Bay TMDL. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">A review of Maryland\u2019s Watershed Implementation Plan (\u201cWIP\u201d) is instructive as to why the 20% restoration requirement will help to restore the Chesapeake Bay. MDE, Basis for Final Determination. As we have discussed, WIPs are \u201croad-maps\u201d setting forth a plan for how and when a jurisdiction will reach the pollution reduction goals in the Bay TMDL. EPA, Bay TMDL ES at ES-8. The EPA developed the Bay TMDL <em>\u201cin reliance on\u201d </em>the WIPs that each affected jurisdiction submitted to the EPA. <em>Am. Farm Bureau Fed\u2019n, </em>792 F.3d at 291 (emphasis added). Moreover, the EPA approved the Bay TMDL <em>\u201conly after\u201d </em>determining that each jurisdiction provided \u201creasonable assurance\u201d that it would meet the pollutant reductions in its WIP. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>see </em>EPA, Bay TMDL ES at ES-8 (The WIPs are the \u201ccornerstone\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>ensures accountability to achieve pollution reductions).<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Importantly, the strategies in Maryland\u2019s WIP for urban stormwater include, among other things, the reduction of impervious surface area by 20% over a five-year period, just as the Permits do. <em>Compare </em>Maryland Phase I Watershed Implementation Plan: Executive Summary ES-15 (Dec. 3, 2010) [hereinafter Phase I WIP ES], <em>with </em>Part III.G.2. In fact, restoration of \u201ctwenty percent of the counties\u2019 impervious surface area that is not already restored to the maximum extent practicable (MEP)\u201d is listed in the \u201ckey elements\u201d that provide reasonable assurance of the implementation of Maryland\u2019s WIP. Maryland Phase I Watershed Implementation Plan: \u00a7 5.2.2, at 5-30 (Dec. 3, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">MDE incorporated another important element from the WIP to bolster compliance with the 20% restoration requirement. The EPA explained that the WIPs were to include \u201cmechanisms to track and report implementation activities\u201d and \u201cprovide alternative approaches.\u201d EPA, Chesapeake Bay TMDL ES at ES-8-ES-9. Maryland\u2019s WIP thus includes what we refer to as the adaptive management approach, whereby additional or alternative practices are implemented if existing programs are not meeting target reductions. Phase I WIP at 5-30.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> MDE incorporated this approach from the WIP into the Permits as part of the agency\u2019s review of the Counties\u2019 annual reports: \u201cBMP and program modifications shall be made\u201d if the Counties fail to comply with the Permits or fail to show progress in meeting WLAs of EPA-approved TMDLs.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> We are satisfied from the record that MDE \u201cex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>amine[d] the relevant data and artieulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action.\u201d <em>Natural Res. Def. Council, </em>808 F.3d at 569 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). We conclude, then, that MDE\u2019s decision to include the 20% restoration requirement in the Permits was supported by substantial evidence and is not arbitrary and capricious.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Although we recognize that MDE issued the Montgomery County Permit before Maryland\u2019s WIP and the Bay TMDL were prepared, the Bay TMDL was not an isolated event. <em>See Am. Farm Bureau, </em>984 F.Supp.2d at 298 (The Bay TMDL \u201cis not a new or recent idea,\u201d and thus, \u201cit would be improper to view the Final TMDL in a vacuum as a single, isolated effort to restore water quality to the Chesapeake Bay.\u201d). As we have discussed, an important prior effort to restore the Chesapeake Bay was the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement. To achieve the restoration goals of that agreement, the Governor of Maryland\u2019s Chesapeake Bay Cabinet prepared a draft of the State\u2019s plan. Department of Legislative Services, Office of Policy Analysis, Chesapeake Bay Restoration and the Tributary Strategy: An Analysis of Maryland\u2019s Efforts to Meet the Nutrient and Sediment Reduction Goals of the <em>Chesapeake 2000 </em>Agreement iii (2007). The strategy for stormwater included restoration of impervious surface in Montgomery County, the first County to successfully implement this program. <em>Id. </em>at 13. The State conceived of this strategy as an effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>state-wide method of improving the Chesapeake Bay. <em>See </em>Maryland\u2019s Chesapeake Bay Tributary Strategy Statewide Implementation Plan 16 (2008) (stormwater strategy). Thus, MDE\u2019s decision to include the 20% restoration requirement in the Montgomery County Permit was also supported by substantial evidence and was not arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">We further disagree with the Water Groups\u2019 position that the 20% restoration requirement is insufficient because it does not relate to other TMDLs. Indeed, the Permits incorporate a requirement to submit plans regarding WLAs for all EPA-approved TMDLs. That requirement ensures the Permits address all applicable TMDLs.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">C. The Methodology in the Guidance</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Finally, with respect to the 20% restoration requirement, the Water Groups object to MDE\u2019s method of calculating impervious surface area not restored to the MEP. They assert that the Guidance, which MDE incorporated into these Permits by reference, is flawed because MDE arbitrarily selected 2002 as the baseline for measuring impervious surface area. For example, the Water Groups allege that MDE has ignored the current definition for MEP in the agency\u2019s own regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">We disagree with the Water Groups because MDE reasonably justifies its decision based on the accurate determination that 2002 marked a significant milestone in the State\u2019s treatment of water quality. <em>See Najafi, </em>418 Md. at 173, 12 A.3d at 1261 (discussing the substantial evidence test); <em>Natural Res. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number><em>Def. Council, </em>808 F.3d at 569 (discussing the arbitrary and capricious test).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">MDE explained its selection of 2002 in the Guidance: \u201cMaryland regulations and local ordinances began requiring BMPs [around this time] to address a specific suite of volumes [recharge (Rey), water quality (WQy), and channel protection (Cpv) ] and it can therefore be justified that water quality treatment has been provided to the MEP.\u201d MDE, Guidance at 4. In proposing new regulations for stormwater management in 2000, MDE explained: \u201cThe resulting program will provide water quality treatment of up to 90 percent of the average annual rainfall throughout the State, establish ground water recharge standards, and outline a channel erosion control strategy.\u201d 27 Md. Reg. at 1168. Additionally, MDE explained that prior regulations had provided \u201csparse guidance\u201d on \u201cwater quality enhancement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To bolster MDE\u2019s focus on water quality, the agency incorporated the Manual by reference into the 2000 regulations. <em>See id. </em>at 1170; <em>see also </em>CWP &amp; MDE, Manual \u00a7 2.1, at 2.2 (\u201cThe WQy is directly related to the amount of impervious cover created at a site.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The Water Groups reject MDE\u2019s decision by arguing that Maryland\u2019s regulations <em>currently </em>define \u201cmaximum extent practicable\u201d based on a different requirement the State imposed after 2002. That is, COMAR 26.17.02.02B(22) defines MEP as the design of \u201cstormwater management systems so that all reasonable opportunities for using <em>ESD </em>planning techniques and treatment practices are exhausted and, only where absolutely necessary, a structural BMP is implemented.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">MDE has explained, however, that pursuant to the Storm-water Management Act of 2007, which precipitated the regulatory change the Water Groups refer to,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> the performance requirement ESD pertains to \u201cfuture development,\u201d not to restoration. MDE, Basis for Final Determination. As set forth in EN \u00a7 4-203(b)(1), (\u201c[t]he rules and regulations shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>[i]ndicate that the primary goal of the State and local programs will be to maintain <em>after development, </em>as nearly as possible, the predevelopment runoff characteristics.\u201d) (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>COMAR 26.17.02.01B (\u201cThese regulations for stormwater management apply to the development or redevelopment of land____\u201d). MDE has reached a correct legal conclusion, and one regarding the law in which the agency has expertise. <em>See John A., </em>400 Md. at 381-82, 929 A.2d at 147 (\u201cIn reviewing an agency\u2019s legal conclusions, it is a fundamental principle of administrative law that a reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency.\u201d). We find no error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Although the agency selected ESD as the MEP via regulation in 2009,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> MDE chose 2002 because that year marked the beginning of the stormwater management era when BMPs were subjected to performance standards to better treat water quality. 27 Md. Reg. at 1168. WQv is one such standard. CWP &amp; MDE, Manual \u00a7 1.2, at 1.13. The Manual shows a direct relationship between the amount of impervious surface and WQv. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2.1, at 2.3 (Figure 2.2). Thus, beginning in 2002, Maryland connected stormwater management practices to the restoration of impervious surface area, which is the Permit requirement at issue. MDE\u2019s conclusion that the Counties should calculate impervious surface area using 2002 as a baseline as part of the <em>20% </em>restoration requirement was supported by substantial evidence and was not arbitrary and capricious. <em>See Banks, </em>354 Md. at 69, 729 A.2d at 381 (\u201c[T]he expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.\u201d).<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Because we uphold the Guidance as a component the Counties may legally use to achieve the 20% restoration requirement, we must address whether Montgomery County can use this methodology, too. We recognize that MDE issued the Montgomery County Permit before MDE prepared the Guidance. <em>Compare </em>Montgomery County Permit: Part I: C (Effective Date: February 16, 2010), <em>with </em>MDE, Basis for Final Determination at 10 (MDE held meetings with the Counties about the Guidance from August 2010 to February 2011 before completing it in June 2011.). As we have discussed, MDE limited the practices the County could implement by connecting restoration to the Manual. But, importantly, MDE did not limit the manner in which Montgomery County could <em>show </em>its compliance with the 20% restoration requirement. <em>See, e.g., </em>Montgomery County Permit: Part G.2 (Watershed Restoration), Part IV.A (Annual Reporting). Because the Permit does not restrict how the County must show its progress in achieving the 20% restoration requirement and because of the important links we have already analyzed between the Guidance and the Manual (i.e., the WQy standard), we conclude that Montgomery County can rely on the Guidance in showing its compliance with this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">\n<em>Part II: TMDL Plans</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">As we discussed at the outset of this opinion, TMDLs are informational tools, of which WLAs \u2014 -wasteload allocations \u2014 are critical. As the District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania aptly noted, \u201cWLAs are not permit limits <em>per se; </em>rather they still require translation into permit limits \u2014 \u201d <em>Am.

[elffluent limits developed to protect a narrative water quality criterion, a numeric water quality criterion, or both, are consistent with the assumptions and requirements of any available wasteload allocation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>the discharge prepared by the State and approved by EPA pursuant to 40 CFR 130.7.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The Water Groups construe the contents of the TMDL implementation plans, that is, the actions and deadlines discussed <em>supra, </em>as effluent limitations. As they put it, nothing else in the Permits is \u201cremotely capable of ... impos[ing] effluent limitations that are consistent with the assumptions and requirements of TMDLs.\u201d Thus, the Permits can only be in compliance with 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(d)(1)(vii)(B) when MDE has reviewed <em>the contents </em>of the TMDL implementation plans. The problem for MDE, then, is one of timing. Because MDE will review the contents one year <em>after </em>issuing the Permits, the Water Groups conclude that MDE cannot know whether the effluent limitations in the Permits are consistent with the WLAs.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">We disagree with the Water Groups because (1) 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(d)(1)(vii)(B) is, like the MEP standard, flexible as to how a permitting authority complies with this regulation and (2) MDE has complied with the regulation by incorporating the WLAs (the most critical element of the regulation) into the Permits and by using an \u201citerative\u201d process of agency review and program change to ensure progress in meeting the WLAs.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Before we analyze MDE\u2019s \u201citerative\u201d process, we must take issue with the Water Groups\u2019 position that the <em>contents </em>of the restoration plans are effluent limits. We understand the effluent limits to be best management practices (\u201cBMPs\u201d).<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> But, importantly, the Permits do not incorporate these effluent limits in the restoration plans but in another section of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the Permits \u2014 Part III.E. That is, the Counties must implement a stormwater management program (\u201cSWMP\u201d), including the \u201cpractices found in the <em>2000 Maryland, Stormwater Design </em>Manual.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Importantly, the Permits instruct that \u201cthese [management] programs shall be integrated with other permit requirements to promote a comprehensive adaptive approach toward solving water quality problems.\u201d In this light, we understand the TMDL implementation plans as roadmaps because they <em>describe </em>a plan for achieving a goal (using BMPs to meet WLAs). <em>See, e.g., </em>Montgomery County Permit Part III.J (In the TMDL implementation plans, the County must \u201cdescribe those actions necessary to meet the storm drain system\u2019s share of WLAs in EPA approved TMDLs.\u201d). The requirement to implement BMPs, however, exists independent of the requirement to submit the TMDL implementation plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Having clarified this matter, we turn to the regulation to better understand MDE\u2019s obligation with respect to effluent limits and WLAs. We note that the plain text imposes a duty on the permitting authority to ensure that effluent limits are consistent with WLA assumptions and requirements. <em>See In re City of Moscow, Idaho, </em>2001 WL 988721, at *9 (\u201c[T]he governing regulations require consistency....\u201d) (emphasis in original). But the text does not instruct the permitting authority as to how it must ensure this consistency. <em>See id. </em>at *8 (noting the lack of detail in the regulation). Instead, the EPA set a minimal, flexible requirement in which the permitting authority is to design a scheme where effluent limits are compatible or in agreement with WLAs. <em>See </em>National Pollution Discharge Elimination System, 54 Fed.Reg. 23,868, 23,870, 23,879 (June 2, 1989) (codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44) (\u201cSubparagraph (vii) does not prescribe detailed procedures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>for developing water quality-based effluent limits. Rather, the regulation prescribes minimum requirements for developing water quality-based effluent limits, and at the same time, gives the permitting authority the flexibility to determine the appropriate procedures for developing water quality-based effluent limits.\u201d); <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>392 (4th ed. 2006) (Consistent means in agreement or compatible.)<footnotemark>56</footnotemark>; <em>cf. Am. Farm Bureau Fed\u2019n, </em>984 F.Supp.2d at 328 (\u201cAccordingly, in some circumstances, a state may write a NPDES permit limit that is different from the WLA, provided that it is consistent with the operative assumptions underlying the WLA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><em>In re City of Moscow, Idaho </em>is illustrative of the flexibility the regulation affords MDE. There, the Environmental Appeals Board rejected the City of Moscow\u2019s petition for review of an EPA-issued NPDES permit. 2001 WL 988721, at *1. In pertinent part, the Board concluded that the EPA (Region X) did not err in creating permit limits although the EPA did not incorporate the design flow rate of an applicable TMDL. <em>Id. </em>at *8-9. After reviewing 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(d)(1)(vii)(B) and the regulatory history, <em>see </em>54 Fed.Reg. 23,868, 23,879, the Board explained that there was no law or rule prescribing how the EPA was to select a flow rate to create effluent limits, <em>In re City of Moscow, Idaho, </em>2001 WL 988721, at *8. The Board concluded that the agency acted \u201cwell within the discretion accorded [it] under the applicable regulatory scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *9.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">So too here. No law or regulation specifies how or burdens MDE in undertaking the process of complying with 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(d)(1)(vii)(B). In fact, as we have discussed, the overarching federal law for MS4s \u2014 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii)\u2014 is broad and flexible, too. <em>See Natural Res. Def. Council, </em>966 F.2d at 1308.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Under the Permits, the Counties must include in the TMDL implementation plans the actions needed to meet \u201cWLAs in EPA approved TMDLs.\u201d Part III.J.1. Thus, the Permit ties the activities to WLAs, not to some other benchmark that could be inconsistent with the WLA. As the Permits make clear, \u201c[a]ll EPA approved TMDL\u2019s that establish WLA\u2019s applicable to the County\u2019s storm drain system are incorporated by reference into this permit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The Counties must also submit \u201cdocumentation of progress toward meeting applicable WLAs developed under EPA approved TMDLs.\u201d Reporting on WLA progress is reinforced through watershed assessment and restoration requirements. <em>See </em>Part III.F (\u201c[Watershed assessments shall [sjpecify how restoration efforts will increase progress toward meeting any applicable WLAs included in EPA approved TMDLs.\u201d); Part III.G (The Counties shall annually report on progress toward meeting WLAs.).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Moreover, \u201cMDE will review program implementation, annual reports, and periodic data submittal on an annual basis.\u201d The Permit requires \u201cBMP and program modifications\u201d if this report fails to \u201cshow progress toward meeting WLAs.\u201d The modifications are a product of the \u201citerative approach\u201d the Counties must follow if they do not make progress in achieving WLAs. That is, the Counties must propose \u201cadditional or alternate stormwater controls\u201d to meet WLAs, which MDE will review and approve, if adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\"><em>Environmental Defense Center, Inc. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEDC\u201d) </em>is instructive on the importance of permittee reporting and agency review to ensure compliance with the law. 344 F.3d 832, 858 (9th Cir.2003). In EDC, the Ninth Circuit vacated a portion of an EPA rule that permitted small MS4s to discharge under a general permitting scheme, and remanded for the EPA to revise the rule to comply with the CWA. <em>Id. </em>at 858.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Ninth Circuit stated that the rule did not require the permitting authority to review the MS4 operator\u2019s stormwater management program \u201cto ensure\u201d that the operator\u2019s program would <em>\u201cin </em>fact\u201d comply with the relevant law. <em>Id. </em>at 855 (emphasis in original). Thus, the Ninth Circuit concluded that \u201cnothing prevents the operator of a small MS4 from misunderstanding or misrepresenting its own stormwater situation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The scheme the Ninth Circuit rejected in <em>EDC </em>is materially different from the scheme in the Permits here. MDE requires reporting, assessment, and adaptation to ensure that the Counties\u2019 BMPs will make progress to achieve WLAs. We find the effluent limits under this scheme to be consistent with approved WLAs. <em>See id. </em>at 856 (\u201cHowever, stormwater management programs that are designed by regulated parties must, in every instance, be subject to meaningful review by an appropriate regulating entity....\u201d). Thus, the Permits comply with 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(d)(1)(vii)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\n<em>Part III: Monitoring</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Here, the Water Groups raise two arguments: the Permits do not include federally mandated monitoring to (1) produce representative data in the MS4 jurisdictions and (2) assure compliance with Permit requirements. They contend that MDE elected not to comply with federal regulations that impose the above requirements and that the record does not otherwise show that MDE complied with these laws. MDE responds by defending its monitoring scheme as sufficient to comply with the applicable federal regulations. Moreover, MDE argues that some of the federal provisions are inapposite because they only pertained to the initial application for MS4 permits in the 1990s.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>A. The Permit\u2019s Monitoring Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">We begin by noting what the Permits require. Under Part III.F, each County must conduct chemical, biological, and physical monitoring at one outfall and an associated in-stream station.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> The Permits set forth the number of required monitoring events, sampling methods, pollutants, and locations.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The Counties must also conduct monitoring of stream channel protection.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> These two levels of monitoring occur at different locations. <em>Compare </em>note 58, <em>with </em>note 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>B. Applicable Law</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">We now consider what federal monitoring regulations apply to the Permits. Under 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.48(b), <em>\u201c[ajll permits shall specify </em>[Required monitoring including type, intervals, and frequency sufficient to yield data which are representative of the monitored activity including, when appropriate, continuous monitoring.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Moreover, monitoring requirements must \u201cassure compliance with permit limitations.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(i)(1); <em>see also In re Gov\u2019t of the D.C. Mun. Separate Storm Sewer Sys., </em>10 E.A.D. 323, 2002 WL 257698, at *20 (Feb. 20, 2002) (\u201cFirst, both section 122.48(b) and section 122.44(i) would appear to require that certain monitoring conditions be included in all permits.\u201d). The Clean Water Act makes plain the EPA\u2019s broad authority to set these requirements. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1318(a); <em>Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. EPA, </em>863 F.2d 1420, 1434 (9th Cir.1988) (The EPA \u201chas wide discretion and authority to determine monitoring requirements in NPDES permits____\u201d). These requirements apply to state programs. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 123.25(15), (19).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The Water Groups point us to an additional regulation as part of their argument that the Permits are not capable of producing representative data. Specifically, pursuant to 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.26(d)(2)(iii)(D), applicants for large MS4s must submit a \u201cproposed monitoring program for representative data collection for the term of the permit that describes the location of outfalls or field screening points to be sampled (or the location of instream stations),\u201d and, among other things, \u201cwhy the location is representative.\u201d But MDE disputes whether this regulation is even applicable to our analysis of the agency\u2019s decision to issue the Permits when the regulation, in its view, pertains to applicants (i.e., permittees). MDE argues that we should read 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.26(d)(2)(iii)(D) as relevant only to a permit <em>application </em>\u2014 not a permit \u2014 and, moreover, only to the <em>first cycle </em>of permit applications for MS4s (i.e., the early 1990s). In MDE\u2019s view, the agency had \u201cthe flexibility to establish requirements [it] deem[ed] appropriate\u201d in subsequent MS4 permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Recognizing that 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.26(d) concerns \u201c[application requirements,\u201d we nevertheless agree with the Water Groups that the regulation is relevant to our review of MDE\u2019s decision to issue the Permits. Although state and federal permitting laws are unhelpful, an EPA Policy Memorandum interpreting 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.26(d) (\u201cthe Policy Memo\u201d)<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> is instructive. In the Policy Memo, the EPA instructs that \u201creapplications should focus on maintenance and improvement of [MS4 storm water management] programs\u201d that were required in the initial applications. EPA, Interpretive Policy Memorandum on Reapplication Requirements for Municipal Separate Sewer Systems, 61 Fed.Reg. 41,698, 41,698 (Aug. 9, 1996) [hereinafter Policy Memo].<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> According to the Policy Memo, MDE can make changes to the MS4 monitoring program during the reapplication period, , but such changes must be \u201cappropriate and useful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41,699. In other words, when a permittee reapplies for a discharge permit, and if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>permitting authority reissues the permit, it is the permitting authority\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the reissued permit contains programs that are adequate in light of the initial application requirements in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.26(d). We rely, then, on 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.26(d) as a baseline to review the monitoring program in the Permits to ensure that MDE only made program changes that were \u201cappropriate and useful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41,699.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">C. The EPA Policy Memo</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The EPA published the Policy Memo to \u201crespond[ ] to requests from municipalities and NPDES permit writers for clarification about regulations which do not appear to address reapplication requirements, i.e., permit reissuance.\u201d 61 Fed. Reg. at 41,698.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In the Policy Memo, the EPA first explains that it does not require an applicant to repeat <em>in full </em>the process in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.26(d)(1)-(2). <em>Id. </em>The EPA explained that it would be redundant to \u201crequest the same information again [including characterization of data at \u00a7 122.26(d)(2)(iii) ], where it has already been provided and has not changed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But an applicant \u201cshould identify any proposed changes or improvements\u201d to \u201cmonitoring activities.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">If MS4 applicants and permit writers wish to change programs in future permits, the EPA explains, they may not only \u201cde-emphasize\u201d but also propose <em>to eliminate </em>a program component. <em>Id. </em>at 41,699; <em>see id. </em>at 41,698 (\u201cMS4 permit applicants and NPDES permit writers have considerable discretion to customize appropriate and streamlined reapplication requirements on a case-by-case basis.\u201d). De-emphasis may be justified based on the discharger\u2019s experience during the first permit term. <em>Id. </em>By way of example, the EPA stated that \u201cnew information on the relative magnitude of a problem\u201d and \u201cnew data on water quality impacts of storm water discharges\u201d could justify program changes. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, elimination could be justified \u201cwhen a different water quality program would serve the same goals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We construe the phrase \u201csame goals\u201d as referring to the CWA\u2019s objective in Chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>26 of Title 33 of \u201crestoring] and maintaining] the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a); <em>see </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1318(a)(1)(A)(i) (\u201cWhenever required to carry out <em>the objective </em>of this chapter [26: Water Pollution Prevention and Control],____the Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any point source to establish and maintain such records ...

The EPA then suggested alternative techniques: \u201cmunicipalities may wish to consider using monitoring techniques <em>other than </em>end-of-the pipe chemical-specific monitoring, including habitat assessments, bioassessments, and/or other biological methods.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">D. Representative Monitoring</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">MDE argues, somewhat correctly, that the Policy Memo grants it \u201cthe flexibility to establish requirements [it] deem[s] appropriate.\u201d The Water Groups only repeat the language of the Policy Memo, arguing that MDE can change programs to make them \u201cmore appropriate and useful.\u201d They argue that MDE\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. Although the Policy Memo does grant NPDES permit writers, like MDE, the flexibility to modify program components, including monitoring, 61 Fed.Reg. at 41,699, the EPA does not allow permit writers to reissue permits and abdicate their responsibility in \u201crestor[ing] and maintaining] the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a). 40 C.F.R. 122.26(d) required, among other things, a \u201cproposed monitoring program for representative data collection for the term of the permit that describes the location of outfalls or field screening points to be sampled (or the location of instream stations),\u201d and, among other things, \u201cwhy the location is representative.\u201d And as we also discussed earlier, the Permits must include monitoring \u201csufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>to yield data which are representative of the monitored activity.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.48(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">We conclude that MDE\u2019s monitoring program in the Permits will produce representative data because MDE has (1) ensured that the Counties monitor stormwater discharges at monitoring locations that represent an adequate range of land uses statewide, and (2) increased the frequency of monitoring to yield more representative information at the County level.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">MDE revised the MS4 monitoring program in the late 1990s to implement a monitoring approach called the \u201cthree legged stool,\u201d so named because it incorporated not only \u201c[c]hemical testing\u201d but also \u201cbiological criteria\u201d and \u201cphysical assessments.\u201d MDE, Maryland\u2019s NPDES Municipal Stormwater Monitoring at \u00a7 4.2 (1997); <em>see also </em>MDE, Basis for Final Determination to Issue Anne Arundel County\u2019s NPDES MS4 Permit.

MDE did not rubber stamp the jurisdictions\u2019 proposal but affirmed that \u201c[t]here is still a need to continue water chemistry work for the far field objectives of nutrient reduction in the Bay and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>accurate loading estimates for NPDES.\u201d MDE, Maryland\u2019s NPDES Municipal Stormwater Monitoring at \u00a7 4.2.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Moreover, biological and physical monitoring are within the scope of the EPA\u2019s suggestions for alternative techniques, that is, \u201cmonitoring techniques <em>other than </em>end-of-the pipe chemical-specific monitoring, including habitat assessments, bioassessments, and/or other biological methods.\u201d 61 Fed.Reg. at 41.699 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">By increasing the number of monitored storm events,<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> MDE intended for the Counties to acquire more <em>representative </em>data about pollutant loads. <em>Compare </em>61 Fed.Reg. at 41.699 (The EPA encouraged permit writers \u201cto determine if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>storm water monitoring efforts are appropriate and useful.\u201d), <em>with </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.62(d)(2)(iii)(D) (The initial application called for \u201c[a] proposed monitoring program for representative data collection.\u201d).<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The Water Groups insist on interpreting <em>representative </em>in terms of the boundaries of the political subdivisions. In its analysis of the Counties\u2019 initial monitoring experiences, MDE explained that site selection was a challenging undertaking, and one that it had to interpret flexibly so that the Counties could reasonably carry out their monitoring duties. That is, \u201cmonitoring only five sites did not allow any single jurisdiction to monitor all possible land uses.\u201d Maryland\u2019s NPDES Municipal Stormwater Monitoring at \u00a7 2.3. From MDE\u2019s perspective, however, the state-wide program to improve water quality was maintained by, <em>\u201cin the aggregate,\u201d </em>monitoring \u201cthe continuum from low density residential to heavy industrial sites.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).

We conclude that MDE acted within the discretion the EPA accorded it in the Policy Memo. Thus, we also conclude that MDE has committed no legal errors pertaining to 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.26(d)(2)(iii)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">For many of the same reasons, we believe that the Permits contain monitoring \u201csufficient to yield data which are representative of the monitored activity.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.48(b). The Permits require monitoring of many pollutants. Part IV.F.1.a-d.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Following the Counties\u2019 first experience imple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>meriting MS4 permits, MDE increased the frequency of monitoring to \u201cimprove pollutant load estimates.\u201d MDE, Maryland\u2019s NPDES Municipal Stormwater Monitoring \u00a7 4.0. The agency also decided to orchestrate site selection at the state level to \u201cmaintain an adequate number of residential, commercial, and industrial sites for State water chemistry needs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4.3. By taking control of the selection of monitored sites, MDE could better ensure monitoring of a continuum of activities (industrial, residential, and commercial). Additionally, the Counties will have to explain their monitoring process to ensure that the agency can evaluate whether they have complied with MDE\u2019s requirements. Part V.A.l.b. (The Counties shall submit annual reports and include \u201c[a] narrative summary describing the results and analyses of data, including monitoring data that is accumulated throughout the reporting year.\u201d).<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>MDE also requires the Counties to assess WLAs, which represent pollutant loads. Part IV.E.2.b.iii. The Counties must record continuous flow measurements to obtain data to estimate pollutant reductions. Part IV.F.l.aiv. Because the Counties are to achieve WLAs over time through restoration activities, MDE requires the Counties to conduct such monitoring \u201cwhere the <em>cumulative </em>effects of watershed restoration activities can be assessed.\u201d Part IV.F.l (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">MDE thus structured the Permits and imposed requirements on the Counties to ensure that they will monitor the discharge of pollutants to yield representative data.

Permit Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(i) requires monitoring \u201cto assure compliance with permit limitations.\u201d We begin by noting the two applicable limitations: (1) controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> and (2) the restoration of 20% of impervious surface area not restored to the MEP. <em>See </em>Part III.D; Part III.E.2.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>1. Reduction of Pollutant Discharge</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The Permits include two important components that inform our analysis of whether MDE\u2019s monitoring program ensures reductions in the discharge of pollutants: (a) the monitoring and modeling scheme and (b) adaptive management. As we explain, our initial discussion of monitoring and modeling is not sufficient to measure MDE\u2019s compliance with 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(i). Rather, it is a necessary component of what we consider a two-part scheme MDE designed to ensure the Counties would implement controls to reduce stormwater discharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">a. Monitoring and Modeling</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">MDE requires the Counties to implement a stormwater management program (\u201cSWMP\u201d), which consists of BMPs. Part IV.D.1.a. The Counties must integrate SWMPs with other permit requirements. Part IV.D. Aside from their role in the 20% restoration requirement, BMPs are most critical in the restoration plans that the Counties must implement to achieve progress in meeting WLAs. Part IV.E.2, 4; <em>see swpra </em>note 17 (The WLAs are derived from the EPA approved TMDLs for each Permit.).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">To achieve progress in meeting WLAs, the Counties must first set a baseline for stormwater pollutant loads. MDE, Guidance, at 3.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> To set this baseline, the Counties must apply TMDL pollutant loading rates to urban land use data. <em>Id. </em>An MDE-approved model, such as MAST, will automatically calculate the cost and load estimates for Counties to inform their decision-making. <em>See </em>About MAST, Maryland Assessment Scenario Tool, <em>available at </em>http://www.mastonline.org/About. aspx [https://perma.cc/7NRV-QNXX]. The Counties can compare different scenarios to determine what BMPs they can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>implement to reduce pollution. <em>Id.; see also </em>MDE, Guidance, at 1 (\u201cLocal governments can weigh the cost associated with implementing different practices and choose the most efficient option for meeting pollutant load reductions.\u201d). The Counties select and begin implementing BMPs in accordance with their restoration plans. Part IV.E.2. Then they can monitor the effectiveness of the activities, Part IV.F.l.aiv, and use the monitoring information to determine if the activities have helped make progress in achieving WLAs, Part IV.E.2, 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">But the efficiencies for BMPs that the Counties select are based in part on estimates. <em>See, e.g., </em>MDE, Guidance, at 10 (Table 4).<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> As our discussion of modeling illustrates, a model predicts the reductions a BMP can achieve.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> But it does not tell the Counties exactly what the BMP will do in terms of pollution reduction. Indeed, many variables impact this process.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Chesapeake Bay Program, Phase 5.3 Community Watershed Model, \u00a7 6.1.2, at 6-4 (\u201cUncertainty in estimates of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>BMP effectiveness is due to factors including (1) variability in precipitation, hydrology, soils, and geology; (2) variable performance of land management practices; [and] (3) lag time between implementing a practice and full performance and observed water quality benefits \u2014 \u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at \u00a7 6.2.2, at 6-8 (\u201cVirtually all research data are generated under controlled management conditions\u201d that, among other things, are designed to minimize hazards; thus, \u201cthe research estimates are more representative of a best-case scenario.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">But this should not raise a red flag about the legal correctness of the Permits. Indeed, the inherent shortcoming in estimating BMP effectiveness explains MDE\u2019s decision to require the Counties to adapt their practices based on improved knowledge over time. <em>See infra </em>Discussion: Adaptive Management. Rather, because the Counties <em>must </em>implement BMPs to make progress in achieving WLAs, estimation and prediction are necessary evils in this context. Thus, high quality assessments of BMPs are particularly important in the Permits so that MDE and the Counties can understand which practices are most effective to meet the many WLAs incorporated into the Permits. <em>See infra </em>note 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">As we have discussed, MDE requires the Counties to assess BMPs through a focused monitoring approach. Part IV. F.1.a.iv. In the Basis for Final Determination, MDE explained that pollution reduction research supported the use of focused monitoring to better understand and, thus, improve BMPs. MDE, Basis for Final Determination to Issue Anne Arundel County\u2019s NPDES MS4 Permit (2013).<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> The research includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>an analysis of how states, including Maryland, were \u201ctracking nutrient and sediment control practices\u201d to restore the Chesapeake Bay. <em>See </em>Committee on the Evaluation of Chesapeake Bay Program Implementation for Nutrient Reduction to Improve Water Quality, Achieving Nutrient and Sediment Reduction Goals in the Chesapeake Bay vii (National Academies Press 2011) [hereinafter Achieving Nutrient and Sediment Reduction Goals in the Bay].

Part IV.F.1 (\u201cMonitoring activities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>shall occur where the cumulative effects of watershed restoration activities can be assessed.\u201d). Indeed, MDE designed the second component of the monitoring program with the same purpose in mind: monitoring \u201cfor determining the effectiveness of stormwater management practices for stream channel protection.\u201d Part IV.F.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">MDE then uses the monitoring data to calibrate its models. Part IV.F.1.a.iv (\u201cData collected shall be used to estimate annual and seasonal pollutant loads and reductions, and for the calibration of watershed assessment models.\u201d). That is, MDE\u2019s approach yields more accurate data on the efficacy of BMPs, which increases certainty for all interested parties in understanding what effects restoration activities will have on the State\u2019s waters. MDE, Guidance, at 1 (\u201cThe data gathered may be used to update and improve Maryland\u2019s stormwater management matrix of options for achieving water quality.\u201d). Our review of the first component in the Permits \u2014 the monitoring and modeling scheme \u2014 illustrates that it is necessary to ensure the Counties are implementing BMPs to the maximum extent practicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">b. Adaptive Management</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">In their annual report, the Counties must submit the pollutant load reductions determined through monitoring. Part V.A.2.g; <em>see also </em>Attachment A: Annual Report Databases (G).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The required measurement is pounds per year, which is consistent with the federal requirement that a discharger monitors \u201cmass (or other measurement specified in the permit) for each pollutant\u201d or \u201cvolume of effluent discharged from each outfall.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(i)(1)(i)-(ii). As discussed above, these reductions pertain to the pollutants which the Counties must monitor. Part IV.1.a.iv; <em>see </em>Attachment A: Annual Report Databases (G) (The pollutants arise from the Bay TMDL and local TMDLs.).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">MDE will review the annual reports, Part V.B, and will require program modifications \u201caccording to needed program <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>improvements identified as a result of [MDE\u2019s] periodic evaluations,\u201d Part IV.D.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> \u201cFailure to comply with a [Pjermit provision,\u201d such as the stormwater management or reporting requirements, \u201cconstitutes a violation of the CWA and is grounds for enforcement action; permit termination, revocation, or modification; or denial of a permit renewal application.\u201d Part VII.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">As we have discussed,<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> MDE has flexibility in setting controls in MS4s: \u201cCongress did not mandate [in 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii) ] a minimum standards approach or specify that the EPA develop minimal performance requirements.\u201d <em>Natural Res. Def.

Rather, the regulation prescribes minimum requirements for developing water quality-based effluent limits, and at the same time, gives the permitting authority the flexibility to determine the appropriate procedures for developing water quality-based effluent limits.\u201d). We discern that the law requires a regulating authority such as MDE to review the entity\u2019s actions (or non-action, as the case may be) to ensure accountability in implementing stormwater controls: \u201cstormwater management programs that are designed by regulated parties must, in every instance, be subject to meaningful review by an appropriate regulating entity to ensure that each such program reduces the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable.\u201d <em>EDC, </em>344 F.3d at 856.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>MDE\u2019s adaptive management approach includes a requirement to impose program changes based on annual report data obtained from monitoring. Where, for example, the Counties\u2019 current strategy is not reducing discharges, the Permits allow MDE to force the Counties to implement BMPs that will, or at least are an improvement. Because the Counties will implement controls to reduce discharges under MDE\u2019s oversight, the monitoring provisions comply with 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(i).<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> <em>See Natural Res.

But, as we explain, because (1) 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(f) contemplates a flexible approach to monitoring and (2) MDE incorporated a clear evaluation tool into the Permits to assess restoration of impervious surfaces, MDE has assured compliance with the 20% restoration requirement under 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Under the restoration provision, MDE\u2019s approach requires the Counties first to submit an assessment of their impervious surface area within a year of the issuance of the Permits. Part IV.E.2.a. This Permit part incorporates by reference the Guidance, which contains the methodology we discuss herein. In the assessment, the Counties must delineate those portions in their jurisdictions \u201cthat are either treated to the [MEP], partially treated, or untreated and available for retrofit.\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> MDE, Guidance at III.4, at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">To ensure that the Counties implement satisfactory BMPs on their untreated surfaces, MDE requires the Counties to translate the activities into credits. <em>Id. </em>at IV, at 8.

Part VII.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">We find instructive the Second Circuit\u2019s reasoning in upholding, in part, the EPA\u2019s monitoring provisions in permits to regulate the discharge of ballast water from ships. <em>Natural Res. Def.

Although the environmental organizations had advocated for the alternative of \u201cdirect moni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>toring,\u201d the Second Circuit reasoned that dischargers did not have the capacity to quantify living organisms of certain size classes. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the current technology would require an analysis that was \u201cprohibitively expensive and impractical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There was, in essence, no \u201cfeasible\u201d alternative the EPA could have established under these permits. <em>Id. </em>at 582-83. Thus, the Second Circuit deferred to the EPA\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">From <em>NRDC, </em>we discern that a permitting authority has <em>flexibility </em>in how it sets monitoring requirements. As 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(i) reveals, the EPA wrote the regulation with the understanding that not every permit limitation could be measured in terms of mass or volume. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(i)(1)(i) (The regulation requires monitoring of mass \u201cor other measurement specified in the permit.\u201d). In this case, those measurements would not aid the Counties or MDE in evaluating progress toward restoring impervious surface <em>area. </em>Rather, MDE requires the translation of restoration practices, implemented on impervious surface areas, into credits to make restoration of those areas understandable. The agency can also monitor restoration in a uniform manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">From <em>NRDC, </em>we also discern that 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(i)(1)(i) requires <em>feasible </em>monitoring. Here, the Guidance not only promotes accountability in a uniform manner but also gives MS4 permittees the flexibility to choose from among approved restoration practices to address local conditions. Flexibility is a hallmark in designing MS4 permits. <em>See </em>55 Fed.Reg. at 48,038 (\u201cIn enacting section 405 of the [Water Quality Act], Congress recognized that permit requirements for [MS4s] should be developed in a flexible manner to allow site-specific permit conditions to reflect the wide range of impacts that can be associated with these discharges.\u201d). The Water Groups have not presented a feasible alternative that contains both the flexibility and the accountability to assure compliance with the permit limitation that Counties restore 20% of their impervious surface areas. MDE has complied with 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44\u00a9 by incorporating the Guidance by reference for the Counties to use to meet the 20% restoration requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>We recognize that MDE did not incorporate the Guidance into the Montgomery County Permit. But that fact is not fatal to that Permit\u2019s ability to comply with 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(f). When the County submits its annual report, the County must include databases of impervious acreage and specify those areas treated by BMPs, proposed for restoration, under construction for restoration, and completed. Montgomery County Permit Part IV:A.2, Attachment A: (C). The County must also submit descriptions of the type of BMP it used at specific locations. <em>Id. </em>at Part IV:A.2, Attachment A: (D). As we have discussed, those BMPs are the stormwater practices in the Manual. These reporting requirements will allow MDE to evaluate on a yearly basis the Counties\u2019 compliance with the 20% restoration requirement. We recognize that this reporting system is not as detailed as the method in the Guidance, but 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(i) does not include requirements as to the specificity of the measurement the permitting authority selects. <em>See, e.g., Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>808 F.3d at 581 (As to monitoring of a vessel\u2019s ballast water treatment system, the EPA required ship owners to measure system functionality, \u201csuch as how much chlorine the system is using each month.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">The Permit also states that the County must merely describe \u201cthe results and analysis of data.\u201d Part IV.A.l.b. Because the Permit does not prohibit the type of analysis that the County may use to evaluate the 20% restoration requirement, we conclude that the County may use the Guidance. Thus, we conclude that the Montgomery County Permit complies with 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(i) too.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\n<em>Part TV: Public Participation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u201cMany tensions exist between the democratic aspiration of government of the people, by the people, and for the people and modern representative government with its mass electorate and elaborate bureaucracy for carrying out government functions. Nowhere are these tensions more acute than in the domain of environmental policy.\u201d National Research Council, Public Participation in Environmental Assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>and Decision, National Academies Press 7 (2008). The dispute between the Water Groups and MDE over whether the Permits satisfy public participation requirements exemplifies this tension. The Water Groups frame their argument by highlighting the ways in which the Permits\u2019 two most critical elements \u2014 the TMDL Plans and the 20% restoration requirement \u2014 fail to satisfy public participation requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">A. TMDL Plans</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We have discussed at length that the Permits require the Counties to submit TMDL plans and that, among other things, the Permits satisfy 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122,44(d)(1)(vii)(B), which requires that effluent limits be consistent with WLAs.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Nevertheless, the Water Groups contend that the TMDL plans create another problem. The Permits require the Counties to design and submit these plans <em>after </em>the agency approves of the Permits. <em>See, e.g., </em>Montgomery County Permit Part III.J.2 (\u201cWithin one year of the effective date of this permit or the approval of an applicable TMDL by EPA, whichever is later, the County shall submit to MDE for review and approval a TMDL implementation plan____\u2019\u2019). The Water Groups contend that MDE has \u201cunlawfully circumvent[ed]\u201d federal and state procedural requirements because the restoration plans, which include significant new requirements, come into existence more than one year after the Permits are issued, without providing for public notice and comment.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> The Water Groups characterize this scheme as an \u201cend-run around mandatory permitting requirements\u201d and as an approach that \u201cthwart[s] accountability.\u201d Put simply, the essence of the Water Groups\u2019 argument is that the public cannot comment about decisions that have yet to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">1. Permit Modification</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Specifically, the Water Groups view the TMDL plans that must be submitted to MDE as a modification of the Permits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Federal and state regulations stipulate that a permitting authority must provide the public an opportunity to be heard prior to a modification of a permit authorizing discharges. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 122.62, 124.10; EN \u00a7\u00a7 1-601, 9-324.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> Courts across the country have cited these federal regulations as well as related state regulations in recognizing the necessity of public participation when a permit has been modified. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Smithfield Foods, </em>191 F.3d 516 (4th Cir.1999); <em>Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t </em>\u2014 California <em>v. Union Oil Co. of California, </em>83 F.3d 1111 (9th Cir.1996). Thus, the Water Groups\u2019 argument requires us to determine whether the restoration plans constitute a modification of the Permits triggering an obligation upon MDE to implement the public participation provisions in those regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The Permits direct the Counties to develop restoration plans using BMPs that are found in the Manual and discussed again in the Guidance. These documents, which MDE incorporated into the Permits by reference, provide a \u201cmenu of options\u201d for the Counties to utilize. By incorporating these documents, MDE made the BMPs available to the Counties at the time the agency issued the Permits. When the Counties submitted (or will submit) restoration plans using these BMPs, no modification will have occurred because the Counties will merely have drawn from the same pool of BMPs that the agency had previously analyzed and approved of for <em>restoration </em>purposes. CWP <em>&amp; </em>MDE, Manual \u00a7 2.0 (\u201cThis chapter also presents a list of acceptable BMP options that can be used to comply with the sizing criteria,\u201d including, the WQv.); <em>see </em>27 Md. Reg. at 1168 (to be codified at COMAR 26.07.02) (MDE incorporated the Manual as part of the agency\u2019s effort to enhance its regulations which had until then provided \u201csparse guidance\u201d on \u201cwater quality enhancement.\u201d). Al <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>though we recognize that the Counties have selected <em>specific </em>BMPs to implement from among a larger group of BMPs, the larger group still satisfies MDE\u2019s specific performance standard, WQV. Thus, no \u201cmaterial and substantial alterations or additions\u201d will occur after Permit issuance \u201cjustifying] the application of [ ] conditions that are different or absent in the existing [P]ermit.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.62(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">2. Opportunity to Comment</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The Water Groups also argue that the restoration plans violate federal and state laws on public notice and comment because they are unable to meaningfully comment about decisions that have yet to be made. This argument is unavailing because, as we have explained, the BMPs were previously available for the public to comment on. Indeed, many of the same Water Groups challenging the Permits in this case submitted comments on these BMPs.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">For example, in the Basis for Final Determination, MDE noted that it \u201creceived many, varied and often conflicting comments regarding the Guidance,\u201d which referred to the BMPs, and that the Guidance was \u201cwidely distributed and commented on.\u201d One salient BMP that was objected to by some Water Groups was the use of detention facilities, such as detention ponds.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> For example, Natural Resources Defense Council submitted a comment in which they criticized the Guidance as \u201cflawed\u201d because it \u201coverestimate[d] the efficacy of detention ponds\u201d and \u201coverstate^] the channel protection benefits of detention practices.\u201d Chesapeake Bay Foundation, also a party, commented that detention systems \u201cprovid[e] very little water quality benefits.\u201d<footnotemark>93</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>On the other hand, the Water Groups strongly supported the use of ESD in their submitted comments.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> Natural Resources Defense Council proffered that the draft Guidance \u201cignore[d] the Maryland statute establishing ESD as the preferred Maryland approach.\u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> The Chesapeake Bay Foundation stated that the Permits \u201cshould impose a higher performance standard\u201d and recommended that this \u201cbe done primarily through Environmental Site Design.\u201d<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> In its Basis for Final Determination, MDE responded to the Water Groups\u2019 comments by highlighting its credit approach to improving water quality. MDE explicated that the Guidance incentivized the utilization of ESD practices by granting greater pollution credit for ESD and less credit for structural treatment BMPs such as detention facilities. Furthermore, MDE justified the use of detention ponds and other types of structural BMPs pursuant to the Manual to afford the Counties the \u201cflexibility to implement various strategies based on site specific opportunities.\u201d The comments and MDE\u2019s substantive responses thereto, illustrate that there was a vigorous and pellucid public discussion regarding the practices set forth in the Manual and Guidance, and that the agency defended its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>approach to water improvement strategies as flexible but effective.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Thus, the record in this case clearly supports that the public had the opportunity and, in fact, actually commented on which BMPs would best meet the MEP standard for restoration purposes.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> In arguing that they cannot comment about decisions that have yet to be made, the Water Groups overlook the fact that the public was able to comment on BMPs \u2014 the core component of the TMDL restoration plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Moreover, even though the Counties create the restoration plans after the Permits are approved, the public is still able to participate in the formulation of the plans. The Permits explicitly provide for \u201c[a] minimum 30 day comment period\u201d before finalization of the restoration plans. In addition, the Counties must give notice in a local newspaper and on their website outlining how the public may obtain information and provide comments on the restoration plans. Critically, the Counties must also include a summary in their annual reports of how they \u201caddressed or will address any material public comments received.\u201d MDE reviews these reports. The Counties are \u201cresponsible for complying with all conditions of\u2019 the Permits, and \u201c[failure to comply with a [P]ermit provision constitutes a violation of the CWA and is grounds for enforcement action.\u201d Thus, contrary to the Water Groups\u2019 assertion that the Permits \u201cthwart accountability,\u201d the Permits afford the opportunity for robust public involvement in the attempt to abate stormwater pollution and improve water quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">That the Permits provide for public participation at the County level is not enough for the Water Groups. The Water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Groups fault the Permits for not providing for public participation at the state level and proffer that the Permits \u201cprevente ] members of the public from commenting on ... MDE\u2019s decision to approve the restoration plans.\u201d Because the public had the opportunity to comment on the \u201cmenu\u201d of BMPs in the Manual and the Permits unambiguously mandate public participation at the County level, the restoration plans have been subject to a \u201cdouble layer\u201d of public participation. We, therefore, are not persuaded by the Water Groups\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Finally, the Water Groups maintain that MDE\u2019s claims of \u201cpotential administrative burdens are irrelevant and specious.\u201d We must, however, give weight to the notion that MDE permitted the Counties to draw from a broad group of BMPs in the Manual in light of the highly variable nature of storm-water discharges. MDE possesses a comparative advantage in addressing environmental problems affecting our State. It is axiomatic that a reviewing court should respect \u201cthe expertise of an agency in its own field.\u201d <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 69, 729 A.2d at 381 (citations omitted). Moreover, the Counties have expertise in water quality assessments of waterbodies found within the boundaries of their political subdivisions. As the Permits require, the Counties \u201cshall complete detailed watershed assessments\u201d for their entire jurisdiction. Thus, there is great value in deferring to the Counties\u2019 choice of BMPs, and because the public had an opportunity to comment on the BMPs during the drafting of the Permits as well as on the select BMPs in the restoration plans the Counties submit to MDE, we conclude that the public has not been deprived of notice and comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">3. Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Assoc. v. EPA, </em>410 F.3d 964 (7th Cir.2005), is also instructive on this point. In <em>Texas Independent Producers, </em>the EPA issued a general permit for storm-water discharges from construction sites that required operators to file a Notice of Intent (\u201cNOI\u201d) stating that they planned to operate under the general permit, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>apply for an individual permit. 410 F.3d at 968. Absent a negative ruling by the EPA, stormwater discharges that complied with the terms of the general permit were automatically authorized. <em>Id. </em>The permit also required that operators \u201ccreate, maintain, and implement a site-specific Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (\u2018SWPPP\u2019).\u201d <em>Id. </em>An environmental organization challenged the Permit and asserted that it violated the Clean Water Act because it failed to satisfy public participation requirements regarding the NOI and SWPPP.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">After conducting a <em>Chevron </em>analysis, the court concluded that EPA\u2019s reasoning as to why it issued the general permit without providing for public review of NOIs and SWPPPs was \u201ceminently reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 978. Notably, the court accepted EPA\u2019s argument that because the public had the opportunity to comment on the proposed general permits whose terms governed the NOIs and SWPPPs, there was \u201cno need for additional public comment or a notice period [regarding NOIs and SWPPPs themselves].\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the court credited the EPA\u2019s contention \u201cthat requiring \u2018an additional public hearing on each individual NOI and SWPPP would eviscerate the administrative efficiency inherent in the general permitting concept,\u2019 in effect making the general permit scheme no different from the process of obtaining individual permits.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The Water Groups point out that the permit in <em>Texas Independent Producers </em>was a general permit whereas the Permits at issue here are \u201cnot eligible for general permits.\u201d The Water Groups rightly note that the \u201cexistence of different permitting regimes for large and small municipal storm sewer systems reflects Congressional policy judgment\u201d that large MS4s be regulated differently than small systems. Even if the permits are not the same, the Permits at issue in this case are conceptually analogous to a general permit because all Counties create their restoration plans based upon the <em>same </em>document setting forth the <em>same </em>groups of BMPs \u2014 the Manual. Accordingly, we find the Seventh Circuit\u2019s determination regarding public participation in <em>Texas Independent Producers </em>persuasive, and conclude that the Permits\u2019 TMDL plan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>ning requirement does not violate notice and comment mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">The Water Groups rely on the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Waterkeeper Alliance, Inc. v. EPA, </em>399 F.3d 486 (2d Cir.2005), in support of their argument that the contents of the TMDL plans are subject to public participation requirements. In <em>Waterkeeper Alliance, </em>the court examined the regulation of water pollutants contained in the runoff from concentrated animal feeding operations (\u201cCAFOs\u201d). In pertinent part, the court held that the nutrient management plans the CAFOs were required to develop were effluent limits but that the EPA violated public participation requirements because it \u201cfail[ed] to require that the terms of the nutrient management plans be included in the NPDES permits.\u201d <em>Waterkeeper Alliance, </em>399 F.3d at 502-04. The court stated that the plans were effluent limits because the CAFOs were required to set waste application rates in the plans. <em>Id. </em>at 502; <em>see </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(11) (An effluent limit includes a restriction on a rate.). In contrast to the nutritional plans discussed in <em>Waterkeeper Alliance, </em>the most critical element of the restoration plans\u2014 the BMPs \u2014 is already included in the Permits because the Permits incorporate the Manual and Guidance, which set forth those practices. Thus, the Water Groups\u2019 reliance on <em>Water-keeper Alliance </em>is misplaced. <em>See </em>Part III.G, Part IV.E.2.a.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">A Ninth Circuit decision addressing public participation is also distinguishable. In <em>Environmental Defense Center v. EPA, </em>the Ninth Circuit remanded an EPA regulation that required operators of MS4s to develop and implement individualized pollution control programs that were not subject to agency review or public participation. 344 F.3d at 853-58. The court found that the rule violated 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii), which is the same statutory provision that is at the center of this case. The court held that MS4 pollution control programs must be reviewed by the permitting agency and were subject to public comment, in part because those permittee-prepared programs \u2014 not the general permits issued to MS4 operators \u2014 would contain the substantive requirements that operators must implement to reduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>discharges to the \u201cmaximum extent practicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 855, 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Here, the Counties must submit restoration plans derived from specified best management practices, including ponds, wetlands, infiltration practices, filtering systems, open channels, and other structural water quality practices, that were previously available for public comment. In contrast to the specific practices that form the basis of the restoration plans in the Permits, all that was available at the time of permit issuance in <em>Environmental Defense Center </em>were \u201csix <em>general </em>criteria\u201d designed to protect water quality that were never reviewed by the public. <em>Id. </em>at 845, 853 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> Consequently, the court\u2019s holding in <em>Environmental Defense Center </em>rested, at least in part, on facts that are distinguishable from the circumstances in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">4. Incorporation By Reference And Deference</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">To be sure, the Permits rely heavily on incorporation by reference. But such incorporation by reference, even of important documents, does not contravene public participation requirements because the Manual and Guidance are readily accessible to the public. <em>Cf. </em>Proposed Action on Regulations, 35:25 Md. Reg. 2193 (Dec. 5, 2008) (\u201cPursuant to State Government Article \u00a7 7-207, Annotated Code of Maryland, the 2000 Maryland Stormwater Design Manual ... has been declared a document generally available to the public and appropriate for incorporation by reference. For this reason, it will not be printed in the Maryland Register or [CO-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>MAR].\u201d).<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> Additionally, including the best management practices in the Permits would significantly lengthen the document, which would obfuscate other requirements in the Permit. The Manual has also been part of Maryland regulatory law for two decades. It is so entrenched in the permitting process that we see no reason to detail the content of the Manual in the Permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">5. Compliance Schedules</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The Water Groups further argue that MDE must formally incorporate the restoration plans through modification procedures because the plans contain compliance schedules. They allege that compliance schedules are effluent limitations under the CWA, <em>see </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(11), (17), and they must be \u201cincluded in a \u2018permit,\u2019\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.2. Ergo, MDE must formally incorporate the Counties\u2019 restoration plans \u2014 containing the compliance schedules \u2014 after the Counties submit their plans to MDE. The problem, however, is that the Water Groups do not explain why the schedules in the restoration plans constitute compliance schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The Permits state that the Counties must include in their restoration plans \u201cthe final date for meeting applicable WLAs and a detailed schedule for implementing all structural and nonstructural water quality projects, enhanced stormwater management programs, and alternative stormwater control initiatives necessary for meeting applicable WLAs.\u201d Part IV. E.2.b.i. Quite obviously, the restoration plans contain schedules. <em>Id. </em>But a schedule of compliance, which is an effluent limitation, is \u201cany restriction <em>established by a State.\u201d </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(11) (emphasis added); <em>see In re Alexandria Lake Area Sanitary Dist. NPDES/SDS Permit No. MN0040738, </em>763 N.W.2d 303, 318 (Minn.2009) (holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>even though the TMDL was not yet complete, a schedule of compliance existed where the <em>state pollution control agency required </em>a facility \u201cto meet an effluent limit set upon completion of the TMDL process\u201d). Here, however, the schedule in the restoration plan is set by the <em>Counties. </em>States are not required to set compliance schedules, 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.47, and MDE has not exercised its discretion to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">We recognize that a schedule of compliance is \u201can enforceable sequence of actions or operations leading to compliance with an effluent limitation, other limitation, prohibition, or standard.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(17). But the \u201cdetailed schedule\u201d the Counties must set is subject to change. The Counties may substitute activities where the initially scheduled projects are not making progress in achieving WLAs. Part IV.E.2.b.iv. Consequently, the County-set schedules in the restoration plans are not \u201cenforceable\u201d sequences of actions or operations. What forces the Counties to comply with the WLAs is the annual reporting requirement, which explains that \u201cBMP and program modifications shall be made within 12 months if the [Counties\u2019] annual report[s] do[ ] not ... show progress toward meeting WLAs developed under EPA approved TMDLs.\u201d Part V.A.3. As we have discussed,<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> this adaptive management approach is the true enforcement mechanism that \u201clead[s] to compliance with an effluent limitation [or] other limitation.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(17). Thus, we conclude that the nature of the schedules in the restoration plans does not require MDE to incorporate those plans into the Permits by modification.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">B. 20% Restoration Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The second key component of the Permits that the Water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Groups focus on is the 20% restoration requirement.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> This part of the Permits requires the Counties to complete restoration efforts for 20% of the Counties\u2019 impervious surface area that is not restored to the maximum extent practicable. Part III.G.2; Part IV.E.2.a. Although not required to do so, see 33 U.S.C. 1342(p), MDE decided to impose this numeric effluent limitation.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The Water Groups allege that this provision \u201cis not specific, measurable, or enforceable.\u201d Thus, they argue, MDE has created a requirement that the Water Groups cannot comment on or seek judicial review of.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Because of our earlier analysis, in part, the Water Groups\u2019 arguments are unavailing. Restoration is not \u201cundefined\u201d as the Water Groups argue because MDE anchored restoration in the universe of practices in the Manual. <em>See </em>Part III.E.1 (\u201cAt a minimum, the County shall ... [implement the storm-water management ... practices found in the [Manual]----\u201d).<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> Although the Water Groups do not know in advance which specific practices the Counties will select to restore their impervious surfaces, MDE has permitted the Counties to select from among practices that satisfied a specific performance standard, WQy. CWP &amp; MDE, Manual \u00a7 1.2 (General Performance Standards for Stormwater Management in Maryland).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Moreover, it is inaccurate for the Water Groups to allege that MDE can approve activities \u201cthat are <em>known </em>to be ineffectual without ever being required to articulate its rationale for doing so, or being held accountable.\u201d MDE articulated a response to the Water Groups\u2019 criticism of detention practices: \u201cMaryland\u2019s Manual for stormwater BMP design and MDE\u2019s approach to retrofitting under the municipal permit program are completely aligned with the National Research Council report [stating that detention ponds fail to meet the full range of urban stream and watershed restoration objectives].\u201d MDE, Basis for Final Determination to Issue NPDES Permit. MDE has responded to comments adverse to the draft permit in accordance with Maryland law and its response is adequate. <em>See </em>EN \u00a7 1-604(b) (\u201cThe Department shall prepare a final determination if\u2019 the Department received comments adverse to the tentative determination.). Thus, MDE\u2019s approach has not shielded its decision to approve the Counties\u2019 restoration efforts from comment or judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The Water Groups criticize MDE\u2019s use of the Guidance because, in their view, the Guidance provides assumptions about stormwater practices rather than an enforceable standard. According to the Water Groups, MDE could not know whether the Counties\u2019 efforts would be adequate when it issued the Permits because \u201cwhether the chosen practices actually meet these [pollution reduction] expectations depends entirely on the details of a permittee\u2019s restoration plans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">This argument, however, must fail because it overlooks the nature of the 20% restoration requirement: a surrogate. ENSR, Pilot TMDL Applications Using the Impervious Cover Method \u00a7 1.0, at 1-1 (\u201cThe IC [Impervious Cover] method uses percent impervious cover in a watershed as a surrogate TMDL target.\u201d).<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> Because the 20% restoration requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>is a surrogate for reducing pollution, MDE has logically-created an accountability system based on an assessment of compliance <em>with the surrogate, </em>not on assessment of pollution reduction in fact.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii) (This law requires \u201ccontrols to reduce the discharge of pollutants\u201d to the MEP, not \u201creductions to the MEP.\u201d); <em>EDC, </em>344 F.3d at 855 (The permitting authority must \u201creview these Minimum Measures to ensure that the measures that any given operator of a small MS4 has decided to undertake will <em>in fact </em>reduce discharges to the maximum extent practicable.\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">To ensure that the 20% requirement is met, MDE requires the Counties to translate the BMPs they implement on impervious surfaces into credits. As we previously explained, the credit system is related to the performance standard in the Manual: the WQ,. \u201cAn acre for acre impervious credit will be given when a structural BMP is specifically designed to provide treatment for the full WQv (one inch), or [a] proportional acreage of credit will be given when less than the WQv is provided.\u201d Moreover, for BMPs that \u201cprovide greater than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>one inch of volume control,\u201d the activities \u201creceive additional credit.\u201d<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> As a result, the Counties must choose the appropriate mix of BMPs to obtain enough credits to satisfy the 20% requirement. If the Counties ignore the credit system and the consequences of selecting BMPs with efficiency estimates below the WQy standard, then the Counties risk failing to fulfill the 20% restoration requirement and confronting an enforcement action by MDE.

Because we disagree with the Water Groups\u2019 arguments, the TMDL plans are not \"enforceable\u201d such that MDE has violated public participation laws.

The Water Groups mischaracterize the 20% restoration requirement as a \"plan\" and thus discuss it in the same context that they discuss how the TMDL plans violate public participation requirements. This description is inaccurate because, quite simply, there is no plan for the 20% restoration requirement. Rather, the Counties need only restore 20% of their impervious surface area within five years. Part III.G.2. Consequently, the Water Groups\u2019 argument that MDE's approval of TMDL plans constitutes a modification with respect to the 20% requirement is inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"104\">\n<p id=\"b201-8\">.
