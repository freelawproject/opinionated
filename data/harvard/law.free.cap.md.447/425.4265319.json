Both companies operate a chain of restaurants, which are respectively known as \u201cMoe\u2019s Southwest Grill\u201d and \u201cChipotle Mexican Grill.\u201d The dispute between the parties, which underlies this appeal, began in 2012, when Chipotle applied for a \u201cspecial exception\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to build a restaurant at 36 Market Space in Annapolis, Maryland, which is approximately 425 feet from Moe\u2019s South<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>west Grill at 122 Dock Street. The Department of Planning and Zoning for the City of Annapolis recommended that the City\u2019s Board of Appeals approve Chipotle\u2019s application, but Moe opposed that recommendation during Board proceedings. The Board, though, unanimously approved Chipotle\u2019s request in the Spring of 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Moe subsequently filed a petition for judicial review, pursuant to Maryland Rule 7-201 <em>et </em>seq.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> asking that the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County review the Board\u2019s decision. Chipotle then filed a Motion to Dismiss in which it argued that Moe was unable to file a petition for judicial review because its right to do business had been forfeited,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, thus, could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>\u201cmaintain\u201d suit under Section 4A-1007(a) of the Corporations and Associations Article of the Maryland Code (1975, 2007 RepLVol.).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Chipotle also argued that Moe did not have standing to pursue a petition for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision because it was not a \u201ctaxpayer\u201d and was not \u201ca person aggrieved\u201d under Section 4-401(a) of the Land Use Article, Maryland Code (2012).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Moe, in response, filed an Amended Petition for Judicial Review and attached a \u201cCertificate of Good Standing\u201d issued by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation on September 24, 2013. Moe argued that, while it was not registered to do business in Maryland when it had filed its petition, it could still \u201cmaintain\u201d the action under Section 4A-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>1007 of the Corporations and Associations Article because it had subsequently successfully registered and paid the associated penalty. Moe also argued that it did have standing, both as a taxpayer and as a person aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The Circuit Court, after a hearing, dismissed Moe\u2019s petition, reasoning that a foreign limited liability company could maintain an action as long as it \u201cc[a]me back and renew[ed]\u201d its right to do business, but found that Moe lacked standing to petition for judicial review because it was not a taxpayer and the petition was brought \u201csimply [as] a matter of competition\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANM\">[THE COURT]: The fact is that in this case, your client does not have standing. Your client is not a taxpayer within the meaning of the statute and therefore on that basis alone the Court must grant the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">You stand in the front of either one of these properties and look at the other, you will never have a direct view of it, and I don\u2019t even have to get into all of those issues that you have raised, all the other issues. The fact is they are not a taxpayer and therefore cannot maintain this action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">I do believe, however, I believe if a limited corporation does file and hasn\u2019t paid their taxes or whatever, if they come back and renew it, I believe that would restore their right to maintain the action. But in this case, it simply appears to this Court it is simply a matter of competition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">It is an argument that is not the subject for which the Court could grant on the basis of competition. So therefore the Court is going to grant the motion to dismiss the case with prejudice. I will sign an order to that effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Moe appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, conceding that it was not a \u201ctaxpayer,\u201d under Section 4-401(a) of the Land Use Article, but arguing that it still had standing to file such an action as \u201ca person aggrieved\u201d by the Board\u2019s decision under the very same statutory provision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>In a reported opinion, <em>A Guy Named Moe, LLC v. Chipotle Mexican Grill of Colorado, LLC, </em>223 Md.App. 240, 242, 115 A.3d 733, 734 (2015), the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court but disagreed with the lower court on the seminal issue of whether Moe could maintain its suit. Our intermediate appellate court concluded that, \u201cthe petition at issue was void <em>ab initio, </em>given that, at the time that it was filed, Moe\u2019s had lost its right to do business in Maryland and was nonetheless continuing to do business in Maryland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246, 115 A.3d at 736. The court reasoned that Moe\u2019s right to do business in Maryland was forfeited when it had filed its initial petition for judicial review and had not been restored until over four months after the 30-day filing period had lapsed. <em>Id. </em>at 244, 115 A.3d at 735. Thus, according to the court, Moe could not proceed with its action because \u201cit did not meet Rule 7-203(a)\u2019s 30-day deadline, as it had no right to \u2018maintain suit\u2019 under C.A. \u00a7 4A-1007(a) during the entire 30-day period and, when it re-attained that right, the thirty-day period had long since lapsed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254, 115 A.3d at 741. The court opined that, \u201cthe plain language of the statute allows a foreign LLC to \u2018cure the infirmity\u2019 of forfeiture so that it may \u2018maintain suit,\u2019 \u201d but that even after satisfying the court of its right to maintain suit it could not \u201crely on a petition it had filed with the court when it had no such right to do so\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 248, 115 A.3d at 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The Court of Special Appeals determined that \u201cthere are no Maryland appellate decisions that address the issue of a foreign LLC\u2019s standing to bring or maintain a legal action under the circumstances presented by this case\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 249, 115 A.3d at 738. The court, nonetheless, relied on <em>Price v. Upper Chesapeake Health Ventures, </em>192 Md.App. 695, 995 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>A.2d 1054 (2010), which dealt with a domestic limited liability company\u2019s ability to file and maintain suit after forfeiture:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apx\">In <em>Price, </em>members of a domestic LLC filed a derivative suit against members of the LLC\u2019s management committee, who had decided to sell substantially all of its assets, as well as against those members of the LLC who had ratified that sale. But the suit was brought nearly a year after the domestic LLC\u2019s right to do business had been forfeited. While noting that C.A. \u00a7 4A-920 does provide that \u201c[t]he forfeiture of the right to do business in Maryland and the right to the use of the name of the limited liability company does not ... prevent the limited liability company from <em>defending </em>any action, suit, or proceeding in a court of this State,\u201d we stressed that \u201c[t]he negative implication of such language, and the sweep of the \u2018doing business\u2019 and name \u2018using\u2019 prohibition is that the company may not <em>file or maintain </em>a lawsuit after its rights have been forfeited.\u201d That reasoning and, more specifically, that \u201cnegative implication\u201d is applicable to foreign LLCs, like Moe\u2019s, as well. Like C.A. \u00a7 4A-920, the statute governing domestic LLCs, C.A. \u00a7 4A-1007(b), the statute governing foreign LLCs, provides: \u201cThe failure of a foreign limited liability company to register in this State does not impair the validity of a contract or act of the foreign limited liability company or prevent the foreign limited liability company from <em>defending </em>any action, suit, or proceeding in a court of this State.\u201d Then, significantly, the foreign LLC subtitle goes one step further and includes a statutory provision, C.A. \u00a7 4A-1007(a), that expressly bars a foreign LLC from maintaining suit when it is doing business in Maryland without a right to do so. Thus the reasoning in Price clearly applies to the instant case: If a domestic LLC cannot, by \u201cnegative implication,\u201d file or maintain suit, then surely a foreign LLC containing an express bar to such legal action cannot file or maintain suit, or its legal equivalent, a petition for judicial review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 249-50,115 A.3d at 738-39 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original). The court concluded that, \u201ca foreign LLC, like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Moe\u2019s, that had its right to do business in Maryland forfeited but nonetheless continued to do business in this State, in violation of Maryland law, cannot maintain a suit in Maryland. And, if it files a petition for judicial review during that time, that action is void <em>ab initio.\u201d Id. </em>at 253-54, 115 A.3d at 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">The court also found helpful \u201ccases involving the legal effects of the loss of a corporate charter, by forfeiture, upon a corporation.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals concluded that \u201cneither a corporation nor, by implication, an LLC like Moe\u2019s may revive a suit that, though timely filed, was initiated by such an entity, after it had lost the right to do business in Maryland and yet persisted in doing business in this State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253, 115 A.3d at 741. The court reasoned that since a domestic limited liability company or corporation, under Maryland law, could not revive a suit filed after forfeiture, then neither could a foreign limited liability company. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The Court of Special Appeals also addressed whether Moe was a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d by the Board\u2019s decision to grant Chipotle\u2019s special exception. Our intermediate appellate court declared that, \u201cthe circuit court, in effect, appeared to make a finding as to whether Moe\u2019s qualified as \u2018a person aggrieved\u2019 when it opined, in its oral decision, that Moe\u2019s action against Chipotle was brought simply as a \u2018matter of competition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254, 115 A.3d at 742. The court concluded that, \u201ca person is not \u2018aggrieved\u2019 for standing purposes when his sole interest in challenging a zoning decision is to stave off competition with his established business.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Superior Outdoor Signs, Inc. v. Eller Media Co., </em>150 Md.App. 479, 500, 822 A.2d 478, 478 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">We shall affirm, but we disagree with the Court of Special Appeals in its holding that a foreign limited liability company cannot file a petition for judicial review and subsequently \u201ccure\u201d a forfeiture of its registration to do business in Maryland that occurred prior to the filing of its action; we agree with the intermediate appellate court\u2019s decision, however, because Moe was not aggrieved for standing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>It is undisputed that prior to filing suit, Moe\u2019s right to do business in Maryland was forfeited by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation pursuant to Section 4A-1013(a) of the Corporations and Associations Article, Maryland Code (1975, 2007 Repl.Vol.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\">The Department may forfeit the right of any foreign limited liability company to do business in this State if the limited liability company fails to file with the Department any report or fails to pay any late filing penalties required by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Upon forfeiture of the right to do business a foreign limited liability company is treated as if it never registered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">On forfeiture of its right to do business in this State, the foreign limited liability company is subject to the same rules, legal provisions, and sanctions as if it had never qualified or been licensed to do business in this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX\">Maryland Code (1975, 2007 Repl.Vol.), Section 4A-1013(d) of the Corporations and Associations Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Under Section 4A-1009(a)(1) of the Corporations and Associations Article Maryland Code (1975, 2007 Repl.Vol.), \u201cdoing business,\u201d however, does not include \u201cmaintaining suit\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">In addition to any other activities which may not constitute doing business in this State, for the purposes of this title, the following activities of a foreign limited liability company do not constitute doing business in this State: (1) Maintaining, defending, or settling an action, suit, claim, dispute, or administrative or arbitration proceeding^]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">\u201cUnless the [foreign] limited liability company shows to the satisfaction of the court\u201d that it has paid a penalty for noncompliance and complied with the registration requirements, it cannot \u201cmaintain\u201d suit, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">If a foreign limited liability company is doing or has done any intrastate, interstate, or foreign business in this State without complying with the requirements of this subtitle, the foreign limited liability company and any person claiming under it may not maintain suit in any court of this State, unless the limited liability company shows to the satisfaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>of the court that: (1) The foreign limited liability company or the person claiming under it has paid the penalty specified in subsection (d)(1) of this section;[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] and (2)(i) The foreign limited, liability company or a successor to it has complied with the requirements of this title; or (ii) The foreign limited liability company and any foreign limited liability company successor to it are no longer doing intrastate, interstate, or foreign business in this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Maryland Code (1975, 2007 Repl.Vol.), Section 4A-1007(a) of the Corporations and Associations Article,</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The issue, thus, is queued up: If a foreign limited liability company had filed a judicial review action after it had forfeited its right to do business, could it then \u201cmaintain\u201d the suit, after it cured the infirmity? The Circuit Court answered in the affirmative; the Court of Special Appeals determined that the suit was void <em>ab initio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Moe argues that the prohibition on <em>maintaining </em>suit does not prohibit it from <em>filing </em>suit and that its subsequent registration efforts would allow the suit to continue. Moe asserts that, not only is such an interpretation of \u201cmaintain\u201d warranted by a plain meaning interpretation, but also that we concluded as much in <em>Kendrick &amp; Roberts v. Warren Bros. Co., </em>110 Md. 47, 72 A. 461, 463 (1909). Chipotle argues that the prohibition on \u201cmaintaining\u201d suit includes a prohibition on commencing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">The statute does not answer the question, but embraces an ambiguity that has permitted the two varying interpretations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>developed by the Circuit Court and our intermediate appellate court. Section 4A-1007(a) of the Corporations and Associations Article admonishes that a foreign limited liability company \u201cmay not maintain suit in any court of this State\u201d if it is noncompliant, but this prohibition is subject to the proviso, \u201c[u]nless the [foreign] limited liability company shows to the satisfaction of the court\u201d that it has paid a penalty for noncompliance and complied with the registration requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">\u201cMaintain,\u201d used in Section 4A-1007(a), means \u201cto continue\u201d something already in existence, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1097 (10th ed.2014), and coupled with \u201cunless the limited liability company shows to the satisfaction of the court,\u201d indicates that the Legislature intended to permit a noncompliant foreign limited liability to \u201ccure\u201d its failure to comply with registration requirements, even though having failed to register before filing suit. The history of Section 4A-1007(a) after our decision in <em>Kendrick, </em>110 Md. at 47, 72 A. at 461, and the <em>Kendrick </em>case itself, as well as out of state cases interpreting the words \u201cmaintain\u201d and \u201cunless\u201d or \u201cuntil\u201d in similar statutes support this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In <em>Kendrick </em>we analyzed an iteration of our foreign corporation statute, enacted in Section 109(d) of Chapter 270 of the Maryland Laws of 1898 and codified in Section 140 of Article 28 of the Code of Public General Laws of 1904, which stated that, \u201cNo such foreign corporation shall be permitted to maintain any action, either at law or equity, in the courts of this state, until the provisions of this Act shall have been complied with\u201d. 110 Md. at 70, 72 A. at 464. In the case, Kendrick <em>&amp; </em>Roberts Inc., a West Virginia corporation, had sued Warren Bros. Co., which in response stated that, \u201cat the time of the institution of this suit in this Court the said foreign corporation had not filed in the office of the Secretary of the State of Maryland\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 67, 72 A. at 462. Kendrick <em>&amp; </em>Roberts Inc. alleged, thereafter \u201cby way of replication,\u201d that two months after filing suit, \u201cthe plaintiff fully complied with all the requirements of the law of the state of Maryland relating to foreign corporations\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 68, 72 A. at 463. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>trial court allowed the action to proceed, and Kendrick &amp; Roberts Inc. prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">We affirmed and held that, \u201cThe statute does not forbid the institution or bringing of the action, but prevents the maintaining of such action until the provisions of the law shall have been complied with.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 72 A. at 464. We recognized that, \u201cThe meaning of the word \u2018maintain\u2019 has been defined \u2018in pleading, to support what has already been brought into existence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded that, \u201comission on the part of the plaintiff does not operate to end a suit otherwise regularly instituted, or to destroy a right in other respects validly existing, and the greatest effect ... would be to suspend the prosecution of such suit until compliance was had with statute.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Wetzel &amp; T. Ry. Co. v. Tennis Bros. Co., </em>145 F. 458, 464 (4th Cir.1906).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The subsequent history of Section 140 of Article 23 reveals that the Legislature retained the \u201cmaintain\u201d language in every iteration of the foreign corporation statute to permit a non-compliant foreign corporation to come into compliance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>statute has been amended on several occasions since it was interpreted in <em>Kendrick, </em>and the General Assembly has not changed the statute so as to modify the <em>Kendrick </em>interpretation. It is then presumed that the Legislature has acquiesced in the interpretation given in <em>Kendrick. Forbes v. State, </em>324 Md. 335, 342, 597 A.2d 427, 431 (1991). While the word \u201cuntil\u201d was replaced with \u201cunless\u201d during the enactment of the Corporations and Associations Article by Chapter 311 of the Maryland Laws of 1975, the revisers indicated that \u201cno substantive changes [we]re made\u201d by the amendment. Governor\u2019s Commission to Revise the Annotated Code, Commission Report No. 1975-2: Revised Article on Corporations and Associations [S.B. 330] 47 (1975) (\u201cSubtitle 3 [of Title 7\u2014 Foreign Corporations] is composed of five sections relating to sanctions and penalties; no substantive changes are made.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Both the foreign corporation statute and the statute governing foreign limited liability companies embody identical \u201cmay not maintain suit\u201d language that we interpreted in <em>Kendrick. </em>Maryland Code (1975, 2007 Repl.Vol.), Sections 4A-1007(a) and 7-301 of the Corporations and Associations Article. Foreign limited liability companies and foreign corporations also suffer identical consequences upon failure \u201cto file with the Department any report or failure] to pay any late filing penalties required by law\u201d such that the Department of Assessments and Taxation may forfeit the entities\u2019s right \u201cto do business in this State\u201d. Maryland Code (1975, 2007 Repl.Vol.), Sections 4A-1013(a) and 7-304(a) of the Corporations and Associations Article. Upon forfeiture of the right to do business, a foreign limited liability company and a foreign corporation are \u201csubject to the same rules, legal provisions, and sanctions as if [they] had never qualified or been licensed to do business in this State.\u201d Maryland Code (1975, 2007 Repl. Vol.), Sections 4A-1013(d) and 7-304(d) of the Corporations and Associations Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Our analysis that a foreign limited liability company may cure the infirmity of failure to register from the time of filing suit also finds support in our sister jurisdictions interpreting the words \u201cmaintain\u201d and \u201cunless\u201d or \u201cuntil\u201d in statutes similar to ours.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">In <em>Nolte v. MT Tech. Enterprises, LLC, </em>284 Va. 80, 726 S.E.2d 339, 345 (2012), MT filed suit when it was not registered to transact business in Virginia. Under the Virginia Code \u00a7 13.1-1057(A) \u201c[a] foreign limited liability company transacting business in the Commonwealth may not <em>maintain </em>any action, suit, or proceeding in any court of the Commonwealth until it has registered in the Commonwealth.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). While MT was not registered when it initiated suit, it registered \u201cbefore the trial court entered its final order\u201d granting judgment in its favor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed and concluded that MT could maintain its suit after registering. The court interpreted the statutory language in Virginia Code \u00a7 13.1-1057(A) of \u201cmaintain\u201d as \u201c \u2018to continue (something),\u2019 not to start or commence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1039 (9th ed.2009). The court also relied on its prior interpretation of a similar statute applicable to foreign corporations where the court had determined that, \u201c[i]t is <em>not the right to begin the action, but the right to maintain it, </em>that is withheld for failure to comply with its terms. It takes no right away from the offending party after compliance.

The court reasoned that, \u201c[t]he statute at issue in <em>Phlegar </em>contained language similar to the language in Code \u00a7 13.1-1057(A)\u201d and that the foreign corporation statute at issue in <em>Phlegar </em>stated in relevant part that, \u201c \u2018no action shall be <em>maintained </em>in any of the courts in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>State by any such person, firm or corporation ... until the certificate required by this act has been filed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">A similar result was reached by the Delaware Supreme Court in interpreting its foreign corporation statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>Hudson Farms, Inc. v.

McGrellis filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that Hudson Farms was a foreign corporation not licensed to do business in Delaware, and was, therefore, barred from initiating the action. The trial court determined that Hudson Farms was not licensed at the time it filed the action and dismissed the action without prejudice, although, \u201cthe practical effect of the [trial court\u2019s] ruling was to defeat Hudson Farms\u2019 cause of action because the period for filing a mechanic\u2019s lien had expired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217. Hudson Farms, in a motion for reargument, asserted that, between McGrellis\u2019s filing of the motion for summary judgment and the date of the hearing on the motion, it had properly registered to do business in Delaware. The trial court denied reargument, \u201cruling, in effect, the Hudson Farms registration efforts were unavailing since its nonregistered status at the time of filing suit was an uneorrectable defect.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>The Supreme Court of Delaware reversed.

The Delaware court recognized that in states with similar statutes, \u201cCourts which have considered the \u201cmaintaining\u201d language of foreign corporation statutes appear to have adopted a liberal stance in construing the term\u201d and \u201callowed a non-qualified foreign corporation to file suit and thereafter obtain the required authorization.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220, citing <em>Oxford Paper Co. v. S.M. Liquidation Co., </em>45 Misc.2d 612, 257 N.Y.S.2d 395 (Sup.Ct. N.Y.1965). The court concluded that, \u201cThe majority of courts would permit a non-qualified foreign corporation to achieve registration during the pendency of the proceeding, notwithstanding the lack of such status when the litigation was commenced and regardless of whether the applicable registration statute contains the term \u2018unless\u2019 or \u2018unless and until.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The court determined that Delaware\u2019s statute as well as those in other states was similar to Section 117 of the Model Business Corporation Act (1960), which stated, in part, that \u201c[n]o foreign corporation transacting business in this State without a certificate of authority shall be permitted to maintain any action, suit or proceeding in any court of this State, until such corporation shall have obtained a certificate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>authority.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 218. The court reasoned that, \u201cIt is not unreasonable to assume, as most courts do, that the word \u201cuntil,\u201d as used in \u00a7 117, provides an inference that a proceeding may be stayed until compliance occurs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218-19.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See also Empire Excavating Co. v.

Tahoe Reg\u2019l Planning Agency, </em>93 Nev. 270, 563 P.2d 582, 583 (1977), for example, the League to Save Lake Tahoe was a foreign corporation not qualified to do business in Nevada when it filed an action against Tahoe Regional Planning Agency. During the pendency of the suit, The League \u201cqualified to do business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court, nevertheless, dismissed the action with prejudice reasoning that Nevada Revised Statute (\u201cNRS\u201d) 80.210 which provided that, \u201ca foreign corporation \u2018... shall not be allowed to commence,[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] maintain, or defend any action or proceeding in any court of this state until it shall have fully complied with the provisions of NRS 80.010 to 80.040, inclusive\u2019 \u201d mandated dismissal since The League had not qualified to do business when the suit was commenced. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">The Supreme Court of Nevada affirmed and concluded that, \u201c[\u00a1Institution of suit before compliance with filing requirements does not toll the statute of limitations, nor does later compliance operate retroactively to permit continuation of the action if the statute of limitations had run between filing of the suit and such compliance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585. The court stated that \u201cThe League to Save Lake Tahoe lacked capacity to commence this action. We must decide whether the statute, NRS 80.210, allows curative efforts to revive initial lack of capacity to sue\u2014 Case authority elsewhere is split and not particularly helpful since statutory language differs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583-84. The court reasoned that \u201cthe word \u2018maintain\u2019 was meant to apply to a case commenced by a corporation which had qualified to do business here but which subsequently became unqualified because of failure to comply with continuing statutory requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number><em>The League to Save Lake Tahoe </em>was expressly overruled, however, in <em>Executive Mgmt., Ltd. v.

In the case, Executive, a foreign corporation in Nevada, had its certificate to do business revoked prior to the time it filed suit against Ticor Title in Nevada, and Ticor argued that Executive\u2019s action should be dismissed. Executive subsequently renewed its qualification, but the trial court dismissed Executive\u2019s suit with prejudice, because the statute of limitations had run. <em>Id. </em>at 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The Supreme Court of Nevada reversed and concluded that \u201cNRS 80.210 is susceptible to a different construction than the construction that <em>League to Save Lake Tahoe </em>relied on.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 875. The court reasoned that \u201cmaintain\u201d could be interpreted to mean \u201ccarry on\u201d or \u201ccontinue\u201d and \u201cimplies] that the foreign corporation should not be allowed to proceed with its action \u2018until it has fully complied with the\u2019 qualification requirements after its failure to comply has been discovered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court determined that, \u201cThe majority of states follow this more forgiving approach \u2014 rather than dismiss an action filed by an unqualified foreign corporation outright, most states with statutes similar to Nevada\u2019s simply stay the action until the corporation qualifies.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we shall hold that a foreign limited liability company can \u201ccure\u201d its failure to comply with registration requirements and continue its suit even though not registered at the time of filing suit. What was true in <em>Kendrick, </em>110 Md. at 47, 72 A. at 464, remains true today with respect to a foreign limited liability company: \u201comission on the part of the plaintiff does not operate to end a suit otherwise regularly instituted\u201d. Thus, once a foreign limited liability company comes into compliance with the statute, it may maintain its action even though not registered when initiating the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Chipotle, though, argues that the result reached by our brethren on the Court of Special Appeals is more appropriate. Unlike our intermediate appellate court we, however, rely on an interpretation of \u201cmaintain\u201d and \u201cunless\u201d in Section 4A-1007(a) as well as <em>Kendrick </em>and related out of state cases, while the Court of Special Appeals relied upon <em>Price v. Upper Chesapeake Health Ventures, </em>192 Md.App. 695, 697, 995 A.2d 1054, 1055 (2010), which we find to be inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">In <em>Price, </em>members of The Surgery Pavilion, LLC, a domestic limited liability company whose right to do business and use its name had been forfeited,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> sought to bring a derivative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>action on behalf of the LLC after management approved the sale of substantially all of its assets. The circuit court dismissed the suit, determining that the members could not bring a derivative suit on behalf of the LLC. <em>Id. </em>at 702, 995 A.2d at 1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the dismissal. The court relied primarily on two statutory sections that address a domestic limited liability company\u2019s abilities following forfeiture: Sections 4A-911(d) and 4A-920 of the Corporations and Associations Article. Section 4A-911(d) stated that, after forfeiture, a domestic limited liability company loses \u201cthe right to do business in Maryland and the right to the use of [its] name\u201d while Section 4A-920 provided that, \u201cforfeiture of the right to do business in Maryland and the right to the use of the name of the limited liability company under this title does not ... prevent the limited liability company from defending any action, suit, or proceeding in a court of this State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 703-05, 995 A.2d at 1058-60. Interpreting the \u201csavings clause\u201d permitting the domestic limited liability company to defend a suit, the Court of Special Appeals rejected the notion that defending a suit includes filing an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Chipotle and the Court of Special Appeals relied on <em>Price, </em>obviously, because Moe, like Surgery Pavilion LLC, lost its right to do business, albeit not its name. <em>Price </em>is inapposite, however, because a foreign limited liability company is offered the opportunity after forfeiture to \u201cmaintain suit,\u201d as well as defend an action.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Maryland Code (1975, 2007 Repl.Vol.), Section 4A-1007 of the Corporations and Associations Article. The inclusion of the language \u201cmaintain\u201d makes all the difference in the world as explained in <em>Kendrick, </em>a part of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>jurisprudence not cited to the Court of Special Appeals by Moe, and bulwarked by our sister states interpreting the same language.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Chipotle, however, argues that Moe\u2019s subsequent compliance with the statutory registration requirement \u201ccannot be given retroactive effect\u201d under Rule 7-203(a), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap3\">Except as otherwise provided in this Rule or by statute, a petition for judicial review shall be filed within 30 days after the latest of: (1) the date of the order or action of which review is sought; (2) the date the administrative agency sent notice of the order or action to the petitioner, if notice was required by law to be sent to the petitioner; or (3) the date the petitioner received notice of the agency\u2019s order or action, if notice was required by law to be received by the petitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In essence, Chipotle argues that Rule 7-203 creates a statute of limitations that was not observed when registration was \u201ccured\u201d outside of the thirty days.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In the present ease, Moe could file suit without having registered once Moe cured its infirmity during the pendency of the action. Clearly, in so holding we recognize that the thirty day dictates of Rule 7-203 have been met as a result of Moe\u2019s registration during the pendency of the suit based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>those out-of-state cases upon which we have relied; some permitted curing of registration requirement infirmities to permit maintenance of suit even when the statute of limitations had run at the time of curing.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Hudson, </em>620 A.2d at 217; <em>Executive Mgmt., </em>38 P.3d at 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Although we hold that Moe could file its petition for judicial review and then register in order to maintain its action, Moe was not a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d and thus did not have standing under Section 4-401 of the Land Use Article, Maryland Code (2012), to file a request for judicial review of the decision of the board of appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">(a) Any of the following persons may file a request for judicial review of a decision of a board of appeals or a zoning action of a legislative body by the circuit court of the county: (1) a person aggrieved by the decision or action; (2) a taxpayer; or (3) an officer or unit of the local jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4V\">Chipotle did not raise the issue of standing before us, conceivably because the issue was decided in its favor in the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals. Rather than remand to the Circuit Court to once again decide the issue of Moe\u2019s standing and then encounter further proceedings, however, we rely upon the language of Maryland Rule 8-131(a), which provides that, \u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.\u201d <em>Lizzi v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., </em>384 Md. 199, 206, 862 A.2d 1017, 1022 (2004) (The Court may decide an issue not raised by petition or cross-petition when the issue \u201cwas raised in and has been fully determined by the trial court.\u201d). We avoid the expense and delay of another appeal because we hold that Moe was not a \u201cperson aggrieved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The issue of whether Moe was a person aggrieved by Chipotle\u2019s special exception was raised for the first time in the Circuit Court when Chipotle filed a Motion to Dismiss challenging Moe\u2019s standing to file a judicial review action. After a hearing on the Motion, the Circuit Court Judge dismissed the action finding Moe\u2019s arguments concerning increased traffic unavailing saying, \u201cYou stand in the front of either one of these properties and look at the other, you will never have a direct view of it ... in this case, it is simply a matter of competition. It is an argument that is not the subject for which the Court could grant on the basis of competition. So therefore the Court is going to grant the motion to dismiss the case with prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">To be a person aggrieved, \u201c[t]he decision must not only affect a matter in which the protestant has a specific interest or property right but his interest therein must be such that he is personally and specially affected in a way different from that suffered by the public generally.\u201d <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery County Board of Appeals, </em>247 Md. 137, 144, 230 A.2d 289, 294 (1967). \u201cAn adjoining, confronting or nearby property owner is deemed, <em>prima facie, </em>to be specially damaged and, therefore, a person aggrieved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 230 A.2d at 294. \u201cA protestant is specially aggrieved when she is farther away than an adjoining, confronting, or nearby property owner, but is still close enough to the site of the rezoning action to be considered almost <em>prima facie </em>aggrieved, and offers \u2018plus factors\u2019 supporting injury.\u201d <em>Ray v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>430 Md. 74, 85, 59 A.3d 545, 551-52 (2013). In <em>Ray </em>we succinctly summarized that proximity is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>the most important factor and beyond that, special aggrievement must be shown:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">A review of our cases, where standing to challenge a rezoning action was at issue, reveals one critical point: proximity is the most important factor to be considered. The relevance and import of other facts tending to show aggrievement depends on how close the affected property is to the re-zoned property. There is, however, no bright-line rule for exactly how close a property must be in order to show special aggrievement. Instead, this Court has maintained a flexible standard, finding standing in cases that do not quite satisfy the \u201cadjoining, confronting or nearby\u201d standard of <em>prima facie </em>aggrievement, but are nudging up against that line. Protestants in such cases will be considered to pass the standing threshold if they allege specific facts of their injury. In other words, once sufficient proximity is shown, some typical allegations of harm acquire legal significance that would otherwise be discounted. But in the absence of proximity, much more is needed. For example, an owner\u2019s lay opinion of decreasing property values and increasing traffic has been considered sufficient for special aggrievement when combined with proximity that is almost as great as in cases where properties are \u201cadjoining, confronting or nearby.\u201d Conversely, without sufficient proximity, similar facts will only support general aggrievement. For example, when the affected properties are not sufficiently close to the site to qualify as almost <em>prima facie </em>aggrieved, claims of increasing traffic, change in the character of the neighborhood, lay opinion projecting a decrease in property values, and limited visibility have been held to show only general aggrievement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 82-85, 59 A.3d at 550-52 (internal footnotes and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Moe lacks the sufficient proximity and \u201cplus factors\u201d identified in <em>Ray </em>needed to demonstrate aggrievement. The Circuit Court determined that Moe\u2019s property was not within direct view of Chipotle\u2019s. Additionally, the issue of traffic is not dispositive because \u201cthere is an overwhelming weight of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>authority that claims of increased, traffic, by protestants who lack close proximity, are insufficient to prove special aggrievement.\u201d <em>Ray, </em>430 Md. at 96, 59 A.3d 545. The motivator driving Moe to protest the rezoning was, as found by the Circuit Court Judge, \u201csimply a matter of competition.\u201d It is clear, however, that, \u201ca person is not \u2018aggrieved\u2019 for standing purposes when his sole interest in challenging a zoning decision is to stave off competition with his established business.\u201d <em>Superior Outdoor Signs, Inc., </em>150 Md.App. at 500, 822 A.2d at 490, citing <em>Kreatchman v.

The statute was amended by the enactment of Section 69 of Chapter 240 of the Maryland Laws of 1908 to state that: \u201cfailure shall not affect the validity of any contract made with such non-complying corporation, but no suit shall be maintained in any of the courts of this state, by any such corporation until it has complied with the requirements of this article.\u201d. A new corporation statute was enacted in 1937 in Chapter 504 of the Maryland Laws. The preamble to Chapter 504 of the Maryland Laws of 1937, entitled \"AN ACT to alter and amend the laws relating to corporations, associations and joint stock companies\u201d states that, \"the provisions of this Act, so far as they are substantially the same as existing statutes, shall be construed as continuations thereof, and as intended to make no substantive change in existing laws, except in so far as such change shall clearly manifest\u201d. Again a new corporation statute was enacted by Chapter 135 of the Maryland Laws of 1951, which was a complete revision of Sections 1 \u2014 135 of Article 23 of the Maryland Code (1939). The Commission tasked with revising Maryland\u2019s corporate laws, stated that \"provisions of [the foreign corporations] subtitle are substantially the same as the present Sections 117 to 122, inclusive, of Article 23.\u201d Final Report of the Commission on Revision of the General Corporation Laws of Maryland December 1, 1950 at 86. By Chapter 311 of the Maryland Laws of 1975, provisions in Article 23, including the prohibition on maintaining suit, were recodified into the modem Corporations and Associations Article, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>the language enacted in 1975 remains that which exists today in Section 7-301 of the Corporations and Associations Article.

The Delaware court also noted that the statute related to foreign corporations had a revenue enhancing purpose in the payment of <em>\"all fees, penalties and franchise taxes </em>for the years or parts thereof during which it did business\u201d in Delaware without authority. <em>Hudson Farms, </em>620 A.2d at 221. Our statute also has a revenue enhancing purpose. The statute requires that a penalty be paid in order to maintain suit and that the penalty be collected as a penalty under the Tax-Property Article: \"(i) If a foreign limited liability company does any intrastate, interstate, or foreign business in this State without registering, the Department shall impose a penalty of $200 on the limited liability company, (ii) The penalty under this subsection shall be collected and may be reduced or abated under \u00a7 14-704 of the Tax-Property Article.\u201d Maryland Code (1975, 2007 Repl.Vol.), Section 4A-1007(d)(1) of the Corporations and Associations Article. Additionally, registration with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation helps facilitate the collection of taxes. Thus, dismissal of the action would undermine the incentive to pay the penalty and register. <em>See also Empire Excavating Co. v. Maret Dev.

Chipotle cites <em>Amalgamated Zinc &amp; Lead Co. v. Bay State Zinc Mining Co., </em>221 Mo. 7, 120 S.W. 31, 33 (1909), in which the Supreme Court of Missouri interpreted Missouri Revised Statutes of 1899, Section 1026, which stated that, \"* * * no foreign corporation as above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>defined, which shall fail to comply with this act, can maintain any suit or action, either legal or equitable, in any of the courts of this state, upon any demand, whether arising out of contract or tort; * * <em>Salitan v. Carter, Ealey &amp; Dinwiddie, </em>332 S.W.2d 11, 13 (Mo.Ct.App. 1960). In 1943 the Legislature amended the statute to read: \" * * * No foreign corporation, failing to comply with this act, can maintain any suit or action, either legal or equitable, in any of the courts of this state, upon any demand, whether arising out of the contract or tort, <em>while the requirements of this Act have not been complied with.\u201d Id. </em>at 14 (emphasis in original). Interpreting the more modem statute in <em>Salitan, </em>332 S.W.2d at 15, the Missouri Court of Appeals determined that a foreign corporation could cure an infirmity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\">In the 1943 amendment there is no absolute prohibition of the enforcement of the contract by action in any Missouri court. Rather, there is a prohibition of such enforcement only 'while' the chapter is not complied with. To our minds this plainly means that the prohibition exists and applies only so long as the statute has not been complied with and that thereafter the bar on the maintenance of a suit or action is removed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Chipotle also cites <em>Parker v. Lin-Co Producing Co., </em>197 So.2d 228, 230 (Miss. 1967), in which the Supreme Court of Mississippi interpreted a statute that stated that, \"No foreign corporation transacting business in this state without a certificate of authority shall be permitted to maintain any action, suit or proceeding in any court of this state.\u201d This statutory language was later revised to conform with Maryland statutory provisions and required the opposite result thereafter as explained in <em>Cuba Timber Co. v. Boswell, </em>339 F.Supp.2d 773, 775-76 (S.D.Miss, 2004):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">[T]he current version of the statute is quite different from the version in effect at the time <em>Parker </em>was decided and which was considered by the court in <em>Parker. </em>Previously, the door-closing statute provided, \"No foreign corporation transacting business in this state without a certificate of authority shall be permitted to maintain any action, suit or proceeding in any court of this state.\u201d In sharp contrast, though, and as observed <em>supra, </em>the current version, which became effective January 1, 1988, prohibits a foreign corporation transacting business in Mississippi without a certificate of authority from maintaining a proceeding in the courts of the statute only \"until it obtains a certificate of authority____\u201d In light of these changes to the statute, the state court\u2019s reliance on <em>Parker </em>was not well placed and its conclusion that the door-closing statute barred the cross-claim was not well grounded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">(internal footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">In <em>P.K. Springfield, Inc. v.

We note that the use of the word \"commence\u201d in the Nevada statute differentiates it from statutes in other jurisdictions. Even if <em>League to Save Lake Tahoe </em>was not subsequently overruled, this difference could be dispositive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b472-6\">. The Nevada Court also noted that the statute \"sets forth its own penalties and enforcement procedures, utilizing district attorneys and the attorney general under the governor's direction to enforce the qualification requirements \u2014 the judiciary need not impose penalties beyond those provided.\" <em>Executive Mgmt., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Ticor Title Ins. Co., </em>118 Nev. 46, 38 P.3d 872, 876 (2002). Like Nevada\u2019s statute, Maryland law provides penalties and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that a foreign limited liability company complies with qualification requirements. Section 4A-1007(d)(1) of the Corporations and Associations Article, Maryland Code (1975, 2007 Repl. Vol.) provides that, \"(i) If a foreign limited liability company does any intrastate, interstate, or foreign business in this State without registering, the Department shall impose a penalty of $200 on the limited liability company.\u201d A foreign limited liability company\u2019s members would also be incentivized as members and agents of a foreign limited liability company that do business without qualification are subject to a misdemeanor and fine: \"Each member of a foreign limited liability company that does intrastate, interstate, or foreign business in this State without registering, and each agent ... is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to a fine of not more than $1,000.\" Maryland Code (1975, 2007 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Repl.Vol.), Section 4A-1007(d)(2) of the Corporations and Associations Article. Section 4A-1008 of the Corporations and Associations Article provides that, \"The Attorney General may bring an action to restrain a foreign limited liability company from doing business in this State in violation of this title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">The Nevada Court also reasoned that, \"the determination of whether a foreign corporation is actually \u2018doing business' in this state and therefore required to qualify involves a fact-intensive and often nebulous inquiry, and thus, the failure to qualify can be the result of a \u2018bona fide disagreement\u2019 \u201d. <em>Executive Mgmt., </em>38 P.3d at 876. Under Maryland law, whether a foreign limited liability company is \u201cdoing business\u201d and must register may also not always be clear: \" \u2018doing business\u2019 depends upon the facts of each individual case, and rests not on a single factor, but rather on the nature and extent of the business and activities which occur in the forum state.\u201d <em>Tiller Const.

We recognize that the court in <em>Price </em>relied on the rule of strict construction for \"savings clauses,\u201d or a \"statutory provision exempting from coverage something that would otherwise be included.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed.2014). Generally, savings clauses are strictly construed when the statute is unclear. We, however, in <em>Kendrick </em>declared the foreign limited liability savings clause to be clear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\">. Chipotle also urges us to consider Section 4A-1001(b) of the Corporations and Associations Article, which prohibits a foreign limited liability company from doing \"any kind of intrastate, interstate, or foreign business in this State which the laws of this State prohibit a domestic limited liability company from doing.\u201d Chipotle argues that allowing a forfeited foreign limited liability company to file suit when a forfeited domestic limited liability company could not would be contrary to the limitation on \"doing business.\u201d Chipotle\u2019s interpretation of Section 4A-1001(b) is untenable. Section 4A-1009 of the Corporations and Associations Article makes clear that \"maintaining suit\u201d is not included in the definition of \"doing business.\u201d Prohibiting a foreign limited liability corporation from filing suit while not registered would also render meaningless the exception allowing it to \"maintain suit\u201d contained in Section 4A-1007(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\">.

Section 902(b) states that <em>\u201cA </em>foreign limited liability company doing business in this state may not maintain an action or proceeding in this state unless it is registered to do business in this state.\u201d The comment accompanying Section 902(b) merely states that, \u201cif a court dismisse[d] a case under this subsection rather than staying the proceedings pending the foreign LLC's registration, a statute of limitations problem may occur.\u201d The Comment cites to <em>Corco, Inc. v. Ledar Transp., Inc., </em>24 Kan.App.2d 377, 946 P.2d 1009 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">In <em>Coreo, </em>Ledar was a foreign corporation not registered to do business in Kansas and, as a result, \"[t]he trial court dismissed Ledar\u2019s counterclaim with prejudice based on Ledar's failure to register as a foreign corporation\u201d because Ledar \"never fully complied with the statute\u201d. 946 P.2d at 1009-10.
