In early 2013, a deputy assigned to a local high school came into possession of an anonymous letter that raised concerns about the relationship between Quentin and Petitioner. At this time, Quentin was nineteen years old. The letter was turned over to Detective Casey Nogle of the Washington County Sheriffs Office. Detective Nogle initiated an investigation and interviewed Quentin. That conversation prompted further concerns. Detective Nogle called Petitioner, and requested she come to the Sheriffs Office for an interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">On February 6, 2013, Detectives Nogle and Jared Barnhart interviewed Petitioner. The session was audio and video recorded. When Detective Nogle showed Petitioner the anonymous letter, she immediately confessed that she did not know the paternity of her two year old son, Logan. Petitioner admitted that she had had a sexual relationship with her stepson, which began shortly after he moved in when he was sixteen years old, and that the relationship ended a couple months prior to the interview. As a result of that relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>ship, Petitioner stated that she was unsure of the paternity of her two youngest children, but that she suspected Quentin was Logan\u2019s father. Petitioner further confessed that she had sexual intercourse five to ten times with her stepson. The detectives provided Petitioner with several pages of Facebook communications between Quentin and \u201cFaith Evans.\u201d When asked whether Petitioner was Faith Evans, she responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The Circuit Court for Washington County (\u201cCircuit Court\u201d) returned an indictment against Petitioner charging her with, among other things, three counts of sexual abuse of a minor pursuant to Md.Code (2002, 2012 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-602 of the Criminal Law Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At trial, the State offered into evidence the testimony of Detective Nogle and Quentin as witnesses, and Petitioner\u2019s recorded confession. Detective Nogle discussed his investigatory process, which resulted in Petitioner\u2019s confession on the day of the interview. The State immunized Quentin and obtained a court order compelling him to testify in the State\u2019s case. On direct examination, Quentin answered a few preliminary questions, but when asked about pertinent details of the investigation, including whether he had ever had a sexual relationship with Petitioner, he responded that he did not recall the details or events. Defense Counsel elected not to cross-examine Quentin. When the State rested its case in chief, Defense Counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal. The Circuit Court denied Petitioner\u2019s motion. The Defense Counsel rested, and, at the end of the introduction of all the evidence, renewed the motion for a judgment of acquittal. The motion was again denied, and, after closing arguments, jury deliberations began. Petitioner was convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>two of the three counts of sexual abuse of a minor. Petitioner appealed to the intermediate appellate court. In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the convictions. We granted Petitioner\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. <em>Grimm v. State, </em>444 Md. 638, 120 A.3d 766 (2015). For the reasons explained below, we hold there was insufficient evidence to sustain the convictions, because the rule of corroboration of an extrajudicial confession was not satisfied. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In 2009, Quentin moved in with his father, John, stepmother, Petitioner, and brother, Derrick. At this time, Quentin was sixteen years old. In early 2013, Troy Lipenski, a deputy assigned to a local high school as a School Resource Officer, contacted Detective Nogle, and released to him an anonymous letter, which raised concerns about the nature of the relationship between Quentin and Petitioner. Further concerns were raised when Detective Nogle spoke with Quentin about the anonymous letter. This prompted the detective to continue the investigation, and he called Petitioner in order to arrange an interview at the Sheriffs Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">On February 6, 2013, Detectives Nogle and Barnhart conducted the interview. After being read her Miranda rights, Petitioner signed a Miranda waiver, and consented to the session being audio and video taped. Preliminary questioning revealed that Petitioner, in addition to her stepson, had three biological children with her husband, Mr. Grimm: Derrick, age thirteen; Logan, age two; MacKenzie, seven weeks old. After being shown the anonymous letter, Petitioner confessed that she previously had sexual intercourse with Quentin five to ten times, beginning when he was sixteen years old. She stated that their relationship ended a few months before the date of the interview; Quentin was nineteen years old at this time. Petitioner further confessed that she was unsure of the paternity of her two youngest children, but that she suspected Quentin was Logan\u2019s father. When the detectives showed Petitioner fourteen pages of Facebook communications be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>tween Quentin and \u201cFaith Evans,\u201d she admitted that Faith Evans was her Facebook alias. Specifically, Petitioner stated that Faith Evans was the name \u201cwe were going to name Logan if it was a girl. So we made it up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The State filed an indictment in the Circuit Court. Petitioner was charged with three counts of sexual abuse of a minor by a household member under \u00a7 3-602(b)(2) of the Criminal Law Article, and two counts of third degree sexual offense pursuant to Md.Code (2002, 2012 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-307 of the Criminal Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The case proceeded as a trial by jury. The State entered <em>nolle prosequi </em>to the two counts of third degree sexual offense. At trial, the State called Detective Nogle as a witness, and he testified about his investigation. He explained how he came into possession of the anonymous note, and that the content of the letter prompted him to speak with Quentin. That conversation, in turn, caused him to investigate further. He stated that on the day of the interview, he and Detective Barnhart read Petitioner her Miranda rights, obtained a Miranda waiver, and her consent to record the interview. A portion of the audio and video recording of Petitioner\u2019s confession was then played for the jury. The recording was stopped at the point when Petitioner was questioned about the Face-book communications. On cross-examination, Detective Nogle stated that he did not request a search warrant to obtain a paternity test, because Petitioner admitted that she did not know the paternity of Logan. On redirect, Detective Nogle stated that paternity was not an element of the crime of sexual abuse of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The State called Quentin as its next witness. In preliminary questioning, Quentin stated that he moved in with his father and Petitioner in the Fall of 2009. He also identified Petitioner as his stepmother.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In pertinent part, the following colloquy ensued between the State prosecutor and Quentin:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Q.

I don\u2019t remember that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Quentin stated that he moved out in December 2012. The State completed its direct examination of Quentin, and Defense Counsel elected not to cross-examine him. The State rested its case, and the jury was excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Defense Counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the State failed to make a prima facie showing as to each element of each count. Defense Counsel maintained that the only evidence of the corpus delicti<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 sexual act(s) between Petitioner and Quentin \u2014 was derived from Petitioner\u2019s confession, and was not corroborated by independent evidence, namely, Quentin\u2019s testimony. Moreover, Defense Counsel argued, \u201cBased upon [Quentin\u2019s] answers there\u2019s never been an admission or a concession by him which would serve as the corroboration for the body of that crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The State disagreed, and asserted that there was sufficient corroboration, because Quentin\u2019s testimony proved beyond a reasonable doubt two of the three elements of the crime of sexual abuse of a minor: Petitioner was a \u201chousehold member,\u201d and Quentin was sixteen years old at the time the sexual relationship began. The State argued, \u201cAll we have to [do] is show opportunity and we showed two elements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">The Circuit Court denied the motion for a judgment of acquittal, because it found sufficient corroboration. The trial judge stated \u201cthere has to be some corroboration but not some corroboration of each and every element of a crime.\u201d After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Petitioner elected not to testify, Defense Counsel rested, and renewed its motion for judgment of acquittal. The Circuit Court denied the motion. The jury returned a verdict of guilty to two counts of sexual abuse of a minor by a household member.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Petitioner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals on the issue of whether her confession was sufficiently corroborated in order to sustain her convictions. In an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the convictions. It stated: \u201cQuentin\u2019s testimony was, to be sure, independent of the confession and significantly bolstered its credibility, as it directly concerned the <em>corpus delicti i.e., </em>whether he and [the Petitioner] were engaged in a sexual relationship.\u201d The intermediate appellate court cited to <em>Larocca v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 460, 883 A.2d 986 (2005), and stated that Quentin\u2019s \u201cpreposterous testimony\u201d was sufficient to corroborate Petitioner\u2019s confession. It held that the trial court did not err in denying the motion for judgment of acquittal, or sending the ease to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">We granted <em>certiorari Grimm v. State, </em>444 Md. 638, 120 A.3d 766 (2015), to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">(1) May a witness\u2019s testimony that he does not remember whether an act occurred constitute sufficient corroboration of an extra-judicial confession by the defendant that the act in fact occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">(2) Can a criminal defendant\u2019s uncorroborated confession constitute sufficient evidence to support a conviction for sexual abuse of a minor?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">For the reasons stated below, we shall answer both questions in the negative. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">Ordinarily, \u201c[t]his Court reviews a question regarding the sufficiency of the evidence in a jury trial by asking whether after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Cox v. State, </em>421 Md. 630, 656-57, 28 A.3d 687, 702-03 (2011) (citations and internal quotations marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u201cIn determining whether evidence was sufficient to support a conviction, an appellate court \u2018defer[s] to any possible reasonable inferences [that] the trier of fact could have drawn from the ... evidence^]\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>440 Md. 450, 455, 103 A.3d 586, 589 (2014) (quoting <em>Hobby v. State, </em>436 Md. 526, 538, 83 A.3d 794, 801 (2014)). \u201cWe defer ... and need not decide whether the jury could have drawn other inferences from the evidence, refused to draw inferences, or whether we would have drawn different inferences from the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Mayers, </em>417 Md. 449, 466, 10 A.3d 782, 791-92 (2010) (citing <em>State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 557, 823 A.2d 664, 682 (2003)). In <em>Jones v. State, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">In performing its fact-finding role, the trier of fact decides which evidence to accept and which to reject. Therefore, in that regard, it is not required to assess the believability of a witness\u2019s testimony on an all or nothing basis; it may choose to believe only part, albeit the greatest part, of a particular witness\u2019s testimony, and disbelieve the remainder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtU\">343 Md. 448, 460, 682 A.2d 248, 254 (1996) (citing <em>Muir v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 648, 654, 498 A.2d 666, 668-69 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">It is settled law that \u201cMaryland follows the general rule that, as a matter of substantive law, a criminal conviction cannot rest solely on an uncorroborated confession.\u201d <em>Miller v. State, </em>380 Md. 1, 46, 843 A.2d 803, 829 (2004). The rule of corroboration requires independent substantiation of an extrajudicial confession made by a defendant. In <em>Bradbury v. State, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">It is, of course, well settled that an extrajudicial confession of guilt by a person accused of crime, unsupported by other evidence, is not sufficient to warrant a conviction. We have therefore consistently held that the extrajudicial confession must be supported by evidence, independent of the confes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>sion, which relates to and tends to establish the <em>corpus delicti, ie., </em>the facts that are necessary to show that a crime has been committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">233 Md. 421, 424, 197 A.2d 126, 127 (1964) (internal citations omitted). Furthermore, \u201cindependent evidence ... need not be full and positive proof of the <em>corpus delicti </em>and may be small in amount, if such proof, when considered with the confession, convinces the jury beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.\u201d <em>Bradbury, </em>233 Md. at 425, 197 A.2d at 128 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[T]he <em>corpus delicti </em>may be proved by circumstantial evidence when direct evidence is not available.... \u201d <em>Bradbury, </em>233 Md. at 424-25, 197 A.2d at 128. <em>See also Ballard v. State, </em>333 Md. 567, 577, 636 A.2d 474, 479 (1994) (discussing the \u201cnational overview of the corroboration requirement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Petitioner was convicted under \u00a7 3-602(b)(2) of the Criminal Law Article of sexual abuse of a minor by a household member.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cSexual abuse\u201d is defined, in \u00a7 3 \u2014 602(a)(4)(i), as \u201can act that involves sexual molestation or exploitation<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of a minor, whether physical injuries are sustained or not.\u201d The corpus delicti of this crime is sexual abuse. Sexual abuse includes, but is not limited to, incest, rape, sexual offense in any degree, sodomy, and unnatural or perverted sexual practices. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-602(a)(4)(ii) of the Criminal Law Article. \u201cThis list is not exhaustive. To constitute sexual abuse, the conduct underlying the charge need not be among the exemplars listed in \u00a7 3 \u2014 602(a)(4)(ii).... \u201d <em>Schmitt v. State, </em>210 Md.App. 488, 497, 63 A.3d 638, 643 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>At trial, the State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) Petitioner was a household member; (2) Quentin was a minor; and (3) that Petitioner sexually molested or exploited the alleged victim by means of a specific act. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-602 of the Criminal Law Article. As evidence, the State placed into evidence a portion of Petitioner\u2019s confession, which included her admission that she had a sexual relationship with her minor stepson, and that as a result of that relationship, she was unsure of Logan\u2019s paternity. To corroborate that testimony, the State called the alleged victim to testify. Although Quentin acknowledged that he lived with his father and Petitioner from the Fall of 2009 until December 2012, he did not remember details relating to the corpus delicti, i.e., sexual abuse. Quentin asserted that he did not remember: (1) whether he had a sexual relationship or intercourse with Petitioner, (2) whether he spoke to Detectives Nogle and Barnhart, and (3) whether he told the detectives of his belief that he was Logan\u2019s father. Furthermore, Quentin replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d when the prosecutor asked whether he knew why Petitioner selected Faith Evans as her Facebook alias. In other words, Quentin did not affirmatively testify that sexual abuse, as defined by the statute, occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Petitioner argues that the evidence is insufficient to support her convictions, because her confession of sexual abuse of a minor was not corroborated by independent evidence. It is her position that the Court of Special Appeals erred in determining that Quentin\u2019s testimony provided sufficient corroboration. That ruling, she argues, \u201cignores the holding of decades of case law\u201d requiring corroboration of an extrajudicial confession. She correctly identifies that the State did not attempt to impeach Quentin with any prior inconsistent statement he made to the detectives. Likewise, the State did not present other corroborating documentation, such as medical or physical evidence, to support its contention that Petitioner sexually abused the alleged victim. Petitioner points out that the rule of corroboration of an extrajudicial confession requires independent evidence of the corpus delicti, and that the State failed to satisfy this rule, because it provided no evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>an act involving sexual molestation or exploitation of a minor occurred. Furthermore, Petitioner asserts that Quentin\u2019s testimony concerning his inability to recall whether he had a sexual relationship with Petitioner did not establish independent evidence of the corpus delicti. In regard to what inferences may be drawn from Quentin\u2019s testimony, Petitioner stated: \u201cEven if the Court found it incredulous that Quentin could not remember ... it does not logically follow that the appropriate conclusion is that the event necessarily occurred.\u201d In her brief, Petitioner states that if a fact-finder does not believe the testimony of a non-party witness \u2014 here, Quentin\u2014 the jury must discredit that testimony, because, as a matter of law, \u201c[n]o other inferences or speculation are permitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">It is the State\u2019s position that the Court of Special Appeals was correct, in its reliance on <em>Larocca v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 460, 485, 883 A.2d 986, 1001 (2005), to hold that Quentin\u2019s testimony was so \u201cpreposterous\u201d that it corroborated the confession. In its brief, the State discusses the history of the corpus delicti rule, and posits that \u201cthe rule was designed only to preclude confessions to, and convictions for, fictitious crimes ____\u201d (citing David A. Moran, <em>In Defense of the Corpus Delicti Rule, </em>64 Ohio St. L.J. 817, 836 (2003)).

The corroboration rule plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of our criminal justice system. \u201cGenerally an uncorroborated confession does not establish as a matter of law the commission of [a] crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

The independent evidence offered by the State to corroborate the confession was Quentin\u2019s testimony. The State is correct that the alleged victim\u2019s testimony corroborated two of the three elements of the crime of sexual abuse of a minor: Petitioner was a household member, and Quentin, during the relevant times, was a minor.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The State posits that Quentin\u2019s inability to recall details, such as whether he and Petitioner had a sexual relationship, is \u201cpreposterous\u201d and that the inconceivability of such testimony allowed the jury to infer that a sexual act \u2014 the corpus delicti \u2014 did, in fact, occur. The Court of Special Appeals agreed, and stated \u201cQuentin\u2019s testimony was, to be sure, independent of the confession and significantly bolstered its credibility, as it directly concerned the <em>corpus delicti, ie., </em>whether he and [Petitioner] were engaged in a sexual relationship.\u201d We disagree. \u201c[T]he extrajudicial confession must be supported by evidence, independent of the confession, which relates to and tends to establish the <em>corpus delicti ie., </em>the facts that are necessary to show that a crime has been committed.\u201d <em>Bradbury v. State, </em>233 Md. 421, 424, 197 A.2d 126, 127 (1964) (citations omitted). To be sure, on the direct examination of Quentin, the State asked questions concerning the corpus delicti, but Quentin\u2019s responses \u2014 he did not remember \u2014 did not \u201crelate to\u201d or \u201cestablish\u201d the corpus delicti. The excerpt of Petitioner\u2019s recorded confession was the only evidence of the alleged sexual relationship between Quentin and Petitioner. This without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>more cannot satisfy the corroboration rule. In <em>Bradbury, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\">The rules governing the substantiation of extrajudicial statements in this State ... recognize that the supporting or substantiating circumstances need not establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>beyond a reasonable doubt; that the <em>corpus delicti </em>may be proved by circumstantial evidence when direct evidence is not available; that proof of the <em>corpus delicti </em>need not be full and positive but may be established by the circumstances of each particular case; and that the supporting evidence is sufficient to establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>if, when considered in connection with the confession or admission, it satisfies the trier of facts beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense charged was committed and that the accused committed it. It is clear, therefore, that the independent evidence necessary to support the confession need not be full and positive proof of the <em>corpus delicti </em>and may be small in amount, if such proof, when considered with the confession, convinces the jury beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">233 Md. at 424-25, 197 A.2d at 128 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). In <em>Ballard v. State, </em>333 Md. 567, 577-78, 636 A.2d 474, 478-79 (1994), we dedicated significant time to discussing the corroboration rule. In pertinent part, we focused on the analysis of the corroboration rule made by McCormick on Evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">To establish guilt in a criminal case, the prosecution must ordinarily show that (a) the injury or harm constituting the crime occurred; (b) this injury or harm was done in a criminal manner; and (c) the defendant was the person who inflicted the injury or harm. Wigmore maintains that <em>corpus delicti </em>means only the first of these, that is, \u201cthe fact of the specific loss or injury sustained,\u201d and does not require proof that this was occasioned by anyone\u2019s criminal agency____Most courts, however, define <em>corpus delicti </em>as involving both (a) and (b). This means that the corroborat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>ing evidence must tend to show the harm or injury and that it was occasioned by criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">The traditional approach has been to require that the elements of the offense be carefully distinguished and that the corroborating evidence tend to show each of those elements. A growing number of courts, however, are abandoning the strict requirement that the corroborating evidence tend to prove all elements of the <em>corpus delicti </em>Thus the corroborating evidence need only tend to show the \u201cmajor\u201d or \u201cessential\u201d harm involved in the offense charged and not all of the elements technically distinguished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\"><em>Ballard, </em>333 Md. at 577-78, 636 A.2d at 479 (citing 1 McCormick on Evidence 557-59 (John W. Strong ed., 4th ed.1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). A fact-finder could not reasonably infer from Quentin\u2019s testimony that Petitioner sexually abused Quentin. Absent from his responses was the \u201cmajor\u201d or \u201cessential\u201d harm involved in the offense charged: evidence of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">In <em>Lemons v. State, </em>the Court of Special Appeals reversed a conviction of first-degree murder, because, although the defendant confessed, the State\u2019s evidence was too slim to corroborate that crime. 49 Md.App. 467, 433 A.2d 1179 (1981). \u201cA confession simply cannot fortify its own truth.\u201d <em>Lemons, </em>49 Md.App. at 473, 433 A.2d at 1183. The circumstantial evidence only proved that the alleged victim failed to return to work. The State failed to corroborate the corpus delicti of murder. \u201c[E]vidence is only \u2018corroborative,\u2019 ... if it touches or concerns the <em>corpus delicti </em>and \u2014 in that way \u2014 fortifies the truth of the accompanying confession.

State, </em>the State\u2019s failure to corroborate an extrajudicial confession led to a reversal of convictions for child abuse and second degree sexual offense due to the insufficiency of evidence. 64 Md.App. 45, 494 A.2d 235 (1985). The State alleged that the defendant had sexually abused his five year old son. At trial, the State introduced the defendant\u2019s extrajudicial confession, and called the trooper and the child\u2019s mother to testify; the minor\u2019s out-of-court accusatory statement came in through the mother\u2019s testimony. <em>Duncan, </em>64 Md.App. at 54, 494 A.2d at 239. After being convicted, the defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence. The intermediate appellate court reversed the convictions, because of the lack of independent corroborative evidence of the defendant\u2019s extrajudicial confession. The out-of-court accusatory statement was admissible only in conjunction with the defendant\u2019s implied admission of guilt, but the statement was \u201cnot substantive evidence of the fact asserted by the child.\u201d <em>Duncan, </em>64 Md.App. at 54, 494 A.2d at 239. <em>But see Bradbury v. State, </em>233 Md. 421, 197 A.2d 126 (1964) (holding there was sufficient evidence to uphold a sodomy conviction, based, in part, on the minor victim\u2019s testimony against the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the State failed to satisfy the rule of corroboration for extrajudicial confessions. As mentioned above, Quentin\u2019s testimony corroborated two elements of the crime of sexual abuse of a minor, but his responses did not corroborate the major or essential element: sexual abuse. Quentin\u2019s assertion that he could not recall, among other things, whether he had ever had a sexual relationship or intercourse with Petitioner, was not sufficient evidence to corroborate that the alleged act(s) did, in fact, occur. In other words, the alleged victim\u2019s responses did not constitute substantive evidence that Petitioner had sexually abused him. Fatal to the State\u2019s case is the absence of any other independent circumstantial or direct evidence corroborating the \u201cessential\u201d harm to Quentin, i.e., sexual abuse. <em>See Ballard, </em>333 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Md. at 578, 636 A.2d at 479 (approving the rule requiring independent corroboration of \u201conly the major or essential harm involved in the charged offense\u201d). Because the State introduced no other corroborating evidence, there was insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Petitioner sexually abused Quentin. The trial judge erred in denying Petitioner\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. <em>See Morgan v. State, </em>134 Md.App. 113, 126, 759 A.2d 306, 313 (2000) (\u201cIt is the judge\u2019s role to determine whether the evidence that the State has presented is legally sufficient to warrant sending the case to the jury.\u201d). Furthermore, even if the jury disbelieved Quentin\u2019s inability to recall certain details, the jury could only discredit that testimony. It could not assign weight to discredited testimony, and infer that sexual abuse did, in fact, occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Assessing What Inferences, If Any, a Fact-Finder May Draw From the Disbelief of the Testimony of a Non-Party Witness</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">A. General Rule Governing a Fact-Finder\u2019s Disbelief of a Testifying Witness</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">We have already held that there is insufficient evidence to warrant the convictions of sexual abuse of a minor, because the State failed to corroborate Petitioner\u2019s extrajudicial confession. We feel it is necessary, however, to address the State\u2019s argument that Quentin\u2019s inability to recall details, such as whether he and Petitioner had a sexual relationship, is so \u201cpreposterous\u201d that it allowed the jury to infer that the corpus delicti \u2014 a sexual act \u2014 did, in fact, occur. Such an inference, under the circumstances, is inconsistent with Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">We have often stated that \u201cthe fact-finder possesses the unique opportunity to view the evidence and to observe first-hand the demeanor and to assess the credibility of witnesses during their live testimony....\u201d <em>Walker v.

In other words, disbelief is not evidence in and of itself. Therefore, a trier of fact cannot infer scienter, i.e., guilty knowledge, based solely on a defendant\u2019s denial of such knowledge.

State, </em>407 Md. 682, 710, 967 A.2d 790, 807 (2009) (Murphy, J., dissenting). In his treatise, Judge Joseph F. Murphy explains, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-4\">Disbelief of a witness does not ordinarily permit the factfinder to conclude that the opposite of what the witness testified to is true. For example, if a nonparty witness testifies that the light was green for northbound traffic, but the jurors are persuaded that this testimony is false, they cannot turn their disbelief into a finding that the light was actually red for northbound traffic. If the witness is not believed on that point, the jurors \u201cerase the blackboard.\u201d Disbelief of a party, however, is sometimes treated differently. The finding that a party has deliberately furnished false information permits the inference that the party did so because he knew that his cause should not prevail. The criminal defendant who furnishes false exculpatory information to investigating officers or who has threatened the other side\u2019s witnesses is treated differently from the non-party witness whose testimony is simply not given any credit. Under certain circumstances, false information can be treated as an admission by conduct that the opposing party\u2019s case is truthful and would prevail but for the falsity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., Maryland Evidence Handbook \u00a7 409, at 167 (4th ed.2010) (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added). This explanation conforms with decades of Maryland case law. We hold that an expansion of the scienter exception is unnecessary and unwarranted. The State ignores evidentiary tools, such as the turncoat witness rule,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>already at its disposal to prove its case in chief. The burden remains with the State to present the requisite substantive evidence, and here it failed to meet that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The scienter exception does not apply, because the facts in the instant case do not satisfy the requirements of the exception. First, the testimony at issue is that of a non-party witness, i.e., the alleged victim, rather than that of a party witness. Second, Petitioner did not deny scienter; she confessed to having sexual intercourse with her stepson five to ten times. Third, other than the extrajudicial confession, no additional evidence was presented to allow the jury to permissibly infer that sexual act(s) occurred between Petitioner and the alleged victim. Petitioner confessed to sexual abuse of a minor, but the State failed to produce <em>any </em>evidence to adequately corroborate the crime. Therefore, the general rule would apply in the absence of the corroboration rule. If the jury disbelieved the alleged victim\u2019s testimony, the fact-finder was obliged to discredit the part(s) disbelieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In sum, we reject the State\u2019s argument, and conclude that it amounts to no more than a misapplication of the scienter exception. We also distinguish <em>Larocca v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 460, 883 A.2d 986 (2005) from the case <em>sub judice, </em>because the issue there did not involve the application of the corroboration rule. Additionally, that case involved the testimony of a co-defendant who the State impeached using the co-defendant\u2019s prior inconsistent statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">We note that in <em>Larocca </em>the Court of Special Appeals, in dicta, drew a distinction between a neutral non-party witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>and a non-neutral non-party witness.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As stated above, the applicability of the scienter exception turns on the status of the witness and whether the witness is a party or non-party. To the extent the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Larocca </em>suggested that the applicability of the scienter exception is contingent on whether the witness is neutral or non-neutral, we disavow that distinction to the degree it conflicts with the general rule and the scienter exception as articulated herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. Quentin\u2019s testimony did not relate to or establish the eorpus delicti of sexual abuse of a minor. Because the State did not produce independent evidence to corroborate the extrajudicial confession, the rule of corroboration was not satisfied, as a matter of law. The evidence was legally insufficient to warrant a jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS IS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY.

There, the trial court \"impose[s] an important limitation: the plaintiff or prosecutor must still meet the initial burden of proof without the inference---- In criminal cases, a defendant who chooses to testify does not do so until after the prosecution has rested its case, meaning the prosecution has presumably adduced sufficient evidence without the defendant\u2019s testimony.\u201d Pollis, <em>supra </em>note 9, at 469.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b535-4\">. Under the scienter exception, when referring to a party witness, the term \"party\u201d is broader than the caption of the case. It refers not only to the parties of a case, but it also includes any co-defendants, because co-defendants are also accused of being a participant in the criminal activity at issue. For example, in <em>Larocca </em>v. <em>State, </em>164 Md.App. 460, 883 A.2d 986 (2005), co-defendant Hinkle entered into a plea bargain with the State, and was then called to testify in his co-defendant\u2019s trial.

Absent evidence of a faulty memory or mind-altering substances, no rational twenty-year-old could possibly forget whether he or she had had sexual intercourse with a stepparent within the previous five years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>strains all credulity that Quentin could remember exchanging messages with Grimm on Facebook, and could even remember Grimm\u2019s username on Facebook (\u201cFaith\u201d), yet could not remember whether he had had sexual intercourse with Grimm.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">After the prosecutor asked the simple question \u201cHow would you describe your relationship with [] Grimm?\u201d, Quentin repeated what he had already said four times: \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d Quentin\u2019s answer was not only non-responsive and nonsensical, but also demonstrably false; after the prosecutor asked \u201cWhat\u2019s your relationship with [] Grimm like today?\u201d, Quentin replied: \u201cMother.\u201d The jury could easily reasonably infer that Quentin was reflexively falsely responding \u201cI don\u2019t remember\u201d to almost every question, including questions about whether he had had sexual intercourse with Grimm. In short, I wholeheartedly agree with the Court of Special Appeals that Quentin\u2019s testimony about his lack of memory was \u201cpreposterous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Having concluded that the evidence was more than sufficient to demonstrate that Quentin was lying when he testified that he could not remember whether he had had sexual intercourse with Grimm, I would hold that, as a matter of law, Quentin\u2019s false testimony could serve as corroboration of Grimm\u2019s confession to having had sexual intercourse with Quentin. Again, Quentin made the preposterous claim that he could not remember whether he had had sexual intercourse with Grimm. Given that Quentin would have certainly denied the allegation if it were false, a reasonable inference is that the allegation was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The Majority states that \u201cdisbelief is not evidence in and of itself\u201d and cites: <em>Hayette v.

By contrast, this ease concerns the issue of whether an inference from a trier of fact\u2019s disbelief of a witness can serve as corroboration of a defendant\u2019s confession.

Specifically, in <em>VF Corp., </em>350 Md. at 711, 715 A.2d at 196, without any direct evidence of fraud, the plaintiff relied on the jury\u2019s discrediting the defendant\u2019s employee\u2019s testimony that he did not know that \u201chis representations were false.\u201d In <em>Clements, </em>319 Md. at 298, 572 A.2d at 179, in an attempt to establish dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, the Attorney Grievance Commission relied on the hearing judge\u2019s discrediting the respondent\u2019s testimony. And, in <em>Gloria H., </em>410 Md. at 579, 979 A.2d at 719, the State had no direct evidence of the juvenile\u2019s mother\u2019s involvement in the juvenile\u2019s truancy, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>the juvenile court based its verdict in the State\u2019s favor on the circumstance that the juvenile court discredited the juvenile\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The lesson of <em>VF Corp., Clements, </em>and <em>Gloria </em>H. \u2014 that a party with the burden of proof could not rely on a fact-finder\u2019s disbelief of a witness\u2019s testimony alone to establish the party\u2019s case \u2014 does not apply where, as here, the issue is whether there was corroboration of a confession. By definition, in such a case, the party with the burden of proof \u2014 namely, the State \u2014 is not relying on a fact-finder\u2019s disbelief of a witness\u2019s testimony alone to establish the State\u2019s case. In this case, the State offered not only evidence of Grimm\u2019s confession, but also independent evidence, in the form of Quentin\u2019s testimony, that, in relation to Quentin, Grimm was both a \u201cfamily member\u201d and a \u201chousehold member,\u201d as those terms are defined by Md.Code Ann., Crim.

[at] 298, 572 A.2d [at] 179[], \"[a] refusal to believe evidence of a [defendant], however, does not, of itself, supply affirmative evidence of the dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation charged. The issue is whether [the plaintiff] presented sufficient evidence of the charge to meet the clear and convincing standard of proof,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\"><em>VF Corp., </em>350 Md. at 711, 715 A.2d at 196-97 (some alterations in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b542-9\">. In <em>Gloria H., </em>410 Md. at 565, 979 A.2d at 712, this Court held that a juvenile\u2019s mother was \"entitled to a new trial on the issue of whether she was \u2018involved\u2019 in\u201d her daughter\u2019s truancy. In the juvenile court, the juvenile and her mother \"testified that, although [the juvenile] arrived at her school on a regular basis, [the juvenile] rarely attended tire classes to which she was assigned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, 979 A.2d at 714 (emphasis omitted). If believed, the testimony of the juvenile and her mother would have established that the juvenile's mother was not involved in her daughter\u2019s truancy, because the juvenile\u2019s mother had done all that she had needed to do \u2014 namely, simply ensure that her daughter arrived at school, However, the juvenile court found that, \"because [the juvenile's mother]'s \u2018incomprehensible\u2019 testimony lacked credibility, the opposite of her exculpatory testimony must [have] be[en] true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579, 979 A.2d at 719. This Court concluded that, \"[f]or the reasons stated in <em>VF Corp. </em>[] and <em>Clements, </em>[] the [juvenile c]ourt erred in drawing th[e] impermissible inference\u201d that the opposite of the juvenile\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony was true. <em>Gloria H., </em>410 Md. at 579, 979 A.2d at 719.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b543-6\">. <em>\"Mens rea </em>[is] the guilty mind or mental state accompanying a forbidden <em>act____[M]ens rea </em>[is] interchangeable with the terms 'guilty mind,' <em>\u2018scienterW </em>and \u2018criminal intent[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>State Cent.
