The federal court certified to this Court the following question of law: \u201cDoes Md.Code Ann., Real Prop. [ (1974, 2015 Repl.Vol.) (\u201cRP\u201d) ] \u00a7 14-127 imply a private right of action?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">We answer the certified question of law \u201cno\u201d and hold that RP \u00a7 14-127 does not contain an express or implied private right of action, as neither RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s plain language, legislative history, nor legislative purpose demonstrates any intent on the General Assembly\u2019s part to create a private right of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">In a memorandum opinion accompanying the certification order, the federal court stated the following facts,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Edward J. Fangman and Vicki Fangman (collectively \u201cthe Fangmans\u201d) seek to represent a class of approximately 4,000 to 5,000 individuals (collectively \u201cAppellants\u201d) who, from 2009 to 2014, retained Genuine Title, LLC (\u201cGenuine Title\u201d) for settlement and title services and utilized various lenders (collectively \u201cthe Lender Appellees\u201d) (together with Genuine Title, \u201cAppellees\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the purchase and/or refinancing of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>residences. All Appellants allegedly used Genuine Title\u2019s settlement and title services as a result of referrals from the Lender Appellees. All of the Lender Appellees are servicers of federally related mortgage loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In the second amended complaint,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Fangmans alleged that they and all other class members \u201cwere victims of an illegal kickback scheme\u201d in which the Lender Appellees received unearned fees and kickbacks from Genuine Title and \u201csham companies\u201d that were created by Genuine Title (collectively, \u201cthe Genuine Title Appellees\u201d) for the purpose of distributing the kickbacks.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to the second amended complaint, the Lender Appellees\u2019 employees and/or agents received and accepted cash payments, free marketing materials, and other things of value from the Genuine Title Appellees in exchange for referring borrowers to Genuine Title for settlement and title services.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Genuine Title Appellees and Lender Appellees allegedly concealed these payments from Appellants and failed to disclose the payments on Appellants\u2019 HUD-1 settlement statements. Additionally, Appellants alleged that Genuine Title and the Lender Appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>failed to disclose that Genuine Title was participating with referring loan officers/banks and with the Genuine Title Appellees, and also failed to disclose their affiliated business relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">As some point, regulators began to investigate the alleged scheme. Appellants alleged that, once the investigation began, Genuine Title drafted and back-dated sham title services agreements for the purpose of disguising cash payments as legitimate fees for alleged services provided. Appellants alleged that cash payments were not made in accordance with the fee schedule contained in the title services agreement. For example, in some instances, pursuant to the sham title services agreements, Genuine Title agreed to make cash payments to referring mortgage brokers for title services that were not actually performed. Appellants alleged that, as a result of the kickback scheme, they were deprived of \u201ckickback[-]free settlement services and process\u201d and their settlement fees would have been \u201cmuch lower\u201d had the kickback scheme not been in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">On December 6, 2013, the Fangmans filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County an initial class action complaint against Genuine Title. Genuine Title then removed the case to the federal court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On January 2, 2015, the Fangmans, along with thirty other Appellants, filed the first amended complaint on behalf of themselves and the alleged class, adding as defendants the Genuine Title Appellees and all but one of the Lender Appellees. On May 20, 2015, Appellants filed the second amended complaint, adding as a defendant one Lender Appellee and adding sixteen additional plaintiffs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the second amended complaint, Appellants alleged that the Genuine Title Appellees and Lender Appellees violated 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2607(a) and (b), part of the Real Estate Settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Procedures Act (\u201cRESPA\u201d);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> RP \u00a7 14-127; and Md.Code Ann., Com. Law (1975, 2013 Repl.Vol.) (\u201cCL\u201d) \u00a7 13-301, part of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">In response to the second amended complaint, the Genuine Title Appellees and Lender Appellees filed in the federal court eleven separate motions to dismiss. On November 24, 2015, the federal court conducted a hearing on the motions to dismiss.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On December 9, 2015, the federal court issued a memorandum opinion in which the federal court, with one exception,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> denied the motions to dismiss the RESPA claims, granted the motions to dismiss the Maryland Consumer Protection Act claims, and stayed the motions to dismiss the RP \u00a7 14-127 claims so that this Court could determine whether RP \u00a7 14-127 permits a private right of action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As to the RP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>\u00a7 14-127 claims, the federal court observed \u201cthat no Maryland state court decision has resolved the present issue,\u201d and thus it was certifying the question of law to this Court, On the same day, December 9, 2015, the federal court issued a certification order and stayed Appellants\u2019 claims as to RP \u00a7 14-127 in the federal court pending this Court\u2019s response.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AqW\">The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Appellants contend that RP \u00a7 14-127 provides an implied private right of action. Appellants argue that RP \u00a7 14-127 was enacted to protect a narrow class of individuals \u2014 namely, consumers of residential title and settlement services \u2014 and that Appellants are in that class for whose benefit RP \u00a7 14-127 was enacted; <em>ie., </em>they are consumers of residential title and settlement services. Appellants assert that the injuries that they suffered \u2014 including overcharges, lack of impartiality in the referral, and a reduction of competition among settlement service providers \u2014 constitute the exact type of harm that RP \u00a7 14-127 was designed to prevent. Appellants maintain that RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s language focuses on, and RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s purpose is, the protection of consumers in real estate transactions involving land in Maryland. According to Appellants, implying a private right of action under RP \u00a7 14-127 is consistent with RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s language and purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Appellees<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> respond that there is no evidence that the General Assembly intended to create a private right of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>under RP \u00a7 14-127 and that there is no basis in law or fact for implying a private right of action. Appellees contend that RP \u00a7 14-127 neither identifies a specific class of protected individuals nor confers a beneficial right on any specific class of individuals, let alone Appellants. Appellees argue that, on its face, RP \u00a7 14-127 does not confer any right at all, and instead is a broad prohibition on individuals who are involved in real estate transactions in Maryland from paying or receiving anything in exchange for settlement business. According to Appellees, RP \u00a7 14-127 simply prohibits a certain type of conduct and is designed to protect the public at large, not a narrow, specific class of individuals. Appellees assert that neither RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s plain language nor its legislative history supports the position that RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s purpose was to create a private right of action. Appellees point out that, when RP \u00a7 14-127 was amended in 2010, the General Assembly was aware that RESPA provided a private right of action, yet chose not to provide a similar private right of action under RP \u00a7 14-127. Appellees maintain that RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s purpose is to criminalize certain conduct; in other words, according to Appellees, RP \u00a7 14-127 is a criminal statute with no private right of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Pursuant to the Maryland Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act, Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud.

Montgomery Cnty., </em>427 Md. 691, 708-11, 50 A.3d 1112, 1122-23 (2012), we discussed in detail how to assess whether a State statute contains an implied private right of action, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-11\">A private cause of action in favor of a particular plaintiff or class of plaintiffs does not exist simply because a claim is framed that a statute was violated and a plaintiff or class of plaintiffs was harmed by it. Rather, the issue is a matter of statutory construction....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-12\">The U.S. Supreme Court fashioned the prevailing test for determining whether a statute contains implicitly a private cause of action:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>In determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute not expressly providing one, several factors are relevant. First, is the plaintiff one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted[?] Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or. to deny one? Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4u\"><em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 78, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 2087-88, 45 L.Ed.2d 26, 36 (1975) (internal citations omitted). This Court utilized the <em>Cort </em>test in <em>Erie Ins </em>[.] <em>Co </em>[. <em>v. Chops], </em>322 Md. [79,] 90-91, 585 A.2d [232,] 237 [ (1991) ], which dealt with a Maryland statute....</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\"><em>Touche Ross [&amp; c v. Redington, </em>442 U.S. 560, 575-76, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 61 L.Ed.2d 82 (1979) ] emphasized that the central inquiry remains whether the legislative body intended to create, either expressly or by implication, a private cause of action. Courts discern ... whether a private cause of action was intended by analyzing the language of the statute to identify its purpose and intended beneficiaries, reviewing the statute\u2019s legislative history, and determining whether the statute provides otherwise an express remedy. As a result, in a case in which neither the statute nor the legislative history reveals a legislative intent to create a private right of action for the benefit of the plaintiff, we need not carry the <em>Cort v. Ash </em>inquiry further.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Thus, our analysis begins with the language of the statute at hand and whether it confers a beneficial right upon a particular class of persons. If a statute\u2019s language provides a right to a particular class of persons, there is a strong inference that the legislature intended the statute to carry an implied cause of action. Conversely, that inference becomes attenuated when the statute is framed as a general prohibition or a command to a governmental entity or other group or confers a generalized benefit. For example, in <em>Cannon [v. Univ. of Chicago, </em>441 U.S. 677, 693 n. 13, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979),] the Supreme Court listed several statutory schemes that conferred a right on a class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>of persons and created an implied private cause of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5O\">\u201cAll citizens of the United States shall have the same right ... as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof,\u201d \u201cno person shall be denied the right to vote,\u201d and \u201cemployees shall have the right to organize and bargain collectively.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">(Internal quotation marks, footnote, brackets, and most citations omitted) (last ellipsis in original).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To reiterate, in assessing whether a State statute contains an implied private right of action, we are concerned with three specific inquiries: (1) Is the plaintiff one of the class for whose special benefit the statute was enacted? (2) Is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one? (3) Is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff? <em>Baker, </em>427 Md. at 709, 50 A.3d at 1122; <em>see also Scull v. Groover, Christie &amp; Merritt, P.C., </em>435 Md. 112, 122, 76 A.3d 1186, 1191 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">This Court has applied the three-factor test from <em>Cort </em>in several cases to determine whether an implied private right of action existed. For example, in <em>Erie Ins. Co., </em>322 Md. at 91-92, 83, 585 A.2d at 238, 233, we held that there was no express or implied private right of action under Md.Code Ann., Transp. (1977, 1987 Repl.Vol.) (\u201cTR\u201d) \u00a7 17-106(b), which provided: \u201cAfter July 1, 1983, each insurer or other provider of required security immediately shall notify the [Motor Vehicle] Administration [ (\u201cthe MVA\u201d) ] of only those terminations or other lapses that are final and occur within the first 6 months of any required security issued to or provided for a resident of this State.\u201d In <em>Erie Ins. Co., </em>322 Md. at 81, 585 A.2d at 233, a husband and wife, the Chopses, were injured in an automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>accident that occurred in West Virginia; the accident was solely the fault of Carol Iser (\u201cIser\u201d), who was driving a vehicle that she owned and that was registered in Maryland. At the time of the accident, Iser\u2019s vehicle was uninsured because, two months prior to the accident, Erie Insurance Company (\u201cErie\u201d) had cancelled Iser\u2019s automobile liability insurance policy for nonpayment of the premium. <em>See id. </em>at 81-82, 585 A.2d at 233. Despite the lack of insurance, the Chopses sued Erie, alleging that Erie was liable because it had breached the duty that it owed under TR \u00a7 17-106(b) to notify the MVA that it had cancelled Iser\u2019s automobile liability insurance policy. <em>See Erie Ins. Co., </em>322 Md. at 82, 585 A.2d at 233. In the trial court, the Chopses argued that Erie\u2019s violation of TR \u00a7 17-106(b) made it liable as though Iser\u2019s automobile liability insurance policy had not been cancelled or, alternatively, that Erie\u2019s violation of TR \u00a7 17-106(b) was evidence of negligence that was a proximate cause of the Chopses\u2019 damages. <em>See Erie Ins. Co., </em>322 Md. at 82, 585 A.2d at 233. Following a trial, the Chopses were granted judgment against Erie; Erie appealed; and, before the case was considered by the Court of Special Appeals, this Court issued a writ of <em>certiorari </em>on its own motion. <em>See id. </em>at 82, 585 A.2d at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Upon review, we determined that, because Erie did not notify the MVA until forty days after it cancelled Iser\u2019s policy, the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s finding that Erie had failed to notify the MVA of the cancellation of Iser\u2019s policy within the time required by TR \u00a7 17 \u2014 106(b), which required immediate notification. <em>See Erie Ins. Co., </em>322 Md. at 83-84, 585 A.2d at 234. Nonetheless, this Court held that the duty that was imposed on Erie by TR \u00a7 17-106(b) was not a \u201ctort duty\u201d because TR \u00a7 17-106(b) \u201cdid not create a legally cognizable duty running from Erie to all persons who might thereafter suffer economic damage by reason of involvement in an accident with an uninsured motorist upon Erie\u2019s failure to give immediate notice to the MVA of the termination of coverage.\u201d <em>Erie Ins. Co., </em>322 Md. at 86, 585 A.2d at 235.

In particular, HG \u00a7 19-710(p) of the HMO Act prohibited a health care provider from billing an HMO member for amounts beyond those that were provided in the HMO\u2019s plan, a practice commonly known as \u201cbalance billing,\u201d providing: \u201cA health care provider or any representative of a health care provider may not collect or attempt to collect from any subscriber or enrollee any money [that is] owed to the health care provider by a[n HMO that has been] issued a certificate of authority to operate in this State.\u201d <em>Scull, </em>435 Md. at 119-20, 76 A.3d at 1190.

We began our analysis by observing that the HMO Act did not provide an express private right of action for an HMO member who was allegedly harmed by a violation of the prohibition against balance billing; thus, we turned to whether there was an implied private right of action. <em>See id. </em>at 121, 76 A.3d at 1191. We then applied and analyzed the three factors set forth in <em>Cort </em>in the context of the HMO Act. <em>See Scull, </em>435 Md. at 122-24, 76 A.3d at 1191-92. As to whether the plaintiff was a member of the class for whose benefit HG \u00a7 19-710(p) was enacted, we stated that, on its face, HG \u00a7 19-710(p) \u201cstrongly suggested] an intent to protect a specific class of persons, namely enrollees and subscribers of HMOs, from the practice of balance billing.\u201d <em>Scull, </em>435 Md. at 122, 76 A.3d at 1191.

As to legislative intent to create or deny a remedy, we reiterated that there was nothing expressly in HG \u00a7 19-710(p) concerning a private right of action for a violation of the prohibition against balance billing; and, we further concluded that \u201cnothing in the text of the balance billing prohibition in HG \u00a7 19 \u2014 710(p) suggested] that the [General Assembly] believed that it was creating a new cause of action on behalf of HMO subscribers against health care providers \u2014 as opposed to creating a structure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>foster HMO plans.\u201d <em>Scull, </em>435 Md. at 122, 76 A.3d at 1191-92.

Finally, as to the statutory scheme and legislative purpose, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">[T]he statutory scheme largely concerns the structure and operation of [HMO]s, not the billing practices of health care providers. In that sense, the statute is intended to confer a general benefit on the public at large by providing a foundation for a particular form of health care coverage. The [HMO] Act is primarily focused on the operation and regulation of an HMO and its relationship with the providers that serve its members. Notably, the explicit private cause of action that does appear in the [HMO] Act is on behalf of a health care provider against an HMO that fails to carry out the HMO\u2019s obligations under the [HMO] Act. While the prohibition against balance billing of HMO members is an important part of the overall scheme, the [HMO] Act provides for its enforcement through \u201chold harmless\u201d contract provisions required by [the HMO Act]. And there is already in place a cause of action for a patient to obtain relief for violations of unlawful billing practices[, namely, under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 123-24, 76 A.3d at 1192 (citations omitted). Accordingly, we held \u201cthat an HMO member does not have an implied private right of action under the HMO [Act] with respect to a violation of the balance billing prohibition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124, 76 A.3d at 1192 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Returning to the instant case, we hold that RP \u00a7 14-127 does not provide an express or implied private right of action. As stated above, RP \u00a7 14-127(c)(1) prohibits \u201c[a] person who has a connection with the settlement of real estate transactions involving land in the State\u201d from \u201cpay[ing] to or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>receiving] from another any consideration to solicit, obtain, retain, or arrange real estate settlement business.\u201d Nothing within RP \u00a7 14-127 generally, or RP \u00a7 14-127(c)(1) specifically, expressly provides a private right of action for anyone who is allegedly harmed by a violation of RP \u00a7 14 \u2014 127(c)(1). Thus, the key question in this case \u2014 indeed, the question that the federal court certified to this Court \u2014 is whether RP \u00a7 14-127 contains an implied private right of action. We hold that it does not, as neither RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s plain language, legislative history, nor legislative purpose demonstrates any intent on the General Assembly\u2019s part to create a private right of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">\n<em>Class</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">As to whether Appellants are members of the class for whose benefit RP \u00a7 14-127 was enacted, RP \u00a7 14-127(c)(1) provides that \u201c[a] person who has a connection with the settlement of real estate transactions involving land in the State may not pay to or receive from another any consideration to solicit, obtain, retain, or arrange real estate settlement business.\u201d On its face, RP \u00a7 14-127(c)(1) does not specifically identify a class for whose benefit it was enacted. Nonetheless, there is a group who could receive the benefit of RP \u00a7 14-127 \u2014 consumers of residential and commercial settlement services.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In other words, RP \u00a7 14-127(c)(1) could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>inure to the benefit of consumers or members of the public who use residential and commercial settlement services because the prohibition in RP \u00a7 14-127(e)(1) could theoretically keep costs down by eliminating hidden costs and excess fees that may be associated with the solicitation, obtainment, or arrangement of real estate settlement business. As consumers of settlement services, Appellants are members of a class that would conceivably benefit from RP \u00a7 14-127, although there is no evidence that RP \u00a7 14-127 was designed specifically to protect consumers of settlement services.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Our conclusion that RP \u00a7 14 \u2014 127(c)(1) inures to the benefit of consumers of residential and commercial settlement services is consistent with an opinion from the Maryland Attorney General concerning whether RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s predecessor, Md.Code Ann., Art. 27 (\u201cArt.27\u201d), \u00a7 465A, had been preempted by the revised Regulation X of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. In the opinion, the Maryland Attorney General stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">Although we are not aware of any legislative history bearing on the purpose of [Art. 27, \u00a7 465A], it is evidently intended to prevent a real estate broker, for example, from having a financial incentive to steer a purchaser of real property to a particular provider of settlement services. Presumably, the General Assembly perceived that the purchaser would be better served if advice about settlement services was free of such bias.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">78 Md. Op. Atty.

Stated otherwise, the Maryland Attorney General also found no specific class of individuals intended to be protected by RP \u00a7 14-127, but opined that <em>purchasers </em>\u2014 i.e., consumers \u2014 of settlement services would receive the benefit of RP \u00a7 14-127 by receiving settlement services free of bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Nevertheless, we reiterate that RP \u00a7 14-127 does not expressly provide a right to a particular class of persons. For example, the prohibition in RP \u00a7 14 \u2014 127(c)(1) is not phrased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>along the lines of \u201call consumers of settlement services have the right to have kickback-free settlement services.\u201d <em>Cf. Baker, </em>427 Md. at 711, 50 A.3d at 1123 (\u201c[T]he Supreme Court listed several statutory schemes that conferred a right on a class of persons and created an implied private cause of action: \u2018All citizens of the \u00dcnited States shall have the same right ... as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof,\u2019 \u2018no person shall be denied the right to vote,\u2019 and \u2018employees shall have the right to organize and bargain collectively.\u2019 \u201d (Citation and brackets omitted) (ellipsis in original)). Rather, RP \u00a7 14-127(c)(1) contains a general prohibition \u2014 namely, that persons connected \u201cwith the settlement of real estate transactions involving land in the State may not pay to or receive from another any consideration to solicit, obtain, retain, or arrange real estate settlement business.\u201d And, RP \u00a7 14-127(c)(1) appears to confer only, as a result of the prohibition, a generalized benefit that inures to consumers of settlement services. <em>See Baker, </em>427 Md. at 710-11, 50 A.3d at 1123 (\u201cIf a statute\u2019s language provides a right to a particular class of persons, there is a strong inference that the [General Assembly] intended the statute to carry an implied cause of action. Conversely, that inference becomes attenuated when the statute is framed as a general prohibition or a command to a governmental entity or other group or confers a generalized benefit.\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). Significantly, RP \u00a7 14-127 does not mention, let alone identify, consumers or the public in general as a class who benefits from the provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In any event, as we stated in <em>Baker, </em>427 Md. at 708-09, 50 A.3d at 1122, \u201c[a] private cause of action in favor of a particular plaintiff or class of plaintiffs does not exist simply because a claim is framed that a statute was violated and a plaintiff or class of plaintiffs was harmed by it.\u201d (Citation omitted). Rather, the question of whether a private right of action exists is a matter of statutory construction. <em>See id. </em>at 709, 50 A.3d at 1122. As such, although Appellants are in a class of individuals who arguably receive the benefit of RP \u00a7 14-127, we still must examine RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s plain language, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>legislative history, and legislative scheme/purpose to determine whether the General Assembly intended to create a private right of action under RP \u00a7 14-127. <em>See Baker, </em>427 Md. at 710, 50 A.3d at 1123 (\u201cCourts discern legislative intent whether a private cause of action was intended by analyzing the language of the statute to identify its purpose and intended beneficiaries, reviewing the statute\u2019s legislative history, and determining whether the statute provides otherwise an express remedy.\u201d (Citations omitted)); <em>see also Scull, </em>435 Md. at 122-24, 76 A.3d at 1191-92 (Although concluding that the plaintiff was a member of the class for whose benefit the statute at issue was enacted, we also analyzed legislative intent and purpose before concluding that no implied private right of action existed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">\n<em>Legislative History I Intent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">As to whether there is any indication of legislative intent, either explicit or implicit, to create or deny a private right of action, we conclude that RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s legislative history fails to reveal any intent on the General Assembly\u2019s part to create a private right of action, either expressly or impliedly.

In response, then-State Insurance Commissioner Norman Polovoy proposed a three-bill package that \u201cwould make title insurance companies financially liable for any misuse of funds changing hands in real estate settlements, outlaw kickbacks from lawyers to brokers steering business their way[,] and require lawyers to explain to home buyers the difference between mortgage title insurance, protecting only the lender, and home owners title insurance.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>Staff Writer, <em>Escrow Bills Advance at Annapolis, The Washington Post, Times Herald, </em>Mar. 17, 1967, at B1. The House Banking and Insurance Committee endorsed all three bills. <em>See </em>Sandy Royner, <em>Polovoy Bill Gains in Part, The Sun, </em>Mar. 16, 1967, at C12; Staff Writer, <em>supra, </em>at B1. Thereafter, House Bill 1075, outlawing kickbacks, was enacted as Art. 27, \u00a7 465A. <em>See </em>1967 Md. Laws 1662-68 (Vol.II, Ch. 756, H.B. 1075). An article dated February 1, 1968 noted, however, that \u201ca stronger measure that failed to pass in the 1967 General Assembly\u201d would be reintroduced, namely, a \u201cbill [that] would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>hold title insurance companies liable for defalcations by their \u2018approved attorneys.\u2019 \u201d Peter A. Jay, <em>Proposed Realty-Closing Controls Hit, The Washington Post, Times Herald, </em>Feb. 1, 1968, at B5.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">A \u201cReport of the Committee to Study the Problem of Delayed Disbursements of Real Estate Settlements,\u201d included in the Report of the 72nd Annual Meeting of the Maryland State Bar Association (1967 Md. State Bar Ass\u2019n Transaction Report, at 211-13), provided a fuller report on the three bills, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">As a result of defalcations by various attorneys handling real estate settlements in which buyers and sellers of real property in Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties lost well over $1,000,000, a large number of bills were introduced in the 1967 Session of the General Assembly dealing with various aspects of the problem. The State Insurance Commissioner ... prepared for introduction three bills known as House Bills 1073, 1074, and 1075____The three bills, which came to be known as the \u201cPolovoy Package\u201d, would attempt to solve the problem in the following manner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-9\">H.B. 1073 provided that[,] whenever a title insurance company shall issue a policy of insurance insuring the title to such property for the benefit of any mortgagee, the title company or the title attorney shall, prior to the disbursement of the settlement funds, notify the mortgagor of his right to purchase insurance insuring title to the property for his benefit and of the cost of such insurance. Substantially similar proposed legislation was included in H.B. 41[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>H.B. 1074 would have, in effect, placed an \u201cabsolute and unqualified liability\u201d as to the proper disbursement of settlement funds upon a title company [that] issued a binder or policy insuring title to the property for the benefit of any party to the settlement. To accomplish this, the title insurance company would be conclusively presumed to have constituted and designated its so-called approved attorney as its agent for the closing of the transaction and the presumption and liability so imposed by statute would extend for the benefit of all parties to the settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">H.B. 1075, the \u201cAnti-Kick Back Bill[,]\u201d would have amended Article 27 of the Code[,] making it a criminal offense to pay or receive anything of value for the purpose of soliciting, obtaining, retaining[,] or arranging any real estate settlement or real estate settlement business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">H.B. 41 was enacted by the General Assembly and has been signed by the Governor. This Bill, for practical purposes, accomplishes the same result as H.B. 1073.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">H.B. 1075 was enacted by the General Assembly and has been signed by the Governor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\">H.B. 1074 failed of enactment and was referred to the Legislative Council for further study.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">Thus, as originally enacted, Art. 27, \u00a7 465A, criminalizing kickbacks, provided, in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-10\">No person, firm, or corporation having any connection whatsoever with the settlement of real estate transactions involving land situated and lying in this State shall, for the purpose of soliciting, obtaining, retaining, or arranging any real estate settlement or real estate settlement business, pay to or receive from, any other person, firm, or corporation any fee, compensation, gift (except promotional or advertising materials for general distribution), thing of value, rebate, or other consideration, including loans and advancements of commissions or deposit monies. Any person, firm, or corporation violating the terms of this section, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>subject to a fine not to exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) or to imprisonment for not more than six (6) months or both. Every violation of this section shall constitute a separate offense and shall be punishable as such. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as preventing the payment of commissions to agents who have been duly licensed as such by the State Insurance Department. Nothing herein shall prohibit the referral of any such business from one attorney to another attorney, or prohibit any professional fee arrangement between attorneys in such cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">1967 Md. Laws 1662-63 (Vol.II, Ch. 756, H.B.1075) (italics and some capitalization omitted). Art. 27, \u00a7 465A remained largely unchanged until 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">In 2002, pursuant to House Bill 11, as part of the Code Revision that created the Criminal Law Article, Art. 27, \u00a7 465A was recodified as RP \u00a7 14-127. <em>See </em>2002 Md. Laws 197, 202, 1089-90 (Vol.I-II, Ch. 26, H.B.11). Specifically, House Bill 11 was enacted for the purpose of, among other things, \u201cadding a new article to the Annotated Code of Maryland, to be designated and known as the \u2018Criminal Law Article\u2019, to revise, restate, and recodify the laws of the State relating to criminal law; [and] revising, restating, and recodifying certain provisions relating to ... real estate settlements[]\u201d 2002 Md. Laws 197 (Vol.I, Ch. 26, H.B.11). At that time, RP \u00a7 14-127 was divided into subsections, including RP \u00a7 14-127(c) (now RP \u00a7 14-127(c)(1)), which provided then, as it does now, that \u201c[a] person who has a connection with the settlement of real estate transactions involving land in the State may not pay to or receive from another any consideration to solicit, obtain, retain, or arrange real estate settlement business.\u201d 2002 Md. Laws 1090 (Vol.II, Ch. 26, H.B.11). The Revisor\u2019s Note stated that \u201csubsections (a)(3) and (b) through (e)\u201d of RP \u00a7 14-127 were \u201cnew language derived without substantive change from former Art. 27, \u00a7 465A.\u201d 2002 Md. Laws 1090 (Vol.II, Ch. 26, H.B.11). Two other notes in the Revisor\u2019s Note pertained to RP \u00a7 14-127(c): (1) that \u201cthe former references to a \u2018firm\u2019 and \u2018corporation\u2019 [we]re <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>deleted in light of the definition of \u2018person\u2019 in [RP] \u00a7 1-101(bb)\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe former reference to land \u2018situated and lying\u2019 in the State [wa]s deleted as included in the comprehensive reference to \u2018land in the State\u2019.\u201d 2002 Md. Laws 1090 (Vol.II, Ch. 26, H.B.11).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">House Bill ll\u2019s Fiscal Note explained the purpose of House Bill 11 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">This Code Revision bill revises, restates, and recodifies the laws of the State relating to criminal law. The new article is a nonsubstantive revision of statutes that relate to substantive crimes in the State of Maryland. It derives primarily from Article 27 \u2014 Crimes and Punishments, and includes related provisions from the Agriculture, Commercial Law, and Family Law Articles, and others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">In the \u201cFiscal Summary\u201d portion of House Bill ll\u2019s Fiscal Note, it was noted that House Bill 11 simply \u201crecodifie[d] specified existing laws without substantive change.\u201d In the \u201cAnalysis\u201d portion of House Bill ll\u2019s Fiscal Note, it was noted that \u201cHouse Bill 11 also revise[d] in several other articles a number of provisions relating to criminal law, regulatory, and enforcement matters originally codified in Article 27. These other articles include[d] ... [the] Real Property Article^]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AlI\">In 2010, RP \u00a7 14-127 was amended through Senate Bill 1019 and House Bill 1471. At that time, among other things, certain definitions were added to RP \u00a7 14-127(a); RP \u00a7 14-127(c) became RP \u00a7 14-127(c)(1); and RP \u00a7 14-127(c)(2) and (d) were added. <em>See </em>2010 Md. Laws 2417-19 (Vol.III, Ch. 373, S.B.1019); 2010 Md. Laws 2419-21 (Vol.III, Ch. 374, H.B. 1471). The stated purpose of the amendments was to \u201crequire] a certain person who offers settlement services in connection with residential real estate transactions involving land in the State to comply with certain federal disclosure requirements; alter[ ] a certain provision relating to the payment of a commission to a certain person; repeal[ ] a certain definition; defin[e] certain terms; and generally relat[e] to real estate settlements.\u201d 2010 Md. Laws 2417 (Vol.III, Ch. 373, S.B.1019); 2010 Md. Laws 2419 (Vol.III, Ch. 374, H.B. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>1471). Senate Bill 1019\u2019s and House Bill 1471\u2019s Fiscal and Policy Notes explained that the purpose of the bills was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">Th[ese] bill[s] establish ] that a person who participates in an \u201caffiliated business arrangement\u201d as defined under the federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) is not a violation of a State law that otherwise prohibits affiliates from participating in a real estate settlement (1) solely because that person participates in an affiliated business arrangement; and (2) as long as that person complies with existing RESPA disclosure requirements. A person who does not comply is guilty, under existing penalty provisions, of a misdemeanor and subject to maximum penalties of six months imprisonment and/or a fine of $1,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">When RP \u00a7 14-127 was amended in 2010, it was the first time that RP \u00a7 14-127 included specific references and citations to RESPA, in RP \u00a7 14-127(a)(4), (c)(2), and (d). <em>See </em>2010 Md. Laws 2418-19 (Vol.III, Ch. 373, S.B.1019); 2010 Md. Laws 2420-21 (Vol.III, Ch. 374, H.B.1471).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">RP \u00a7 14-127 was most recently amended this year. Specifically, the references to the Code of Federal Regulations in RP \u00a7 14 \u2014 127(a)(4), (c)(2), and (d) were updated; the amendment became effective upon its enactment, and was approved by the Governor on March 14, 2016. <em>See </em>2016 Md. Laws - (Vol. \u2014 , Ch. 8, S.B.506).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">Upon consideration of the above-described circumstances, we conclude that RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s legislative history fails to demonstrate that an implied private right of action exists. The legislative history of RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s prohibition against persons connected \u201cwith the settlement of real estate transactions involving land in the State ... pay[ing] to or receiving] from another any consideration to solicit, obtain, retain, or arrange real estate settlement business\u201d is completely devoid of any mention whatsoever of an intent to create a private right of action on behalf of consumers of settlement services. There is simply nothing in RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s legislative history from which we can glean any intent on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>the General Assembly\u2019s part to create an implied private right of action. In other words, RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s legislative history is silent as to any intent to create an implied private right of action. \u201c[W]here the plain language of a provision weighs against implication of a private remedy, silence within the legislative history as to a private cause of action reinforces the decision not to find such a right implicitly.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>427 Md. at 714, 50 A.3d at 1125 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Scull, </em>435 Md. at 123, 76 A.3d at 1192 (\u201cWhile legislative silence is not conclusive, this certainly weighs against finding a private right of action.\u201d (Citation and footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Indeed, in reviewing RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s legislative history, we observe that the only indication that the General Assembly even considered creating a private right of action was in connection with House Bill 1074, which was introduced as part of the Polovoy Package along with House Bill 1075 (which became Art. 27, \u00a7 465A, RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s predecessor). Significantly, House Bill 1075 was intended to prohibit and criminalize kickbacks in real estate settlements, and the General Assembly was silent as to any intent to create a private right of action on behalf of consumers of settlement services who were allegedly harmed by a violation of the new prohibition against kickbacks. <em>See </em>1967 Md. Laws 1662-63 (Vol.II, Ch. 756, H.B.1075). By contrast, House Bill 1074 \u201cwould [have] ma[d]e title insurance companies financially liable for any misuse of funds changing hands in real estate settlements!,]\u201d Barnes, <em>supra, </em>at C2, or, stated otherwise, \u201cwould [have] h[e]ld title insurance companies liable for defalcations by their \u2018approved attorneys[,]\u2019\u201d Jay, <em>supra, </em>at B5. Plainly put, a review of RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s legislative history and the articles providing context for enactment of the prohibition against kickbacks in real estate settlements clearly shows that the General Assembly considered creating a private right of action only with respect to House Bill 1074, which was separate and distinct from House Bill 1075. The circumstance that the General Assembly considered creating a private right of action to hold title insurance companies financially liable for misuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>of settlement funds, but apparently did not consider the same with respect to the prohibition against kickbacks, further bolsters our determination that RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s legislative history is devoid of anything from which we can conclude that the General Assembly intended to create a private right of action.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">\n<em>Legislative Scheme/Purpose</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Finally, we examine whether an implied private right of action would be consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme. As an initial matter, we observe that RP \u00a7 14-127 is not part of a larger statutory scheme concerning, for example, real estate settlement services in general; rather, it is currently a part of the \u201cMiscellaneous Rules\u201d title in the Real Property Article. Before it became RP \u00a7 14-127, the statute was in the \u201cCrimes and Punishments\u201d article of the Code of Maryland. Nonetheless, despite not necessarily being one statute in a larger statutory scheme, it is evident from RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s plain language and legislative history that its purpose is to criminalize kickbacks in relation to settlement services, not to protect a certain class of individuals or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>create a private right of action on behalf of a specific class of individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Importantly, RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s predecessor, Art. 27, \u00a7 465A, was enacted and added to Article 27 of the Code of Maryland, entitled \u201cCrimes and Punishments,\u201d for the express purpose of prohibiting kickbacks in connection to settlement services. <em>See </em>1967 Md. Laws 1662 (Vol.II, Ch. 756, H.B.1075). And, as enacted, Art. 27, \u00a7 465A \u201cprovid[ed] penalties for violation of such provisions[,]\u201d by making a violation of the prohibition against kickbacks a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000, imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. 1967 Md. Laws 1662 (Vol.II, Ch. 756, H.B.1075). Stated otherwise, RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s predecessor\u2019s placement in a criminal law article is not consistent with the intent to create a private right of action, but rather supports the conclusion that RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s purpose is \u2014 and has always been \u2014 to criminalize behavior related to settlement kickbacks. Thus, as originally enacted, it is clear that Art. 27, \u00a7 465A\u2019s purpose was criminal in nature in that it created a new crime and set forth the possible punishments for conviction of that crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">That Art. 27, \u00a7 465A was intended to be a criminal statute is confirmed by its addition as RP \u00a7 14-127 through House Bill 11 in 2002. Indeed, in 2002, as part of the Code Revision that created the Criminal Law Article, Art. 27, \u00a7 465A was recodified as RP \u00a7 14-127. <em>See </em>2002 Md. Laws 197, 202, 1089-90 (Vol.I-11, Ch. 26, H.B.11). House Bill ll\u2019s stated purpose was, among other things, to create the Criminal Law Article \u201cto revise, restate, and recodify the laws of the State relating to criminal law; [and to] reviste], restat[e], and recodify[ ] certain provisions relating to ... real estate settlements[.]\u201d 2002 Md. Laws 197 (Vol.I, Ch. 26, H.B.11). House Bill 11\u2019s Fiscal Note stated that \u201cHouse Bill 11[ ] revise[d] in several other articles a number of provision relating to criminal law, regulatory, and enforcement matters originally codified in Article 27. These other articles include[d] ... [the] Real Property Article[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>From RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s plain language and legislative history, we have no difficulty in concluding that RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s purpose was criminal in nature, and not to create an implied private right of action on behalf of a specified protected class of individuals. Moreover, we note that, in addition to criminalizing kickbacks in connection with settlement services, RP \u00a7 14-127 effectively prevents practices that could increase the costs of settlement and limit competition among providers of settlement services; <em>ie., </em>RP \u00a7 14-127 helps keep the costs of settlement down and provides consumers with a wider choice of providers of settlement services than would otherwise be available absent the prohibition against kickbacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">As a final matter, we point out that RP \u00a7 14-127 furnishes a penalty for violations of RP \u00a7 14 \u2014 127(c)(1) and (d). Specifically, RP \u00a7 14-127(e) provides: \u201cA person who violates [RP \u00a7 14-127] is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 6 months or a fine not exceeding $1,000 or both.\u201d And, \u201c[e]ach violation of [RP \u00a7 14-127] is a separate violation.\u201d RP \u00a7 14 \u2014 127(f). Thus, RP \u00a7 14-127 does not prohibit certain conduct without providing any penalty or means of enforcement whatsoever; RP \u00a7 14-127 clearly provides a criminal penalty for violations. <em>Cf. Baker, </em>427 Md. at 713, 50 A.3d at 1125 (\u201cAn elemental canon of statutory construction is [that,] where a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, a court must be chary of reading others into it. Under [the statute at issue], citation recipients ... may (but are not obliged to) defend against receiving a citation on the basis that the local government violated [the statute]. This militates against finding a separate, private cause of action to enforce the statute.\u201d (Citations, brackets, footnotes, and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">In sum, as we did in <em>Baker, id. </em>at 714-15, 50 A.3d at 1126, here, we conclude that \u201cthe lack of discernible legislative intent to create an implied [right] of action in the plain language and structure of [RP \u00a7 14-127], its legislative history, or some other legitimate and reliable source cements the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>conclusion that the [General Assembly], in enacting [RP \u00a7 14-127], did not contemplate an implied private [right] of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">\n<em>Enforceable Duty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Given that, as part of our analysis of whether RP \u00a7 14-127 contains a private right of action, we conclude that Appellants are members of a group who receive a benefit from RP \u00a7 14-127, we shall address whether there otherwise exists a duty under RP \u00a7 14-127 pursuant to which Appellants may maintain a tort claim. Stated differently, we consider whether RP \u00a7 14-127 gives rise to an actionable duty that inures to the benefit of Appellants. We determine that there is no such enforceable duty arising under RP \u00a7 14-127 and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">In <em>Baker, </em>427 Md. at 711 <em>&amp; </em>n. 16, 50 A.3d at 1123 &amp; n. 16, we determined that, because the statute at issue did \u201cnot confer rights on a class of persons[,]\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201calternative argument that their causes of action are based on common law tort duties\u201d was \u201cforeclose^,]\u201d explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">A statute creates an enforceable duty when the plaintiff is a member of the class of persons [whom] the statute was designed to protect and the injury was of the type [that] the statute was designed to prevent. Furthermore, the statute must set forth mandatory acts clearly for the protection of a particular class of persons rather than the public as a whole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\">In <em>Gourdine [v. Crews, </em>405 Md. 722, 757, 955 A.2d 769, 790 (2008) ], the plaintiff argued that the following language in the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act created an enforceable duty in the defendant drug manufacturer: \u201cThe following acts and the causing thereof are prohibited: (a) The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food, drug, device, or cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded.\u201d We disagreed, noting that the statute was framed to protect the public in general. In <em>Muthukumarana [v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>370 Md. 447, 499-500, 805 A.2d 372, 403 (2002) ], a Maryland statute required all counties to have an operational 9-1-1 system to protect the safety and well-being of Marylanders. The plaintiff posited that the statute placed on a 9-1-1 operator a duty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>care to an injured citizen utilizing that service. Again, we disagreed, stating that statutory language requiring broad emergency services did not evince a special benefit to a particular class of persons: \u201cIn our view, acting to protect or assist a specific group of individuals, sufficient to create a special relationship, involves more than general actions taken to serve members of the public at large in need of emergency telephone services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">The assertedly relevant portion of the present statute, like the statutes in <em>Gourdine </em>and <em>Muthukumarana, </em>protects the public in general by prohibiting certain contingency fees, without enumerating a particular class of persons. Therefore, no actionable tort duty inures from [the statute] to the benefit of [the plaintiffs].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">(Some citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">By contrast, in <em>Blackburn Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Paul, </em>438 Md. 100, 111-12, 90 A.3d 464, 470-71 (2014), we explained that, pursuant to the Statute or Ordinance Rule, a plaintiff may demonstrate a <em>prima facie </em>case in negligence \u2014 a common law tort\u2014 by showing, among other things, the violation of a statute or ordinance that was intended to protect a particular class of people that includes the plaintiff. Specifically, in <em>Blackburn, id. </em>at 128, 90 A.3d at 480, we held that the defendants\u2019 alleged violation of a Code of Maryland Regulation (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) pertaining to barriers surrounding public swimming pools, \u201cif proven, would demonstrate the breach of a duty from\u201d the defendants to a three-year-old child who \u201centered the pool [of his apartment complex] by slipping through [an] allegedly defective gate\u201d; that \u201c[s]uch a duty, derived from statute, would apply irrespective of [the child]\u2019s legal status on the property when the incident occurred\u201d; and that \u201c[a] reasonable trier of fact could find that such a duty existed, that [the defendants violated this duty, and that such violation was the cause of [the child]\u2019s injuries.\u201d In <em>Blackburn, id. </em>at 110, 90 A.3d at 469-70, we acknowledged that the child was a trespasser, and that ordinarily a property owner owes a very limited common law tort duty to trespassers. However, we explained that \u201cthe Statute or Ordinance Rule\u201d provided an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>exception to that limited duty, and that the \u201cRule can apply irrespective of a property owner\u2019s duty to trespassers under the common law[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111, 117, 90 A.3d at 470, 474. We explained that, under the Statute or Ordinance Rule,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATA\">to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case in a negligence action, all that a plaintiff must show is: (a) the violation of a statute or ordinance designed to protect a specific class of persons [that] includes the plaintiff, and (b) that the violation proximately caused the injury complained of. Proximate cause is established by determining whether the plaintiff is within the class of persons sought to be protected, and the harm suffered is of a kind [that] the drafters intended the statute to prevent. It is the existence of this cause and effect relationship that makes the violation of a statute <em>prima facie </em>evidence of negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 112, 90 A.3d at 471 (citation, internal quotation marks, and asterisks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Applying the Statute or Ordinance Rule, we held that \u201cthe COMAR regulations incorporate^] the Model Barrier Code, which [ ] identified] a specific class \u2014 namely, young children under the age of five years[,]\u201d who were a \u201cspecial class of young children that COMAR most assuredly recognize[d] as beneficiaries of the pool owner\u2019s duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125, 90 A.3d at 479. Under COMAR, the defendants \u201cwere required to provide a barrier that did not allow passage of a sphere 4 inches in diameter, except when the entrance gate was open.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125, 90 A.3d at 479 (citation omitted). We explained that COMAR set forth requirements for pool owners that were specifically meant to protect the class that was identified in the Model Barrier Code \u2014 children under the age of five. <em>See id. </em>at 125, 90 A.3d at 479. We concluded that the child, who was three years old at the time of the accident, \u201cwas clearly a member of this protected class.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126, 90 A.3d at 479. The holding in <em>Blackburn </em>gave rise to common law tort duty under the Statute or Ordinance Rule. <em>Blackburn </em>did not purport to establish a test for whether a statute gives rise to a private right of action for any and all actions that a plaintiff may seek to pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>In this case, we hold that there is no enforceable common law duty arising under RP \u00a7 14-127. Among the inquiries in determining whether there is an enforceable common law duty under RP \u00a7 14-127 are whether Appellants are members of the class of persons whom RP \u00a7 14-127 was designed to protect and whether the injury was the type that RP \u00a7 14-127 was designed to prevent. <em>See Baker, </em>427 Md. at 711 n. 16, 50 A.3d at 1123 n. 16; <em>Blackburn, </em>438 Md. at 112, 90 A.3d at 471. The first inquiry is not satisfied in this case, as there is a difference between being a member of a group who arguably receives a benefit from a statute and being a member of a class whose injury the statute was designed to protect. A review of RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s plain language, legislative history, and legislative purpose does not reveal any indication on the General Assembly\u2019s part to protect an identifiable class of persons. As discussed above, although Appellants, as consumers of settlements services, are members of a class who incidentally receive the benefit of RP \u00a7 14-127, at core, RP \u00a7 14-127 is a criminal statute that fails to mention, let alone identify with any specificity, consumers of settlement services, the public in general, or some other group of persons who are intended to be protected by RP \u00a7 14-127. Rather, RP \u00a7 14-127(c)(1) simply contains a general prohibition that persons connected \u201cwith the settlement of real estate transactions involving land in the State may not pay to or receive from another any consideration to solicit, obtain, retain, or arrange real estate settlement business\u201d; <em>ie., </em>RP \u00a7 14-127(c)(1) contains only a prohibition, the by-product of which is a benefit that inures to consumers of settlement services. And, RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s legislative history does not reveal that RP \u00a7 14-127 was enacted to create a tort duty that applies to persons who are connected with settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\"><em>Blackburn </em>and the regulations at issue in Blackburn are readily distinguishable from RP \u00a7 14-127 and the circumstances of this case. In <em>Blackburn, id. </em>at 103, 105, 126-27, 90 A.3d at 466, 467, 479, the plaintiffs claim was grounded in the common law tort of negligence, but, due to the child\u2019s status as a trespasser and because a property owner owes no affirma <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>tive duty of care to a trespasser, the plaintiff could not pursue such a claim; we held that, under the Statute or Ordinance Rule, the plaintiff could establish that: the child was a member of a protected class, <em>ie., </em>the class that COMAR was designed to protect; the fence failed to meet the requirements of COMAR; and there was sufficient circumstantial evidence of causation. Stated otherwise, <em>Blackburn </em>is a case in which this Court specifically found the violation of an ordinance or statute could under certain circumstances serve as evidence of negligence. Moreover, in <em>Blackburn, id. </em>at 125, 90 A.3d at 479, the regulatory history of the relevant COMAR provisions demonstrated that they were specifically designed to protect a specific class of persons \u2014 namely, children under the age of five \u2014 who could be harmed by pool barriers not complying with the regulation. Thus, COMAR clearly created a duty that was specifically intended to protect young children. <em>See id. </em>at 125, 90 A.3d at 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">By contrast, here, Appellants do not bring a claim of negligence against Appellees; as such, this is not a case where a violation of RP \u00a7 14-127 could serve as evidence of Appellees\u2019 negligence. First, as a practical matter, in the second amended complaint, Appellants allege a knowing and deliberate illegal kickback <em>scheme </em>\u2014 ie., knowing violations of laws, including RP \u00a7 14-127 \u2014 as opposed to negligence; thus, there is no underlying issue of duty. Even if a violation of RP \u00a7 14-127 could theoretically serve as evidence of Appellees\u2019 negligence under <em>Blackburn, </em>such a conclusion is meaningless in the context of this case, where Appellants have not alleged that Appellees were negligent in the first instance, and where the nature of Appellants\u2019 allegations would not support a negligence claim. At oral argument, Appellants\u2019 counsel acknowledged that the conduct that was involved in this ease was \u201cintentional,]\u201d that Appellees could not \u201cnegligently pay a kickback[,]\u201d and that Appellants\u2019 action was not a \u201cnegligence-based action[.]\u201d Equally significant is our determination that RP \u00a7 14-127 does not, and was not intended or designed to, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>protect a specific class of persons. This determination is fatal to any contention that RP \u00a7 14-127 creates an enforceable duty.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">\n<em>Policy Considerations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Before concluding, we pause to address policy considerations raised by Appellants. Specifically, Appellants contend that implying a private right of action, <em>ie., </em>a civil remedy, is a more effective and efficient remedy than a criminal penalty alone because implying a private right of action \u201cwould provide an incentive for those subject to the statute\u2019[s] mandatory acts to conform to the statute in regard to each potential liability[-]indueing <em>event </em>\u2014 ie., in each and every real estate transaction.\u201d Appellants argue that, absent a private right of action, they and other consumers will lack \u201caccess to [S]tate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>court\u201d and will be forced to seek relief in the federal court, which they maintain is more expensive and less accessible.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Appellees respond that whether a civil remedy is more effective and efficient is irrelevant where the General Assembly neither expressly nor by implication intended to create a private right of action. Appellees argue that whether or not an alleged victim can seek redress in State court has no bearing in determining whether a statute provides a private right of action. And, Appellees assert that, in any event, an alleged victim can bring a RESPA claim in State court. We agree with Appellees in all respects and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">As discussed in detail above, whether a State statute contains an implied private right of action turns on three specific inquiries concerning class, legislative intent, and legislative purpose. <em>See Scull, </em>435 Md. at 121-22, 76 A.3d at 1191. That an implied private right of action allegedly would be a \u201cbetter\u201d remedy is simply not one of the considerations that we take into account, and, thus, such a consideration is irrelevant for purposes of determining whether a statute contains an implied private right of action. Indeed, we are concerned only with whether there is any basis from which we could conclude that the General Assembly, either expressly or impliedly, intended to create a private right of action. <em>See Baker, </em>427 Md. at 710, 50 A.3d at 1123 (\u201c[T]he central inquiry remains whether the legislative body intended to create, either expressly or by implication, a private cause of action.\u201d (Citation, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted)). Here, there is nothing from which we can glean any intent on the General Assembly\u2019s part to create an express or implied private right of action under RP \u00a7 14-127. Additionally, we note that it is the General Assembly\u2019s province to create private rights of action, as it is \u201clegislative bodies [that] know how to \u2018salt the mine\u2019 for the enablement of implied private causes of action.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>427 Md. at 715, 50 A.3d at 1126 (citations omitted). In other words, such policy considerations are best presented to the General Assembly, not this Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>and it would be up to the General Assembly to create a private right of action if it so chooses.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">As to lacking access to State court, we disagree with Appellants\u2019 position. First, whether an alleged victim is able to redress his or her harm in a State court is not a consideration in determining whether a State statute contains an implied private right of action. Second, under RESPA, an alleged victim is permitted to bring a claim for violation of RESPA\u2019s provisions in either State or federal court. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2614 (\u201cAny action pursuant to the provisions of section 2605, 2607, or 2608 of this title may be brought in the United States district court or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, for the district in which the property involved is located, or where the violation is alleged to have occurred[.]\u201d); <em>cf. R.A. Ponte Architects, Ltd. v. Investors\u2019 Alert, Inc., </em>382 Md. 689, 691, 857 A.2d 1, 2 (2004) (This Court held that \u201ca private cause of action for damages, under the provisions of the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act, for the receipt of unsolicited commercial telephone facsimile messages ... may be brought in courts of this State.\u201d (Citation omitted)). That a case filed in State court, in which a plaintiff claims a RESPA violation, subsequently can be removed to the federal court is of no consequence to whether that plaintiff still has a remedy for alleged violations of RESPA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(a) (\u201cA defendant ... desiring to remove any civil action from a State court shall file in the district court of the United States for the district and division within which such action is pending a notice of removal ... and containing a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">As a final matter, we observe that our holding in this case\u2014 that RP \u00a7 14-127 does not contain an express or implied private right of action \u2014 in no way deprives Appellants of a remedy altogether. As discussed above, RP \u00a7 14-127(e) provides criminal penalties for those who are convicted of violating RP \u00a7 14-127(c)(1)\u2019s prohibition against kickbacks. And, under RESPA, Appellants are specifically provided a private right of action for the type of conduct prohibited under RP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>\u00a7 14-127. Specifically, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2607(a) prohibits persons from giving or accepting \u201cany fee, kickback, or thing of value pursuant to any agreement or understanding, oral or otherwise, that business incident to or a part of a real estate settlement service involving a federally related mortgage loan shall be referred to any person.\u201d And 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2607(b) prohibits persons from giving or accepting \u201cany portion, split, or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2607(d) provides both criminal and civil penalties, stating, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">(1) Any person or persons who violate the provisions of this section shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">(2) Any person or persons who violate the prohibitions or limitations of this section shall be jointly and severally liable to the person or persons charged for the settlement service involved in the violation in an amount equal to three times the amount of any charge paid for such settlement service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">(5) In any private action brought pursuant to this subsection, the court may award to the prevailing party the court costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Thus, nothing in our holding today deprives Appellants of their private right of action against Appellees under RE SPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">In sum, we hold that RP \u00a7 14-127 does not contain an express or implied private right of action, as neither RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s plain language, legislative history, nor legislative purpose demonstrate any intent on the General Assembly\u2019s part to create a private right of action.

For two reasons, we identify the class as including consumers of both residential and commercial settlement services, and not just consumers of residential settlement services, such as Appellants. First, RP \u00a7 14-127(c)(1) does not limit the prohibition against paying or receiving \"any consideration to solicit, obtain, retain, or arrange real estate settlement business\u201d to residential real estate settlement business. Instead, RP \u00a7 14-127(c)(1) refers broadly to \u201creal estate transactions\u201d and \"real estate settlement business\u201d without specifying only residential real estate transactions and residential real estate settlement business. Second, in contrast to RP \u00a7 14 \u2014 127(c)(1), RP \u00a7 14 \u2014 127(d) applies only to \"residential real estate transactions!,]\u201d which RP \u00a7 14-127(a)(4) defines as \"a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan as defined in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2602 and 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.2.\u201d In other words, had the General Assembly intended the prohibition in RP \u00a7 14-127(c)(1) to apply only to residential real estate transactions, it would have said so, as evidenced by RP \u00a7 14-127(d); however, the General Assembly did not limit RP \u00a7 14-127(c)(1) in such a manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b734-10\">, Before this Court, Appellees moved to strike two newspaper articles from <em>The Sun </em>that were included in the appendix to Appellants' reply brief, as well as all references to the newspaper articles contained in Appellants\u2019 reply brief, on the ground that the newspaper articles are not part of the record. We deny the motion to strike. Even if the newspaper articles were not included in the record, in reviewing RP \u00a7 14-127's legislative history, this Court would have undoubtedly uncovered the newspaper articles, which provide useful context concerning the circumstances surrounding the enactment of Art. 27, \u00a7 465A, RP \u00a7 14-127\u2019s predecessor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b740-6\">. Additionally, we note that, in 2010, when the General Assembly amended RP \u00a7 14-127 to provide specific references and citations to RESPA, it failed to include or otherwise incorporate a private right of action into RP \u00a7 14-127, even though RESPA contains an express private right of action. <em>See 12 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2607(d)(5) (\"In any private action brought pursuant to this subsection, the court may award to the prevailing party the court costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys fees.\u201d (Emphasis added)).

To be sure, in amending RP \u00a7 14-127 in 2010, the General Assembly did not expressly state that it was rejecting a civil remedy. Nonetheless, that the General Assembly was aware that RESPA provides a private right of action for those who are harmed by violations of its provisions, and yet chose not to amend RP \u00a7 14-127 to similarly provide a private right of action for violations of RP \u00a7 14-127(c)(1), lends additional support to the determination that the General Assembly did not intend to create a private right of action under RP \u00a7 14-127.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b748-7\">.

We further stated that there existed a common law tort duty under the statutes, explaining, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">The legislative policy of preventing future harm to children already reported to have been abused is so abundantly clear as to be beyond cavil, and, given the statutory mandate to act and the general waiver of tort immunity when State employees fail to act in a reasonable way and harm ensues, we can see no great burden or consequence to regarding this existing statutory duty as a civil one from which tort liability may arise.... The [General Assembly] meant for [the Department of Social Services] and its social workers to act immediately and aggressively when specific reports of abuse or neglect are made, and the best way to assure that is done is to find that they do have a special relationship with specific children identified in or, upon reasonable effort, identifiable from, facially reliable reports of abuse or neglect and, subject to the State Tort Claims Act, to make them liable if harm occurs because they fail in their mandated duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ3\"><em>Id. </em>at 193, 854 A.2d at 1245 (emphasis omitted). Again, in contrast to <em>Horridge, </em>there is no legislative policy or legislative history identifying consumers of settlements services as a class of persons needing protection, such that we could conclude that RP \u00a7 14-127 creates a common law tort duty owed to those consumers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
