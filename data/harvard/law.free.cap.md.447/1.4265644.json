United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). The issues have their genesis in Petitioner Donald R. Twigg\u2019s conviction of child abuse, second degree rape, third degree sexual offense, and incest against his daughter. As charged, any one of the three sexual offenses could have provided the basis for the child abuse conviction. The trial court sentenced Petitioner to a total of forty years\u2019 incarceration: consecutive terms of twenty years for second degree rape, ten years for third degree sexual offense, and ten years for incest; for child abuse, the court imposed a fifteen-year sentence, but suspended the entirety of that time in favor of five years\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">We must decide whether all, or only one, of the sexual offenses merge for sentencing purposes with the sentence for child abuse. We also must decide whether Maryland law permits a remand to afford the trial court the opportunity to consider resentencing on the child abuse conviction and, if so, the limits within which the court must operate when considering a new sentence for that crime. We hold that only the sentence Petitioner received for second degree rape must be vacated, by application of <em>State v. Johnson, </em>442 Md. 211, 112 A.3d 383 (2015). We further hold that Maryland Rule 8-604(d) authorizes a remand for a new sentencing hearing and, at that hearing, the sentencing court has the discretion to resentence Petitioner to a term of active incarceration on the child abuse conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">\n<em>The Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">In 2011, Petitioner was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Charles County on an indictment charging that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>committed the crime of child abuse of his daughter, by engaging in various sexual offenses against her during the period spanning March 25, 1974, and January 1, 1979. Each of the charged sexual offenses was alleged to have occurred within a particular subpart of that nearly five-year timeframe, while his daughter was between the ages of nine and fourteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">We need not detail all of the evidence presented at trial. It is enough to say that the jury heard evidence, primarily through the testimony of the daughter, from which the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that during the identified timeframes Petitioner committed the following four crimes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Between July 1, 1976, and March 25, 1978, he committed a third degree sexual offense<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by touching his daughter\u2019s vagina and making her touch his penis. Between July 1, 1976, the effective date of the then-new rape statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>and March 25, 1978, he committed second degree rape.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Between March 25, 1974, and January 1, 1979, he committed incest<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by engaging in vaginal intercourse with his daughter. And, throughout that time he committed child abuse \u201cby engaging in sexual molestation and sexual exploitation.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>At the close of all the evidence, the court instructed the jury that, to convict Petitioner of the crime of \u201csexual child abuse,\u201d the jury was required to find, among other elements, that Petitioner engaged in sexual molestation or exploitation of his daughter. The court further instructed that the dates identified in the charging document for child sexual abuse \u201ccover the entire period,\u201d that child sexual abuse is \u201ca generic type of charge,\u201d and that \u201cthe other [sexual offense] charges are specifications within that generic charge.\u201d The State argued in closing that Petitioner committed the \u201csexual molestation or sexual exploitation\u201d element of child abuse by engaging in any of the charged sexual offenses. The State did not seek to prove or argue in closing that the child abuse charge was \u2014 or could be \u2014 based on evidence of molestation or exploitation other than that which the State offered in support of the various charged sexual offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The jury completed a verdict sheet finding Petitioner guilty of child abuse, second degree rape, third degree sexual offense, and incest. The jury was not directed either by the judge or on the verdict sheet to specify which of the charged sexual offense(s) satisfied the molestation/exploitation element of the child abuse conviction. As mentioned at the outset, the court imposed consecutive sentences for rape, third degree sexual offense, and incest, and a fifteen-year suspended sentence for child abuse, for a total of forty years of active incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\n<em>The Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Petitioner argued before the Court of Special Appeals that he was entitled to have the \u201cseparate convictions and/or sentences\u201d for the three sexual offenses vacated as lesser included offenses of that crime. He rested the argument on the Fifth Amendment provision, held applicable to the states, that \u201c[n]o person shall ... be subject for the same offence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb,\u201d requiring merger of a lesser included offense as set forth in <em>Blockburger. </em>For that proposition, Petitioner relied primarily upon the reasoning and holding of <em>Nightingale v. State, </em>312 Md. 699, 542 A.2d 373 (1988). The Court of Special Appeals agreed with Petitioner that he was entitled to have all three sexual offenses \u2014 second degree rape, third degree sexual offense, and incest \u2014 vacated, under <em>Nightingale. Twigg v. State, </em>219 Md.App. 259, 272, 100 A.3d 1187 (2014). At the time the intermediate appellate court issued <em>Twigg, </em>we had not yet decided <em>State v. Johnson, </em>442 Md. 211, 112 A.3d 383 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The Court of Special Appeals further held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">(1) under the circumstances of the instant case, this Court has the discretionary authority to remand the case to the trial court for the purpose of imposing a new sentence on [Petitioner] for his sexual child abuse conviction, and (2) on remand, the trial court may impose any sentence it deems proper up to the maximum penalty prescribed by the child abuse statute for such offense committed from July 1, 1974 through January 1,1979.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">219 Md.App. at 282, 100 A.3d 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The Court of Special Appeals concluded that resentencing on the greater offense is permissible because the trial court had failed to merge the lesser offenses, <em>id. </em>at 284-85,100 A.3d 1187, reasoning that the trial judge is entitled to consider the \u201ctotal sentence for all of the convictions together,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 287, 100 A.3d 1187. The Court of Special Appeals explained that it would defy common sense to conclude that Petitioner\u2019s sentence would be unlawfully increased, even if the judge on remand were to impose the maximum fifteen years of active incarceration on the child abuse conviction, because Petitioner\u2019s total sentence would not exceed the total forty-year sentence imposed originally. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">Both Petitioner and the State sought issuance of a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. Petitioner asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>1. When an appellate court holds that a lesser included offense (or offenses) should have been merged into the greater offense and it vacates the sentences that were merged for the lesser offense (or offenses), does the appellate court have authority to vacate the sentence imposed for the greater offense and remand for re-sentencing/new sentencing for that offense where there has been no challenge on appeal to the legality of the conviction or sentence for the greater offense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-5\">2. In this case, did the Court of Special Appeals have authority and/or discretion to remand the case for re-sentencing/new sentencing on the greater offense of child sexual abuse after correctly holding that the lesser included offenses of second degree rape, third degree sexual offense, and incest must merge into child sexual abuse for sentencing purposes?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The State asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">Where Twigg was convicted of child sexual abuse and three statutory sexual offenses (incest, second degree rape, and third degree sexual offense) \u2014 any one of which supports a conviction for child sexual abuse \u2014 should only one of the statutory sexual offenses merge for purposes of sentencing, rather than all three?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">We answer \u201cyes\u201d to all three questions and, accordingly, affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. We begin by addressing the State\u2019s cross-petition on merger and then will address Petitioner\u2019s two questions on resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">The State urges us to reverse the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s holding that all of the sexual offense convictions merge for purposes of sentencing. In the State\u2019s view, when, as happened here, the jury did not specify which of the sexual offenses satisfied the molestation/exploitation element of child abuse, the law requires that only one of those offenses, in this case, second degree rape, merges for sentencing purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>with the conviction and sentence for child abuse. For that proposition, the State relies on our recently-decided <em>Johnson </em>opinion. The State further argues that <em>Nightingale </em>does not mandate a different result.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Petitioner counters that <em>Johnson </em>does not dictate the outcome the State seeks and, contrary to the State\u2019s reading of <em>Nightingale, </em>application of that case requires that the sentences for all three of the sexual offenses \u2014 second degree rape, incest, and third degree sexual offense \u2014 merge with the sentence for child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Resolution of this dispute requires us first to determine what we did \u2014 and did not \u2014 decide in <em>Nightingale </em>insofar as it relates to the State\u2019s cross-petition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\n<em>Nightingale (and Myers) v. State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">There were two petitioners in <em>Nightingale, </em>Carol Nightingale and Albert James Joseph Myers, Sr. Both were charged with committing child abuse under the then-extant statute, <em>see swpra </em>note 5, by engaging in sexual molestation or exploitation of their respective daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Petitioner Nightingale was tried before a jury on charges of second degree rape, incest, common law battery, perverted practice, and second degree sexual offense, in addition to child abuse. All of the crimes were alleged to have been committed \u201con or about 1977 to 1982\u201d when his daughter was \u201cunder 14 years of age.\u201d 312 Md. at 700-01, 542 A.2d 373. The victim \u201ctestified that on various occasions during the years in question her father had engaged in sexual activity with her, beginning with fondling and culminating with vaginal intercourse, fellatio, and cunnilingus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 701, 542 A.2d 373. Nightingale was acquitted on the charges of battery, perverted practices, second degree rape, and incest. The jury found him guilty of child abuse and second degree sexual offense. For those crimes, the court imposed consecutive sentences of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Petitioner Myers was tried before a jury on three consolidated criminal informations, only two of which contained charges resulting in guilty verdicts. <em>Id. </em>at 701-02 &amp; n. 2, 542 A.2d 373. The first of those, Number 7317, charged Myers with committing child abuse as well as second, third, and fourth degree sexual offenses upon his daughter; the charges were alleged to have occurred \u201cbetween November, 1983 through February, 1985,\u201d while she was under fourteen years of age. Number 7319 charged Myers with child abuse by committing third and fourth degree sexual offenses against his daughter in a single incident \u201con or about August 3, 1985,\u201d during which, the daughter testified, Myers \u201cthrust his hand inside her panties and touched her vagina.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 701-02, 542 A.2d 373. The jury found Myers guilty of all the charges in Number 7317 and 7319. In case Number 7317, the court imposed four concurrent sentences, the longest of which was twenty years of incarceration for second degree sexual offense. In case Number 7319, the court imposed three concurrent sentences, the longest of which was fifteen years for child sexual abuse, with ten of those years suspended, and made the sentences consecutive to those in Number 7317. <em>Id. </em>at 702, 542 A.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Both Nightingale and Myers argued before this Court that, \u201cfor double jeopardy purposes, their convictions and sentences for child abuse and sexual offenses cannot stand because the crimes are the same under the required evidence test of <em>Blockburger.\u201d Id. </em>at 702, 542 A.2d 373. We described that test as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">If each offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not, the offenses are not the same and do not merge. However, if only one offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not, the offenses are deemed the same, and separate sentences for each offense are prohibited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 703, 542 A.2d 373 (quoting <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260, 268, 373 A.2d 262 (1977)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We noted, with regard to the then-applicable child abuse statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">[CJhild abuse, taken in its broadest sense, involves certain elements <em>(e.g., </em>physical harm and a particular relationship between actor and victim) that none of the sexual offenses do. By the same token, each of the sexual-offenses requires some elements <em>(e.g., </em>performance of a sexual act or sexual contact and sexual arousal or gratification) that child abuse does not. But the analysis does not end at this point. When a multi-purpose criminal statute is involved, we refine it by looking at the alternative elements relevant to the case at hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">312 Md. at 705, 542 A.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">This \u201calternative elements\u201d approach was not newly minted in <em>Nightingale; </em>the Court had employed it in several prior cases including, for example, <em>Newton v. State.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Petitioner Newton had been convicted of and separately sentenced for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>felony murder and the underlying attempted robbery of the murder victim. <em>Newton, </em>280 Md. at 262-63, 373 A.2d 262. We noted in <em>Nightingale </em>that the <em>Newton </em>Court had \u201clooked to the alternative elements involved in the felony murder\u201d variety of first degree murder and, because punishment for both the \u201cunderlying felony and murder committed in the perpetration of that felony constitute, under the required evidence test, double punishment for the same offense in violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s double jeopardy clause,\u201d the underlying felony conviction merged with the murder conviction. <em>Nightingale, </em>312 Md. at 705, 542 A.2d 373 (quoting <em>Newton, </em>280 Md. at 273-74, 373 A.2d 262). We summarized the alternative elements analysis employed in <em>Newton </em>and other cases involving multi-purpose statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">When, as here, a multi-purpose criminal statute is involved, the court must construct from the alternative elements within the statute the particular formulation that applies to the case at hand. It should rid the statute of alternative elements that do not apply. It must, in other words, treat a multi-purpose statute written in the alternative as it would treat separate statutes. The theory behind the analysis is that a criminal statute written in the alternative creates a separate offense for each alternative and should therefore be treated for double jeopardy purposes as separate statutes would. If, when we look at the applicable alternative elements, a lesser offense in effect becomes one of the elements of another offense, the <em>Blockburger </em>test is met. It is met because, by virtue of that fact, all the elements of the lesser offense must be established to prove the other; only the other offense has any additional elements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 706-07, 542 A.2d 373 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">We recognized that sexual offense statutes, as well as the then-extant child abuse statute, are multi-purpose statutes, in that all of them punish \u201cseveral different types of conduct, which may be treated as separate statutory offenses for double jeopardy purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 706, 542 A.2d 373. We identified the elements of each of the relevant crimes charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>in Nightingale\u2019s and Myers\u2019s cases and considered those elements in light of the evidence produced, the court\u2019s instructions, the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments, and, in Nightingale\u2019s case, how the judge answered the jury\u2019s question, asking whether \u201c \u2018touching, in the wrong places, alone, constitute^] child abuse as described in our instructions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707-08, 542 A.2d 378 (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">With respect to criminal information Number 7319 in Myers\u2019s case, we reasoned that \u201cthe jury must have found a sexual offense as the basis of the child abuse verdict, because that information involved but a single incident of sexual contact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 708, 542 A.2d 373. As for the remaining child abuse charges (in Nightingale\u2019s case and in information Number 7317 in Myers\u2019s ease), in each, the child abuse charge spanned a period of time. With respect to those child abuse charges, we were unable to discern whether the juries had based their guilty verdicts on one or more of the charged sexual offenses or, instead, some other form of sexual molestation or exploitation not rising to the level of a sexual offense. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\">[A] jury could have reached various decisions as to child abuse and sexual offenses, all of which were reflected in general verdicts of guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">The problem, then, is that we cannot tell whether these general verdicts of guilty were based on the use of sexual offenses as lesser included offenses (or elements) of child abuse, or whether the child abuse verdicts were based on other reasons <em>{e.g., </em>some sort of sexual molestation which the juries thought did not rise to the level of a sexual offense in any degree). In these circumstances we resolve the ambiguity in favor of the defendants and set aside the judgments on the sexual offense counts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">In Nightingale\u2019s case, we merged the second degree sexual offense into the child abuse conviction. In Myers\u2019s case Number 7317, we merged all three sexual offenses into the child abuse conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Notable for present purposes, we did not explain <em>why </em>we merged all of the underlying sexual offenses into the respective child sexual abuse convictions. Indeed, the only ambiguity expressly identified in <em>Nightingale </em>related to whether the juries based their guilty verdicts on some act of sexual molestation or exploitation other than one of the charged sexual offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The precise question put before us by the State in the present case was not considered in <em>Nightingale, </em>and, consequently, that case does not dictate the outcome here. We are not left, however, to write on a clean slate, as the answer to the question presented is found in <em>Johnson, </em>our recent decision applying <em>Blockburger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\n<em>State v. Johnson</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Petitioner Johnson was convicted of felony murder and two underlying felonies, kidnapping and robbery, and sentenced separately on all three convictions. He appealed, arguing that he was entitled, by application of <em>Blockburger, </em>to have the sentences for both underlying felonies merge with his conviction and sentence for felony murder. The Court of Special Appeals in an unreported opinion agreed with Johnson and vacated the sentences for both underlying felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">We granted the State\u2019s petition for certiorari and reversed the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. We concluded that the law requires that only one of the underlying \u201cpredicate\u201d felonies merges and, because it was not clear upon which of the two felonies the jury found Johnson guilty of felony murder, \u201cthe conviction for the predicate felony with the greatest maximum sentence merges for sentencing purposes.\u201d 442 Md. at 221, 112 A.3d 383. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-9\">Because only one predicate felony is required to support a felony murder conviction, once the State proves a predicate felony and the death of the victim as a result of that felony, the crime of felony murder is complete, and, for the required evidence test\u2019s purposes, all of felony murder\u2019s elements have been satisfied such that the elements of any additional predicate felonies would be redundant. In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>words, once one merger for sentencing purposes occurs, as to felony murder and one predicate felony, the elements of any additional predicate felonies are no longer required elements of felony murder. For the required evidence test\u2019s purposes, the pairing of the conviction for one predicate felony with the felony murder conviction leaves no room for a pairing with any additional predicate felonies. In sum, once the conviction for one predicate felony merges, application of the required evidence test does not result in further merger of convictions for other predicate felonies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 222-23, 112 A.3d 383 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\n<em>The Present Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The reasoning of <em>Johnson </em>applies equally to the case before us. The jury found Petitioner guilty of second degree rape, incest, and third degree sexual offense as well as child sexual abuse. Any one of the sexual offenses satisfies the molestation/exploitation \u201celement\u201d of child sexual abuse. By tracking the Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Johnson, </em>the answer to the <em>Bloekburger </em>multiple punishment merger question before us becomes clear. Once the State proves a predicate sexual offense and abuse of a child victim as a result of that predicate offense, the crime of child sexual abuse is complete, and, for purposes of the required evidence test, the sexual molestation/exploitation element of child sexual abuse is satisfied, rendering redundant, for the purpose of <em>Blockburger </em>multiple punishment merger, additional predicate sexual offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">It is not necessary that Petitioner\u2019s jury be unanimous with respect to the act that involved the sexual molestation or exploitation of his daughter. <em>See Cooksey v. State, </em>359 Md. 1, 23-24, 752 A.2d 606 (2000); <em>cf. Rice v. State, </em>311 Md. 116, 122-23, 532 A.2d 1357 (1987) (holding that the jury need not be unanimous with regard to the mode of commission of theft, so long as the jury was unanimous that the property was wrongfully taken from the owner). This is so because abuse of a child is the gravamen of the offense of child sexual abuse, not the particular sexual act involving molestation or exploitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>itself. <em>See Crispino v. State, </em>417 Md. 31, 45, 47-50, 7 A.3d 1092 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The jury was instructed, and the State argued, that each of the sexual offenses was charged as a \u201cspecification\u201d of child abuse. So long as the jurors were unanimous that Petitioner committed child sexual abuse, which obviously they were, it is of no consequence that they may not have agreed on which of the underlying sexual offenses supplied the \u201celement\u201d of sexual molestation or exploitation that supported the child abuse conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Petitioner argues that he is entitled to have all of the lesser included offenses merge because the State charged child abuse as a continuing offense. He states that it is \u201csimply impossible\u201d to discern from this record \u201cwhether the jury convicted petitioner of child sexual abuse based upon <em>all </em>of the underlying sexual conduct and/or offenses, <em>generally </em>(or, perhaps, based on some other conduct that did not rise to the level of a sexual offense in any degree).\u201d Putting aside that <em>Nightingale </em>\u2014 the sole case upon which Petitioner relies for this proposition \u2014 did not discuss the question presented here, nothing in this trial record remotely suggests that the jury found Petitioner guilty of child sexual abuse based on \u201csome other conduct that did not rise to the level of a sexual offense in any degree.\u201d Likewise, given the evidence at trial, we cannot imagine that any one or more of the jurors found Petitioner guilty of child abuse only by combining his crimes of rape, incest, and third degree sexual offense, or some combination of two of the three.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Finally, because we cannot discern which of the three sexual offenses the jury relied upon in finding Petitioner guilty of child abuse, we resolve that ambiguity by holding, as we did in <em>Johnson, </em>442 Md. at 221, 224-25, 112 A.3d 383, that Petitioner is entitled to have the crime that carries the greatest maximum sentence merge for sentencing purposes with the child abuse sentence. This means, and we so hold, that Petitioner is entitled to have vacated the twenty-year sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>for second degree rape.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Petitioner is not entitled to merger of the sentences imposed on his convictions for the crimes of incest and third degree sexual offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The Court of Special Appeals ordered a remand to the Circuit Court for a new sentencing hearing on the child abuse conviction. Petitioner raises two concerns in connection with that disposition. He first argues that the Court of Special Appeals, and by implication this Court, does not have the authority to order the remand. He further argues that imposing a new sentence on the child abuse conviction would run afoul of the \u201cconstitutional parameters embodied in <em>North Carolina v. Pearce </em>\u201d and implicate \u201cdouble jeopardy and related due process concerns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The State responds that Maryland Rule 8-604 expressly authorizes the remand and, at the new sentencing hearing, the Circuit Court may exercise its discretion to resentence Petitioner for child abuse without offending double jeopardy and due process principles.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>\n<em>The Appellate Court\u2019s Authority to Remand for Resentencing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 604(d)(1) authorizes an appellate court to remand a case to a lower court if the appellate court \u201cconcludes that the substantial merits of a case will not be determined by affirming, reversing or modifying the judgment, or that justice will be served by permitting further proceedings.\u201d Rule 8 \u2014 604(d)(2) further provides that, \u201c[i]n a criminal case, if the appellate court reverses the judgment for error in the sentence or sentencing proceeding, the Court shall remand the case for resentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">This Court has recognized, with at least tacit approval, the propriety of resentencing on a greater offense upon merger for sentencing purposes of a lesser included offense. In <em>Jones v. State, </em>414 Md. 686, 997 A.2d 131 (2010), we reviewed a ruling of a trial judge on remand following Jones\u2019s successful challenge of his sentence on appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. That Court held in an unreported opinion that merger was required under <em>Blockburger, </em>vacated both the sentences for the lesser included offense and the greater inclusive offense, and directed resentencing on the greater inclusive offense. <em>Id. </em>at 690, 997 A.2d 131. On remand, the trial court refused to allow Jones to argue in mitigation before imposition of the new sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 690-91, 997 A.2d 131. Jones appealed, claiming error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit argument. <em>Id. </em>at 691, 997 A.2d 131. We determined that the trial court had erred and remanded for a new sentencing proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 692, 703, 997 A.2d 131. Important for present purposes, we expressed no concern that the Court of Special Appeals was without the authority to order a remand for resentencing on the greater offense. To the contrary, we stated that the trial court\u2019s \u201cprimary task\u201d on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>remand was to conduct the \u201cresentencing of the petitioner\u201d on the greater offense. <em>Id. </em>at 707, 997 A.2d 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Petitioner offers no authority for the proposition that remand for resentencing, as was done in <em>Jones </em>and as the Court of Special Appeals did in the present case, is unauthorized by Maryland statute, our rules, or our case law, and we are not aware of any.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\n<em>Double Jeopardy and Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Petitioner argues that resentencing on the child abuse conviction would run afoul of double jeopardy and due process protections. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">The Supreme Court has made clear that resentencing does not offend double jeopardy principles. The Court stated in <em>United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 132, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980), that the prohibition against multiple trials is the controlling principle in double jeopardy cases and the same prohibition precludes appellate review of an acquittal. The double jeopardy prohibition does not preclude either an appeal of a sentence or resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 133, 101 S.Ct. 426. \u201c[T]he pronouncement of sentence has never carried the finality that attaches to an acquittal,\u201d <em>id.; </em>likewise, resentencing following an appeal does not subject the defendant to \u201cmultiple\u201d sentences, <em>id. </em>at 138-39, 101 S.Ct. 426. <em>See also Pennsylvania v. Goldhammer, </em>474 U.S. 28, 29-30, 106 S.Ct. 353, 88 L.Ed.2d 183 (1985) (per curiam) (holding that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prevent a state court from resentencing a defendant following reversal of some of the defendant\u2019s convictions on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">Even more to the point is <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2089, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969). In that case, the Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the imposition of a longer sentence after a retrial and reconviction than was imposed in the original, vacated proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 722-23, 89 S.Ct. 2089. The <em>Pearce </em>Court was quite clear on that point: \u201cA man who is retried after his first conviction has been set aside may be acquitted. If convicted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>he may receive a shorter sentence, he may receive the same sentence, or he may receive a longer sentence than the one originally imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 722, 89 S.Ct. 2089.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Petitioner\u2019s due process argument is likewise unavailing. Petitioner appears to rely on the <em>Pearce </em>Court\u2019s discussion of due process concerns that might attend resentencing after a defendant\u2019s successful appeal. The <em>Pearce </em>Court was concerned specifically about the extent to which vindictiveness may play a role in the imposition of a harsher sentence following retrial. <em>Id. </em>at 725, 89 S.Ct. 2089. The Court recognized the inherent unfairness of \u201cimposing a heavier sentence\u201d upon a defendant \u201cfor the explicit purpose of punishing the defendant for his having succeeded in getting his original conviction set aside.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728-24, 89 S.Ct. 2089. Because due process \u201crequires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial,\u201d the Court provided a prophylactic rule to guard against it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">In order to assure the absence of such a motivation, ... whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for his doing so must affirmatively appear [and] must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 725-26, 89 S.Ct. 2089.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">The Supreme Court has retreated from its analysis in <em>Pearce. See Texas v. McCullough, </em>475 U.S. 134, 138, 106 S.Ct. 976, 89 L.Ed.2d 104 (1986) (explaining that \u201cthe evil the <em>[Pearce </em>] Court sought to prevent\u201d was the vindictiveness of a sentencing judge, not the imposition of \u201cenlarged sentences after a new trial\u201d); <em>Alabama v. Smith, </em>490 U.S. 794, 799-800, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 104 L.Ed.2d 865 (1989) (stating that, absent a reasonable likelihood that an increased sentence was the \u201cproduct of actual vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing authority,\u201d the defendant retains the burden \u201cto prove actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>vindictiveness\u201d). These cases clarify that vindictiveness is not to be presumed from the imposition of a more severe sentence on remand following the defendant\u2019s successful appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Although <em>McCullough, Smith, </em>and even <em>Pearce </em>all concerned resentencing following reconviction, we see no material distinction, for purposes of protecting due process, between those cases and a remand for a new sentence on an unchallenged conviction \u2014 here, child abuse \u2014 when the sentence for a lesser included offense is merged on appeal by application of <em>Blockburger. </em>In that circumstance, a more severe sentence will not offend due process unless one of two situations occurs: either the record of the new sentencing hearing demonstrates a reasonable likelihood that an increased sentence was the product of actual vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing authority, <em>or </em>the defendant \u201cprove[s] actual vindictiveness.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>490 U.S. at 799-800, 109 S.Ct. 2201.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\n<em>\u00a7 12-702(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A4\">We agree with the State that whatever remains of the <em>Pearce </em>doctrine in Maryland, insofar as it relates to this case, would be found in \u00a7 12 \u2014 702(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See Jones v. State, </em>307 Md. 449, 454, 514 A.2d 1219 (1986) (noting that \u00a7 12-702(b) codified the constitutional doctrine of <em>Pearce </em>and adopted \u201csignificant portions of the <em>Pearce </em>language\u201d). The first sentence of subsection (b) states: \u201cIf an appellate court remands a criminal case to a lower court in order that the lower court may pronounce the proper judgment or sentence ... the lower court may impose any sentence authorized by law to be imposed as punishment for the offense.\u201d The next sentence of subsection (b) codifies <em>Pearce </em>and reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">However, [the court] may not impose a sentence more severe than the sentence previously imposed for the offense unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>(1) The reasons for the increased sentence affirmatively appear;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">(2) The reasons are based upon additional objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">(3) The factual data upon which the increased sentence is based appears as part of the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Petitioner contends that this statutory language precludes imposition of a new sentence for his conviction of child abuse because any sentence that modifies the originally imposed, fully suspended sentence would constitute a \u201csentence more severe than the sentence previously imposed\u201d for that crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">We disagree, as did our colleagues on the Court of Special Appeals. For reasons we shall explain, even if, on remand, the trial court were to impose the then-applicable fifteen-year maximum sentence for child sexual abuse, that sentence would not violate \u00a7 12-702(b). We reach that conclusion by employing pertinent principles of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the General Assembly. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>415 Md. 413, 421, 2 A.3d 368 (2010). We begin with the plain meaning of the statute. <em>Meyer v. State, </em>445 Md. 648, 676, 128 A.3d 147 (2015). If the statutory language is unambiguous and consistent with the purpose of the statute, our review ceases and we apply the normal and plain meaning of the statute. <em>Harrison-Solomon v. State, </em>442 Md. 254, 265, 112 A.3d 408 (2015). When, however, the language is ambiguous because it gives rise to more than one reasonable interpretation, we must look to other indicia to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly, \u201cincluding the relevant statute\u2019s legislative history, the context of the statute within the broader legislative scheme, and the relative rationality of competing constructions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265-66, 112 A.3d 408. In all cases, when confronted with construing the meaning of a statutory provision, we must provide a reasonable interpretation \u2014 one that is consonant with logic and common sense. <em>McCree v. State, </em>441 Md. 4, 13, 105 A.3d 456 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Section 12-702(b) provides that, on remand, \u201c[the court] may not impose a sentence more severe than the sentence previously imposed for the offense[.]\u201d We must ascertain the meaning of the terms \u201csentence\u201d and \u201coffense.\u201d Those terms are used not simply in the context of the phrase, \u201c[the court] may not impose a sentence more severe than the sentence previously imposed for the offense,\u201d but also in the context of the language that precedes that phrase: upon remand for resentencing, \u201cthe lower court may impose any sentence authorized by law to be imposed as punishment for the offense.\u201d <em>See Haile v. State, </em>431 Md. 448, 470, 66 A.3d 600 (2013) (explaining the \u201clongstanding principle of statutory construction\u201d that requires courts to interpret a statute \u201cby looking to the statutory scheme in its entirety rather than segmenting the statute and analyzing only its individual parts\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Diaz v. State, </em>129 Md.App. 51, 84-85, 740 A.2d 81 (1999) (stating that \u201cthe issue in the instant case is not so much whether the word \u2018offense\u2019 should be singular or plural, but rather if the word includes \u2018count\u2019 or \u2018all counts comprising a singular criminal episode\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">Petitioner declares that \u201csentence\u201d and \u201coffense\u201d are \u201cunequivocally singular nouns.\u201d We are not nearly as convinced as Petitioner that this is so, in the context of \u00a7 12-702(b). Those terms appear unambiguous when applied in a case involving conviction of only one count, yet those same terms are less than clear in cases involving multiple counts arising from a single criminal episode or transaction. In the latter, frequently occurring situation, it is not unreasonable to understand the terms as referring to the total sentence for all those counts upon which the defendant was convicted. In that situation, the General Assembly could well have intended \u201cthe offense\u201d to refer to the criminal episode, encompassing all the counts of which the defendant was convicted, and \u201cthe sentence\u201d to refer to the total sentence imposed for those component counts. To resolve this ambiguity, we turn first to the legislative history of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The legislative history of \u00a7 12-702(b) discloses that the General Assembly enacted that language in 1973 to codify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number><em>Pearce </em>presumption of vindictiveness doctrine. <em>Gardner v. State, </em>420 Md. 1, 14-15, 20 A.3d 801 (2011). The 1973 Revisor\u2019s Note stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\">As a result of this judicial history, we have a constitutional limitation on increase of sentence if there is an ordinary appeal and either a remand for sentencing or a re-conviction after a new trial. And we have a statutory limitation on increase of sentence if there is a conviction after a de novo appeal. What \u00a7 12-702 proposes is the codification of the case law, and the retention of the existing statutory law, thus providing a uniform approach to the problem, and one readily accessible to and understandable by those involved in criminal sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Laws of Maryland, ch. 2 (1973) (First Special Session), Revisor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 12-702(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Notwithstanding that \u00a7 12-702(b) was \u201cMaryland\u2019s legislative response to the due process holding of <em>North Carolina v. Pearce,\u201d </em>it remains a \u201cstatement of legislative policy that stands independent of current Supreme Court notions of what due process may require.\u201d <em>Dixon v. State, </em>364 Md. 209, 225-27, 772 A.2d 283 (2001) (quoting <em>Davis v. State, </em>312 Md. 172, 178, 539 A.2d 218 (1988)). That \u00a7 12-702(b), as a legislative enactment, remains independent of the Supreme Court\u2019s retreat from <em>Pearce, </em>however, does not address, much less resolve, the question presented by the case before us. <em>See Gardner, </em>420 Md. at 15 &amp; n. 5, 20 A.3d 801; <em>Dixon, </em>364 Md. at 226-27, 772 A.2d 283. What remains for determination is what constitutes a \u201cmore severe sentence\u201d than one previously imposed for the \u201coffense\u201d at a new sentencing. As to that question, the legislative history offers no clue.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The canon of statutory construction that requires a reasonable interpretation consistent with logic and common sense aids us in answering the question. <em>See Briggs v. State, </em>413 Md. 265, 275, 992 A.2d 433 (2010). We conclude that, as the word is used in \u00a7 12-702(b), \u201coffense\u201d means not simply one count in a multi-count charging document, but rather the entirety of the sentencing package that takes into account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>each of the individual crimes of which the defendant was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">The notion of sentencing as a \u201cpackage\u201d is well-recognized, not simply by the Court of Special Appeals in the present case but also among our sister federal and state appellate courts. The Court of Special Appeals reasoned that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">[i]n imposing sentences for multiple convictions in a single case, a trial judge considers not only the sentence for each conviction, but also the total sentence for all of the convictions together. Indeed, the Maryland Sentencing Guidelines are structured to reflect such dual consideration.

Wade, </em>297 Conn. 262, 998 A.2d 1114, 1120 (2010) (holding that \u201cthe original sentencing court is viewed as having imposed individual sentences merely as component parts or building blocks of a larger total punishment for the aggregate convictions, and, thus, to invalidate any part of that package without allowing the court thereafter to review and revise the remaining valid convictions would frustrate the court\u2019s sentencing intent\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Adams v. State, </em>287 Ga. 513, 696 S.E.2d 676, 679 (2010); <em>Sanjari v. State, </em>981 N.E.2d 578, 583 (Ind.Ct.App.2013); <em>State v.

Nothing in the plain language of the statute, moreover, precludes this construction of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Furthermore, attributing these meanings to \u201coffense\u201d and \u201csentence\u201d in no way runs afoul of the clear legislative purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>behind the General Assembly\u2019s enactment of \u00a7 12-702(b), which we know was to codify the <em>Pearce </em>doctrine.

The General Assembly effectively overruled our decision in <em>Nightingale </em>by amending the child abuse statute in 1990 to permit separate sentences for child abuse and any underlying crime(s) that establish the gravamen of the child abuse conviction. Laws of Maryland, ch. 604 (1990) (enacted by H.D. 815, 1990 Leg., 400th Sess.

The State does not challenge here the holding of the Court of Special Appeals that the 1990 amendment of the child abuse statute was not intended to apply retroactively. <em>See Twigg v.

The <em>Blockburger </em>Court used essentially the same language: \u2018\u2018The applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>Blockburger v.

It is clear under case law of the United States Supreme Court and Maryland that, for purposes of resentencing, the remedy is to vacate only the sentence imposed upon the lesser included offense, not the conviction itself. <em>See North Carolina v.

The State also maintains that Petitioner\u2019s challenge to the constitutional implications of resentencing \"is not ripe for review because the trial court has not yet held a new sentencing hearing or imposed a new sentence on the child sexual abuse conviction.\u201d The State refers us to <em>Mercy Medical Center v. Julian, </em>429 Md. 348, 379 n. 17, 56 A.3d 147 (2012), which in turn cited <em>Toland v. Futagi, </em>425 Md. 365, 390, 40 A.3d 1051 (2012). We noted in those cases that this Court has \"long forbidden\" the practice of issuing an advisory opinion concerning an issue that is not \"ripe,\u201d that is, one that involves \u201ca matter which is future, contingent and uncertain.\u201d <em>See Hickory Point P\u2019ship </em>v. <em>Anne Arundel Cty., </em>316 Md. 118, 130, 557 A.2d 626 (1989) (internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>marks omitted). Inasmuch as we decide, as a matter of first impression, that this case is properly remanded to the Circuit Court for a new sentencing, it is appropriate to advise the court of what the law permits the court to do in the exercise of its sentencing discretion.

This construction of \u00a7 12\u2014702(b), moreover, does not result in unfair prejudice to a defendant who has been successful on appeal in having one or more, but not all, convictions and/or sentences vacated. <em>See Greenlaw v. United States, </em>554 U.S. 237, 253-54, 128 S.Ct. 2559, 171 L.Ed.2d 399 (2008) (explaining that, when a trial court on remand \"impose[s] a sentence on the remaining counts longer than the sentence originally imposed on those particular counts, but yielding an aggregate sentence no longer than the aggregate sentence initially imposed,\u201d the defendant \"may [have] gain[ed] nothing from his limited success on appeal, but he will also lose nothing, as he will serve no more time than the trial court originally ordered\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b56-6\">. The State does not seek to have vacated the sentences for incest and third degree sexual offense, for both of which Petitioner received the maximum sentence. We do not intend this opinion to be read as precluding, in the appropriate case, vacation of all sentences originally imposed on those convictions and sentences left undisturbed on appeal, so as to provide the court maximum flexibility on remand to fashion a proper sentence that takes into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances. The only caveat, aside from the exception set forth in \u00a7 12 \u2014 702(b)(1)\u2014(3), is that any new sentence, in the aggregate, cannot exceed the aggregate sentence imposed originally.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
