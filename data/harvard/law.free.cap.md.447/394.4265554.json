We have previously analyzed this privilege only in the defamation context. Today we address two distinct questions that arise out of a dispute between a city and a design engineer\u2019s settlement agreement to, among other things, not disparage one another. Can the litigation privilege immunize a party from a claim for breach of a non-disparagement clause? If so, can a party waive that privilege? We examine these questions to determine whether a trial court correctly granted a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The Maryland Department of the Environment required the City of Salisbury (\u201cthe City\u201d) to upgrade its wastewater sewage treatment plant (\u201cWWTP\u201d). The City then embarked on an $80 million large public works project by hiring O\u2019Brien <em>&amp; </em>Gere Engineers, Inc. (\u201cOBG\u201d) as its design engineer and Construction Dynamics Group (\u201cCDG\u201d) as its construction manager. The project failed because the WWTP did not work as expected and required.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Believing it did not get what it bargained for, the City sued OBG and CDG, among others, for various torts and breach of contract (\u201cthe WWTP Litigation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">With the advice of their respective attorneys, the City and OBG settled their dispute pursuant to an agreement (\u201cthe Settlement Agreement\u201d) in June 2012. In pertinent part, OBG agreed to pay the City $10 million in exchange for the City\u2019s promise to release OBG from all claims relating to the WWTP.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The City also made promises to OBG in the Settlement Agreement so that \u201cOBG [would] not hav[e] to expend any further monies in connection with\u201d the WWTP Litigation and would be protected \u201cfrom any liability and expense associated with any [of the City\u2019s] claims\u201d relating to the WWTP. First, the City agreed to defend, indemnify, and hold OBG harmless if any party (whether in the WWTP Litigation or in any future claim the City might bring) were to sue OBG \u201crelating to the design or construction of or equipment supplied for [the WWTP].\u201d Second, the City agreed to indemnify and hold OBG harmless if any such party obtained a judgment against OBG. Third, the City agreed that it would reduce any damages it recovered if OBG was \u201cdetermined to be a joint tortfeasor\u201d because of any final judgment. In exchange for these promises, OBG agreed to release the City from all of its WWTP claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">OBG and the City also agreed not to disparage one another about the WWTP upgrade. The non-disparagement clause states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>The City and OBG mutually agree that they will not make, or cause or encourage other persons or entities to make, any disparaging remarks or comments about each other relating to any matter having occurred prior to the effective date of this Settlement Agreement or in the future relating directly or indirectly to the Salisbury wastewater treatment plant through any means, including without limitation, oral, written or electronic communications, or induce or encourage others to publicly disparage the other settling party. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \u201cdisparaging\u201d means any statement made or issued to the media, or other entities or persons that adversely reflects on the other settling party\u2019s personal or professional reputation and/or business interests and/or that portrays the other settling party in a negative light.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The parties agreed that, in the event of a breach of this provision, the non-breaching party \u201cshall be\u201d entitled to injunctive relief and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. OBG believes that the City committed such a breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">After the City released OBG from all claims relating to the WWTP Litigation, the City pursued a claim for breach of contract against CDG (\u201cthe CDG Lawsuit\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">On November 1, 2012, in his opening remarks to the jury, the City\u2019s trial counsel, Howard Goldberg, explained that \u201c[the City] hired [CDG], and over the next three and a half years paid them $2,786,462.43. And the City just simply didn\u2019t get what they paid for.\u201d As to CDG\u2019s obligations to the City, Goldberg stated: \u201c[CDG was] to advise [the City] of deficiencies which are discovered or suspected by the construction manager [CDG] which involve the design of the project.\u201d As to the deficiencies, Goldberg said: \u201c[M]ost of the problems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>were design problems created by the design engineer, [OBG]. And they [CDG] should have been advising the City of those problems.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">CDG used its opening statements to establish that it was not responsible under its contract to the City for any of the design issues at the WWTP.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> CDG averred that it caused no harm to the City \u201cbecause the project was built on time, on budget, and there were no construction deficiencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Also on the first day of trial, the City used its first witness, Dr. Enos Stover (\u201cDr. Stover\u201d), to explain to the jury the design problems that plagued the WWTP. On the second day of trial, the City used its second witness, John Jacobs (\u201cJacobs\u201d), to establish CDG\u2019s obligations to the City, specifically, to report issues relating to OBG\u2019s design work. (\u201cThe construction manager is to overview any design issues, they\u2019re not to solve the design issue, but at least raise the issue to the City so that we can resolve it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">When OBG caught wind of the City\u2019s statements in the CDG Lawsuit through a newspaper article, OBG sent a \u201ccease and desist\u201d letter to the City, but it was not assured, in its view, that the City would comply with the non-disparagement clause. OBG then filed a complaint against the City for injunctive and monetary relief. The City filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The Circuit Court for Wicomico County denied OBG injunctive relief without issuing a ruling on the City\u2019s motion to dismiss. The City later filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>an amended motion to dismiss (\u201cthe Amended Motion to Dismiss\u201d), which the Circuit Court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Following OBG\u2019s timely notice of appeal,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>O\u2019Brien &amp; Gere Eng\u2019rs, Inc. v. City of Salisbury, </em>222 Md.App. 492, 580, 113 A.3d 1129 (2015). The intermediate appellate court reasoned that the proper inquiry was \u201cwhether immunity from liability is consistent with and will serve the public policy objectives of the [litigation] privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522, 113 A.3d 1129. Analyzing the facts in light of the public policy objectives, the intermediate appellate court concluded that \u201c[t]he administration of justice would be served (and was served) by applying the absolute litigation privilege to immunize the City from liability for breaching the non-disparagement agreement by introducing evidence and making arguments to the trier of fact that included negative information about OBG\u2019s design of the plant upgrade.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526, 113 A.3d 1129. In pertinent part, the court determined that \u201c[e]vidence about flaws in OBG\u2019s design for the plant upgrade and any cause and effect between flaws in the design and the plant upgrade failure was indispensable to an informed factual resolution of the City\u2019s contract claim against CDG.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524-25, 113 A.3d 1129. Judge Nazarian dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Following OBG\u2019s appeal, we granted its Petition for Writ of Certiorari to address the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">1. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in expanding the scope of the \u201clitigation privilege\u201d and finding that, as an absolute matter of law and without regard to the parties\u2019 intentions, no claim can stand for a deliberate and voluntary breach of a binding non-disparagement agreement when the disparaging statements are made in legal proceedings (even when the agreement contains no exception for statements made in legal proceedings, and the breaching party is not compelled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>by subpoena or other compulsory process or circumstance to make the disparaging statements).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\">2. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in deciding the case on a preliminary Motion to Dismiss, without resolving or allowing any exploration and litigation of important factual questions (related to the parties\u2019 expectations and intentions) bearing on the scope and effect of the non-disparagement clause, including whether it waived the litigation privilege.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">We think both questions presented are so intertwined as to warrant a unified discussion, and we conclude, as to the second question, that the Court of Special Appeals correctly affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. We explain, however, that whether the litigation privilege applies to a breach of contract claim turns in a particular case on whether applying the litigation privilege advances the policies favoring the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">In reviewing a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim, we \u201cmust determine whether the trial court was legally correct, examining solely the sufficiency of the pleading.\u201d <em>Ricketts v. Ricketts, </em>393 Md. 479, 492, 903 A.2d 857 (2006).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Our review of the pleading may extend to \u201cits incorporated supporting exhibits, if any.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491, 903 A.2d 857 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). As we stated in <em>Allied Investment Corp. v. Jasen, </em>when a trial or appellate court reviews a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, it is necessary to \u201cassume the truth of all well-pleaded, relevant, and material facts in the complaint and any reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom. \u2018Dismissal is proper only if the alleged facts and permissible inferences, so viewed, would, if proven, nonetheless fail to afford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>relief to the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d 354 Md. 547, 555, 731 A.2d 957 (1999) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">OBG and the City dispute whether the City violated the non-disparagement clause in the Settlement Agreement because of the City\u2019s statements during the CDG Lawsuit. Conceding that the litigation privilege is absolute with respect to \u201cdefamation and other torts arising from statements made in legal proceedings,\u201d OBG argues that we should adopt a different approach with respect to its breach of contract claim. Because of the public policy favoring settlements, OBG contends, parties can waive the litigation privilege by contract. OBG views the proper question, then, as whether \u201cthe intentions and expectations of the parties or the particular factual context of the case\u201d reveal a waiver of the litigation privilege. Remand is necessary, in OBG\u2019s view, because the Circuit Court granted the City\u2019s Amended Motion to Dismiss without a sufficient record to answer this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The City contends that OBG\u2019s focus is off because the nature of the claim \u2014 tort or contract \u2014 does not matter. In reading our defamation case law, the City deduces that \u201cMaryland has always \u2018struck heavily in favor of the free disclosure of information during a judicial proceeding\u2019 \u201d because of strong public policy reasons, which are just as relevant to OBG\u2019s breach of contract claim. (Quoting <em>Imperial v. Drapeau </em>351 Md. 38, 45, 716 A.2d 244 (1998)). Moreover, the City argues that the Circuit Court committed no error because the available facts supported the court\u2019s grant of the Amended Motion to Dismiss: (1) all allegedly disparaging statements were made in a courtroom and (2) the Settlement Agreement did not forbid the City from discussing OBG\u2019s design of the WWTP in the CDG Lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">MOOTNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Before we address these substantive arguments, we first consider the City\u2019s position that this case is moot. \u201cThis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Court does not give advisory opinions; thus, we generally dismiss moot actions without a decision on the merits.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Human Res., Child Care Admin. v. Roth, </em>398 Md. 137, 143, 919 A.2d 1217 (2007) (citation omitted). \u201c\u2018A case is moot when there is no longer an existing controversy between the parties at the time it is before the court so that the court cannot provide an effective remedy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clark v. O\u2019Malley, </em>434 Md. 171, 192 n. 11, 73 A.3d 1086 (2013) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The Settlement Agreement states that, in the event of a breach of the non-disparagement clause, \u201cthe non-breaching party shall be entitled to equitable relief.\u201d The City argues that, even if it breached the non-disparagement clause, we cannot grant OBG the injunctive relief it sought because \u201cthe acts sought to be enjoined have ceased.\u201d (Quoting <em>State v. Ficker, </em>266 Md. 500, 507, 295 A.2d 231 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Without a doubt, injunctive relief is unavailable. OBG sought injunctive relief to prevent the City from making negative statements about OBG during the CDG Lawsuit. That lawsuit is over, with a verdict favorable to the City. As the City is no longer making negative statements about OBG that we could enjoin, injunctive relief is off the table. Yet, as OBG contends, \u201cany mootness in regard to the claim for injunctive relief (arising from the termination of the WWTP Litigation) has no bearing\u201d on OBG\u2019s claims for money damages and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Not so fast, the City responds. In its view the Settlement Agreement precludes OBG from pursuing money damages. In pertinent part the Settlement Agreement states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">The parties agree that, in the event of any breach of this non-disparagement provision, <em>damages!actual losses will be difficult or impossible to prove with requisite precision, and that an adequate remedy at law will not exist. Accordingly, in the event of a breach of this provision, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to equitable relief.... </em>Further, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and other litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>costs and expenses associated with enforcement of this provision against the breaching party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">(Emphasis added.) The City avers that \u201cmoney damages may not be awarded\u201d because the Settlement Agreement states that \u201can adequate remedy at law will not exist.\u201d OBG disagrees, construing the same language as \u201ca necessary predicate to obtaining injunctive relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The Supreme Court of the United States \u201chas repeatedly held that the basis for injunctive relief in the federal courts has always been irreparable injury and the inadequacy of legal remedies.\u201d <em>Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, </em>456 U.S. 305, 312, 102 S.Ct. 1798, 72 L.Ed.2d 91 (1982). Although such a basis is not now required in our state courts, it once was. <em>Compare </em>Maryland Rule 15-502(c) (\u201cThe court may not deny an injunction solely because the party seeking it has an adequate remedy in damages____\u201d), <em>and Seci, Inc. v. Chafitz, Inc., </em>63 Md.App. 719, 725, 493 A.2d 1100 (1985) (\u201c[Although the law was once to the contrary, it is clear now that an injunction need not be denied merely because the party seeking it has an adequate remedy at law.\u201d), <em>with Musch v. Underwood, </em>179 Md. 455, 459, 19 A.2d 699 (1941) (\u201cThe doctrine is well settled in this state that where a party has a certain, complete and adequate remedy at law, he cannot sue in equity.\u201d), <em>and Anne Arundel Cnty. v. Whitehall Venture, </em>39 Md.App. 197, 200 n. 2, 384 A.2d 780 (1978) (\u201cTraditionally, the non-existence of an adequate remedy at law was a prerequisite to injunctive relief.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>In reviewing the above provision in the Settlement Agreement, we note that the language focuses precisely on the adequacy of a legal remedy, not on its availability. By no means does the Settlement Agreement state, as the City contends, that money damages shall not be awarded, or, shall not be available as a legal remedy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Lasco Enters., Inc. v. Kohlbrand, </em>819 So.2d 821, 825 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2002) (rejecting argument that money damages were unavailable because the contract language \u201cdid not place a limitation upon their available remedies, but instead, simply provided that the Kohlbrands \u2018may* proceed in equity to enforce its rights or \u2018may\u2019 elect to receive the return of earnest money deposit. The provision does not state that the Kohlbrands \u2018shall\u2019 limit themselves to such remedies.\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Reviewing our case law, we discern that the parties must at least use clear language to show their agreement to limit available remedies. <em>See Mass. Indem. &amp; Life Ins. Co., </em>269 Md. 364, 369-70, 306 A.2d 213 (1973) (rejecting the argument that the contract prohibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>injunctive relief and explaining that \u201c \u2018[a] contract will not be construed as taking away a common-law remedy unless that result is imperatively required\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). We cannot agree with the City that this contract language shows the parties\u2019 intention to limit available relief. Rather, our research and the relevant language indicate an attempt by the parties merely to ensure the availability of injunctive relief. We conclude that the dispute over the meaning of the non-disparagement clause is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">NON-DISPARAGEMENT CLAUSE AS WAIVER OF LITIGATION PRIVILEGE</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\n<em>Preservation of OBG\u2019s Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The City contends that OBG never argued to the Circuit Court its primary argument here \u2014 \u201cthat the City waived its right to rely on the absolute litigation privilege because it agreed to the non[-]disparagement provision contained in the Settlement Agreement.\u201d In the City\u2019s view, OBG\u2019s argument to the Circuit Court was \u201cthat the public policy favoring enforcement of settlement agreements should prevail over the public policy underlying the absolute litigation privilege.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The City\u2019s non-preservation argument belies its own presentation of the issue to the Circuit Court at the hearing on the Amended Motion to Dismiss, in which it stated: \u201ceffectively the issue today is whether or to what extent or <em>what effect </em>the non-disparagement contract between the City of Salisbury and O\u2019Brien &amp; Gere has in relation to the absolute privilege in judicial proceedings that Maryland recognizes.\u201d (Emphasis added). When OBG argues in this appeal that the non-disparagement clause constitutes a waiver of the litigation privilege it raises the same issue \u2014 whether the City gave up its litigation privilege by signing the non-disparagement clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Moreover, at the same hearing, and in its Opposition to the Amended Motion to Dismiss, OBG relied on <em>Wentland v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number><em>Wass, </em>126 Cal.App.4th 1484, 25 Cal.Rptr.3d 109 (2005). In <em>Wentland, </em>the California intermediate appellate court concluded, in part, that the litigation privilege \u201cshould not apply in this breach of contract case\u201d because \u201cone who validly contracts not to speak ... has [ ] waived the protection of the litigation privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Although OBG did not quote this exact language from <em>Wentland </em>before the Circuit Court, it made a similar point when it stated that the non-disparagement clause represented the City\u2019s \u201cclear, unqualified, and unlimited\u201d promise not to portray OBG in a negative light. The issue of whether the City waived its right to rely on the litigation privilege when it entered into the Settlement Agreement was argued in the Circuit Court, and is therefore preserved for our review. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8-131(a) (\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\n<em>Nature and History of Litigation Privilege</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">We begin by examining the established contours of the litigation privilege, which accords the putative tortfeasor absolute immunity from civil liability. The litigation privilege dates back 500 years to the English Court of Queen\u2019s Bench. <em>See Beauchamps v. Croft, </em>73 Eng. Rep. 639 (Q.B. 1497) (\u201c[N]o punishment was ever appointed for a suit in law, however it be false and for vexation. And in the case above, it is indifferent to say that it is false or true[.]\u201d). The privilege rests on the vital public policy of the \u201cfree and unfettered administration of justice.\u201d <em>Adams v. Peck, </em>288 Md. 1, 5, 415 A.2d 292 (1980) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Expounding on the importance of this policy, we said in <em>Adams:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">The ultimate purpose of the judicial process is to determine the truth. The investigation, evaluation, presentation and determination of facts are inherent and essential parts of this process. If this process is to function effectively, those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>who participate must be able to do so without being hampered by the fear of private suits for defamation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u201cFor witnesses, parties, and judges, we employ the \u2018English\u2019 rule, which provides that the putative tortfeasor enjoys absolute immunity from civil liability, even if the statement is wholly unrelated to the underlying proceeding.\u201d <em>Norman v. Borison, </em>418 Md. 630, 650, 17 A.3d 697 (2011). <em>Norman </em>also instructs that \u201c[f|or attorneys whose appearances are entered in a case, however, we follow the majority American rule and require that the defamatory statement have some rational relation to the matter at bar before unfurling the umbrella of absolute privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The litigation privilege has been described as \u201cmore of an immunity for litigators, by contrast to a qualified privilege.\u201d Paul T. Hayden, <em>Reconsidering the Litigator\u2019s Absolute Privilege to Defame, </em>54 Ohio St. L.J. 985, 992 (1993).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The litigation privilege is long-standing in Maryland, dating back to the 1880s. <em>See Maulsby v. Reifsnider, </em>69 Md. 143, 14 A. 505 (1888) (involving statements made by an attorney in the course of a judicial proceeding); <em>Hunckel v. Voneiff, </em>69 Md. 179, 17 A. 1056 (1888) (involving statements made by witnesses). Although the disputes in <em>Maulsby </em>and <em>Hunckel </em>involved libel and slander, we have since observed that \u201c[p]rivilege is not confined in the law of torts to matters of defamation.\u201d <em>Walker v.

Indeed, to refuse to consider applying the privilege when the claim is not labeled as a tort is to ignore the possibility that the alleged harm derives from tortious conduct. <em>See Rain, </em>626 F.3d at 378 (\u201c[Appellants\u2019 breach of contract claim is largely indistinguishable from a tort claim alleging injury flowing from statements made in a judicial proceeding.

We have found only a handful of cases involving non-disparagement clauses and the privilege. These cases have generally focused on whether the application of the privilege would further the privilege\u2019s public policy reasons. <em>See, e.g., Rain, </em>626 F.3d at 377; <em>Wentland, </em>25 Cal.Rptr.3d at 114.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Drawing from these courts, we now inquire \u201cwhether applying the litigation privilege in this case would promote the due administration of justice and free expression by participants in judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Rain, </em>626 F.3d at 378. Two cases with contrary outcomes are instructive as we undertake this step in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\n<em>Rain v. Rolls-Royce Corp.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">In <em>Rain, </em>the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the litigation privilege protected a manufacturer from its competitors\u2019 claim for breach of a non-disparagement clause arising out of a settlement agreement. 626 F.3d at 375, 378.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> competitors averred that the manufacturer breach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ed the non-disparagement clause by, among other things, \u201cincluding certain allegations in [a] complaint\u201d against third parties filed after the parties executed the settlement agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 376. The complaint alleged that the competitors had conspired with others \u201cto obtain and use [its] proprietary information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375. The Seventh Circuit reasoned that the manufacturer could defend itself against the breach of contract claim because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\">application of the privilege here allows [the manufacturer] to pursue its claims against third parties without fear of future legal liability arising out of its efforts to protect its intellectual property rights. By contrast, the failure to apply the privilege would frustrate the underlying policy by discouraging [the manufacturer] from exercising its fundamental right to resort to the courts to protect its rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ\"><em>Id. </em>at 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Here, the City pursued its already pending claim of breach of contract against CDG, a third party, as contemplated by the parties to the Settlement Agreement. In his opening statements, the City\u2019s trial counsel stated that \u201c[CDG was] to advise the [City] of deficiencies which are discovered or suspected by [CDG] which involve the design of the project.\u201d In order to persuade the jury that CDG breached its contract with the City, the City <em>needed </em>to establish that OBG had defectively designed the WWTP, that CDG was obligated to advise the City of such issues, and that CDG failed to do so. This is precisely what the City did through its witnesses, Jacobs and Dr. Stover.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As in <em>Rain, </em>application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>litigation privilege allows the City to pursue its claims and protect its rights without fear of future legal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">OBG raises several unpersuasive arguments to distinguish <em>Rain. </em>First, it argues that, unlike this case, the non-disparagement clause in <em>Rain </em>had no definition of \u201cdisparage,\u201d saying simply that \u201cnone of the Parties will disparage the other.\u201d This distinction is meaningful to OBG because, with such a clear definition of the term, \u201cthere could be no finding in this case that the statements at issue did not constitute \u2018disparaging\u2019 comments within the meaning of the Settlement Agreement.\u201d We fail to see how this distinction has any bearing on our policy discussion or the policy discussion in <em>Rain.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Second, OBG argues <em>Rain </em>is distinguishable because that court never considered the policy argument favoring enforcement of contracts. OBG is incorrect. Even though the <em>Rain </em>court stated that the policy argument was waived, the court went on to explain that the policy argument was unpersuasive because: \u201cthe agreement\u2019s enforceability is not at issue. Rather, the question is whether to impose liability for a violation of that agreement.\u201d <em>Rain, </em>626 F.3d at 378.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\n<em>Wentland v. Wass</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">In <em>Wentland, </em>a California intermediate appellate court held that the litigation privilege did not apply because the underlying policies would not be furthered by its application. 25 Cal.Rptr.3d at 111, 116. Two partners brought an action for an accounting of three partnerships. <em>Id. </em>at 111. Through their attorney\u2019s statements and a declaration, these two partners explained that an audit of the books was just and reasonable because audits of other partnerships, including the Parkview Terrace partnership, had revealed self-dealing by the managing partner. <em>Id. </em>The managing partner filed a cross-complaint alleging that the other two partners had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>breached an agreement to \u201cmake no accusation or comment [which] alleged wrongdoing\u201d by him concerning Parkview Terrace. <em>Id. </em>According to the cross-complaint, all three partners had entered into this agreement after the two partners began <em>asserting </em>\u2014 not <em>in court </em>\u2014 that the managing partner had misappropriated assets from Parkview Terrace. <em>Id. </em>at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Although the trial court in <em>Wentland </em>dismissed the cross-complaint on the basis of the litigation privilege, the intermediate appellate court reversed, explaining that the policies underlying the privilege were not advanced through its application. First, the privilege did not promote \u201caccess to the courts, truthful testimony or zealous advocacy\u201d because \u201c[t]his cause of action [was] not based on allegedly wrongful conduct during litigation\u2014 it [was] based on breach of a separate promise independent of the litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116. Second, the privilege did not promote finality because the two partner\u2019s comments about the managing partner \u201cinvite[d] further litigation as to their accuracy\u201d when the agreement \u201cpresumably\u201d ended the matter of the managing partner\u2019s conduct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">To be sure, as in <em>Wentland, </em>OBG\u2019s claim relates to breach of a separate promise independent of litigation. But importantly, application of the privilege to the City\u2019s statements still promotes access to the courts, truthful testimony, and zealous advocacy. As we discussed earlier, those statements were essential to the City\u2019s case that CDG breached its contract with the City. We also recognize that the City\u2019s statements caused further litigation, as in <em>Wentland. </em>But, as we shall explain <em>infra, </em>we do not view the City\u2019s statements as inviting further litigation because they were made in the mutually anticipated court proceedings in which both parties clearly contemplated that OBG\u2019s work would be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">OBG argues that <em>Wentland </em>is analogous because, in both eases, the application of the litigation privilege would frustrate the purpose of the agreements. We disagree. We begin by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>setting forth what OBG said, in relevant part, to the Circuit Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\">[W]hat their [the City\u2019s] position requires is actually reading into that settlement agreement language that doesn\u2019t exist there, to read into it an exception for statements made in court, would have completely frustrated the purpose of the clearly stated indemnification clause, hold harmless and defend clause, which was very broad in its terms and very clear in its terms, that if anybody in the wastewater treatment plant litigation took issue, whether by third-party complaint or some other kind of claim, took issue with our design, the City, these lawyers, were going to come into court and actually defend O\u2019Brien &amp; Gere.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">OBG hones in on the provisions of the Settlement Agreement wherein the City promised to defend, indemnify, and hold OBG harmless <em>\u201cfrom any claim asserted </em>(previously or at any time in the future) <em>by any other party </em>to the Lawsuit.\u201d (Emphasis added.) CDG, however, has not asserted any claim against OBG. As Judge Eyler, writing for the Court of Special Appeals, aptly noted, CDG has merely raised OBG\u2019s defective design as a defense.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But CDG\u2019s defense is \u201cnot a claim or suit against OBG.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien &amp; Gere Eng\u2019rs, </em>222 Md.App. at 526 n. 20, 113 A.3d 1129. In other words, there is no inconsistency between the indemnification clause and the City\u2019s breach of contract claim. Thus, we are not persuaded that applying the litigation privilege would frustrate the purpose of the Settlement Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>\n<em>Waiver of Privilege by Terms of Non-Disparagement Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">We now turn to OBG\u2019s argument that the City waived its litigation privilege by the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Tracking OBG\u2019s argument, we approach this issue in two steps. First, we examine whether the litigation privilege is waivable.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The City argues that the \u201cMaryland public policy underlying the Absolute Litigation Privilege is logically inconsistent with OBG\u2019s waiver argument.\u201d The City reasons that \u201cOBG\u2019s argument asks the Court to support a contractual interpretation that would impede Maryland Courts and juries from ascertaining vital and important facts during the trial of a case.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) For support, the City points to <em>United States v. Mezzanatto, </em>in which the United States Supreme Court acknowledged that \u201c[tjhere may be some evidentiary provisions that are so fundamental to the reliability of the factfinding process that they may never be waived without irreparably \u2018discrediting] the federal courts.\u2019 \u201d 513 U.S. 196, 204, 115 S.Ct. 797, 130 L.Ed.2d 697 (1995) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">We recognize the fundamental importance of the fact-finding process. Indeed, that is in part why we have affirmed the litigation privilege for so many years. <em>See Imperial, </em>351 Md. at 45, 716 A.2d 244 (\u201cAs a matter of public policy, the balance is struck heavily in favor of the free disclosure of information during a judicial proceeding.\u201d). It is also why we decide today that non-disparagement contracts should be construed -with a rebuttable presumption <em>against </em>waiver of the litigation privilege. <em>Cf. Bollack v. Bollack, </em>169 Md. 407, 409-11, 182 A. 317 (1936) (challenging party must provide evidence of undue influence to rebut the presumption that the instrument was voluntarily executed); <em>Hovnanian Land Inv. Grp., LLC v. Annapolis Towne Ctr. at Parole, LLC, </em>421 Md. 94, 123, 25 A.3d 967 (2011) (\u201cThe party alleging waiver must show an intent to waive both the contract provision at issue and the non-waiver clause.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>But we do not go quite as far as the City in declaring a ban against any and all waiver of that privilege (or the intermediate appellate court in elevating privilege over waiver as a matter of law). There may be situations in which there are good reasons to uphold a clear waiver of the litigation privileges \u2014 but that is a question for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">In previously affirming the litigation privilege in the tort context, we have acknowledged that our analysis \u201cinvolves a matter of public policy in which the public interest in free disclosure must be weighed against the harm to individuals who may be defamed.\u201d <em>Adams, </em>288 Md. at 5, 415 A.2d 292. In the context of breach of a settlement contract, the inquiry changes. We weigh not only the public policy of administration of justice against the individual harm defamation poses, but also consider the favorable policy of encouraging settlement agreements. <em>See Sisson v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt, </em>51 Md. 83, 95-96 (1879) (\u201cThe law always favors compromises and amicable adjustments of disputes \u2014 \u201d). When we encourage parties to settle on their terms, the administration of justice is also served. Weighing the important policy concerns both parties raise, we conclude that, even if the litigation privilege can be waived by contract, in construing a non-disparagement clause, we will apply a rebuttable presumption against waiver of that privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Applying Rebuttable Presumption, Could This Be A Waiver?</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">OBG argues that the Circuit Court improperly granted the City\u2019s Amended Motion to Dismiss because the \u201cintended effect of the non-disparagement agreement\u201d upon the CDG Lawsuit was an \u201cunresolved and critical dispute.\u201d Moreover, OBG avers, \u201cwhether the parties intended to waive the litigation privilege in the Agreement\u201d could not \u201cproperly have been decided on a pre-answer motion to dismiss.\u201d OBG contends that it negotiated the non-disparagement clause to ensure that the City would not portray it in a negative light. It sought this assurance because, OBG argues, \u201cit would no longer be a party to the City\u2019s continuing WWTP Litigation\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>and \u201cno longer have the ability or be in a position to effectively defend itself against aspersions cast upon it by the City.\u201d OBG avers that the promise not to disparage \u201cwas clear, unqualified, and unlimited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\u201cWe have defined waiver as \u2018the intentional relinquishment of a known right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>394 Md. 184, 201, 905 A.2d 315 (2006) (attorney-client privilege) (citations omitted); <em>see Harrison v. State, </em>276 Md. 122, 137, 345 A.2d 830 (1975) (\u201c[T]he intent to waive [the attorney-client privilege] must, however, be expressed either by word or act, or omission to speak out.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Keeping in mind our rebuttable presumption just discussed, we apply the rules of construction of contracts in interpreting a settlement agreement. <em>See Clark v. Elza, </em>286 Md. 208, 219, 406 A.2d 922 (1979) (\u201cAs long as the basic requirements to form a contract are present, there is no reason to treat such a settlement agreement differently than other contracts which are binding.\u201d). \u201cThe fundamental rule in the construction and interpretation of contracts is that the intention of the parties as expressed in the language of the contract controls the analysis.\u201d <em>Ford v. Antwerpen Motorcars, Ltd., </em>443 Md. 470, 477, 117 A.3d 21 (2015) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). To discern the parties\u2019 intentions, we look at \u201cthe contents of the document itself and not by consideration of the provisions separately.\u201d <em>Wheaton Triangle Lanes, Inc. v. Rinaldi </em>236 Md. 525, 530-31, 204 A.2d 537 (1964). We follow the \u201cobjective interpretation principle,\u201d that is, \u201c[i]f the language of the contract is unambiguous, we give effect to its plain meaning and do not delve into what the parties may have subjectively intended.\u201d <em>Ford, </em>443 Md. at 477, 117 A.3d 21 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">In light of our rebuttable presumption, the non-disparagement clause here does not prohibit the statements that OBG challenges. The term \u201cdisparaging\u201d does not expressly reach the CDG Lawsuit. <em>See Harrison, </em>276 Md. at 138, 345 A.2d 830 (\u201c[T]he intent to waive [the privilege] must, however, be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>expressed either by word or act, or omission to speak out.\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The term, as defined in the Settlement Agreement, focuses instead on statements \u201cmade or issued to the media, or other entities or persons.\u201d Identifying this audience does not suggest that the City knew the Settlement Agreement would circumscribe the statements it could make in court. <em>Smith, </em>394 Md. at 201, 905 A.2d 315 (citations omitted) (\u201cIntrinsic to the definition of \u2018waiver\u2019 is the recognition that the client must be informed of both the scope and nature of the right being relinquished as well as the consequences of so doing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Indeed, OBG\u2019s counsel acknowledged at the hearing on the Amended Motion to Dismiss that it knew the City\u2019s pending case was against CDG.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Furthermore, not only did OBG know about the pending litigation and its subject matter, but it promised to \u201cproduce Mr. Meinert and Ms. Knox for the completion of their depositions <em>in the pending case </em>at no expense to the City.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Although OBG knew that the City had a pending suit against CDG, and although OBG expected that its role in the WWTP upgrade would come up during the CDG Lawsuit, the Settlement Agreement includes no language restricting the legal issues that the City could raise or the legal strategy that the City could take. Instead, OBG sought, above all else, to protect itself \u201cfrom any <em>liability </em>and <em>expense </em>associated with any claims\u201d relating to the WWTP. (Emphasis added.) OBG accomplished this purpose by: (1) requiring the City to defend, indemnify, and hold OBG harmless in the event anyone related to the WWTP Litigation were to sue OBG or were to obtain a judgment against OBG; and (2) requiring the City to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>reduce any damages it recovered if OBG were \u201cdetermined to be a joint tortfeasor\u201d as a result of any claims. OBG succeeded in accomplishing as much because, as it repeatedly asserts, \u201cthe City dismissed its professional negligence and other tort claims against CDG, and reduced its prayer for damages as to CDG from $60 million to $4 million\u201d in order to \u201cprevent a contribution claim by CDG against OBG, which would have triggered the City\u2019s indemnification obligations under the Settlement Agreement.\u201d But OBG nowhere precluded the City from discussing OBG\u2019s design work in the CDG Lawsuit.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">If we review the CDG Lawsuit transcripts (which OBG referred to in its complaint), then the only reasonable inference is that, as Judge Eyler wrote below, \u201cthe facts material to whether CDG breached its contract with the City were interrelated with the facts material to whether OBG\u2019s design was flawed.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien &amp; Gere Eng\u2019rs, Inc., </em>222 Md.App. at 524, 113 A.3d 1129. This close interdependence causes us to conclude that the only reasonable interpretation of the Settlement Agreement is that the parties contemplated that OBG\u2019s design work would not only come into play during the CDG Lawsuit but also likely be bandied back and forth as the parties tried to hold each other responsible for overseeing OBG.
