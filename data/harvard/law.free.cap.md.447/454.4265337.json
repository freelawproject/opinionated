Respondent Supervisor of Assessments of Montgomery County (\u201cSupervisor\u201d) advises us that, since 1992, the State Department of Assessments and Taxation and its local assessors have followed the practice of considering sales after the date of finality to value property as of the date of finality when those sales are reasonably close in time and otherwise comparable to the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\n<em>This Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The case before us has its genesis in Petitioner Ann Lane\u2019s appeal of her 2011 tax assessment of the condominium she owns and occupies in Parc Somerset, a seventeen-story building located on Wisconsin Avenue in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Parc Somerset is the newest of three condominium buildings, all of which were built over a twenty-year period and together comprise the Somerset House development. Condominiums in Parc Somerset are the most desirable in the development. Certain condominiums in Parc Somerset that are located directly above and below one another form a \u201cstack,\u201d meaning that the units are exactly the same in design, layout, and size. Petitioner\u2019s unit is located on the tenth floor in the \u201c03\u201d stack. The \u201c03\u201d stack runs from floors three to twelve and each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>the \u201c03\u201d units measures 2,498 square feet.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">On December 28, 2010, the Supervisor notified Petitioner that her condominium (\u201cunit 1003\u201d), would be assessed at a value of $2,130,000, representing \u201cthe new market value effective January 1, 2011.\u201d The Notice stated that the \u201cnew market value is based upon market data available prior to this date.\u201d The assessment, which was determined by using a computer-assisted mass appraisal technique, was approximately 11 percent higher than the previous assessment of Petitioner\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Petitioner, believing the assessment to be incorrect, availed herself of her administrative rights of appeal. She appealed first to the Supervisor, who issued a Final Notice of Assessment in August 2011, making no change to the assessment. Petitioner appealed that decision to the Property Tax Assessment Appeal Board for Montgomery County (\u201cPTAAB\u201d). At that juncture, Petitioner\u2019s appeal was consolidated with those of nine other Parc Somerset condominium owners, including the owners of units 803 and 703. The PTAAB reduced the assessment for unit 803 to $1,840,000 and the assessment for unit 703 to $1,830,000 but left standing the assessment of Petitioner\u2019s property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Petitioner appealed the decision of the PTAAB to the Maryland Tax Court. She presented two arguments in support of a reduction in the assessed value of her condominium. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>She argued first that the correct value of her condominium was $1,649,000 plus a $20,000 floor premium for a total value of $1,669,000. In support of that value, Petitioner relied on two items of evidence: the affidavit of a real estate broker attesting to a $10,000 floor premium for units in Parc Somerset; and an appraisal of unit 803, which valued that condominium at $1,649,000 as of January 3, 2011, and was conducted on behalf of a mortgage company to assist the owners of unit 803 in refinancing their mortgage. Petitioner alternatively argued that, because the PTAAB had valued unit 703 at $1,830,000 and unit 803 at $1,840,000, her property should be valued, at the most, at $1,860,000, accounting for a $10,000 premium that the PTAAB appeared to have accorded to each additional floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Leonard Nichols, a real estate appraiser and hearing specialist, was present at the hearing on behalf of the Supervisor and was accepted by the Tax Court as an expert witness. Mr. Nichols informed the Tax Court that, in his view, the value of Petitioner\u2019s property was $2,130,000. Mr. Nichols testified that he arrived at that valuation by reliance on the sales of three comparable condominium units in Parc Somerset. All of those units measured 2,441 square feet and were sold in May 2011.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When comparing these sales to unit 1003, Mr. Nichols made adjustments for variations between the subject property and comparable properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The first comparable sale was of unit 207, which sold for $2,200,000; to that amount Mr. Nichols added $35,000 for the difference in square footage, $80,000 as a floor premium,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>$15,000 for land adjustments. Based on that information, Mr. Nichols concluded that the market value for unit 1003 was $2,330,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The second comparable sale upon which Mr. Nichols relied was of unit 507, which sold for $2,075,000; to that amount he added $35,000 for the difference in square footage, $50,000 as a floor premium, and $15,000 for land adjustments. Based on that information, Mr. Nichols concluded that the market value for unit 1003 was $2,175,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The third comparable sale was of unit 707 which sold for $1,995,000; Mr. Nichols added $35,000 for the difference in square footage, $30,000 as a floor premium, and $15,000 for land adjustments. Based on this third comparable unit, Mr. Nichols valued unit 1003 at $2,075,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Mr. Nichols further testified that no sales of units in Parc Somerset occurred during 2010. He added that he had chosen not to rely upon sales from the other two buildings in the Somerset House development because those units were in older, less desirable buildings and therefore were not comparable to units in Parc Somerset.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Petitioner objected to Mr. Nichols\u2019s testimony, arguing that the sales were not of comparable units and, even so, occurred more than four months after January 1, 2011, the \u201cdate of finality.\u201d In the discussion that followed, Mr. Nichols noted that the common practice at the Tax Court is to submit sales occurring within the first half of the year after the date of finality and that he excluded comparable properties sold in September and December of 2011 as \u201ctoo far beyond the date of finality.\u201d The court overruled Petitioner\u2019s objection, stating that it is the \u201cpolicy\u201d of the Tax Court to accept evidence of sales occurring shortly after the date of finality, \u201c[ejspecially when there\u2019s nothing else, when there are no other sales.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The Tax Court considered both parties\u2019 evidence concerning comparable units. The Tax Court decided that the Supervisor\u2019s evidence offered through Mr. Nichols provided a more accurate measure than that offered by Petitioner in determining the value of Petitioner\u2019s condominium as of January 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>2011. The Tax Court found that unit 707 was the \u201cbest indicator of [the] value\u201d of Petitioner\u2019s property and agreed with Mr. Nichols\u2019s adjustments in comparing unit 707 to unit 1003. The Tax Court reasoned that Petitioner\u2019s evidence concerning the January 3, 2011, refinancing appraisal of unit 803 was a less accurate indicator of the value of Petitioner\u2019s unit, given a lending bank\u2019s interest in seeking a low appraisal. The Tax Court further noted that the appraisal of unit 803 was based upon sales from the two older buildings in the Somerset House development and had not included appropriate adjustments for unit 803, based on its location in the newer, more desirable Parc Somerset building. Evidently relying most heavily upon the Supervisor\u2019s third comparable sale, the Tax Court reduced the assessment of Petitioner\u2019s property from $2,130,000 to $2,075,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Petitioner filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. After hearing from the parties, the Circuit Court ruled that the Tax Court had committed legal error in considering the Supervisor\u2019s evidence of the post-\u201cdate of finality\u201d sales of units in Parc Somerset and, consequently, the decision of the Tax Court was arbitrary and capricious. The Circuit Court ordered a remand to the Tax Court for the assessment to be reconsidered and \u201creduce[d].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The Supervisor appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court and affirmed the Tax Court\u2019s decision. <em>Supervisor of Assessments of Montgomery Cty. v. Lane, </em>222 Md.App. 107, 112 A.3d 952 (2015). We granted Petitioner\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">1. Whether evidence of sales consummated subsequent to the date of finality is admissible in property tax assessment cases?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">2. Does the record lack substantial evidence to support the Tax Court\u2019s determination of assessed value where the Tax Court relied solely upon post-date of finality sales of units that differ from the subject property in location, layout, and size, and effectively imposed a $290,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>premium over the assessed value determined by the Property Tax Assessment Appeals Board for Montgomery County for an identical unit two floors below?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">We answer yes to the first question and no to the second question. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-1\">\u201cAn appeal before the Tax Court shall be heard <em>de novo </em>and conducted in a manner similar to a proceeding in a court of general jurisdiction sitting without a jury.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Tax-Gen. (\u201cTG\u201d) \u00a7 18-523 (1988, 2010 Repl.Vol.). Though denominated a \u201ccourt,\u201d the Tax Court is an administrative agency and, as such, \u201cis subject to the same standards of judicial review as other administrative agencies.\u201d <em>Frey v. Comptroller of Treasury, </em>422 Md. 111, 136, 29 A.3d 475 (2011). We look through the decisions of the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals to review the decision of the agency directly. <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Science Applications Int\u2019l Corp., </em>405 Md. 185, 192, 950 A.2d 766 (2008). We affirm the decision of the Tax Court \u201cunless that decision is not supported by substantial evidence appearing in the record or is erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Supervisor of Assessments v. Stellar GT, </em>406 Md. 658, 669, 961 A.2d 1119 (2008). This Court accords great deference to \u201cthe Tax Court\u2019s interpretation of the tax laws, but reviews its application of case law without special deference.\u201d <em>Andrecs, </em>444 Md. at 604, 120 A.3d 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-2\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\">Petitioner claims that the Tax Court erred as a matter of law in relying upon evidence of sales of comparable units in Parc Somerset that post-dated January 1, 2011. She interprets TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2) as prohibiting the Tax Court from considering any evidence arising after the date of finality when assessing property as of that date. She makes two arguments in support of that position: (1) the plain language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>of TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2) precludes the Tax Court\u2019s consideration of comparable sales occurring after January 1, 2011; and (2) consideration of such evidence violates the \u201cuniformity\u201d requirement of Article 15 of the Declaration of Rights. The Supervisor counters that the statutory language does not indicate, one way or the other, how property must be valued as of the date of finality; consequently, the Tax Court may consider probative evidence when assessing the value of the subject property as of January 1, 2011, including evidence of sales of comparable properties occurring reasonably soon after the date of finality. The Supervisor adds that relying on such evidence does not run afoul of Article 15. We conclude that the Supervisor has the better part of the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Petitioner\u2019s first argument is one of statutory interpretation. Her argument for why the \u201cplain language\u201d of TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2) does not allow for consideration of post-\u201cdate of finality\u201d sales of comparable units rests on the definition of \u201cfinality.\u201d Petitioner quotes Merriam-Webster\u2019s definition of \u201cfinality\u201d as possessing \u201cthe character or condition of being final, settled, irrevocable, or complete.\u201d She argues, based on that definition, that TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2) precludes reliance upon evidence of sales occurring after the date of finality when assessing the value of property on that date. Petitioner maintains that interpreting TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2) to allow reliance on sales occurring within \u201ca reasonable period of time thereafter\u201d would permit the vagaries of individual decision-makers to determine what constitutes \u201ca reasonable period of time.\u201d Petitioner argues that a \u201cbright-line rule that [TP \u00a7] 8-104 prohibits the use of sales occurring after the date of finality is consistent with the principle that \u2018[i]n case of doubt, tax statutes are construed most strongly against the government, and in favor of the citizen.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Comptroller of Treasury v. Clyde\u2019s of Chevy Chase, Inc., </em>377 Md. 471, 484, 833 A.2d 1014 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">We agree with Petitioner that the meaning of the phrase \u201cdate of finality\u201d is that real property is to be assessed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>reference to its value on January 1 of the relevant tax year. This meaning is fully consistent, moreover, with other provisions of the Tax Property Article. We, however, do not agree with Petitioner that the plain meaning of that phrase forecloses consideration of evidence that is relevant to determining the value of a subject property on the date of finality. Indeed, neither TP \u00a7 8-104 nor, as far as we can discern, any other provision of Title 8 of the Tax Property Article prescribes <em>how </em>the property\u2019s value, on the date of finality, is to be calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Whenever confronted with a question of statutory interpretation, we turn to the well-settled rules for that process. Those rules require us to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly. <em>Green v. Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, </em>430 Md. 119, 135, 59 A.3d 1001 (2013). We give the words their \u201cnatural and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Phillips, </em>445 Md. 55, 62, 124 A.3d 188 (2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). We avoid construing words in insolation; rather, we analyze the text within the larger statutory scheme in which it belongs. <em>Frey, </em>422 Md. at 182, 29 A.3d 475. And, \u201c[w]e neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the [General Assembly] used or engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>445 Md. at 62, 124 A.3d 188 (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The statutory scheme of the Tax Property Article reflects the General Assembly\u2019s intent to have the \u201cfull cash value\u201d of the subject real property be assessed as of the date of finality.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cFull cash value\u201d is the equivalent of fair market value. <em>See Shell Oil Co. v. Supervisor of Assessments of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number><em>Prince George\u2019s Cty., </em>278 Md. 659, 667-69, 366 A.2d 369 (1976). The fair market value of the property is the value \u201ca willing purchaser would pay to a willing seller in the open market.\u201d <em>Weil v. Supervisor of Assessments of Washington Cty., </em>266 Md. 238, 246, 292 A.2d 68 (1972) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThus, for purposes of measuring full cash value, the assessor should assume that a willing buyer and a willing seller wish to engage in a hypothetical sale of the property to be assessed.\u201d <em>St. Leonard Shores Joint Venture v. Supervisor of Assessments of Calvert Cty., </em>307 Md. 441, 446, 514 A.2d 1215 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Sales of comparable properties occurring reasonably soon after the date of finality are relevant to an accurate assessment of the valuation of property as of that date; there is, therefore, no good reason why such probative evidence should not be considered. <em>See Supervisor of Assessments of Anne Arundel Cty. v. Southgate Harbor, </em>279 Md. 586, 593, 369 A.2d 1053 (1977) (\u201cBecause valuation is not an exact science many, many methods have been used in attempting to determine fair market value.\u201d); <em>State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation v. Greyhound Comput. Corp., </em>271 Md. 575, 591, 320 A.2d 40 (1974) (\u201cIt has long been established that assessors have reasonable latitude in selecting any proper method of valuation that results in assessment at full cash value\u201d). Moreover, nothing in the Tax Property Article, the legislative history of TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2), or cases construing it suggests a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">We pointed out earlier in this opinion that the Tax Court reviews the appeal \u201cde novo\u201d and conducts the hearing \u201csimilar to a proceeding in a court of general jurisdiction sitting without a jury.\u201d TG \u00a7 13-523. The Tax Court has the \u201cfull power to hear, try, determine, or remand any matter\u201d and, \u201c[i]n exercising these powers, the Tax Court may reassess or reclassify, abate, modify, change or alter any valuation[.]\u201d TG \u00a7 13-528. Inherent in those powers is the discretion to decide what evidence is relevant to the matter at issue and accord to that evidence the weight it deserves. <em>See </em>TG \u00a7 13-524 (\u201cThe Tax Court is not bound by the technical rules of evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Because valuation \u201cis not an exact science,\u201d we have held that \u201cassessors have reasonable latitude in selecting a method of valuation that arrives at full cash value.\u201d <em>St. Leonard Shores Joint Venture, </em>307 Md. at 448, 514 A.2d 1215. The Tax Court, as the determiner of the value of Petitioner\u2019s condominium, had the responsibility to decide the relevance of the evidence presented, discard that which the court deemed irrelevant, and accord to that which is relevant the weight it deserved. The Tax Court considered as most relevant to assessing the value of Petitioner\u2019s unit the three sales of other units in Parc Somerset, all of which were sold in May 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">In <em>Hance v. State Roads Commission of Maryland, </em>221 Md. 164, 170-71, 156 A.2d 644 (1959), we reviewed the admissibility of evidence to determine the fair market value of property condemned by eminent domain, as of March 4, 1959, the date of the government condemnation. The trial court had excluded evidence of a comparable property sold a few weeks after the taking, \u201capparently on the sole ground that this sale was made <em>subsequent </em>to the taking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173, 156 A.2d 644. We held that evidence of that sale should have been admitted because such evidence is relevant to determining the market value of the property as of the date of the taking. <em>Id. </em>at 175-760, 156 A.2d 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Petitioner argues that <em>Hance </em>is distinguishable because a condemnation proceeding does not have a \u201cdate of finality\u201d similar to an assessment proceeding. We conclude, however, that a court in a condemnation proceeding, such as in <em>Hance, </em>is similar to an assessment proceeding before the Tax Court because both courts are assessing the value of property as of a certain date. Indeed, this is not the first tax assessment case in which a condemnation case has guided our analysis. <em>See Shell Oil Co., </em>278 Md. at 665-68, 366 A.2d 369 (\u201cCurrent zoning was an entirely proper factor for the assessor to consider in reaching his determination as to fair market value just as this is a proper factor to be considered in an eminent domain proceeding.\u201d). <em>Hance </em>confirms that evidence of sales of comparable properties occurring after an assessment date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>may be relevant to the property\u2019s fair market value as of the date of assessment and therefore are admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The conclusion we reach here is in line with that of our sister state courts, which have admitted evidence of comparable property sales occurring after the tax assessment date. <em>See In re Application of Rosewell, </em>120 Ill.App.3d 369, 75 Ill.Dec. 953, 458 N.E.2d 121, 125-26 (1983) (holding that evidence occurring after the tax assessment date, including the \u201csale of property during the tax year in question[,] is a \u2018relevant factor\u2019 in considering the validity of an assessment\u201d); <em>Almax Builders, Inc. v. City of Perth Amboy, </em>1 N.J.Tax 31, 37-38 (N.J. Tax Ct.1980) (holding that a sale of property after the tax assessment date is admissible \u201c[s]o long as a proffered sale is not remote\u201d because \u201c[o]ne cannot deny the logic of the equal rational probative value of a sale which occurs one day after the assessment date compared to its occurrence one day prior to such date\u201d and any \u201cweight to be accorded such sale or sales [remains with] the factfinder\u201d); <em>People ex rel.

For that argument, she points to <em>Montgomery County Board of Realtors, Inc. v. Montgomery County, </em>287 Md. 101, 411 A.2d 97 (1980), and <em>Supervisor of Assessments v. Stellar GT, </em>406 Md. 658, 961 A.2d 1119 (2008). Neither case supports Petitioner\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>In <em>Montgomery County Board of Realtors, </em>the County imposed a tax on \u201cthe transfer of real property\u201d when the \u201ctaxable value of such property on the date of [conveyance] exceeds the assessed valuation of that property.\u201d 287 Md. at 103, 411 A.2d 97. The ordinance was intended to prevent the owner/seller of property from \u201cenjoy[ing] the use of the property at a lesser tax burden than the sale reveals he should have borne.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102, 411 A.2d 97. We invalidated the County\u2019s attempt to \u201creassess and tax real property after the date of finality,\u201d as it would \u201cmove forward the date of finality\u201d and thereby directly conflict with state law. <em>Id. </em>at 109-10, 411 A.2d 97. <em>Montgomery County Board of Realtors </em>does not address, much less decide, what evidence the Tax Court may consider when assessing the value of property as of the date of finality.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><em>Stellar GT </em>likewise is of no assistance to Petitioner. That case involved the Supervisor of Assessments\u2019 reassessment of a property upon its sale for a price that far exceeded the assessment that had been determined on the date of finality at the outset of the tax cycle. We recognized that TP \u00a7 8 \u2014 104(c)(1) permits mid-cycle reassessments under certain circumstances. We held, though, that the sale of the subject property is not one of those circumstances, 406 Md. at 662, 673, 961 A.2d 1119; consequently, the reassessment, based on the sale price, amounted to a retroactive assessment, <em>id. </em>at 675, 961 A.2d 1119. That case is not remotely like the case before us. The Tax Court\u2019s exercise of its legislative grant of authority to assess de novo the value of a subject property on the date of finality does not amount to a retroactive assessment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For the reasons we have discussed, we reject Petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>er\u2019s construction of TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2), and we hold that sales of comparable properties occurring reasonably soon after the date of finality can be considered relevant by the Tax Court when called upon to assess the value of the property on the date of finality.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">We turn next to Petitioner\u2019s argument that admitting sales evidence subsequent to the date of finality violates the uniformity requirement of Article 15. The assessment of property taxes must \u201cbe \u2018uniform\u2019 within each class or subclass of property as those classes are defined by the Legislature\u201d; therefore, property must be \u201cassessed based on an equivalent proportion of the property\u2019s actual value.\u201d <em>Andreas, </em>444 Md. at 589, 120 A.3d 734. Judge McDonald, writing for this Court in <em>Andrecs, </em>explained that there are two principles attendant to the requirement of uniformity: \u201c(1) that property taxes be based on actual value and (2) that they be assessed based on an equivalent proportion of value within each class or sub-class of property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Perfect uniformity in assessments is an impossibility and therefore not required. <em>Id. </em>at 590, 120 A.3d 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Petitioner asserts that the Tax Court violated Article 15 by considering evidence that differed from that which the PTAAB considered. We disagree. The Tax Court, as the de novo arbiter of the value of Petitioner\u2019s condominium, was entitled to consider whatever evidence that, within reason, the court deemed relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Petitioner also argues that the Tax Court violated the uniformity requirement of Article 15 because the Tax Court failed to assess her property consistent with the PTAAB\u2019s assessments of virtually identical units, 803 and 703. The uniformity requirement is violated when property within the same class or sub-class is not \u201cassessed based on an equivalent proportion of the property\u2019s actual value.\u201d <em>Andreas, </em>444 Md. at 589, 120 A.3d 734. Accordingly, Article 15 \u201crequires that the same standard of value or economic yardstick must be used in making assessments within the same subclass.\u201d <em>Greyhound, </em>271 Md. at 590, 320 A.2d 40. In the present case, the Tax Court\u2019s valuation of Petitioner\u2019s property does not offend uniformity principles because her property was assessed at its full cash value, which is the \u201ceconomic yardstick\u201d used to assess all real property. <em>See id.; see also Samet v. Supervisor of Assessments of Balt. City, </em>290 Md. 357, 361, 430 A.2d 73 (1981) (explaining that an owner whose property has been properly assessed according to the fair market value will not receive a reduced assessment even when neighboring properties may have been assessed at a lesser valuation). We hold that the Tax Court did not violate Article 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">When reviewing whether the Tax Court\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, we evaluate \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Frey, </em>422 Md. at 137, 29 A.3d 475 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Tax Court resolves conflicts in evidence and draws reasonable inferences when necessary. <em>St. Leonard Shores Joint Venture, </em>307 Md. at 447, 514 A.2d 1215. Petitioner argues that the Tax Court\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence because the court relied solely upon post-date of finality sales and consequently failed to consider Petitioner\u2019s evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The Tax Court considered but discredited Petitioner\u2019s evidence \u2014 an appraisal, for refinancing purposes, of a unit in Park Somerset that was based on units in the older, less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>desirable buildings in the Somerset House development. The Tax Court explained at the hearing that, \u201ceven though the methodology of the appraisal\u201d was professional, \u201cit\u2019s not accurate at all.\u201d The Tax Court reasoned that when Petitioner\u2019s appraiser relied on \u201csales from the other building[s],\u201d the appraiser failed to make appropriate adjustments to account for the desirability of the Parc Somerset building. The Tax Court concluded that the Supervisor\u2019s evidence was more accurate to the valuation of Petitioner\u2019s property. In its written decision, the Tax Court again summarized the evidence presented by both parties and concluded that \u201cbased on the Assessor\u2019s best comparable, a modicum of further relief is warranted\u201d thereby, again, crediting the Supervisor\u2019s evidence as more probative of the valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">We held earlier in this opinion that the Tax Court may consider the sale of comparable properties occurring within a reasonable time after the date of finality to assess the value of the property. As was its prerogative, the Tax Court relied in the present case on such evidence to support its assessment. We see no error of fact or law in the Tax Court\u2019s doing so and therefore defer to that court\u2019s decision. <em>See Supervisor of Assessments of Anne Arundel Cty. v. Hartge Yacht Yard, Inc., </em>379 Md. 452, 461, 842 A.2d 732 (2004) (explaining that, when \u201cthe Tax Court\u2019s decision is based on a factual determination, and there is no error of law, the reviewing court may not reverse the Tax Court\u2019s order if substantial evidence of record supports the agency\u2019s decision\u201d). We therefore hold that the Tax Court\u2019s assessment of Petitioner\u2019s property, relying upon the Supervisor\u2019s post-date of finality sales, was supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Petitioner also argued during oral argument before us that a taxpayer\u2019s right to appeal may be chilled if post-\"date of finality\u201d sales may be admitted because those sales may support a greater assessment than originally assessed by the tax assessor. Our decision in <em>Abramson v. Montgomery County, </em>328 Md. 721, 616 A.2d 894 (1992), demonstrates the flaw in Petitioner's argument. In <em>Abramson, </em>the property owners of White Flint Mall, unhappy with the Supervisor\u2019s valuation of their property, took an appeal to the PTAAB. At the hearing before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>PTAAB, Montgomery County intervened and argued that the property value was higher than that proposed by the Supervisor, but PTAAB affirmed the Supervisor\u2019s valuation. <em>Id. </em>at 725, 616 A.2d 894. Montgomery County appealed PTAAB\u2019s decision to the Tax Court, and the Tax Court, agreeing with the County\u2019s valuation, increased the property\u2019s value for tax assessment. <em>Id. </em>at 725-26, 616 A.2d 894. The owners appealed the Tax Court\u2019s decision, arguing that Montgomery County lacked standing before the Tax Court, <em>Id. </em>at 726, 616 A.2d 894.

Although the Majority opinion is well written, I would hold that Md.Code Ann., Tax-Prop. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>(1985, 2012 Repl.Vol.) (\u201cTP\u201d) \u00a7 8-104(b), by its plain language, does not permit the Maryland Tax Court (\u201cthe Tax Court\u201d) to take into consideration sales of comparable properties that occur after the date of finality in determining the value of a property on the date of finality.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Because this case turns on statutory interpretation, I reiterate the pertinent principles of statutory interpretation as set forth in <em>Hailes v. State, </em>442 Md. 488, 495-96, 113 A.3d 608, 612 (2015):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">In interpreting a statute, a court first considers the statute\u2019s language, which the court applies where the statute\u2019s language is unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose. Where the statute\u2019s language is ambiguous or not clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, the court searches for the General Assembly\u2019s intent in other indicia, including the history of the statute or other relevant sources intrinsic and extrinsic to the legislative process, in light of: (1) the structure of the statute; (2) how the statute relates to other laws; (3) the statute\u2019s general purpose; and (4) the relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7Lx\">(Citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Examining the plain language of TP \u00a7 8 \u2014 104(b), I would conclude that nothing in TP \u00a7 8-104(b) permits the Tax Court to take into consideration events occurring after the date of finality in determining the value of a property on the date of finality. TP \u00a7 8 \u2014 104(b)(1) provides that, \u201c[notwithstanding a revaluation under subsection (c) of this section, the [State] Department [of Assessments and Taxation (\u201cSDAT\u201d) ] or supervisor [of assessments for a county] shall value all real property once in every 3-year cycle based on an exterior physical inspection of the real property.\u201d TP \u00a7 8-102(a) provides that, with an exception not relevant here, \u201cthe value of real property shall be its value on the date of finality.\u201d (Emphasis added). TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2), in turn, states: \u201cThe date of finality for real property that is valued under this subsection is the January 1 immediately before the 1st taxable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>year[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] to which the assessment based on the new value is applicable.\u201d In other words, pursuant to TP \u00a7 8-102(a), the value of a property \u201cshall be its value on the date of finality[,]\u201d which, under TP \u00a7 8 \u2014 104(b)(2), is January 1 of the relevant tax year. Significantly, TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2) makes no mention whatsoever of consideration of events occurring after the date of finality as being relevant to determining the value of a property on the date of finality. Rather, the date of finality is the date of <em>finality </em>\u2014 ie., January 1 of the relevant tax year\u2014 nothing more and nothing less.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2)\u2019s plain language comports with the commonsense understanding of the term \u201cfinality.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cfinality\u201d as \u201c[t]he quality of being complete and unchangeable.\u201d Finality, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed.2014). Similarly, Merriam-Webster defines \u201cfinality\u201d as \u201cthe quality or state of being final or finished and not able to be changed\u201d and as \u201cthe character or condition of being final, settled, irrevocable, or eomplete[.]\u201d Finality, Merriam-Webster (2015), http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ finality [http://perma.co/3V8H-MYD7]. Simply put, something has finality when it is complete, final, and finished. Thus, the date of finality for purposes of real property assessment is January 1 of the relevant tax year; <em>ie., </em>that is the date when the assessment is to be complete, final, and finished, and the value of a property must be the value that exists on January 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2)\u2019s plain language and meaning simply does not allow for consideration of events occurring after January 1 for a determination of what a property\u2019s value is as of January 1. And this reading of TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2) is entirely logical. If something is to be final as of a certain date, that does not mean that something is somewhat final as of that date and that events that occur months after that date can somehow be used to justify a different result or to change what otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>is meant to be final. Take, for instance, the example of a student\u2019s homework assignment. The teacher states that the homework assignment must be finished as of January 1 and that her grade will be finalized as of that same date, January 1. The student finishes the homework assignment and turns it in on January 1. The teacher grades the homework assignment and returns it to the student. The student believes that the homework assignment grade is final and thinks no more of it. Months later, however, after having graded other assignments from other students, the teacher adjusts the grade given to the student on the homework assignment due on January 1, lowering the grade. Obviously, the student thinks such a result is unfair because the grade given after she turned in the homework assignment has now been adjusted against her, based on events that occurred after that assignment, namely, other students having turned in other assignments. Such a result flies in the face of the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cfinal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Moreover, in addition to the circumstance that TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2)\u2019s plain language and meaning do not provide for consideration of events occurring after January 1 in determining what a property\u2019s value is as of January 1, TP \u00a78-104(b)(2)\u2019s legislative history is notably silent on the matter. Indeed, the Majority fails to identify any legislative history supporting its interpretation of TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2). Rather, the Majority simply states: \u201cSales of comparable properties occurring reasonably soon after the date of finality are relevant to an accurate assessment of the valuation of property as of that date; there is, therefore, no good reason why such probative evidence should not be considered.\u201d Maj. Op. at 467, 135 A.3d at 835 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But such reasoning is circular, renders the term \u201cdate of finality\u201d essentially meaningless, and adds to TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2) language that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>not there, thus violating one of the cardinal rules of statutory construction. <em>See Montgomery Cnty. v. Phillips, </em>445 Md. 55, 62, 124 A.3d 188, 192 (2015) (\u201c[W]e neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words [that] the General Assembly used or engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d (Citation and brackets omitted)); <em>id. </em>at 63, 124 A.3d at 192 (\u201cIn construing a statute, we avoid a construction of the statute that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d (Citation and brackets omitted)); <em>Doe v. Montgomery Cnty. Bd. of Elections, </em>406 Md. 697, 712, 962 A.2d 342, 351 (2008) (\u201cWe begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence^] or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless[,] or nugatory.\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). In short, in my view, the Majority adds something to TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2) that is not there where the General Assembly has given no indication that it intended to permit the Tax Court to consider events occurring after the date of finality in determining a property\u2019s value on the date of finality. And there is a good reason for not considering sales occurring after the date of finality\u2014 namely, fairness to the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The Majority also holds that, because the Tax Court reviews appeals <em>de novo, </em>the Tax Court \u201chad the responsibility to decide the relevance of the evidence presented, discard that which the court deemed irrelevant, and accord to that which is relevant the weight [that] it deserved\u201d; <em>i.e., </em>the Tax Court was permitted to consider the sales of comparable properties occurring after the date of finality. Maj. Op. at 468, 135 A.3d at 841-42. However, such a holding turns the concept of <em>de novo </em>review on its head. To be sure, \u201c[a]n appeal before the Tax Court shall be heard de novo and conducted in a manner similar to a proceeding in a court of general jurisdiction sitting without a jury.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Tax-Gen. (1988, 2010 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 13-523. However, the power of the Tax Court to hear appeals <em>de novo </em>does not permit the Tax Court to override the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>plain language of TP \u00a7 8 \u2014 104(b)(2) and take into consideration evidence that occurs after the date of finality in contravention of TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2). Indeed, the Majority\u2019s reasoning as to the Tax Court\u2019s power to hear appeals <em>de novo </em>is a red herring and has no correlation whatsoever with the Tax Court\u2019s authority as it relates to statutory interpretation. <em>See, e.g., Phillips, </em>445 Md. at 61-62, 124 A.3d at 191-92 (When an appellate court reviews decisions of the Tax Court, the appellate court is \u201cunder no statutory constraints in reversing a Tax Court order [that] is premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law____A reviewing court will not accord deference to the [T]ax [C]ourt\u2019s decision on a question of law[.]\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Furthermore, I disagree with the Majority\u2019s use of condemnation cases to justify exceeding the plain language of TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2). Specifically, I disagree with the Majority\u2019s reading of <em>Hance v. State Rds. Comm\u2019n of Md., </em>221 Md. 164, 156 A.2d 644 (1959) as \u201cconfirm[ing] that evidence of sales of comparable properties occurring after an assessment date may be relevant to the property\u2019s fair market value as of the date of assessment and therefore are admissible.\u201d Maj. Op. at 468-69, 135 A.3d at 842. In my view, <em>Hance, </em>221 Md. at 167, 156 A.2d at 644, is distinguishable and not persuasive in the context of this property assessment case because, simply put, it is a condemnation case. In <em>Hance, id. </em>at 175, 156 A.2d at 650, we held that, in the context of a condemnation case, comparable sales that \u201ctak[e] place subsequent to the taking\u201d may be considered in determining the market value of the property as of the date of the taking. That the most recent information about the values of comparable properties is admissible in condemnation cases is not dispositive of the issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Importantly, the statutes concerning eminent domain do not provide that the valuation of the property taken must be done by the date of finality. Indeed, Md.Code Ann., Real Prop. (1974, 2015 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 12-103 expressly provides: \u201cUnless an applicable statute specifies a different time as of which the value is to be determined, the value of the property sought to be condemned and of any adjacent property of the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>claimed to be affected by the taking shall be determined as of the date of the taking, if taking has occurred, or as of the date of trial, if taking has not occurred.\u201d Nonetheless, this Court has held that the \u201cvaluation date is not immutable\u201d \u201cbecause the date of valuation set by statute cannot be used to deprive a property owner of the just compensation [that the owner] is entitled to receive^]\u201d <em>City of Baltimore v. Kelso Corp., </em>281 Md. 514, 519, 380 A.2d 216, 219 (1977). Thus, in <em>Kelso Corp., id. </em>at 519, 380 A.2d at 219, we held that, if the property owner could \u201cshow that the City through fraud manipulated the date of valuation to [the owner\u2019s] detriment, the court can remedy the injustice by ignoring the statutory date and allowing the jury to consider such factors as will allow the property owner to receive just compensation free of any effect of the fraudulent device.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">In any event, in my view, the distinction between the purposes of condemnation and routine property assessment renders <em>Hance </em>and similar condemnation cases inapplicable. Condemnation occurs where the government takes a property through the power of eminent domain. <em>See Mayor and City Council of Balt. City v. Valsamaki, </em>397 Md. 222, 241, 916 A.2d 324, 335 (2007) (\u201cCondemnation is a function of the State\u2019s power of eminent domain[, which] is defined as the inherent power of a governmental entity to take privately owned property, especially] land, and convert it to public use, subject to reasonable compensation for the taking.\u201d (Citation, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted)). The goal in a condemnation case, however, is to try to give the property owner every opportunity to establish the value of the property that is most favorable to the property owner, <em>i.e., </em>to establish \u201creasonable compensation for the taking.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 243, 916 A.2d at 337 (\u201cThe Maryland Constitution provides that: \u2018The General Assembly shall enact no Law authorizing private property, to be taken for public use, without just compensation, as agreed upon between the parties, or awarded by a Jury, being first paid or tendered to the party entitled to such compensation.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted)). By contrast, in the context of property assessment, the purpose of property assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>ment is to assess property based on the fair market value of a property at a particular time. Indeed, SDAT or local authorities are to assess property taxes based on the \u201cfull cash value of property!,]\u201d TP \u00a7 1-101(qq), which is the equivalent of the fair market value of the property. And, pursuant to TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2)\u2019s plain language, the fair market value is assessed as of the date of finality.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Significantly, unlike in condemnation cases, in the context of property assessment, TP \u00a7 8-102(a) and TP \u00a7 8 \u2014 104(b)(2) expressly provide that the value of real property shall be the value as on the date of finality, which is January 1 of the relevant tax year. In other words, property assessment relies on the date of \u201cfinality,\u201d not the date of taking, the date of trial, or some other appropriate date. Through use of the term \u201cdate of finality,\u201d the General Assembly clearly expressed an intent that property owners have finality, <em>ie., </em>certainty about the date on which the value of the property would be determined. In other words, a property owner would know that, as of January 1 of the relevant tax year, his or her property has a specific value for tax assessment purposes. The property owner would then have the ability to rely on, or at least know, what the evidence would consist of, should the property owner choose to appeal the Board\u2019s decision or initial valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">By holding as the Majority does, however, property owners are placed in the difficult position of spinning the wheel and gambling on appeal, as property values could go up or down depending on \u201cthe sale of comparable properties occurring within a reasonable time after the date of finality!.]\u201d Maj. Op. at 473, 135 A.3d at 839. In my view, the Majority\u2019s holding will chill property owners\u2019 willingness and ability to appeal the Board\u2019s decision or initial valuation because the property owners will not know what the valuation is based on or what evidence will be used from after the date of finality. In some instances, a property owner will accept whatever the initial valuation is, rather than risk an appeal that could result in a higher valuation in light of the sale of comparable properties occurring after the date of finality. Presumably, it is left to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>property owner\u2019s ability to read the Majority\u2019s opinion to assess the risk of an appeal. The Majority\u2019s holding places the onus on the property owner to locate sales of comparable properties \u201coccurring reasonably soon after the date of finality!,]\u201d and then accurately predict which sales of comparable properties SDAT or the Supervisor will utilize in reassessing the value of the property owner\u2019s property and which sales the Tax Court will find \u201crelevant!.]\u201d Maj. Op. at 467, 135 A.3d at 835. Additionally, what constitutes \u201coccurring reasonably soon after the date of finality\u201d is not defined by the Majority and would be subject to varying interpretations by SDAT and the Tax Court. This could not have been the General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Moreover, I want to emphasize that the Notice of Assessment, dated December 28, 2010, issued by the Supervisor of Assessments for Montgomery County to Petitioner stated that Petitioner\u2019s property would be assessed at a value of $2,130,000, which represented \u201cthe new market value effective January 1, 2011.\u201d The Notice of Assessment expressly stated that the \u201cnew market value is based upon market data available prior to this date.\u201d In other words, everything that was provided to Petitioner explicitly stated that the assessment of her property was based upon market data available prior to the date of finality, <em>ie,, </em>January 1, and that the assessment was effective as of the date of finality. There was no other notice that was provided to Petitioner that stated otherwise, and there was certainly nothing that was provided to Petitioner stating that the Supervisor could later justify the assessment using market data occurring after the date of finality.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In sum, I would hold that TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2) does not permit the Tax Court to take into consideration sales of comparable properties that occur after the date of finality in determining the value of a property on the date of finality, as such a holding is contrary to TP \u00a7 8-104(b)(2)\u2019s plain language, common sense, and the goal of giving property owners finality with respect to property assessments. Accordingly, for the above reasons, respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b507-6\">Judge BATTAGLIA has authorized me to state that she joins in this opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-6\">.
