This appeal comes before us from the action of the district court, dismissing the complaint without prejudice pending the plaintiff\u2019s exhaustion of state administrative remedies by submission of his grievance to a newly devised administrative procedure in the Georgia state prisons for processing inmate grievances. The district court took this action in compliance with an earlier order in this case entered September 18, 1974, by another panel of this Court. That panel has now withdrawn and vacated the order of September 18, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">It is, of course, true that the federal courts have imposed upon federal prisoners the requirement that they \u201cexhaust their administrative remedies in accordance with Bureau of Prisons policy\u201d. Jones v. Carlson, 5 Cir. 1974, 495 F.2d 209, 210. See also Paden v. United States, 5 Cir. 1970, 430 F.2d 882; Thompson v. Prison Industries, 5 Cir. 1974, 492 F.2d 1082. A federal prisoner typically brings his suit in mandamus. When he does, this Court has required that administrative remedies available within the prison system itself be exhausted before such actions will be entertained. See, e. <em>g., </em>Knight v. Henderson, 5 Cir. 1974, 500 F.2d 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The rule for state prisoners is different. The starting point for any discussion of the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 is, of course, Monroe v. Pape, 1961, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492. There it was established that \u201cthe federal remedy is supplementary to the state remedy, and the latter need not to be first sought and refused before the federal one is invoked.\u201d 365 U.S. at 183, 81 S.Ct. at 482. A line of per curiam opinions of the Supreme Court followed and reinforced the non-exhaustion rule. In the area of administrative remedies generally, the most important of these was perhaps McNeese v. Board of Education, 1963, 373 U.S. 668, 83 S.Ct. 1433, 10 L.Ed.2d 622. There the Court held that the exhaustion of administrative remedies was not a prerequisite to maintaining the suit, particularly when it appeared that the administrative remedy was not \u201csufficiently adequate\u201d. 373 U.S. at 674, 83 S.Ct. at 1437. But as Justice Harlan pointed out in his dissent, \u201cThere is nothing that leaves room for serious doubt as to the efficacy of the administrative remedy which Illinois has provided.\u201d 373 U.S. at 677, 83 S.Ct. at 1439.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">With the advent of prisoner litigation challenging the conditions of confinement, the Court first faced the problem of exhaustion in the prisoner\u2019s rights area in Houghton v. Shafer, 1968, 392 U.S. 639, 88 S.Ct. 2119, 20 L.Ed.2d 1319. In <em>Houghton, </em>the state prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action was based upon the alleged deprivation of legal materials that he was using to prepare an appeal of his conviction. The Court noted that to require a prisoner to appeal the prison confiscation rules as applied to him to the state attorney general would be \u201cfutile\u201d. But the Court held: \u201cIn any event, resort to these remedies is unnecessary in light of our decisions in Monroe v. Pape . . . ; and Damico v. California, 389 U.S. 416, 88 S.Ct. 526, 19 L.Ed.2d 647.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Later, in Wilwording v. Swenson, 1971, 404 U.S. 249, 92 S.Ct. 407, 30 L.Ed.2d 418, the Court made it clear that its holding in <em>Houghton </em>did not depend on the adequacy of the state administrative remedies. The Court explicitly stated that \u201cstate prisoners are not held to any stricter standard of exhaustion than other civil rights plaintiffs\u201d, and that \u201calthough the probable futility of such administrative appeals [in Houghton] was noted, we held that in \u2018any event, resort to these remedies is unnecessary.\u2019 \u201d 404 U.S. at 251-52, 92 S.Ct. at 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">In Steffel v. Thompson, 1974, 415 U.S. 452, 94 S.Ct. 1209, 39 L.Ed.2d 505, the Court made the unqualified statement: \u201cWhen federal claims are premised on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3)\u2014 as they are here \u2014 we have npt required exhaustion of state judicial or administrative remedies, recognizing the para<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>mount role Congress has assigned to the federal courts to protect constitutional rights\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">In Preiser v. Rodriguez, 1973, 411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439, the Court drew a distinction between suits challenging the fact and duration of confinement and those challenging the conditions pertaining to confinement. It noted that the prisoners \u201ccould have sought and obtained fully effective relief through federal habeas corpus proceedings\u201d. 411 U.S. at 488, 93 S.Ct. at 1835. The Court held that prisoners seeking restoration of good time credits must exhaust adequate and available state remedies as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) provides. But, the Court cautioned, its holding extended only to prisoners who \u201csought no damages, but only equitable relief \u2014 restoration of their good time credits\u201d. \u201cIf a state prisoner is seeking damages, he is attacking something other than the fact or length of his confinement, and he is seeking something other than immediate or more speedy release \u2014 the traditional purpose of habeas corpus. In the case of a damage claim, habeas corpus is <em>not </em>an appropriate or available federal remedy.\u201d 411 U.S. at 494, 93 S.Ct. at 1838.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">More recently, in Wolff v. McDonnell, 1974, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935, the Court reaffirmed the propriety of bringing actions other than those challenging the fact or duration of confinement under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983: \u201cThe complaint in this case sought restoration of good-time credits, and the Court of Appeals correctly held this relief foreclosed under <em>Preiser. </em>But the complaint also sought damages; and <em>Preiser </em>expressly contemplated that claims properly brought under \u00a7 1983 could go forward while actual restoration of good-time credits is sought in state proceedings.\u201d At 554, 94 S.Ct. at 2974, 41 L.Ed.2d at 950. In a footnote, the Court noted that \u201cone would anticipate that normal principles of res judicata would apply in such circumstances.\u201d At 554, 94 S.Ct. at 2974, 41 L.Ed.2d at 950 n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\"><em>Wolff, </em>taken together with <em>Wilwording </em>and <em>Houghton, </em>establishes that the plaintiff in a case such as the present one is challenging the conditions of his confinement, rather than its fact or duration. Accordingly, he may bring an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 without exhausting state administrative remedies, regardless of their adequacy. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has recently reached the same conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-11\">We keenly appreciate the force of the factors identified by the district court in <em>McCray </em>[McCray v. Burrell, D.C., 367 F.Supp. 1191] and <em>Washington </em>[Washington v. Boslow, D.C., 375 F.Supp. 1298] as supporting a policy determination that [the] exhaustion of available administrative remedies should be required of prisoners of correctional institutions in Maryland as a prerequisite to a suit under \u00a7 1983. We recognize the burden which the increasing flood of prisoner complaint litigation places upon the already overtaxed district courts as well as ourselves. Nevertheless, we are constrained to conclude that the holding that exhaustion is required may be reached only by either legislation conditioning resort to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 upon the exhaustion of available administrative remedies, or by the Supreme Court\u2019s re-examination and modification of its controlling adjudications on the subject. Congress has not enacted such legislation. The Supreme Court has not yet begun a reexamination of its previous holdings and we have no basis on which to predict that it will, or, if so, with what result. We think that we have no alternative but to hold that exhaustion may not be required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">McCray v. Burrell, 516 F.2d 357 (4 Cir. 1975) (en banc).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>We, too, are aware of the burdens imposed upon the federal judicial system by the increasing volume of prisoner litigation. Although claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 may be brought in the state courts, the great bulk of the litigation has been in the federal courts. The federal courts, and particularly the district courts, must make every effort to devise procedural innovations that will readily separate meritorious claims from frivolous claims and that will encourage informal settlements of grievances while at the same time preserving the plaintiffs\u2019 rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The problems are particularly vexing because generally speaking no right to counsel exists in \u00a7 1983 cases, and the pleadings are drawn in the first instance by plaintiffs unlearned in the law. Some courts have appointed counsel who have indicated their willingness to accept such appointments to represent plaintiffs in \u00a7 1983 cases that appear to raise particularly meritorious claims. Others, such as the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, have experimented with appointing third-year law students working under faculty supervision to aid prisoners in prosecuting their claims under \u00a7 1983. The Federal Judicial Center has appointed a special committee under the chairmanship of Judge Ruggero J. Aldisert of the Third Circuit, with Professor Frank J. Remington as reporter, to study the handling of prisoners\u2019 civil rights cases and to propose procedures for more efficient processing of those cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The important work of this committee is still in progress, but we have had the benefit of studying a preliminary draft of its report and recommendations. One of the developments the report takes note of is especially relevant to the present case. We must caution, however, that the report is tentative only and does not bear the imprimatur of the committee or of the Judicial Center. The tentative draft notes that District Judge Vincent Biunno has devised a \u201cspecial report\u201d for use in conjunction with \u00a7 1983 litigation before his court in cases which \u201cappear to have significance beyond the individual prisoner who brings the action\u201d. The draft points out that Judge Biunno determines the significant questions raised by the complaint and enters an order directing the state attorney general to furnish information regarding those questions to the court. It is not clear how this \u201cspecial report\u201d procedure interacts with the more familiar processes of pre-trial practice under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which ordinarily would govern \u00a7 1983 cases. To the extent that requiring such \u201cspecial reports\u201d does not divest the \u00a7 1983 plaintiff of any of the rights he enjoys under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the non-exhaustion doctrine, it would appear to be a worthwhile innovation. Such \u201cspecial reports\u201d should not be devised as functional equivalents of the exhaustion of administrative remedies. Rather, if utilized, they should serve the useful functions of notifying the responsible state officials of the precise nature of the prisoner\u2019s grievance and encouraging informal settlement of it, or, at the least, of encouraging them to give the matter their immediate attention so that the case may expeditiously be shaped for adjudication. It is, of course, in the sound discretion of the district court whether special measures such as that devised by Judge Biunno are appropriate to the particular \u00a7 1983 claim before it. The facts here suggest that this may be such a case, and we encourage the district court to consider the possibility on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">We vacate the order of the district court dismissing without prejudice the plaintiff\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust state administrative remedies, and we remand the cause for further proceedings in light of the authorities cited herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ax3\">.
