Huge, 170 U.S.App.D.C. -, 517 F.2d 1237, No. 73-1393, decided this day. Therefore, this opinion will be limited to a discussion of only those facts and issues that have not been fully treated in the <em>Kiser </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-27\">The class in this case consists of all former mine workers who retired <em>prior to </em>1 February 1965 and who were denied pension benefits solely on the basis of their failure to meet the signatory last employment requirement of Trustees\u2019 Resolution No. 56, as amended by Resolution No. 57.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, this re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>quirement provided that in order to qualify for a pension, a miner must have \u201c[p]ermanently retired from and ceased work in the Bituminous Coal Industry after May 28, 1946, following regular employment in a classified job . as an employee of an operator signatory to the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of 1950 . . . . \u201d The plaintiffs-appellees filed their complaint in District Court on 15 July 1969, well before this court decided in Roark v. Boyle<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(Roark II) </em>that a bare signatory last employment requirement is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-5\">I. <em>History of the Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1335-6\">On 9 January 1973 the District Court, 352 F.Supp. 1294, having found that there were no material facts genuinely in dispute, entered summary judgment for the plaintiffs. The court declared the signatory last employment requirement invalid as applied to plaintiffs and enjoined the Fund \u201cfrom denying to the members of the class of plaintiffs herein present and future pension benefits.\u201d The court further ordered that the plaintiffs be paid back pension benefits retroactive to 15 July 1969, the date their complaint was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-7\">On 25 May 1973 this court ordered that \u201cmembers of the class of plaintiffs-appellees who have worked a minimum of five (5) years for a signatory operator since May 28, 1946, shall forthwith be placed by [the Fund] upon the pension rolls as of January 1, 1973 [and] shall be paid by [the Fund] back pension benefits retroactive where appropriate to August 14, 1970, the decision date of Roark v. Boyle . . .\u201d We styled this order as an \u201cintermediate position . . . pending appeal.\u201d We further remanded the record to the District Court \u201cto facilitate an expeditious final decision on the matter of full pension retroactivity still pending before it and on the issue of what period of prior signatory service is a prerequisite to pension eligibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-13\">On remand the District Court issued a Memorandum and Order dated 24 January 1974 providing: (1) that the class plaintiffs are entitled to back pension benefits \u201cretroactive to the first day of the month following the date that their respective applications for pensions were denied\u201d; (2) that no interest will be paid on plaintiffs\u2019 accrued pensions; and (3) \u201cthat defendants shall pay to class action plaintiffs\u2019 counsel the sum of $240,921.00, as well as $1,321.09 for expenses incurred and disbursed by counsel up to and including July 19, 1973, and all proper expenses incurred and disbursed thereafter.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court also held that it would be inappropriate to impose on class members a five-year total signatory service requirement as a prerequisite to pension eligibility.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1335-14\">On the basis of our holding in Kiser v. Huge, 170 U.S.App.D.C. -, 517 F.2d 1237, No. 73-1393, we affirm the District Court insofar as it ordered that members of the plaintiff class be placed on the pension rolls and be paid retroactive pension benefits. We reverse the District Court\u2019s determination that plaintiffs-appellees are not entitled to interest on their accrued pensions. We remand the record for further action in accordance with this opinion and that in <em>Kiser </em>with respect to (1) the question of how much total signatory service should be required to qualify for the relief granted herein; (2) interest; and (3) attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-17\">II. <em>Invalidity of the Signatory Last Employment Requirement as Applied to Plaintiffs-Appellees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1335-18\">The governing resolution when members of the plaintiff class filed their pension applications was No. 56, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>amended by No. 57. This resolution, contained a bare signatory last employment requirement, which we found arbitrary and capricious in <em>Roark II. </em>Under our decision today in Kiser v. Huge, Resolution No. 83, which attempted to supply a \u201cvalidating context\u201d for the signatory last employment requirement, cannot be given retroactive effect to deny the pension applications of plaintiffs-appellees. Since members of the plaintiff class met all criteria for eligibility in effect when they applied except the invalid signatory last employment requirement of Resolution No. 56, they then acquired rights to pension benefits that could not be divested by subsequent alterations in eligibility requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-4\">We affirm the District Court\u2019s holding that members of the plaintiff class are now entitled to pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-5\">III. <em>Retroactive Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-6\">The District Court ordered that each member of the plaintiff class be paid accrued pension benefits retroactive to the first day of the month following the date on which his pension application was denied. On the basis of the discussion in the corresponding section (Part IV) of our opinion in Kiser v. Huge, we affirm this aspect of the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-13\">IV. <em>Total Signatory Service</em></p>\n<p id=\"AWn\">In our order of 25 May 1973 we remanded the record in this case to the District Court with instructions to reach a \u201cfinal decision ... on the issue of what period of prior signatory service is a prerequisite to pension eligibility.\u201d In so doing, we recognized that in <em>Roark II </em>we had stated, \u201c[T]he Taft-Hartley Act [section 302(c) (5) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] requires that each pensioner have some history of contributory employment.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-14\">In its Memorandum of 24 January 1974 the District Court held that <em>five years </em>of signatory service <em>should not be required</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>While we agree that it would be inappropriate to apply a five-year signatory service requirement to the members of the plaintiff class,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we must conclude that the District Court has not fully implemented the instruction on remand that it specify <em>some </em>period of signatory service as a prerequisite to pension eligiblity. Therefore, we again remand the record to the District Court for an expeditious exercise of its equitable discretion on this issue in light of the discussion herein and in Kiser v. Huge.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>We should note as a guide to the District Court that our affirmance of the court\u2019s decision in <em>Kiser </em>to impose a one-year signatory service requirement does not necessarily compel a similar result in the instant case. The rationale of the decision in <em>Kiser </em>was, in part, that the resolution in effect at the time members of the <em>Kiser </em>class applied for pensions contained the bare requirement that an applicant have worked his last year in the coal industry for a signatory employer; thus, the total amount of signatory service then required was one year. In the instant case, Resolution No. 56, which governed the applications of plaintiff class members, required only that an applicant have worked some <em>amount of time </em>for a signatory operator at the end of his career. Hence, the solution in this case that would parallel the result in <em>Kiser </em>would be to require each member of the plaintiff class to demonstrate that he has <em>some </em>signatory service to his credit. We emphasize, however, that this solution is not inevitable. The final solution lies within the equitable discretion of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"A1z\">V. <em>Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-5\">For the reasons stated in Part VI of our opinion in Kiser v. Huge, we reverse the District Court\u2019s decision not to grant plaintiffs-appellees interest on their accrued pensions. We remand to the District Court with instructions to award members of the plaintiff class interest at six percent per annum on accrued pension payments from the dates on which those payments fell due through the date on which the judgment in this case is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-6\">VI. <em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-7\">In its Memorandum and Order of 24 January 1974, the District Court taxed against defendants-appellants fees for the plaintiff class attorneys totaling $240,921.00. This figure was reached by multiplying the total number of hours logged by an hourly rate of $50.00 and adding as a bonus five percent of the estimated class recovery.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-10\"> We must accord the District Court considerable latitude in determining the proper compensation for attorneys.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Hence, it would be inappropriate to upset the District Court\u2019s decisions with respect to the number of hours to be credited to class counsel and the hourly rate of compensation since we find those decisions reasonable. However, we have concluded that the District Court improperly exercised its discretion in awarding class counsel a percentage of the total class recovery. Like Kiser v. Huge, the instant case was decided at the summary judgment stage without extensive pretrial discovery. The legal issues are neither novel nor complex. While the efforts of class counsel conferred a significant benefit on plaintiffs-appellees, this case has not vindicated any important public policy nor has it advanced any legal principle of pervasive applicability. Finally, the risk or contingency factor for class counsel in undertaking this litigation was not substantial. The plaintiff class representatives filed their complaint after Roark v. Lewis<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>(Roark I) </em>had declared the signatory last employment requirement presumptively invalid. <em>Roark II, </em>on which we have relied as controlling precedent, had been decided for over a year when by order of 30 September 1971 this case was certified as a valid class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-11\">We thus consider five percent of the total class recovery to be an excessive reward for class counsel\u2019s prosecution of this litigation, and remand the record to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>the District Court for recalculation of the premium. We think an appropriate basis for this determination is that employed by the District Court in Kiser v. Miller,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> in which class counsel was rewarded with a percentage of the total hourly compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-4\">On the basis of our discussion in Part VII of Kiser v. Huge, we affirm the District Court\u2019s taxation of plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees against defendants-appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-5\">VII. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1338-6\">We affirm the District Court\u2019s disposition of all substantive issues except the question of total signatory service, which we remand for prompt resolution. Pending this determination, the District Court should proceed to order full retroactive relief for all retired miners who have accumulated so much signatory service that they will obviously qualify for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-7\">We reverse the District Court\u2019s decision not to award interest and remand for action in accordance with Part V <em>supra. </em>Finally, we remand the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees for recalculation of the premium for class counsel in accordance with Part VI <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1338-8\">Affirmed in part; reversed and remanded in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-9\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"AzLg\">RESOLUTION NO. 56</p>\n<p id=\"ANa\">FIFTY-SEVENTH MEETING OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNITED MINE WORKERS OF AMERICA WELFARE AND RETIREMENT FUND OF 1950, APRIL 11, 1960</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-10\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-11\">I. <em>Eligibility</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1338-12\">An applicant shall be eligible for a pension if he has:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-13\">A.

Hypothetically, then, there is an <em>X </em>who retired before 1 February 1965 and applied for a pension on 1 January 1966. <em>X </em>had worked just two weeks for a signatory employer during his career in the coal industry, but those two weeks had been his last in the industry. Assuming <em>X </em>met all the other eligibility criteria of Resolution No. 56, his pension application was granted and he has been paid benefits by the Fund to this day. On the other hand, <em>Y </em>is a member of the plaintiff class who retired before 1 February 1965 and applied for a pension at the same time as <em>X. Y </em>had accumulated four years and eleven months of signatory service but retired from a job with a non-signatory operator. The Trustees denied Y\u2019s pension application under the signatory last employment requirement of Resolution No. 56. Y would continue to be denied a pension if we or the District Court imposed a five-year total signatory service requirement, while <em>X, </em>with just two weeks of such service, would continue to receive a pension. As we pointed out in <em>Kiser, </em>this is the sort of inequity that <em>Roark II </em>sought to preclude.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1336-16\">.
