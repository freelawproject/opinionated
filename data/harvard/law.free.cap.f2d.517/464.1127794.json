Our panel was bound to follow Wingate v. Wainwright, 464 F.2d 209 (5th Cir. 1972). The en banc court is not and should not.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-21\"><em>Wingate </em>mistakenly extends Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970). In <em>Ashe </em>the court refused to permit the relitigation of a single ultimate fact \u2014 whether defendant committed the robbery of six men at a card game. Having been acquitted of robbing one card player, Ashe could not be retried for the same robbery as to another player.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-22\"><em>Wingate </em>expands <em>Ashe\u2019s </em>holding beyond double jeopardy, beyond collateral estoppel, and beyond ultimate fact to bar the use of probative evidence about a wholly separate event. Collateral estoppel has never been held to go so far in any civil or criminal context. By asserting it should, we do no less today than stand the double jeopardy clause on its head.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-23\">Recurrence to the simple, direct wording of the constitution \u201c . . . nor shall any person be subject <em>for the same offence </em>to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb\u201d best demonstrates the error of this judicial embroidery. To compound the error, the principle of <em>Win-gate </em>must be given retroactive effect.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
