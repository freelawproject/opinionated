Banks, the former guardian of Ms. Battley\u2019s property, guardianship commissions and attorney\u2019s fees. The first order permitted Banks to pay himself, \u201cfrom the former guardianship bank account,\u201d his guardianship commissions before turning over Ms. Battley\u2019s assets to the personal representative. The second order directed Banks \u201cto write himself a check\u201d from the same bank account for the probate fees he had paid in opening Ms. Battley\u2019s estate. And the third order awarded Banks $300.00 in attorney\u2019s fees for his efforts to open Ms. Battley\u2019s estate and directed that a check in that amount be sent to Banks \u201cimmediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Appellant contends that in each instance, the orphans\u2019 court erred. For the most part we agree. Hence, we shall vacate in full the first and second orders, but as for the third order, we shall vacate it only to the extent that it instructed appellant to pay the funds immediately and not in accordance with the payment schedule in Md.Code (1974, 2001 Repl.Vol., 2006 Supp.), \u00a7 8-105(a) of the Estates and Trusts Article (\u201cET\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">In November 2002, Dorothy Battley executed a will. The will named appellant, who was Ms. Battley\u2019s nephew, as the personal representative of her estate and bequeathed all of her property to Kimiko Battley, her deceased brother\u2019s wife. In the event Kimiko did not survive Ms. Battley, the property was to go to appellant, as the residuary beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">On February 18, 2003, Ms. Battley, suffering from dementia, was admitted to the Woodside Center, a nursing home in Silver Spring, Maryland. Five months later, on July 28, 2003, the Montgomery County circuit court appointed Banks as the guardian of Ms. Battley\u2019s property and appellant as guardian of her person.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">On July 3, 2004, Ms. Battley passed away. Thereafter, Banks filed a petition in the circuit court requesting termination of the guardianship and authorization to transfer \u201call assets at the time of the death of Dorothy Battley\u201d to the personal representative of her estate, who had not as yet been appointed. Banks further asked the court to order whomever was ultimately appointed the personal representative of Ms. Battley\u2019s estate to investigate the value of Ms. Battley\u2019s assets prior to July 9, 2003, the date on which he was appointed guardian of her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">With that petition, Banks submitted the final \u201cAnnual Fiduciary Report,\u201d which consisted of a final accounting of Ms. Battley\u2019s assets and a proposed distribution of them. The report also contained Banks\u2019s claim for guardianship commissions in the amount of $861.47.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">On September 10, 2004, the circuit court approved Banks\u2019s final accounting and proposed distribution, but specified that \u201cthe guardian\u2019s commissions be limited to $550.25.\u201d That same day, the court entered a separate order discharging Banks as the guardian of Ms. Battley\u2019s property and directing him to transfer \u201call assets at the time of [her] death\u201d to the person \u201cto be appointed\u201d personal representative of her estate. But it denied Banks\u2019s request that the personal repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>sentative investigate the value of Ms. Battley\u2019s \u201cassets prior to July 9, 2003.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Over a year later, after no action had been taken by anyone to open the estate, Banks filed a petition for judicial probate in the orphans\u2019 court, requesting, among other things, that he be appointed the personal representative of Ms. Battley\u2019s estate. At that time, he also filed a notice of judicial probate and paid the register of wills $52.84 in probate fees to open Ms. Battley\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">In the probate petition Banks asserted that the \u201conly known assets\u201d were a Bank of America account containing $1286.24 and a \u201cRepresentative Payee account\u201d at Woodside Center with $255.59 in it, although he claimed that he had been informed by Woodside Center that, prior to Ms. Battley\u2019s enrollment at that facility, she \u201cappeared to have an account in excess of $70,000.\u201d The petition concluded with Banks\u2019s request for authorization to pay himself $550.25 in guardianship commissions previously approved by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Approximately two weeks later, appellant filed Ms. Battley\u2019s will, naming him as personal representative, with the register of wills. In response, Banks filed an \u201cAmended Petition for Judicial Probate\u201d with the orphans\u2019 court, requesting that appellant be removed as personal representative and that he, Banks, be appointed special administrator of the estate; that he, as special administrator, be authorized to distribute Ms. Battley\u2019s personal property to Kimiko Battley, in accordance with the will; and that he further be authorized to pay himself the circuit court-approved $550.25 in guardianship commissions owed to him. As grounds for these requests, Banks claimed that, at no time during the fifteen months following Ms. Battley\u2019s death, did appellant contact Banks or the nursing home; that appellant \u201cdid not claim [Ms. Battley\u2019s] body\u201d; and that appellant had neither provided \u201cadequate information regarding the financial affairs of his Aunt, Dorothy Battley,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>nor \u201cprovided information to the Court justifying his expenditures\u201d as the former \u201c[gjuardian of the [decedent\u2019s] person and property.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In response to Banks\u2019s petition, appellant denied that he had ever abandoned his aunt\u2019s body, pointing out that he had, in fact, paid for her funeral expenses and further insisting he had \u201cprovided financial information including [Ms. Battley\u2019s] bank statements directly to Michael Banks.\u201d He added that, notwithstanding Banks\u2019s claims to the contrary, he had never been guardian of Ms. Battley\u2019s property and hence had never made expenditures in that capacity; and that, in any case, \u201cthe Court [had] never requested information from him.\u201d Finally, he asserted that Banks\u2019s \u201cdefamatory allegations\u201d had no foundation in fact and that Banks himself had \u201cfailed to conduct an investigation\u201d into Ms. Battley\u2019s assets while he was still the guardian of her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">On March 22, 2006, after a hearing, the orphans\u2019 court ordered that Ms. Battley\u2019s will be admitted to probate and appointed appellant, in accordance with the will, as personal representative of Ms. Battley\u2019s estate. Following that decision, Banks filed a petition requesting the $550.25 in guardianship commissions previously authorized by the circuit court and for $300 in attorney\u2019s fees<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the actions he took to open Ms. Battley\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">On April 26, 2006, appellant, as personal representative, filed a petition to administer Ms. Battley\u2019s estate as a small estate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He listed Banks\u2019s $550.25 in guardianship commissions as claims against the estate and sought reimbursement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>of the $1223.95 in funeral expenses he had purportedly paid. The register of wills granted appellant\u2019s petition and issued to him the necessary letters of administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">On June 20, 2006, the orphans\u2019 court held a hearing on Banks\u2019s request for both $550.25 in guardianship commissions and $300 in attorney\u2019s fees. During the hearing, Banks asserted he had not paid himself guardianship commissions, in accordance with the circuit court\u2019s earlier order authorizing him to do so, because of \u201can oversight.\u201d When the hearing ended, the orphans\u2019 court ruled that, since \u201cBanks had a right\u201d at the time the circuit court granted his request for guardianship commissions \u201cto pay himself out of the remaining balance of [Ms. Battley\u2019s] funds, the sum of $550.25,\u201d he could \u201cdo it now since he did not do it before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">On June 22, 2006, the orphans\u2019 court awarded Banks the $300 in attorney\u2019s fees he had requested and ordered that a check in that amount \u201cbe sent to Michael G. Banks, Esq. immediately,\u201d but the court was silent as to Banks\u2019s requested guardianship commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">On July 5, 2006, Banks filed a claim against Ms. Battley\u2019s estate for the $52.84 in probate fees he had paid to open the estate, but appellant, as personal representative, disallowed that claim. Thereafter, both parties requested that the orphans\u2019 court issue a written order regarding Banks\u2019s guardianship commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">On July 25, 2006, the orphans\u2019 court entered two orders: one directing Banks to \u201cwrite himself a check\u201d from Ms. Battley\u2019s Bank of America account \u201cin the amount of $52.84\u201d for the probate fees and the other permitting Banks to \u201cpay himself the commissions owed from the former guardianship bank account, pursuant to the previous order of court.\u201d This appeal followed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Motion to Strike Appendix to Banks\u2019s Brief</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Appellant moves to strike the appendix to Banks\u2019s brief, which consists of a letter from Banks to appellant requesting \u201call asset information related to the Dorothy Battley Estate,\u201d Banks\u2019s petition for termination of guardianship in the circuit court, and a receipt from the register of wills for Banks\u2019s payment of the sum of $52.84. Appellant argues that the documents were not introduced below, and hence should not be considered on appeal. Banks has filed no opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Because the record confirms appellant\u2019s assertion that neither of these two documents were introduced below and because ordinarily such documents will not be considered on appeal, we will grant this motion. <em>See, e.g., Prince George\u2019s County v. Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust, </em>388 Md. 162, 170 n. 6, 879 A.2d 81 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The Guardianship Commissions</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Appellant claims that the orphans\u2019 court erred in permitting Banks to pay himself, from the former guardianship bank account, $550.25 in guardianship commissions before turning over that account to appellant as the personal representative of the estate. Even though the circuit court had previously approved the commissions, he argues that, once the guardianship was terminated, Banks, as guardian, was not permitted by law to do anything other than turn over that account to appellant without deducting any commissions. When that was done, Banks\u2019s claim for guardianship commissions would then be treated as a general creditor\u2019s claim, according to appellant, and paid in accordance with ET \u00a7 8-105(a)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>governs the order of payment of claims when the assets of a decedent\u2019s estate \u201care insufficient to pay all claims in full.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">A person appointed as the \u201cguardian of the property of ... a disabled person,\u201d pursuant to ET \u00a7 13-201(a), becomes \u201cvest[ed],\u201d under ET \u00a7 13-206(c), with \u201ctitle to all property of the ... protected person that is held at the time of appointment or acquired later.\u201d His activities are overseen by the circuit court, which has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over protective proceedings for disabled persons,\u201d under ET \u00a7 13-105(b). A guardian of the property may, among other things, \u201cpay or apply income and principal from the estate as needed for the clothing, support, care, protection, welfare, and rehabilitation of the disabled person,\u201d under ET \u00a7 13-214(b)(2). In administering the disabled person\u2019s estate, a guardian is required under ET \u00a7 13-212 to \u201cexercise the care and skill of a man of ordinary prudence dealing with his own property.\u201d And, for his efforts, the guardian is entitled, under ET \u00a7 13-218, \u201cto the same compensation and reimbursement for actual and necessary expenses as the trustee of a trust.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Unfortunately, there is no provision in the Estates and Trusts Article or in the Maryland Rules explaining exactly how and when this compensation is to be paid upon the death of the ward. Lacking a specific provision addressing this issue, we turn for guidance to the more general provisions of the applicable statutes and rules governing how a guardianship is to be terminated and how the property of the disabled ward is to be distributed after he or she dies. <em>See, e.g., Corby v. McCarthy, </em>154 Md.App. 446, 492, 840 A.2d 188 (2003) (\u201c \u2018[I]n determining a statute\u2019s meaning, courts may consider the context in which a statute appears, including related statutes (quoting <em>Ridge Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing v. Brennen, </em>366 Md. 336, 350-51, 783 A.2d 691 (2001))).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">At the outset, we note that, under ET \u00a7 13-221, upon the death of a ward, \u201chis personal representative, the guardian, or any other interested person may petition the court to terminate the guardianship proceedings\u201d and that, under ET \u00a7 13-221(c) the \u201c[tjermination and final distribution of [his] estate\u201d is to \u201cbe made in compliance with the provisions of the Maryland Rules, applying to a fiduciary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The principal Maryland Rule governing the termination of a guardianship and the final distribution of guardianship assets is Rule 10-710. Successive sections of that rule state that \u201c[g]rounds for the termination of a fiduciary estate shall include ... the death of the minor or disabled person,\u201d Rule 10-710(a); that \u201c[w]ithin 45 days after the fiduciary discovers that the grounds for termination exist, the fiduciary shall file a petition requesting the court to terminate the estate,\u201d Rule 10 \u2014 710(b); that \u201cthe petitioner shall file with the petition a copy of the death certificate,\u201d Rule 10 \u2014 710(e)(4); and that the petitioner shall \u201cgive notice of the filing of the petition to the persons named as distributees in the proposed final distribution, to the other persons entitled to notice of annual accounts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>and to all other persons designated by the court,\u201d Rule 10-710(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The rule also provides that \u201c[i]f the petitioner is the fiduciary, the petitioner shall file with the petition a final accounting containing the same information required in annual accountings by Rule 10-708,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> together with the proposed final distribution of any remaining assets of the estate.\u201d Rule 10-710(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">But, as for the disposition of the deceased ward\u2019s assets, we must turn to a provision of the Estates and Trusts Article which governs the estates of decedents, regardless of their ante-mortem status. And that is ET \u00a7 l-301(a), which provides that \u201c[a]ll property of a decedent shall be subject to the estates of decedents law, and upon the person\u2019s death shall pass directly to the personal representative, who shall hold the legal title for administration and distribution.... \u201d Under ET \u00a7\u00a7 2-101 and 2-102, any claims against that property fall under the jurisdiction of the \u201corphans\u2019 court,\u201d \u201cor the court exercising the jurisdiction of the orphans\u2019 court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">It is a basic canon of statutory construction and one to which we routinely subscribe that when statutes are <em>in pari materia, </em>\u201cit is presumed that the [Legislature] ... intended ... [them] to blend into a consistent and harmonious body of law.\u201d <em>State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 93, 581 A.2d 9 (1990). \u201cTherefore, various consistent and related enactments, although made at different times and without reference to one another, nevertheless should be harmonized as much as possible.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The same canon applies to rules and statutes that are in <em>pari materia. </em>As we stated in <em>Davis v. Mills: </em>\u201cWhen the Maryland Rules deal with the same subject matter as a statute, [the relevant rules and statutes] are to be \u2018construed so as to harmonize with each other and not produce an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>unreasonable result.\u2019 \u201d 129 Md.App. 675, 678-79, 743 A.2d 806 (2000) (quoting <em>Johnson v. State, </em>274 Md. 29, 41, 333 A.2d 37 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Applying this venerable rule of interpretation to the above mentioned statutes under the Estates and Trusts Article, we conclude that, under ET \u00a7 l-301(a), when a ward dies, all the ward\u2019s property becomes the assets of his decedent estate, and where a personal representative has been appointed to the ward\u2019s estate, title vests immediately, in that person. In short, the ward\u2019s assets, upon his death, become the assets of his decedent estate. The guardian\u2019s duties are then reduced to filing a petition to terminate the estate together with a final accounting and proposed final distribution of the ward\u2019s property, pursuant to Rule 10-710(b) and ET \u00a7 13-221, and thereafter to transfer to the personal representative all of the decedent\u2019s property, as required by ET \u00a7 l-301(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Moreover, after death of the ward, the guardian may be awarded guardianship commissions. Rule 10-710(f) states that the guardian of the property who files a petition to terminate his guardianship upon the ward\u2019s death \u201cshall file with the petition a final accounting ... together with the proposed final distribution of any remaining assets of the estate.\u201d This \u201cproposed final distribution\u201d does not exclude the guardian\u2019s compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">But the circuit court\u2019s right to approve guardianship commissions does not imply, in this instance, the authority to permit the guardian of the property to pay himself those commissions before handing the deceased ward\u2019s property over to the personal representative. For, as we have previously pointed out, under ET \u00a7 l-301(a), \u201c[a]ll property of a decedent shall be subject to the estates of decedents law, and upon the person\u2019s death shall pass directly to the personal representative, who shall hold the legal title for administration and distribution.... \u201d That means that, at the moment of the ward\u2019s death, his assets under the guardianship immediately become assets of his estate. An order by the orphans\u2019 court allowing the guardian to collect his commissions before hand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>ing his former ward\u2019s assets over to the personal representative would then be, in effect, an order permitting a former guardian to invade the assets of the decedent\u2019s estate. And Maryland law does not permit such an intrusion. The orphans\u2019 court may only allow the claim and direct the personal representative to pay that claim subject to the hierarchy of claims set forth in ET \u00a7 8-105(a). <em>See Barter Systems, Inc. v. Rosner, </em>64 Md.App. 255, 264, 494 A.2d 964 (1985) (citing <em>Schaefer v. Heaphy, </em>45 Md.App. 144, 153-54, 412 A.2d 107 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Indeed, ET \u00a7 13-214 specifies the distributions that a guardian may make \u201cwithout court authorization or confirmation\u201d: when a minor ward attains majority; when the disability of a ward ceases; and when a minor or disabled person dies.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the first two situations, the guardian, according to ET \u00a7 13-214(c)(l)-(2),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cshall\u201d first \u201cmeet[] all prior claims and expenses of administration\u201d before distributing the estate to the former minor or disabled person.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">But in the third situation, that is, when the ward dies, the guardian has no statutory authority to meet all prior claims and expenses of administration (which would of course include guardianship commissions) before distributing the assets of the decedent to the personal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate. In fact, when the ward dies, the guardian is authorized, by ET \u00a7 13-214(c)(3), only to \u201cdeliver to the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>probate court for safekeeping any will of the deceased person in his possession, inform the personal representative or a beneficiary named in it that he has done so, and retain the estate for delivery to an appointed personal representative of the decedent or other person entitled to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">In sum, where the termination of a guardianship is due to a minor ward attaining majority or the cessation of a disabled ward\u2019s disability, the guardian is permitted, without a prior court order, to meet all prior claims and expenses of administration before distributing the remainder of the person\u2019s estate. But, where the termination of a guardianship is due to the death of the ward, the guardian has no such authority. Thus, Maryland clearly disfavors a former guardian paying any \u201cprior claims and expenses of administration,\u201d including guardianship commissions, from the assets of the former guardianship after the ward dies, in contrast to being directed to do so before distributing the property of the guardianship estate to a ward who attains majority or whose disability has ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">For Banks to pay himself his guardianship commissions upon the ward\u2019s death, if it can be done at all, under ET \u00a7 13-214, requires a court order. But, as we have pointed out, such a court order would, under ET \u00a7 1 \u2014 301(a), wrongly permit the former guardian to invade the assets of the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Other states with statutes that fail, as Maryland\u2019s does, to directly address this issue have reached the same conclusion. <em>See, e.g., State v. Estate of Taylor, </em>29 Colo.App. 231, 484 P.2d 1262, 1263 (1971) (\u201cIt is generally held, in the absence of statute ... that upon the death of a person under guardianship, the statutory scheme applicable to decedents\u2019 estates becomes operative, and that debts incurred during the guardianship are to be classified in accordance with the law fixing priorities in the distribution of decedents\u2019 estates.\u201d); <em>In re Bohnstedt, </em>125 A.2d 580, 582 (Del.Ch.1956) (\u201c[Ajlmost but not all of the Courts which have considered our problem have concluded that after the death of the mentally ill person the trustee, absent statutory authority, has no power to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>existing obligations. The creditors must file their claims in the estate proceedings.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Moreover, those state courts that have taken the contrary-position, that is, that, upon the death of a ward, the guardian has the right to collect his commissions before distributing the ward\u2019s assets to the personal representative, only underscore our point. Those decisions were based on state statutes and rules that clearly granted the guardian the right to pay himself any commissions owed him after the death of the ward. <em>See, e.g., Midland Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust v. Comerica Trust Co. of Florida, </em>616 So.2d 1081, 1084 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1993) (Florida Probate Rules permit guardians \u201cto pay from guardianship funds the final costs of administration ... including guardian and attorney\u2019s fees, which had been included in the final accounting as unpaid and which, either in the absence of objection or after objection and court resolution, would be paid by the guardian prior to distribution\u201d of the remainder of the funds to the persons entitled to them.); <em>Treadway v. Motague-Elliston, </em>138 Ariz. 133, 673 P.2d 331, 333 (App.1983) (The Arizona statute authorizes a conservator to reimburse himself, from the conservatorship estate, the \u201cexpenses of administration,\u201d including the \u201cfees and expenses reasonably incurred in -winding up the affairs of the conservatorship estate,\u201d before delivering the remaining estate to the personal representative of the deceased person\u2019s estate.)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">No Maryland statute or rule grants comparable authority to a Maryland guardian of the property when the ward has died.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This lack of statutory authority is particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>telling when orphans\u2019 courts are involved, because they \u201care not courts of general jurisdiction\u201d but \u201care courts of special and limited jurisdiction only.\u201d <em>Barter Sys., Inc. v. Rosner, </em>64 Md.App. 255, 262, 494 A.2d 964 (1985) (quoting <em>Crandall v. Crandall, </em>218 Md. 598, 600, 147 A.2d 754 (1959)). Thus, they \u201ccannot, under pretext of incidental or constructive authority, exercise jurisdiction not expressly conferred by law.\u201d <em>Barter Sys., Inc., </em>64 Md.App. at 262, 494 A.2d 964. The orphans\u2019 court therefore erred in permitting Banks to pay himself $550.25 in commissions from the former guardianship account before turning over that account to appellant.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">We are not unsympathetic to Banks\u2019s position and the possibility that, because of the small size of the estate and the priorities laid out in ET \u00a7 8-105(a), as a general creditor, his claim may be relegated to the bottom of the statutory list of payment priorities and thus he may never be paid his court-approved commissions totaling $550.25. We also recognize that there are sound reasons for allowing a guardian to collect his commissions from a former guardianship account before handing over that account to the personal representative of the ward\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">At least one court has observed that, just as the compensation for a personal representative in handling a decedent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>estate is accorded priority above general creditors, <em>see </em>ET \u00a7 8-105(a), the compensation for a guardian in handling a disabled person\u2019s property \u201cshould as a matter of equity enjoy the same priority in the guardianship estate and not be relegated to the status of [a] general unsecured\u201d claim against the decedent\u2019s estate. <em>Midland, </em>616 So.2d at 1086. That same court has commented on how \u201ctotally illogical\u201d it is for a \u201crule to require the final report to include an amount reserved for unpaid, as well as anticipated, costs and fees if, when approved, such costs and fees are not to be paid by the guardian from guardianship assets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1083. And still another court has pointed out that not to permit the guardian upon the death of the ward to satisfy all legal claims arising by virtue of the guardianship before turning over guardianship funds would result in \u201cendless confusion created by contests between guardians on the one hand and executors or administrators on the other.\u201d <em>State v. Greenhaw, </em>50 Ariz. 436, 72 P.2d 950, 951 (1937). But such policy considerations are for the Legislature to consider, not this Court. It is our task to apply the law as it is currently constituted. Indeed, we may not do otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Finally, appellant, relying on <em>DeFelice v. Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington, </em>55 Md.App. 476, 462 A.2d 88 (1983), claims that \u201cthe [orphans\u2019] court had no jurisdiction to interpret the orders of the circuit court in the first instance because no request had been made to determine title of the guardianship accounts which Banks had conceded in the filing of his petition ... were estate assets.\u201d But <em>DeFelice </em>has no applicability here. In that case, the personal representative sought to receive the insurance proceeds from the car accident in which the decedent had died. <em>Id. </em>at 477, 462 A.2d 88. When the personal representative learned that the insurance company had already paid the proceeds to a third party, he filed suit in the orphans\u2019 court to force that third party to return the proceeds to the estate. <em>Id. </em>The orphans\u2019 court found that the payment of the proceeds directly to the third party was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>We vacated that decision, holding that the orphans\u2019 court \u201cdid not have jurisdiction to consider the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>of who was entitled to the insurance proceeds in question\u201d because there was no statutory authority <em>\u201cfor </em>a personal representative to bring an action in the Orphans\u2019 Court to recover personal property claimed by\u201d a third party. <em>Id. </em>at 478, 79, 462 A.2d 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">But in the instant case, there is no dispute as to the title of the assets in question, that is, the guardianship account. Both parties agree that Ms. Battley owned the monies in that account. The dispute is whether Banks could withdraw his commissions from that account before handing over the account to appellant to administer.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The Probate Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Appellant contends that the orphans\u2019 court erred in \u201cpermitting Banks to \u2018write himself a check\u2019 from the former guardianship account\u201d for the $52.84 in probate fees he paid to open Ms. Battley\u2019s estate. Specifically, appellant argues that, after he disallowed Banks\u2019s claim for the $52.84 for \u201cprobate fees allegedly associated with his petition to administrate the estate and seeking his appointment as personal representative,\u201d Banks should have filed a \u201cpetition for allowance [with] the court\u201d as required by ET \u00a7 8-107(b). Since Banks failed to do so, the court should not have, appellant claims, awarded Banks those fees. In fact, according to appellant, the $52.84 could only be paid to Banks by appellant, as the personal representative, in accordance with the payment priorities set out in ET \u00a7 8-105(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">\u201cIt is well settled that the \u2018findings of fact of an Orphans\u2019 Court are entitled to a presumption of correctness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pfeufer v. Cyphers, </em>397 Md. 643, 648, 919 A.2d 641 (2007) (internal citations omitted). \u201cIt is equally well settled, however, that interpretations of law by such courts are not entitled to the same \u2018presumption of correctness on review: the appellate court must apply the law as it understands it to be.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). \u201cThus, an appellate court ... must determine whether the conclusions of law made by a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>court in the first instance are \u2018legally correct under a de novo standard of review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">On June 29, 2006, Banks filed a claim for $52.84 against Ms. Battley\u2019s estate with appellant who had, by that time, been appointed the personal representative of the estate. Approximately a week later, on July 5, 2006, Banks filed this claim with the register of wills. On that same day, he also filed a similar claim with the orphans\u2019 court, entitled \u201cSupplemental Information for a Claim against Decedent\u2019s Estate,\u201d asking to be reimbursed for the $52.84 in probate fees that he had expended on behalf of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The following day, appellant sent Banks a notice of disallowance of his claim and filed this notice with the register of wills on July 7, 2006. Then, on July 25, 2006, the orphans\u2019 court entered an order, directing Banks to \u201cwrite himself a check from\u201d Ms. Battley\u2019s bank account \u201cin the amount of $52.84.\u201d But Banks\u2019 claim for fees was barred under \u00a7 8-107(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">When appellant disallowed his claim, Banks failed, as required by ET \u00a7 8-107(b), to file a petition for allowance of the claim with the court and hence his claim was, under that subsection, \u201cforever barred.\u201d For ET \u00a7 8-107(b) provides that if the personal representative disallows a claim, \u201cthe claimant is forever barred to the extent of the disallowance unless he files a petition for allowance in the court or commences an action against the personal representative ... within 60 days\u201d after the personal representative mails the notice of disallowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">Appellant argues that the orphans\u2019 court erred in awarding Banks $300 in attorney\u2019s fees. Neither of the two statutes permitting such an award in estate matters, ET \u00a7\u00a7 7-602 and 7-603, were applicable, he maintains, to Banks\u2019s predicament. He claims that Banks\u2019s services in opening the estate were \u201cpart of a guardian\u2019s duties for which commissions are allowable\u201d and hence Banks should not be paid attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>fees for what his guardianship commissions should have covered. He further argues that \u201cclaims against a guardianship estate cannot be made after the guardianship has been terminated.\u201d And, finally, he claims that the orphans\u2019 court abused its discretion in not reducing the amount of fees, which, he suggests, were excessive in light of the size of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">We agree with appellant that ET \u00a7 7-603 is not relevant to Banks\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees. That section states that, \u201c[w]hen a personal representative or person nominated as personal representative defends or prosecutes a proceeding in good faith and with just cause, he shall be entitled to receive his necessary expenses and disbursements from the estate regardless of the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d Clearly, this section does not apply to Banks, who was neither the personal representative nor a person nominated as personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">But ET \u00a7 7-602(a) is relevant. That section states that \u201c[a]n attorney is entitled to reasonable compensation for legal services rendered by him to the estate and/or the personal representative.\u201d Generally, such services must \u201chave been rendered \u2018for the protection or benefit of the estate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Banashak v. Wittstadt, </em>167 Md.App. 627, 666, 893 A.2d 1236 (2006) (quoting ET \u00a7 7-401(y)). And services rendered \u201cfor the protection or benefit of the estate\u201d include \u201cthe rare case where the assets of an estate are increased in value or protected from dissipation as the result of <em>an action brought by someone other than the personal representative for the benefit of the estate as a </em>whole.... \u201d <em>Clark v. Rolfe, </em>279 Md. 301, 307, 368 A.2d 463 (1977) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">That was the case here. The orphans\u2019 court found that Banks\u2019s actions, for which he was charging $300 in attorneys\u2019 fees, were for the benefit of Ms. Battley\u2019s estate. It stated during the hearing that \u201c[t]here\u2019s really no dispute, is there, that Mr. Banks had to open the estate ... I don\u2019t believe for one second that Mr. Banks would have gone to the trouble to open an estate, [if] in fact Ms. Battley had a will and he said, \u2018No, no, don\u2019t bother Mr. Banks, I\u2019ve got a will and I\u2019m going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>to go ahead and file this and we\u2019ll take care of the stuff that\u2019s in the nursing home, and we\u2019ll get it out of your basement.\u2019 \u201d When appellant pointed out that there had been a dispute over the appointment of the personal representative and that Banks had lost, the court responded that \u201cthe fact of the matter is that Mr. Banks did render services in the amount of $300 to the estate at the beginning of this whole thing. Whether he continued on as personal representative is a different issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The orphans\u2019 court\u2019s findings of fact are entitled to a presumption of correctness, <em>Pfeufer, </em>397 Md. at 648, 919 A.2d 641, and that presumption has not been rebutted by appellant. No attempt was made by appellant to open Ms. Battley\u2019s estate for more than fifteen months after her death. Indeed, it was not until Banks attempted to rectify this omission by opening the estate himself that appellant submitted Ms. Battley\u2019s will to probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Moreover, appellant\u2019s counter-argument that Banks\u2019s attempt to open the estate was not for the benefit of the estate is without merit. It is true, as appellant suggests, that Banks\u2019s actions in attempting to become personal representative were contrary to Ms. Battley\u2019s wishes. But, more than fifteen months had passed since Ms. Battley\u2019s death, without appellant opening her estate. And the orphans\u2019 court concluded, based on Banks\u2019s representations as it was entitled to do, that appellant would not have begun probate proceedings had Banks not initiated those proceedings by filing a petition for judicial probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Nor is appellant\u2019s alternative position persuasive. He argues that, as it was Banks\u2019s duty, as the former guardian of Ms. Battley\u2019s property, to open the estate, he had no basis on which to claim attorney\u2019s fees on top of his guardianship commissions. He further points out that, \u201c[f]rom the record, it appears that the orphans\u2019 court believed the petition for probate was done in the course of Banks\u2019s services as a guardian,\u201d that is, that it was \u201cministerial\u201d work done as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>former guardian and not legal work for which he could obtain attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Except for certain duties prescribed by statute and rules, Banks\u2019s duties as guardian legally ended with the termination of the guardianship. Any actions he took thereafter to open Ms. Battley\u2019s estate went beyond what he was required to do as Ms. Battley\u2019s guardian. <em>See </em>ET \u00a7\u00a7 1 \u2014 301(a); 13 \u2014 214(c); 13-221; Rule 10-710. While it is true that the orphans\u2019 court did state, during the hearing, that, when Banks was attempting to open the estate, he was \u201cworking as a guardian performing legal services [for Ms. Battley] ... as part of what [he] should do with the balance of the assets that [he] had,\u201d and Banks did respond by stating that \u201c[he] opened the estate\u201d only \u201c[a]fter repeated attempts\u201d to contact appellant about Ms. Battley\u2019s \u201cmeager personal property\u201d and the balance of what was in her bank account. Nonetheless, the reason the court awarded Banks attorney\u2019s fees was, as it put it: \u201cThere\u2019s really no dispute, is there, that Mr. Banks had to open the estate\u201d because appellant would not have otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Furthermore, the distinction that appellant is attempting to make between \u201cministerial\u201d work and legal services is not relevant here and his reliance on <em>Saint Ignatius Roman Catholic Congregation, Inc. v. Harvey, </em>268 Md. 634, 303 A.2d 389 (1973) in support of that effort is misplaced. In <em>Harvey, </em>the personal representative of a decedent\u2019s estate, who was also an attorney, sought and received, from the orphans\u2019 court, both personal representative\u2019s commissions as well as counsel fees for services rendered on behalf of the estate. <em>Id. </em>at 636-37, 303 A.2d 389. The services rendered included preparation of, among other things, a federal estate tax return, a petition for probate, and a petition \u201cto make distribution under the direction of the Orphans\u2019 Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 638-39, 303 A.2d 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The Court of Appeals, however, reversed the lower court\u2019s grant of those fees, stating that \u201cif all of these activities constituted legal services, it is difficult to identify the duties performed by [counsel] as personal representative for which he [also] sought and received compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 639, 303 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>A.2d 389. In short, the Court was disturbed that, if it permitted such fees under the circumstances of that case, the personal representative would be paid twice for the same work. Here, however, there is no risk of double compensation as Banks was not appointed as personal representative, and, as stated above, had no duties to perform for the estate after his guardianship was terminated, except to file the appropriate papers with the court and to hand over Ms. Battley\u2019s assets to the personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Appellant also contends that \u201cclaims against a guardianship estate cannot be made after the guardianship has been terminated.\u201d But Banks\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees were filed against Ms. Battley\u2019s estate, not her guardianship assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Finally, appellant argues that even if the orphans\u2019 court did not err in awarding Banks attorney\u2019s fees, it abused its discretion in awarding him $300 for such fees as that amount was excessive when compared to the meager value of the estate. Compensation for legal work for the benefit of an estate must \u201cbe fair and reasonable in the light of all the circumstances to be considered in fixing the fee of an attorney.\u201d ET \u00a7 7-602(b). The \u201cprincipal elements\u201d to be considered by the orphans\u2019 court in determining the reasonableness of an award of attorney\u2019s fees include \u201cthe amount [of the requested fee] involved, the character and extent of the services, the time employed, the importance of the question, the benefit to the estate and the customary charges made for similar services.\u201d <em>Wolfe v. Turner, </em>267 Md. 646, 653, 299 A.2d 106 (1973). Once an award is made, it \u201cwill not be disturbed in the absence of proof of abuse of discretion ... which generally means that the fee allowed is shown to be so unreasonably small or so unreasonably high as to amount to an abuse.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The orphans\u2019 court had before it evidence as to the amount of the requested fee, the character of the service, the time employed, the importance of the work, and the benefit to the estate. It stressed that, without Banks\u2019s work, the estate would probably have never been opened.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>On the other hand, appellant produced no evidence of the unreasonableness of the claimed fees at the hearing below, except to argue that the $300 charge was an \u201coutrageous fee\u201d for opening a \u201c$1,200 estate\u201d and to cite statutes providing guidelines for the payment of compensation to the personal representative or special administrator of a decedent\u2019s estate. ET \u00a7\u00a7 7-601; 5-604(a)(3). But we fail to see how the guidelines for the payment of personal representative\u2019s or special administrator\u2019s commissions are relevant to the issue of the reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees for opening an estate. We therefore find no abuse of discretion in the amount of attorney's fees awarded to Banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">We do find, however, that the orphans\u2019 court erred in ordering that \u201ca check ... be sent to Michael G. Banks, Esq [sic ] immediately.\u201d That court could only, at most, direct the personal representative of the estate to pay Banks\u2019s claim, subject to the payment priorities set forth in ET \u00a7 8-105(a). <em>See Barter Sys., </em>64 Md.App. at 264, 494 A.2d 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Prospective Application</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Because of the long-standing division among the courts below as to whether to permit a former guardian to pay himself commissions from a former guardianship account before transferring that account to the personal representative of a deceased ward, because it would be grossly unfair for those guardians who have relied upon the decades-old practices of their localities permitting the pre-transfer collection of such fees, <em>see James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, </em>501 U.S. 529, 536, 111 S.Ct. 2439, 115 L.Ed.2d 481 (1991) (internal citations omitted), and because there are, in fact, sound reasons for those well-established practices, we choose to apply this rule prohibiting such pre-transfer collections \u201cto this case and prospectively to all such causes of action [occurring] after the filing of the opinion in this case.\u201d <em>Boblitz v.

The provisions governing guardianships have been in force since 1969, when the Legislature enacted Article 93A, entitled \"Protection of Minors and Other Persons Under Disability,\u201d for \"the revision and recodification, in a uniform structure, of the laws relating to guardians, committees, conservators, and the protection of property of minors, incompetents, drunkards, senile persons, and other persons generally unable to manage their affairs and property ... and providing rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>relating to guardians of the person of minors and other disabled persons.\u201d 1969 Md. Laws, Chap. 4. Article 93A was subsequently re-codified as the Estates and Trusts Article, \u00a7\u00a7 1-101 to 15-409. 1974 Md. Laws, Chap. 11. It is presently codified as the Estates and Trusts Article, \u00a7\u00a7 13-101 to 13-403, 2001 Md. Laws, Chap. 35.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b672-8\">. Rule 10-708 requires the guardian, in the annual accountings, to submit information in the format provided by that rule, concerning the ward\u2019s assets and income, and disbursements made on the disabled the ward\u2019s behalf.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b674-6\">. ET \u00a7 13-214(c)(4) further provides: \"If a guardianship is terminated for reasons other than the attainment of majority, cessation of disability, or death of the protected person, the guardian shall distribute the estate in accordance with the order of the court terminating the guardianship.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b674-7\">. Those subsections provide respectively: \"When a minor attains his majority, his guardian, <em>after meeting all prior claims and expenses of administration, </em>shall distribute the estate to the former minor as soon as possible....\u201d ET \u00a7 13-214(c)(l) (emphasis added); \"If the guardian is satisfied that the disability of the disabled person has ceased or if the court has found ... that the disability has ceased, the guardian, <em>after meeting all prior claims and expenses of administration, </em>shall distribute the estate to the former disabled person as soon as possible.\u201d ET \u00a7 13-214(c)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b676-6\">. We are also mindful that some states treat guardianship commissions as liens on the decedent's estate. <em>See, e.g., In re Clanton\u2019s Estate &amp; Guardianship, </em>171 Cal. 381, 153 P. 459, 461 (1915) (\"[W]e see no reason why [the guardian\u2019s] equitable lien [on the decedent's land] may not extend to the fund resulting from the sale of the interest of the decedent in the land.\u201d); <em>Riley v.

A lien, in Maryland, may only be created by \"contract, statute, or rule of law.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. May Dept.

Appellant also cites ET \u00a7 13-220 in support of the proposition that termination of a guardianship ends the \"right and power pertaining to the office of guardian.\u201d That section, however, only addresses situations where a guardianship terminates due to the \"death, disability, resignation, or removal\u201d of the guardian, ET \u00a7 13-220(a), and does not address the termination of a guardianship as a result of the ward's death.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
