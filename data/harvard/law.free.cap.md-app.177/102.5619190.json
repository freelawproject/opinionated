Wasserman, </em>164 F.Supp.2d 591, 634 (D.Md.2001) (Blake, J.). Indeed, since the 1970\u2019s, the State\u2019s \u201cdeinstitutionalization\u201d of patients diagnosed with mental illness and developmental disabilities \u201chas been dramatic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In large measure, that change was prompted by advocates for the disabled, based on their view that disabled individuals are entitled to, and would prefer, community treatment in lieu of institutional care. But, as this case demonstrates, not every developmentally disabled person who needs professional care prefers placement in the community. In this appeal, the guardian of a mentally retarded adult complains because the State has declined to institutionalize her ward in a State-run facility for the mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In 2004, Mary L. Reese, appellant, and the late William Massa,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as guardians of Virginia Massa, sought to admit Ms. Massa, the mentally retarded daughter of Mr. Massa, to a State-operated intermediate care facility, known as a State residential center (\u201cSRC\u201d). As we shall see, in this case the application process implicated federal and State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">By letter dated July 19, 2005, S. Anthony McCann, then the Secretary of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the \u201cDepartment\u201d), appellee, denied the application, based on his determination that placement in the community was an appropriate, less restrictive alternative. The Department subsequently opposed appellant\u2019s request for a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>at the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d), at which appellant sought to present evidence as to Ms. Massa\u2019s condition. The Department claimed that the denial of a request for admission to a SRC is not a contested case under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), Md.Code (2004, 2006 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-201 through 10-226 of the State Gov\u2019t. Article (\u201cS.G.\u201d), and therefore there was no entitlement to such a hearing. OAH agreed with the Department and denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Thereafter, Ms. Reese appealed the OAH decision to the Department\u2019s Board of Review (the \u201cBoard\u201d), which upheld OAH by order dated December 12, 2005. She then filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. On March 15, 2006, the court granted the Department\u2019s motion to dismiss. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Appellant presents three issues, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">1. Whether the State\u2019s policy of preventing individuals with qualifying developmental disabilities from obtaining admission to State Residential Centers (\u201cSRCs\u201d) violates the freedom of choice requirement of the federal Medicaid statute and its implementing regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">2. Whether the State has failed to furnish Medicaid services it agreed to provide Ms. Massa with \u201creasonable promptness\u201d in violation of federal Medicaid law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">3. Whether the State\u2019s interpretation of Md.Code Ann. Health-Gen. Art. \u00a7 \u00a7 7-503 and 7-504, which forecloses any review of the Secretary\u2019s denial of SRC admission, violates Appellant\u2019s due process rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">For the reasons that follow, we shall vacate and remand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">I. STATUTORY &amp; REGULATORY FRAMEWORK</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">To understand the facts and the issues, it is helpful to begin with a brief review of the federal and State statutory schemes.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">The Medicaid program, established by Title XEX of the Social Security Act, Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396, <em>et seq., </em>is a \u201cjointly funded collaboration\u201d in which the federal and state governments furnish medical services to low income persons who are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>unable to meet the costs of their own medical care, as well as long-term care for eligible persons. <em>Dept. of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Campbell, </em>364 Md. 108, 112, 771 A.2d 1051 (2001); <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396-1396v; Md.Code (1982, 2000 Repl.Vol., 2005 Repl.Vol., 2006 Supp.), \u00a7 15-103(a)(2) of the Health-General Article (\u201cH.G.\u201d). Medicaid beneficiaries include low income adults and children, the elderly, and the disabled. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A); COMAR 10.09.24.03D(4) (including a disabled person in the list of \u201cMedically Needy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">State participation in Medicaid is voluntary. <em>Campbell, </em>364 Md. at 112, 771 A.2d 1051. But, once a state opts to participate, it must operate its program in compliance with federal statutory and regulatory requirements. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(l). A participating state must develop a state Medicaid Plan for the provision of services that the state intends to provide under the program, which is reviewed by the Health Care Financing Administration (\u201cHCFA\u201d). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a. Once HCFA approves the plan, the state is eligible for federal funding. <em>Campbell, </em>364 Md. at 112, 771 A.2d 1051. When the state implements a plan for medical assistance, the plan becomes mandatory. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Maryland has opted to participate in the Medicaid program through the Maryland Medical Assistance Program. <em>Campbell, </em>364 Md. at 112, 771 A.2d 1051. The program is administered by the Department and overseen at the federal level by the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">According to appellant, Maryland\u2019s State Medicaid Plan indicates that Maryland provides services to eligible retarded persons in an Intermediate Care Facility for the Mentally Retarded (\u201cICF-MR\u201d). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ICF-MRs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>provide residential health and rehabilitative services to mentally retarded individuals under \u201csuch standards as may be prescribed by the Secretary [of HSS].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Maryland has four ICF-MR facilities, all of which are designated SRCs. <em>See </em>Maryland Health Care Commission, An Analysis and Evaluation of the CON Program (2002).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They are operated by the Maryland Developmental Disabilities Administration (\u201cDDA\u201d), an agency within the Department. H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7-201, 7-501.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">In 1981, Congress created the Home and Community Based Services Waiver program (\u201cHCBS\u201d), which allows states to offer long-term care, not otherwise available through their Medicaid programs, to serve eligible individuals in their own homes and communities, instead of hospitals, nursing facilities, or ICF-MRs. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396n(c)(l). <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 97-139 <em>&amp; </em>H.R.Rep. No. 97-208, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 1981, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>reprinted in </em>1981 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News p. 396 &amp; 1981 U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin.News p. 1010. The federal regulation states: \u201cSection 1915(c) of the Act permits States to offer, under a waiver of statutory requirements, an array of home and community-based services that an individual needs to avoid institutionalization.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 441.300. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396n(c)(l), the Medicaid statute allows states to apply for a waiver from HHS to pay for community-based services \u201cpursuant to a written plan of care to individuals with respect to whom there has been a determination that but for the provision of such services the individuals would require the level of care provided in a hospital or nursing facility or [ICF-MR] the cost of which could be reimbursed under the State plan.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Pursuant to 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 441.302(d), a waiver will not be granted unless a state furnishes adequate assurances that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An3\">when a recipient is determined to be likely to require the level of care provided in a hospital, NF, or ICF/MR, the recipient or his/ her legal representative will be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">(1) Informed of any feasible alternatives available under the waiver; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">(2) Given the choice of either institutional or home and community-based services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-8\"><em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396n(c)(2) (\u201cA waiver shall not be granted under this subsection unless the State provides assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that ... such individuals who are determined to be likely to require the level of care provided in a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded are informed of the feasible alternatives, if available under the waiver, at the choice of such individuals, to the provision of inpatient hospital services, nursing facility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>services, or services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u2022 Like many other states, Maryland strongly favors home and community based care for the developmentally disabled over state-run institutional care.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As the State has recognized, its efforts in regard to deinstitutionalization have led to the closure or downsizing of many state residential facilities. Indeed, Maryland \u201chas been in the forefront\u201d in developing community and home based care for the mentally disabled. <em>Williams, </em>164 F.Supp.2d at 634.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">H.G. \u00a7 7-102 reflects the State\u2019s policy favoring community placement. It provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">\u00a7 7-102. Legislative policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">To advance the public interest, it is the policy of this State:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">* * *</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">(4) To foster the integration of individuals with developmental disability into the ordinary life of the communities where these individuals live;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">(5) To support and provide resources to operate community services to sustain individuals with developmental disability in the community, rather than in institutions;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>The statutory scheme implements the policy favoring non-institutional placements by setting strict institutional admissions requirements and by imposing on the Department the burden to demonstrate to a hearing officer, by clear and convincing evidence, that such an admission is appropriate.

It explains: \u201cMaryland has chosen to implement that \u2018freedom of choice\u2019 requirement for the Waiver Program by paying for placements at institutions other than SRCs, and the federal government has approved Maryland\u2019s plan.\u201d Appellee asserts: \u201cThere is nothing in the record to suggest that Ms. Reese has tried to locate another institution or that the Department has refused to pay for care at another institution.\u201d It adds: \u201c[T]here is no basis for concluding that Maryland has not complied with the requirements of the Medicaid statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">With the statutory framework in mind, we turn to review the factual and procedural history pertinent to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Ms. Massa was born on September 19, 1944. At the age of 16, she was stricken with viral encephalitis that left her profoundly retarded. She is covered by Medicaid.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Ms. Massa resided at Great Oaks Center, a SRC, from the early 1970\u2019s until 1996, when the State closed that facility. At that time, Ms. Massa\u2019s father opposed the Department\u2019s decision to transfer his daughter to a community residential placement. The disagreement culminated in a Settlement Agreement in the Spring of 1996<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> between the Department and Mr. Massa, by which Ms. Massa was to be moved to her current residence, a community home operated by the Arc of Howard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>County. Among other things, the Settlement Agreement addressed Mr. Massa\u2019s concerns about community placement with regard to staffing, choice of roommates, medical care, and wheelchair accessibility. Paragraph 13 of the Settlement Agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">The parties consent to mediation should there be any dispute arising from an alleged failure of any party to fulfill the terms of the Agreement. The mediation will be conducted by the Office of Administrative Hearings. After mediation, the parties may avail themselves of other applicable remedies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">On October 27, 2004, Ms. Massa\u2019s co-guardians sought her admission to the Holly Center, a SRC located on the Eastern Shore. Appellant\u2019s affidavit avers that, on January 24, 2005, the Department indicated that Ms. Massa would be permitted to move to the Holly Center on February 15, 2005. Two weeks later, however, the Department advised that Ms. Massa\u2019s admittance had been postponed, pending approval by the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">In May of 2005, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the parties participated in mediation, which proved unsuccessful. Consequently, a hearing on the merits was scheduled at OAH for late July 2005. But, on July 12, 2005, the Department asked OAH to cancel the hearing, claiming it was \u201cpremature\u201d because the Secretary had not yet rendered his decision concerning Ms. Massa\u2019s admission to the Holly Center. If Ms. Massa\u2019s application were denied, explained the Department, a hearing would be unnecessary because \u201cthere is no provision in the [SRC] statute for a hearing before OAH.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Appellant\u2019s attorney responded the next day, claiming that the Department \u201chas consistently delayed and resisted making a final decision with respect to Ms. Massa\u2019s admission to Holly Center.\u201d Her counsel added: \u201cMs. Massa is entitled to this hearing that was scheduled and agreed upon by counsel following the mediation. Ms. Massa has been awaiting an admission decision from the Department that is clearly not forthcoming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>In a letter of July 19, 2005, to appellant and Mr. Massa, Secretary McCann denied the application for Ms. Massa\u2019s admission to Holly Center. The letter stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">I reviewed Ms. Massa\u2019s file carefully in considering whether to grant your request that she be admitted to Holly Center. I applaud your continued, in-depth involvement in your daughter\u2019s/ward\u2019s life and your work with the Developmental Disabilities Administration (\u201cDDA\u201d) and the providers. Although DDA and Mr. Massa initially disagreed about where Ms. Massa should be served when Great Oaks closed in 1996, agreement was reached that Ms. Massa be served in the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">You now ask that Ms. Massa be transferred from her community residential and day service providers of 9 years and admitted to Holly Center, a state residential center (\u201cSRC\u201d). As explained below, Maryland law requires that I deny your request for admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Both the State of Maryland and the federal government have strong policies favoring community-based services over institutional ones ... Effective this year, House Bill 794, requires that all barriers that prevent an individual in a SRC from living in the community be identified. Additionally, it is now Maryland law that each individual has a right to receive services in the most integrated setting available. The admission criteria to a DDA operated and funded SRC incorporate these policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Admission to a SRC is predicated on there not being an appropriate residential placement in the community. An individual can be admitted only if there is no less restrictive setting in which the needed services can be provided and that is available to the individual. Additionally, unlike admission to other types of facilities or programs to which an individual may admit him/herself, only the Secretary can authorize admission to an SRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The legislature has mandated other safeguards to assure that an individual is not inappropriately admitted to a SRC. The statute requires an independent review by the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d) within twenty-one days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>after admission as well as an annual re-evaluation. Thus, the statutory scheme is to permit admission into a SRC only if there are no community options.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><em>For Ms. Massa to be admitted to Holly Center, I would have to find that services in the community are not currently meeting her needs and that there is no community provider who could do so. I do not so find. </em>Rather my review of her file discloses that:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">1) Ms. Massa has been living in the community for over nine years;</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">2) DDA is meeting the conditions in the Settlement Agreement;</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">3) In the community, Ms. Massa has improved her ability to walk and to perform activities of daily living;</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">4) During this time, the staff providing services to Ms. Massa have been remarkably stable. Two of the staff at the day treatment program have been with Ms. Massa since 1996; at her home, one staff person has been there since 1996, two since 1997, and one since 1998;</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">5) Both the residential and the day programs provide Ms. Massa with a broad range of community activities;</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">6) Although there was some delay in medical follow-up treatment because of the retirement of Ms. Massa\u2019s physician, a new physician has been found and medical appointments are timely;</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">7) If Ms. Massa\u2019s physician recommends occupational therapy, physical therapy or any medical service, DDA will fund those services, if not covered by Medicaid;</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">8) Ms. Massa\u2019s dietary needs are being monitored by her physician who is satisfied with her current weight; and</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">9) There is open communication between DDA\u2019s Southern Regional Office and you to discuss an issues related to Ms. Massa\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">This indicates to me that Ms. Massa is receiving residential services that meet her habilitation needs in a less restrictive setting than Holly Center. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number><em>To be noted is, that under DDA\u2019s Home and Community Based Waiver, Ms. Massa could choose to receive residential services in an institution rather than the community. However, what you have requested is her admission to a state-run institution, Holly Center. I want to be clear that I am not denying Ms. Massa\u2019s right to choose to be served in an ICF-MR. I am denying her admission to a state residential center, the admission standards for which are set forth in law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">If you wish to explore transferring Ms. Massa to another community provider or to an intermediate care facility, other than a SRC, DDA\u2019s regional office will work with you</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Two advisory letters were appended to Secretary McCann\u2019s letter. One was a letter of March 22, 2004, to Thomas Middleton, Chair of the Maryland Senate Finance Committee, signed by Robert McDonald, Esquire, Chief Counsel, Opinions and Advice, Maryland Office of the Attorney General, and the former Maryland Attorney General, Joseph Curran. They wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">You have asked for our opinion whether State law concerning care of a developmentally disabled individual is consistent with federal law and the Supreme Court decision in <em>Olmstead v. L.C., </em>527 U.S. 581, 119 S.Ct. 2176, 144 L.Ed.2d 540 (1999). We have reviewed the recent letter of advice on this issue by Assistant Attorney General Kathryn M. Rowe, a copy of which is attached. Letter to Honorable J. Lowell Stolzfus dated January 27, 2004. Ms. Rowe\u2019s letter accurately describes the <em>Olmsteod </em>case, the requirements of the federal Medicaid law, and the current State law that favors home and community based care over institutional care for mentally retarded individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">In our view, Maryland law is consistent with the <em>Olmstead </em>decision, which primarily concerned the right of mentally disabled individuals to community placement under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) in certain circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>stances. As Ms. Roe\u2019s letter notes, the restrictions in State law on admission to State residential facilities for mentally retarded persons may appear to be at odds with the requirement of the Medicaid law that a Medicaid beneficiary who needs the level of care provided in a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility have an option to choose institutional services even if that individual also qualifies for home or community based services.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>42 CFR \u00a7 441.302(d)(2). <em>However, we understand that the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has adopted a policy of satisfying the \u201cchoice\u201d requirement by offering out-of-State institutional placements to Medicaid beneficiaries at State expense. </em>We also understand that the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the agency that promulgated the regulation cited above and that implements the Medicaid waiver program, has accepted Maryland\u2019s policy as compliance with the choice requirement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The other letter was written by Kathryn Rowe, Assistant Attorney General, to the Honorable J. Lowell Stoltzfus, dated January 27, 2004. She wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">You have asked for advice as to whether there is a conflict between Maryland law and federal law with respect to the rights of an individual with developmental disability to chose between care in a state residential facility and a community based care facility. It is my view that there is a theoretical conflict between State law and the federal law with respect to Medicaid recipients\u2019 rights of choice. There is no conflict with respect to persons whose services are not funded by Medicaid. Moreover, with respect to Medicaid recipients, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>is my view that it may be possible to resolve this conflict in ways that are consistent with State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">FEDERAL LAW</p>\n<p id=\"AfK\">Medicaid</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The regulations implementing the waiver authority specify that the state must assure that when a recipient is determined to be likely to require the level of care provided in a hospital, nursing facility, or immediate care facility for the mentally retarded, that individual or his or her legal representatives will be informed of any feasible alternatives available under the waiver, and given the choice of either institutional or home and community based services. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 441.302(d). <em>Cramer v. Chiles, </em>33 F.Supp.2d 1342 (S.D.F[la].1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Thus, there can be no question that federal law requires that a Medicaid recipient in need of residential services be given the choice between institutional and home or community based services. However, it is worthy of note that federal policy generally favors home and community based services over institutional ones. <em>See </em>Executive Order of June 18, 2001, stating that the \u201cUnited States is committed to community-based alternatives for individuals with disabilities and recognizes that such services advance the best interests of Americans,\u201d and letters of January 14, 2000 to state medicaid directors and governors, stating that the <em>Olmstead </em>decision \u201cconfirms what this Administration already believes: that no one should have to live in an institution or a nursing home if they can live in the community with the right support.\u201d1-] <em>See also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(31) and (44)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">\n<em>Olmstead v. L.C.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">In <em>Olmstead v. L.C., </em>527 U.S. 581, 119 S.Ct. 2176, 144 L.Ed.2d 540 (1999), the Supreme Court held that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires placement of persons with mental disabilities in community settings rather than in institutions where \u201cthe State\u2019s treatment professionals have determined that community placement is ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>propriate, <em>the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the individual, </em>and the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.\u201d Because <em>this decision expressly recognizes that the ADA does not require less restrictive care where the individual opposes it, </em>there is no conflict between this case and the federal law and regulations relating to Medicaid services for the developmentally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">STATE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Maryland law very strongly favors home and community based care over institutional care. Health General Article \u00a7 7-102 provides that, \u201c[t]o advance the public interest, it is the policy of this State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">(4) To foster the integration of individuals with developmental disability into the ordinary life of the communities where these individuals live;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">(5) To support and provide resources to operate community services to sustain individuals with developmental disability in the community, rather than in institutions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">(6) To require the Administration to designate sufficient resources to foster and strengthen a permanent comprehensive system of community programming for individuals -with developmental disability as an alternative to institutional care.\u201dn</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">With respect to State facilities for the mentally retarded the law reflects this policy by denying admission to any person unless it is shown that the person has mentally [sic] retardation, that residential services are needed for adequate habitation, and that there is no less restrictive setting in which the needed services can be provided that is available to the individual or will be available to the individual within a reasonable time. HG \u00a7 7-502(a) and (b). These findings must be confirmed at a hearing held after admission, HG \u00a7 7-503(e), and the individual must be re-evaluated annually to determine whether institutional placement is still neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>sary, HG \u00a7 7-505. Thus, under Maryland law, a person is not qualified for admission to a State facility for the retarded if home or community based care is available and would be appropriate.11</p>\n<p id=\"A8o\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">The restriction on admissions to State residential facilities for the mentally retarded does make it more difficult to comply with the requirement of federal law that Medicaid beneficiaries who qualify for home or community based services be given the option of institutional services instead. However, the choice provisions of federal law do not give a Medicaid recipient a right to receive services from an unwilling provider. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23). Nor do these restrictions make compliance with the federal law impossible. Where a Medicaid recipient chooses institutional over home or community services, the State could pay for services for the person in an institution in another state. Federal law requires this opinion only for Medicaid recipients, and not for persons who receive State or privately funded services.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">On July 22, 2005, the Department filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss\u201d the OAH hearing. It claimed that \u201cthe applicable statute does not give Ms. Massa a right to an adjudicatory hearing\u201d with regard to the Secretary\u2019s decision to deny her admission to Holly Center. In her opposition, appellant argued that her due process rights would be violated if she were not granted an opportunity to be heard. In a one line order, an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) granted the Department\u2019s motion on July 25, 2006. As a result, no hearing was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Ms. Reese wrote to Secretary McCann on August 24, 2005, requesting an informal hearing pursuant to H.G. \u00a7 7-406 with regard to his denial of Ms. Massa\u2019s admission to Holly Center. On the same day, Ms. Reese wrote to the Board, stating that she was \u201cappealing the Office of Administrative Hearing\u2019s dismissal of the ... case ...,\u201d and she asked that the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>be set \u201cfor hearing before the Department\u2019s Board of Review.\u201d On August 26, 2005, the Board acknowledged receipt of Reese\u2019s request for a hearing, and informed appellant of its procedures set forth in COMAR 10.01.05. She was advised that she would be notified of the time and date of the hearing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On September 14, the Board liaison wrote to appellant, stating: \u201cA copy of the record concerning the above captioned case is enclosed.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> She was also informed of her right to submit a brief, and told that a hearing had been set for October 27, 2005. It was later postponed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In the meantime, on September 14, 2005, the Department filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss.\u201d It contended that, under H.G. \u00a7 7-504(a) and H.G. \u00a7 2-206(c), the Board did not have jurisdiction to review the Secretary\u2019s decision. The matter was eventually reset for December 8, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">On December 5, 2005, appellant filed a \u201cBrief of Appellant Mary L. Reese,\u201d a \u201cMotion to Supplement the Record,\u201d and a \u201cMotion for Leave of the Board to File Appellant\u2019s Brief.\u201d The motion to supplement the record included a number of exhibits, such as an affidavit of appellant; the Settlement Agreement; some of Ms. Massa\u2019s medical records; and opinion letters from the Office of the Attorney General regarding the legality of Maryland\u2019s SRC provisions. The motion for leave stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">Although Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) \u00a7 10.01.06.07.B requires that appellants provide notice of the intention to file a brief within 30 days after the liaison acknowledges receipt of the notice of appeal, Ms. Reese had filed her notice of appeal <em>pro se </em>and had not yet engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>this law firm to represent her during the time period in question. In addition, while COMAR \u00a7 10.01.06.07.C requires that appellants file a brief within 40 days after receiving a copy of the record and transcript from the liaison, Ms. Reese never received such a transcript because there was no initial hearing in this proceeding. In fact, six days before the initial hearing scheduled by Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d) was to take place, Secretary McCann issued a letter denying Ms. Massa\u2019s admission to Holly Center. OAH subsequently dismissed the July 26th hearing from the docket in light of the Secretary\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\">Thus, Ms. Reese has never been allowed to exercise her due process right to a fair hearing under the U.S. and Maryland Constitutions. The only evidence in the record on which the Board has to determine whether to affirm, deny, or remand the Secretary\u2019s letter ruling is the letter itself. Therefore, the Board needs an adequate record and a written explanation of the complexities at issue prior to making its decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The Department opposed appellant\u2019s motion to supplement the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">On December 8, 2005, the Board convened for the hearing. With regard to appellant\u2019s motion to supplement the record, the Department urged the Board to deny the request because the materials were not part of the record before OAH. Appellant\u2019s counsel responded that, without the supplemental information, the record was inadequate for the Board to make a decision. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUc\">[CHAIRPERSON]: ... There are two barriers [to admitting the materials]. One, we haven\u2019t read it. Two, the Attorney General won\u2019t admit it. And, three, it was late. So regardless of where you go from there or why you\u2019re here, that doesn\u2019t solve the problem for the Board. We\u2019re restricted legally to what is in the record. We are not \u2014 we are an appeals board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I understand. I understand your concern. And should the Board wish to postpone so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>that they could have an ample opportunity to read our submissions, we would be willing \u2014 we would be willing to accommodate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\">[CHAIRPERSON]: Thank you. And what is your response?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">[COUNSEL FOR DEPARTMENT]: My response is that I would oppose any postponement. Because for the simple reason that these materials that were submitted should not be supplemented, should not supplement the record. Because the record, as you said, should only be of what took place below. And <em>what took place below, is a dismissal of the hearing.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\"><em>And I believe that [appellant\u2019s counsel] is mis-characterizing the purpose of today\u2019s hearing. It is not so that this Board could review the Secretary of the Department\u2019s decision regarding Ms. Massa\u2019s denial </em>\u2014 the <em>denial of Ms. Massa\u2019s admission to the Holly Center. It is only the propriety of the ALJ\u2019s dismissal of the case before OAH. And that is it. And that </em>\u2014 it <em>has no bearing on the merits of Ms. Massa\u2019s issue with the denial.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: The ALJ\u2019s decision dismissing the hearing that was scheduled for July 26th, and [that] was set by Judge Pratt, of the Office of Administrative Hearings after a mediation in May, I believe, where he heard both sides. The Attorney General\u2019s arguments as well as Ms. Reese\u2019s arguments as to why Ms. Massa belongs in an SRC. And that that\u2019s the most appropriate place for her, decided to set a hearing for July 26th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">And the State moved even before that hearing date was set to dismiss the hearing, because the Secretary had not made a decision as to whether Ms. Massa should be admitted to Holly Center. So they moved to dismiss the hearing even before there was any opportunity for Ms. Reese or Ms. Massa to make their case as to why she should go to an SRC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">The Secretary then made his decision. And after he denied admission to the SRC, then the State moved to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>dismiss, because a decision had been made. And, therefore they believe that she should not be given an opportunity to be heard and make her arguments as to refute the denial. So Ms. Reese has not been given an opportunity to present her side of the story, either before [sic] the Secretary made his decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\">She also requested, through written correspondence and several phone calls, meetings with the Secretary to explain her reasons why Ms. Massa is best suited to live in a State Residential Center. The hearing did not take place, because the Secretary made his decision six days before the hearing was set to take place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">And then the Judge promptly dismissed the hearing upon motion of the Department. And issued a one-sentence order saying that he dismissed the case. And did not provide any reasons or rationale for why the case was dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">\n<em>We ask that the Board hear the merits of the case, whether it be today or after they\u2019ve had an appropriate time to go through the exhibits that we have provided. Because due process requires that Ms. Reese at least be given a chance to make her ease. And have an opportunity to be heard ...</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The Chair emphasized that the purpose of the hearing was to determine whether the Board was \u201callowed to hear it. That\u2019s all we are talking about.\u201d It determined that it would not accept the supplemental record, but indicated that it \u201cwas willing to hear the case on the record of the information we have read.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel responded (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">Our problem with your suggestion, Madam Chairwoman, is that the core of our argument at this point <em>is there is no record. </em>Because ... <em>[tfhere has been no meaningful opportunity for Ms. Reese and Ms. Massa to make their case to anyone </em>here other than a mediator. And we know that that doesn\u2019t count.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>What counts is the opportunity to make your case to a decision maker. That is why we saw a need to supplement the record when we got involved in the case. So we would ask the Board members to give some consideration to our supplemental record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The Board reiterated that it would not permit supplementation of the record. Appellant\u2019s counsel also asked the Board to remand the case to an ALJ \u201cin order for a hearing on the merits to be heard____\u201d The Department responded that a \u201cremand would be improper,\u201d because the OAH \u201cdoes not have jurisdiction to hear the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The following exchange is also pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: The facts before the Secretary ... were incomplete. And Ms. Reese did not receive an opportunity to meet -with the Secretary or anyone else from the Department ... and present the factual evidence that shows that there is no less restrictive setting for her ward to be in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE]: And the decision that was made by the Secretary, and what went into that decision, is not before the Board at this time. And should not go into your decision as to whether or not to dismiss this case or remand it. The only thing before this Board today is whether or not the ALJ was proper in dismissing the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">The merits of the case, as you have already noted on the record, have no bearing on the Board\u2019s decision today. [COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: If the merits have no bearing, then due process, procedurally, requires that Ms. Reese, at some point during this administrative process, be given an opportunity to be heard. She has been deprived of that right. And that\u2019s why we ask the Board to please remand the case to an Administrative Law Judge so that due process can be provided to Ms. Reese.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-11\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: The law says that if an individual meets the criteria for admission to a State residential center, then they\u2019re entitled to a hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>And that is because the public policy in the State of Maryland is \u2014 favors community placement versus institutional care. To put someone into an institution, into a State residential center, is \u2014 infringes on a liberty interest. And so the hearing that is held pursuant to 7-502 of the Health General Article, is to ensure that the individual meets the criteria, so that their liberty interest is not infringed upon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">As far as due process requiring a hearing in this circumstance, where Ms. Massa\u2019s admission was denied, due process only requires a hearing when the State seeks to deprive an individual of a liberty or a property interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">Ms. Massa does not have a liberty or property interest in being admitted to a State residential center. There is federal law that allows Ms. Massa to choose whether she wants to be served in the community or in a State residential center____The Department is saying that she cannot</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">reside at the Holly Center. If she chooses to reside at an ICFMR, an Intermediate Care Facility for the Mentally Retarded, she can do so in another state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">On December 12, 2005, the Board <em>filed </em>an \u201cOrder\u201d affirming the decision of the ALJ, based on \u201cthe entire record of this case.\u201d It also \u201cadopt[ed] the Findings of Fact and Conclusion of the Law set forth therein.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Thereafter, on January 11, 2006, appellant filed a \u201cPetition for Judicial Review\u201d in the circuit court. She requested review of:</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">1. The July 19, 2005 decision of S. Anthony McCann, Secretary, Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\u201cDHMH\u201d), denying Ms. Massa admission to a state residential center.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">2.

The December 12, 2005 Order of the Board of Review of DHMH affirming Judge Herzing\u2019s Order dismissing the hearing scheduled for July 25, 2005, thereby rendering the decision of the Secretary final.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The Department filed a motion to dismiss on February 21, 2006, claiming that appellant was not entitled to judicial review of the agency\u2019s decision. It averred that, under the APA, S.G. \u00a7 10-201 <em>et seq., </em>only contested cases are afforded review, and \u201cMs. Massa\u2019s admission to the Holly Center is not a contested case.... \u201d Further, the Department asserted that \u201cfederal law does not create a right to admission to a SRC, only a right to choose [ICFMR] placement over home and community based services.\u201d It also argued that \u201cplacement in a SRC is not a privilege that is guaranteed by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">In her opposition, appellant asserted: (1) Ms. Massa has a right to admission to a SRC under H.G. \u00a7 7-502; (2) Ms. Massa has a right to admission to a SRC under federal Medicaid law; (3) appellant is entitled to procedural due process, which requires an opportunity to be heard; and (4) the Department\u2019s \u201cstatutory construction of the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act (APA) foreclose^] any judicial review of [the Department\u2019s] arbitrary denial of a statutory entitlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">By \u201cOrder\u201d dated March 20, 2006, the court granted the Department\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">Appellant complains that \u201c[t]he Secretary\u2019s denial of Ms. Massa\u2019s admission to a SRC constitutes a wholesale denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>her federal right to choose between an ICF-MR and placement in the community.\u201d In her view, the State\u2019s practice of offering out-of-state placements to Medicaid beneficiaries, at State expense, \u201cviolates the freedom of choice requirement of federal Medicaid law,\u201d by which eligible individuals may opt to receive care in an institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Characterizing as \u201cdisingenuous\u201d appellee\u2019s claim that denial of admission to a SRC is not denial of admission to an ICF-MR, appellant asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">[I]n the <em>very same letter </em>denying Ms. Massa\u2019s admission to an ICF/MR, Holly Center, Secretary McCann stated, <em>\u201cMs. Massa could choose to receive residential services in an institution rather than the </em>community.\u201d ... Secretary McCann\u2019s letter continues, <em>\u201cI want to be clear that I am not denying Ms. Massa\u2019s right to choose to be served in an </em>ICF-MR.\u201d ... At the hearing before the Board of Review, the State similarly stated that federal law does not create a right to SRC admission, only a right to choose ICF-MR placement over home and community-based services. However, Holly Center <em>is </em>licensed as an ICF-MR. In fact, the only ICF-MRs in Maryland are also registered as SRCs____ [] Secretary McCann has done precisely the opposite of what his letter purports, in direct violation of federal law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">(Internal citations omitted; emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">Appellant explains that she chose to apply for Ms. Massa\u2019s admission to Holly Center \u201cbecause it is a relatively short drive from her house in Ocean City.\u201d She notes that if Ms. Massa were to be institutionalized in a facility outside the state, as the State suggests, it would be \u201cvirtually impossible ... to continue to be a part of [her] life.\u201d Appellant continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-11\">The proposition that the parent or guardian of a severely mentally retarded individual in Maryland is given a legitimate choice between an institutional or community placement by being offered an ICF-MR placement in New York, California, Wyoming, or any other state in the country is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>wholly impractical and an inappropriate burden upon the parents\u2019 or guardians\u2019 exercise of a federal statutory right. Surely Congress could not have intended that \u201cfeasible alternatives\u201d in the Medicaid statute, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396n(c)(2)(C), include sending a mentally retarded relative or loved one to another state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">In addition, appellant challenges the constitutionality of H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7-508 and 7-504. In her view, the statute deprives appellant and Ms. Massa of \u201cany due process,\u201d and \u201cforecloses any review of the secretary\u2019s denial of SRC admission.\u201d According to appellant, their due process rights were triggered because Ms. Massa has a \u201cproperty interest\u201d with respect to her claim of entitlement to a benefit \u2014 admission to a SRC. Noting that, \u201c[u]nder federal Medicaid law, the State of Maryland must offer Ms. Massa the choice of community or institutional care,\u201d appellant insists that she \u201chas a constitutional due process right to be heard on the merits,\u201d and claims that the State cannot deny \u201cthe choice of community or institutional care ... absent a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ADV\">Further, appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">[B]efore the Board of Review, the Department made the entirely conclusory argument that \u201cwhere Ms. Massa\u2019s admission was denied, due process only requires a hearing when the State seeks to deprive an individual of a liberty or property interest\u201d and \u201cMs. Massa does not have a liberty or property interest in being admitted to a [s]tate residential center.\u201d According to the Department, no court has the right to review either the merits of the Secretary\u2019s letter ruling denying SRC admission, [the ALJ\u2019s] one-sentence order dismissing the hearing scheduled for July 26, 2005, or the Board of Review\u2019s one-sentence decision affirming the ALJ\u2019s dismissal of the hearing. Furthermore, the Department continues to attempt to use its proposed out-of-state alternative ... to foreclose any review of the Secretary\u2019s denial of SRC admission. This lack of <em>any meaningful opportunity </em>to be heard <em>before </em>or <em>after </em>the Secretary\u2019s denial of SRC admission wholly deprives Ms. Massa of her property interest in SRC care without procedural due pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>cess as the Fourteenth Amendment and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights require.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">(Emphasis in original; citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Ms. Reese elaborates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">Ms. Massa is a profoundly mentally retarded citizen of Maryland for whom there is no \u201cless restrictive setting\u201d to receive residential services than an SRC ... If Ms. Reese had ever been given an opportunity to present the facts of her ward\u2019s medical and living conditions, it would be clear to the State that Ms. Massa has a legitimate claim of entitlement to SRC admission. However, the Board of Review failed to consider the brief filed on behalf of Ms. Reese and Ms. Massa ... and affirmed [the ALJ\u2019s] order without any knowledge of the relevant facts. Moreover, the State had already determined that Ms. Massa was eligible for SRC admission, as she had resided at Great Oaks for more than two decades until it closed in 1996 ... It is absurd for the State to claim that she is less eligible for SRC care than when she resided at Great Oaks, when she was years younger and had not yet undergone major surgery.<footnotemark>[17]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">Section 7-503 provides for a hearing only in the event of the Secretary\u2019s grant of SRC admission.... Section 7-504 provides for judicial review of a hearing officer\u2019s findings upon the Secretary\u2019s grant of SRC admission.... This statutory scheme, and the State\u2019s interpretation of it, results in <em>no review whatsoever </em>for a severely mentally retarded individual who has been denied admission to present evidence to dispute the Secretary\u2019s finding that a less restrictive setting than a SRC is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">(Emphasis in brief.)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">In addition, Ms. Reese .complains that appellee failed to provide Medicaid services to Ms. Massa with \u201creasonable promptness,\u201d as required by federal law. She points out that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Ms. Massa applied for admission to Holly Center in October 2004, and currently \u201cremains at a wholly-inadequate facility in the community where her medical needs continue to be neglected, and because of their severity, cannot be met.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">According to the Department, \u201cThe only issue properly before this Court is the Department\u2019s determination that Ms. Reese was not entitled to a hearing on the Secretary\u2019s denial of her request for the admission of Ms. Massa to Holly Center.\u201d With respect to the statutory scheme, it posits that there is no provision for a hearing if the Secretary derives admission to a SRC, and asks us to affirm the denial of a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In reaching its conclusion, the Department maintains that the denial of a request for admission to a SRC \u201cis not a contested case required to be decided only after an opportunity for a hearing.\u201d Appellee explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">The APA defines a contested case as \u201ca proceeding before an agency to determine ... a right, duty, entitlement, or privilege of a person that is required by law to be determined only after an agency hearing.\u201d Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t \u00a7 10-202(d)(l). Contested case proceedings typically require the agency decision to be made using \u201ctrial-type\u201d procedures like those contained in the APA. <em>See Sugarloaf Citizen\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority, </em>323 Md. 641, 651[, 594 A.2d 1115] (1991); <em>Dozier [v. Department of Human Resources], </em>164 Md.App. [526] at 535[, 883 A.2d 1025 (2005)]. Section 7-502(b) of the Health-General Article contains no such requirements. It only requires the secretary to deny admission if the individual does not meet admission criteria.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Moreover, appellee asserts \u201cthat a party is entitled to an adjudicatory hearing only if a statute, regulation or constitutional due process requires such a hearing.\u201d It claims: \u201cThe statutes governing admissions to SRCs do not provide a hearing when the Secretary denies admission, and the Constitution does not require one.\u201d In the Department\u2019s view, \u201cDue process requires a hearing only when the state seeks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>deprive an individual of a liberty or property interest,\u201d and Ms. Massa has neither a liberty nor a property interest in admission to a SRC. While recognizing that Ms. Massa may wish to reside in a SRC, appellee contends that she \u201chas no legitimate claim of entitlement to that place of residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Further, the Department disputes appellant\u2019s argument that, without a hearing, she had no opportunity for review of the Secretary\u2019s decision. Appellee asserts: \u201c \u2018[C]ourts are vested with the inherent residual right to review and restrain improper exercises of administrative powers by agencies alleged to have acted arbitrarily, illegally, capriciously and unreasonably.\u2019\u201d (Citation omitted.) According to the Department, appellant \u201cdid not invoke that \u2018inherent residual right to review,\u2019 ... choosing instead to challenge the lack of a hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The Department also maintains that \u201c[t]he denial of Ms. Massa\u2019s request for admission to a State Residential Center did not violate her rights under federal law\u201d to choose an institutional placement; it claims that, \u201c[u]nder Maryland law, an individual cannot simply choose to reside at a SRC.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Appellee adds: \u201ca Medicaid recipient does not have the right to choose among available providers.\u201d Rather, appellee insists that Ms. Reese could have pursued placement in an out-of-state institution. Claiming that \u201c[t]here is nothing in the record to suggest that Ms. Reese has tried to locate another institution or that the Department has refused to pay for care at another institution,\u201d the Department urges that \u201cthere is no basis for concluding that Maryland has not complied with the [choice] requirements of the Medicaid statute.\u201d In this regard the Department states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The Secretary, in his letter denying Ms. Massa\u2019[s] request for admission to Holly Center, acknowledged that Ms. Massa, as a Waiver Program participant, had the right to choose to live in an institution and offered assistance to Ms. Reese in locating an institution for her ward. To date, Ms. Reese has not requested such assistance. Instead, she insists that Ms. Massa has a right to reside at Holly Center, a SRC. She is mistaken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The Department also relies on Maryland\u2019s policy of favoring community placements over institutionalization. It points out that the Legislature \u201chas plainly expressed its preference\u201d for serving mentally retarded individuals in the community, rather than in institutions. To that end, notes appellee, the statute limits admission to state-run institutions by \u201csetting strict admission requirements and requiring the Department to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence to a hearing officer that each admission is appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The Department also disagrees with appellant\u2019s contention that it has failed to provide Ms. Massa with services with \u201creasonable promptness.\u201d In the Department\u2019s view, this contention is \u201cbased on a misreading of the statute.\u201d It explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">The Medicaid statute defines \u201cmedical assistance\u201d as the \u201cpayment of part or all of the cost\u201d of particular services, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(a), and requires that states furnish such \u201cmedical assistance\u201d with reasonable promptness, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1396a(a)(8). Thus, the statute requires prompt payment, not prompt services. <em>Mandy R. v. Owens, </em>464 F.3d 1139, 1146 (10th Cir.2006); <em>Westside Mothers v. Olszewski, </em>454 F.3d 532, 540 (6th Cir.2006); <em>Bruggeman v. Blagojevich, </em>324 F.3d 906, 910 (7th Cir.2003). Ms. Reese has not made any claim that Maryland has failed to pay for services required by Ms. Massa.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">In reply, appellant reiterates that the State is required to admit to a SRC an individual who meets the specified criteria. This entitlement, in appellant\u2019s view, confers upon appellant a right to a hearing before denying the entitlement, even if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>statute governing admittance to a SRC does not provide for such a hearing. Appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\">[T]he entitlement to admittance to an SRC is triggered here because Ms. Massa meets all of the[ ] criteria enumerated by the statute ... Ms. Massa is a severely mentally retarded individual for whom there is no less restrictive setting to receive residential services than an SRC. Because Ms. Massa is statutorily entitled to admission, the State must first satisfy her due process right to a hearing before denying Ms. Massa that benefit to which she is entitled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Appellant adds: \u201cOnce there is a due process right, whether the statute provides for a hearing is irrelevant ... The relevant question is not whether a statute provides for a hearing, but whether, having granted someone an entitlement that constitutes a property right, the state can deny that right absent a hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Moreover, appellant maintains that, when the Department argues that Ms. Massa has an \u201cinherent residual right to review\u201d in the courts, it \u201cconfuse[s] the right to a hearing with the right to appellate review.\u201d Although appellant agrees with the Department that, \u201cin cases where the APA does not provide for appellate review, courts still retain an inherent residual right to review\u201d agency actions, appellant points out that \u201cMs. Massa is not attempting to have a court review the decision of the Secretary; rather Ms. Massa merely is arguing that she is entitled to a hearing <em>prior </em>to the Secretary deciding her case.\u201d Accordingly, she maintains: \u201c[WJhether courts can review the Secretary\u2019s decision via the residual right power is immaterial to Ms. Massa\u2019s current claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">In addition, appellant contends that, in \u201ctwo important respects,\u201d the Department has \u201cmisconstrued Ms. Massa\u2019s argument regarding the [Department\u2019s] delay in deciding her case.\u201d First, appellant disagrees with the Department\u2019s assertion that Ms. Massa has chosen to reside in a SRC even though she does not meet the admission requirements. She asserts: \u201cMs. Massa is not merely choosing to reside at an SRC, but instead, due to her many conditions, the statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>of her care providers, and other evidence, she is <em>entitled </em>to reside in an SRC.\u201d Second, appellant disagrees with the Department\u2019s argument that Medicaid\u2019s \u201creasonable promptness\u201d requirement only concerns payment for services, rather than the provision of services. She contends: \u201c[I]t is clear that the corresponding regulations provide that Medicaid services must be provided promptly and without delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Title 7 of the Health-General Article is captioned \u201cDevelopmental Disabilities Law.\u201d Subtitle 5 is captioned \u201cState Residential Centers for Individuals with Mental Retardation.\u201d The statutory scheme relating to admission and confinement at a SRC is codified at H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7-501 to 7-508. Preliminarily, the Secretary has the sole responsibility to determine whether an individual meets the entrance criteria for SRC placement. The statute does not provide for a hearing at which the applicant for admission to a SRC may present his or her case prior to the Secretary\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">As our review of the statutory scheme reveals, the Secretary may not approve admission to a SRC if \u201c[t]here is a less restrictive setting in which the needed services can be provided that is available to the individual or will be available to the individual within a reasonable time.\u201d H.G. \u00a7 7-502(b)(2). If the Secretary approves admission, however, \u00a7 7-503 requires a hearing within 21 days of admission to the SRC, conducted by a hearing officer of the Department, at which the Department must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the individual meets the statutory requirements for admission. <em>See </em>H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7-502, 7-503.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Notably, if the Secretary deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>mines that the individual does <em>not </em>meet the criteria for admission to a SRC, the statute does not provide the applicant with any recourse to contest that determination. In effect, then, the statute clothes the Secretary with the unilateral right to determine that an applicant is ineligible for admission to a SRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">After the Secretary determined that Ms. Massa did not qualify for admission to a SRC under H.G. \u00a7 7-502(a), appellant sought review of the Secretary\u2019s decision before the OAH, the Board, and the circuit court. On each occasion, she was not provided with a forum to be heard in regard to the merits of her request to admit Ms. Massa to a SRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">As a condition of Maryland\u2019s participation in Medicaid, the State must certify to the federal government that it provides eligible individuals with the choice of receiving care in the community or in an institution, including an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded (ICF-MR). <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>\u00a7 1396n(c)(2)(C); <em>see also </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 441.302(d). Secretary McCann acknowledged as much in his letter to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">In the first instance, appellant contends, in effect, that the Department\u2019s willingness to place Ms. Massa in an out-of-state residential facility, but not in a SRC, constituted a veiled attempt at an end-run around the federal and State choice requirements. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The Secretary expressly advised that \u201cMs. Massa could choose to receive residential services in an institution rather than the community,\u201d and claimed he was \u201cnot denying Ms. Massa\u2019s right to choose to be served in an ICF-MR,\u201d although he was denying Ms. Massa\u2019s \u201cadmission to a State residential center.\u201d He explained that Ms. Massa could be placed at a facility in another state, at State expense. To be sure, it is understandable that appellant would prefer placement in an institution located in Maryland, .so that she can continue to have close contact with Ms. Massa. But, having found Ms. Massa ineligible for admission to a SRC, the Department\u2019s willingness to pay for an out-of-state institutional placement does not amount to \u201cillusory\u201d compliance with the federal choice requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">What remains, of course, is the larger question of appellant\u2019s rights, if any, to be heard in regard to the Secretary\u2019s determination that Ms. Massa did not qualify for admission to a SRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">As we have observed, the Maryland statute does not provide for a mechanism to challenge the Secretary\u2019s denial of admission to a SRC. For that reason, appellee contends that the matter is not a \u201ccontested case\u201d under the APA, and therefore appellant had no right to an OAH hearing, a hearing before the Board, or traditional judicial review of an administrative agency action. Moreover, appellee insists that due process does not require such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">S.G. \u00a7 10 \u2014 202(d)(1) defines a \u201ccontested case,\u201d in pertinent part, as \u201ca proceeding before an agency to determine: (i) a right, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege of a person that is required by statute or constitution <em>to be determined only </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>after an opportunity for an agency </em>hearing....\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>See Modular Closet Systems, Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>315 Md. 438, 444, 554 A.2d 1221 (1989) (defining \u201ccontested case\u201d to include only those disputes that, by their nature, entitle a party to an agency hearing, regardless of whether a hearing was actually held); <em>State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation v.

Maryland Rule 7-201 (a) is also pertinent. It states, in part: \u201cThe rules in this Chapter govern actions for judicial review of (1) an order or action of an administrative agency, <em>where judicial review is authorized by statute....\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Moreover, S.G. \u00a7 10-223(b)(l) states: \u201cA party who is aggrieved by a final judgment of a circuit court under this subtitle may appeal to the Court of Special Appeals in the manner that [the] law provides for appeal of civil cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">An administrative agency\u2019s action is generally subject to judicial review only when there is \u201ca legislative grant of the right to seek judicial review.\u201d <em>Harvey v.

Maryland Insurance Administration, </em>337 Md. 181, 652 A.2d 125 (1995), elucidates some of the principles discussed above. In that case, a group of pharmacists sought judicial review of a decision of the Commissioner of the \u25a0 Maryland Insurance Administration (\u201cMIA\u201d). By way of background, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maryland (\u201cBCBSM\u201d), a non-profit health service plan, filed a form of contract with the MIA for approval pursuant to statutory requirements.

The difference, broadly speaking, involves whether the decision is to be made on individual or general grounds. Davis, <em>Treatise, </em>\u00a7 7.04.

It claims that neither the disabled person nor the guardian has a right to challenge such a potentially monumental ruling, even though, among other things, the consequence of such a decision could result in an institutional placement (under the Medicaid choice option) in a state located 3000 miles away, making it virtually impossible for the parent or guardian to remain involved in the life of the disabled person.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">We agree with appellant that she was entitled to a hearing, at which she could attempt to demonstrate that Ms. Massa\u2019s needs warrant admission to a SRC, and satisfy the statutory criteria set forth in H.G. \u00a7 7-502.

Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 578, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), the Supreme Court held that an untenured college professor did not have a property interest in continued employment, \u201csufficient to require the University authorities to give him a hearing when they declined to renew his contract of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Roth </em>Court recognized that the professor \u201csurely had an abstract concern in being rehired____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578, 92 S.Ct. 2701. In discussing the concept of a protected property interest in a benefit, the Court said, <em>id. </em>at 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701: \u201cTo have a property interest in a benefit, a person must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\u201d The Supreme Court explained, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">Property interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law \u2014 rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that supports claims of entitlement to those benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>In <em>Riger, supra, </em>278 Md. 281, 363 A.2d 481, Judge Eldridge, speaking for the Court of Appeals, summarized several important due process decisions with regard to benefits, stating, <em>id. </em>at 291-92, 363 A.2d 481:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\">Various types of benefits under federal and state statutes have been held to constitute \u201cproperty\u201d subject to procedural due process requirements. For example, in <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, supra, </em>[397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970) ] the entitlement to welfare benefits pursuant to federal and state programs was held to be \u201cproperty,\u201d with the further holding that such benefits could not be stopped without a pre-termination hearing. In <em>Bell v. Burson, supra, </em>[402 U.S. 535, 539-540, 91 S.Ct. 1586, 29 L.Ed.2d 90 (1971) ] the entitlement to a driver\u2019s license under state law was deemed \u201cproperty\u201d for due process purposes. In <em>Goss v. Lopez, supra, </em>[419 U.S. 565, 576, 95 S.Ct. 729 (1975)] the Court held that a pupil\u2019s interest in attending public school was \u201cproperty,\u201d and that the pupil could not be suspended for even a relatively short period absent some form of notice and hearing. The Court in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 332, 96 S.Ct. at 901, held \u201cthat the interest of an individual in continued receipt of [social security disability] benefits is a statutorily created \u2018property\u2019 interest protected by the Fifth Amendment.\u201d And in <em>Arnett v. Kennedy, </em>416 U.S. 134, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974), the Court held that a public employee\u2019s interest in retaining his job, where the statute required \u201ccause\u201d for removal, was a \u201cproperty\u201d interest, and that therefore the public employee could be removed only by procedures meeting due process standards.1-1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia in her dissent in <em>Board of Pardons v. Allen, </em>482 U.S. 369, 107 S.Ct. 2415, 96 L.Ed.2d 303 (1987), Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s summary of the law of statutory entitlements is also instructive.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>O\u2019Connor pointed to the importance of analyzing the amount of discretion afforded to a decisionmaker in determining whether a statute creates a protected statutory entitlement. She said, <em>id. </em>at 382, 107 S.Ct. 2415:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\">The <em>Roth </em>decision teaches that a mere expectation of a benefit \u2014 even if that expectation is supported by consistent government practice \u2014 is not sufficient to create an interest protected by procedural due process. Instead, <em>the statute at issue must create an entitlement to the benefit before procedural due process rights are triggered. </em>In my view, the distinction between an \u201centitlement\u201d and a mere \u201cexpectancy\u201d must necessarily depend on the degree to which the decisionmakers\u2019 discretion is constrained by law. An individual simply has nothing more than a mere hope of receiving a benefit unless the decision to confer that benefit is in a real sense channeled by law. Because the crucial inquiry in determining the creation of a protected interest is whether a statutory <em>entitlement </em>is created, it cannot be sufficient merely to point to the existence of some \u201cstandard.\u201d Instead, <em>to give rise to a protected liberty interest, the statute must act to limit meaningfully the discretion of the decisionmakers. </em>In the administrative law context we have long recognized that some purported standards \u201c \u2018are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 410, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971) (quoting S.Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1 st Sess., 26 (1945)). Accordingly, we have held that some agency action is committed to agency discretion within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act; as a result, agency action is not subject to judicial review if \u201cno judicially manageable standards are available for judging how and when an agency should exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>cise its discretion.\u201d <em>Heckler v. Chaney, </em>470 U.S. 821, 830, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985). It is no less critical in determining whether a statute creates a protected liberty interest to consider whether the statute includes standards that place real limits on decisionmaker discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Thus, discretionary statutory \u201crights,\u201d as compared to mandatory rights, do not create protected liberty or property interests under the Due Process clause. <em>See Smith v.

Arlington County Employees\u2019 Supplemental Ret. Sys. II, </em>91 F.3d 630 (4th Cir.1996). In that case, a former county employee, Mallette, applied for service-related disability retirement benefits. The county code, codifying the benefits, provided that \u201cany member ... may at any time prior to his normal retirement date retire on account of service-connected disability that is not due to the employee\u2019s willful misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635 (citation omitted). The ordinance directed payment of benefits \u201conce a medical examining board ... certified that the disability (1) is permanent; (2) incapacitates the employee for his or her duties; and (3) resulted from an accident or injury that occurred in actual performance of a duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Employees with a pre-employment disability were still eligible for service-connected disability benefits, provided that the board found that the employee would have been entitled to the benefits notwithstanding the pre-employment injury. The code also provided that any member meeting the requirements \u201cshall receive\u201d the benefits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Mallette had a long history of severe back pain. But, following surgery her condition improved greatly, and she was able to engage in normal activity. After the surgery, Mallette accepted a part-time position with Arlington County, at which point she informed the county of her past medical history and passed a pre-employment physical examination. Mallette later accepted a full-time position, which enabled her to participate in the county\u2019s employee retirement plan. Mallette then suffered injuries in an automobile accident while on duty. After receiving the statutory maximum in worker\u2019s compensation benefits, the county notified Mallette that the retirement system would begin paying benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">According to Mallette, conversations with county employees led her to believe that the county would convert her worker\u2019s compensation benefits to retirement benefits \u201cas a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>course.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633. Mallette submitted an application for service-connected disability retirement benefits. A physician for the retirement system examined Mallette and concluded that she was eligible for service-connected disability retirement benefits. Mallette appeared at the county retirement board\u2019s hearing on Mallette\u2019s application, at which time she was provided with a revised medical report, in which the physician reversed his conclusion; he stated that \u201cit was not medically certain that [Mallette\u2019s] automobile accident was the 'sole reason for her to be on job-connected disability without any pre-existing condition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Mallette submitted a written statement at the hearing. The retirement board subsequently denied Mallette\u2019s claim for service-connected disability retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Mallette appealed, arguing that she was not provided a full hearing because the Board gave her no opportunity to question the physician or the system administrator. The county argued that, because the board found that Mallette did not meet the eligibility requirements for the retirement benefits, she had no property interest in those benefits. The Fourth Circuit rejected that argument, stating that the county \u201cconfuse[d] the right to receive a benefit with the right to fair decision-making before a benefit is denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637 (citation omitted). The Fourth Circuit reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">Under the County\u2019s approach, any adverse decision on the merits would insulate it from the obligation to provide due process. Conversely, no employee could have a property interest triggering due process unless the agency had already awarded them the benefit \u2014 a convenient result for the County \u2014 but one that conflicts with the law. The Supreme Court has explained that a person may hold a property interest in a benefit even before it has been determined that she is, in fact, eligible for the benefit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnK\">A person\u2019s interest in a benefit is a \u201cproperty\u201d interest for due process purposes if there are such rules or mutually explicit understandings that support his claim of entitlement to the benefit and <em>that he may invoke at a hearing. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>Perry v.

By the same token, \u201c[t]he right to be heard does not depend upon an advance showing that one will surely prevail at the hearing.\u201d <em>Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 87, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 1997, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972). In <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>the Court held that welfare claimants \u201chad a claim of entitlement to welfare payments that was grounded in the statute defining eligibility for them,\u201d and thus had a right to due process, even though \u201c[t]he recipients had not yet shown that they were, in fact, within the statutory terms of eligibility.\u201d <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. at 2709 (citing <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970)). Just as the plaintiffs in <em>Goldberg </em>were not required to show that they would prevail on the merits before they were entitled to due process, Mallette need not prove that her injury meets County standards to rightfully claim a modicum of procedural fairness. <em>We hold that Mallette has a property interest in her potential eligibility for disability retirement benefits, whether or not she ultimately prevails on the merits.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Having decided that due process applied to Mallette\u2019s application for benefits, the court focused its analysis on what process was due. Ultimately, the Fourth Circuit reversed and remanded, \u201c[b]ecause [it found] sufficient evidence in the record to suggest that Mallette did not receive notice \u2018reasonably calculated\u2019 to afford her a meaningful opportunity to present her side at the hearing____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 641. On remand, it instructed the district court to \u201capply the <em>Mathews </em>balancing test to evaluate whether the process accorded Mallette was constitutionally adequate, taking into account, where appropriate, any avenues of relief that were available to her under Virginia law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">According to appellant, \u201cjust as in <em>Mallette, </em>Ms. Massa need not \u2018prove that her injury meets [the State\u2019s] standards to rightfully claim a modicum of procedural fairness.\u2019 \u201d Appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>[T]he State relies on the same tautology squarely rejected by the Fourth Circuit in <em>MaUette. </em>The State claims Ms. Massa has no due process right because, in part, the Secretary has already denied her entrance and thus she can have \u201cno legitimate claim of entitlement to that place of residence.\u201d ... Thus, the State\u2019s argument boils down to the proposition that, because it has denied Ms. Massa entrance to the SRC, she is not entitled to any appeal of such a decision because it has already denied her entrance.

H.G. \u00a7 7-502 <em>requires </em>the Secretary to apply certain particularized eligibility criteria in making the decision. If an individual meets those particularized standards, H.G. \u00a7 7-502 does not confer discretion on the Secretary to deny admission, or to apply additional or alternate eligibility criteria. To the contrary, the statute speaks in mandatory terms: \u201cThe Secretary <em>shall </em>approve the admission of an individual\u201d who meets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>the qualifications for admission.

Because H.G. \u00a7 7-502 creates an entitlement to a benefit upon satisfaction of the eligibility criteria, i.e., admission to a SRC, the decision-maker\u2019s discretion is constrained by law.

This case is unlike <em>John A., </em>which involved a claim brought under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400 to 1419 (2000 &amp; Supp. IV 2004), and its Maryland counterpart, Md.Code (1978, 2006 Repl.VoL), \u00a7\u00a7 8-401 to 8-417 of the Education Article (\u201cEduc.\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 369-70, 929 A.2d 136. In <em>John A., </em>the disabled student's parents filed a request for a statutory due process hearing, as provided by the IDEA and its Maryland counterpart. They asserted that the refusal of the Howard County Public Schools (\"HCPS\u201d) to administer various medications in accordance with the instructions of the student\u2019s doctor constituted a denial of the student\u2019s right to a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d (\"FAPE\u201d). They sought an administrative order requiring the HCPS to abide by the doctor\u2019s medical directives and administer the medications to the student during the school day. HCPS challenged the ALJ\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction to consider the issues presented by the parents. HCPS argued that, under the IDEA and Maryland law, a due process hearing may be conducted only when the dispute pertains to the \"identification, evaluation, or placement of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378, 929 A.2d 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The ALJ was of the view that the issue was one of medical treatment, or an ethical question, rather than a special education one. Therefore, the ALJ determined that the dispute fell outside the scope of the statutory due process hearing, and dismissed the complaint based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 380, 929 A.2d 136. The Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In rejecting the parents\u2019 position, the Court reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 390-91, 929 A.2d 136:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">We disagree with the parents\u2019 contention that the particular dispute in this case sufficiently touches and concerns a \"related service\u201d within the contemplation of the regulatory scheme. The dispute in this case is not so much over the administration of medications to a child, which the HCPS concedes is deemed generally a \"related service\u201d contemplated by the IDEA, but instead relates to the ability of a child\u2019s parents to regulate communications between the school personnel designated to administer the drugs and the child\u2019s treating/prescribing psychiatrist. The IDEA does not intend to address claims such as these, even had the ALJ concluded that the administration of medication inferentially was provided for as a \"related service\u201d in A.A.'s IEP. The dispute in this case involves a medical treatment issue, not a special education one. As a result, the contro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>versy resides outside of the expertise and training of an ALJ who adjudicates disputes regarding the IDEA. Allowing parties to use the IDEA as the mechanism for trying such disputes would open .the doors to lawsuits under the IDEA for a multitude of matters unrelated to the proper scope of special education.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The Court added, <em>id. </em>at 391, 929 A.2d 136: \"When the issue, as here ... deals principally with medical and ethical concerns, rather than those touching on special education, the IDEA provides no jurisdiction to resolve disputes through the due process complaint process.\u201d The Court continued: \"The dispute in this case does not touch truly on the provision of the administration of medications as a 'related service,\u2019 but is instead about an ethical issue, the need for school nurses to consult directly with prescribing physicians, which is associated only tangentially with a 'related service.\u2019 <em>\" Id. </em>at 393, 929 A.2d 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In upholding the ALJ\u2019s dismissal of the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the Court said, <em>id. </em>at 395, 929 A.2d 136:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">When, as here, however, the disputed question is a medical or ethical one, and not a special education issue, an ALJ has the power under the IDEA and related Maryland law to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as falling outside his or her power to decide matters \u201crelating to the identification, evaluation, or placement of a disabled child, or the provision of free appropriate public education to such child.\u201d The ALJ did not err here in dismissing Appellants\u2019 complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Notably, the Court observed that \" 'redress is available in other forums in disputes of this nature, [but] an administrative special education due process hearing is not the appropriate forum in which to resolve such an issue.' \" <em>Id. </em>at 394, 929 A.2d 136 (citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">In this case, unlike in <em>John A., </em>there was no due process hearing provided to appellant. Instead, as we observed, the Secretary unilaterally decided that Ms. Massa is not eligible for admission to a SRC, and appellant has no statutory recourse to challenge that finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
