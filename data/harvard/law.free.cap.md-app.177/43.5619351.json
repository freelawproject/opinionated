The lot became undersized as a result of changes to Baltimore County\u2019s zoning laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">When the Petition was filed, appellants also owned an adjoining waterfront lot that Mr. Mueller\u2019s parents had purchased in 1947, and on which they had constructed a residence in 1948 (referred to as \u201cLot 66\u201d or \u201cProperty I\u201d). The lot at issue here (referred to as \u201cLot 67\u201d or \u201cProperty II\u201d), was purchased by Mr. Mueller\u2019s parents in 1960, and has remained undeveloped. Appellants acquired the properties in 1979. In 2004, they sought a variance as to the undeveloped lot in order to construct a dwelling on it. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, appellee, opposed the Petition. After appellants prevailed before the Board, appellee sought judicial review in the circuit court. That court reversed the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">This appeal followed. Appellants pose the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">1. Did the Board properly grant the Appellants\u2019 Petition for Variance in Accordance with the standards for undersized lots established in BCZR Section 304.1?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">2. Did the Board properly grant Appellants\u2019 Petition for Variance in accordance with the BCZR Section 307 variance process?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\">3. Was the Board correct in finding that the doctrine of merger is inapplicable to Properties I and II?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall reverse the circuit court and remand to the Board for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">In 1947, Herman Mueller, Sr. and his wife, Thelma Mueller (the \u201celder Muellers\u201d), the parents of appellant Herman Mueller, Jr., acquired Lot 66, located at 2606 Bauernschmidt Drive in Baltimore County (the \u201cCounty\u201d). In 1948, they construct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>ed a dwelling on Lot 66, which is used as a summer home and weekend retreat. The elder Muellers purchased the adjacent waterfront lot, Lot 67, in 1960, located at 2608 Bauernschmidt Drive. Lot 66 is approximately 8,400 square feet in area, and 50 feet wide, while Lot 67 is approximately 6,812 square feet in area and about 61 feet wide.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">The lots are located in Bauernschmidt Manor, a 1940 waterfront subdivision on the Turkey Point Peninsula, in eastern Baltimore County. Bauernschmidt Manor consists predominantly of single family residences built in the 1940\u2019s and 1950\u2019s, many on lots which are about 50 feet wide, and thus undersized under current zoning regulations. However, many homes in the waterfront section of Bauernschmidt Manor were constructed on multiple, contiguous lots. Lots 66 and 67 both front on Greyhound Creek, which flows into Middle River. Moreover, most of the area comprising the two lots is located within the 100-foot Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Buffer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In 1978, the two parcels were re-deeded to Thelma Mueller and her son, Herman Mueller, Jr. Then, in 1979, the deeds were transferred to appellants Herman, Jr. and his wife, Grace Mueller. Both lots were collectively known as 2606 Bauernschmidt Drive,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but are deeded separately. As of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>January 1, 2003, the land portion of Lot 66 was valued at $98,550, while the improvements were valued at $21,550. As of that date, Lot 67 had a \u201cBase Value\u201d of $5,720. During the pendency of the variance proceedings, appellant sold Lot 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Lots 66 and 67 conformed to Baltimore County Zoning Regulations (\u201cBCZR\u201d) until 1970, when the Bauernschmidt Manor subdivision was re-zoned Density Residential 3.5 or \u201cD.R. 3.5,\u201d (i.e., 3.5 units per acre). In order to construct a dwelling on a lot that is zoned D.R. 3.5, a minimum lot area of 10,000 square feet per dwelling unit is required, along with a minimum lot width of 70 feet. <em>See </em>BCZR \u00a7 1B02.3.C.1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">On April 27, 2004, appellants filed their variance Petition, in which they sought permission to make Lot 67 a buildable lot. In particular, the Petition requested that the Zoning Commissioner \u201capprove an undersized lot per Section 304 [of BCZR] with any other variances deemed necessary....\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">A zoning hearing was held on June 21, 2004. Thereafter, on June 23, 2004, the Deputy Zoning Commissioner granted appellants\u2019 Petition, stating, in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\n<em>Interested Persons</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Appearing at the hearing on behalf of the variance request were James Grammer, engineer from McKee &amp; Associates, Inc., Steven Glock and Herman Mueller, the Petitioner. Silvana Wisniewski, Robert Koch and Steve Hummel appeared in opposition to the petition. Linda Clark attended the hearing as a[sic] interested citizen. People\u2019s Counsel, Peter Max Zimmerman, entered the appearance of his office in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">\n<em>Testimony and Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Testimony and evidence indicated that the property, which is the subject of this variance request, consists of 6,812.10 sq. ft., more or less, and is zoned DR 3.5. Mr. Grammer proffered that the subject property is a vacant lot (lot 67) of the Bauernschmidt Manor subdivision which was recorded in the Land Records of Baltimore County in 1940. Its frontage along Bauernschmidt Drive is approximately 50 ft. as are most other lots in the subdivision. See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1. The Petitioner acquired one half of a 20 ft. wide emergency water access strip in 1960 that separates lots 68 and 67 and so the combined road frontage is approximately 61 ft. As such, the combination does not meet the minimum 70 ft. width required by the regulations for DR 3.5 property. The subject lot faces Greyhound Creek and widens out to approximately 70 ft. along the water. The lot contains approximately 6,800 sq. ft of area, whereas the regulations require 10,000 sq. ft. The property is served by public sewer and water.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Lot 66 is also owned by the Petitioner and is improved by a single-family dwelling. Again, its frontage along Bauernschmidt Drive is approximately 50 ft____</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The Deputy Zoning Commissioner proceeded to list the nearby properties as an indication of the development pattern. He noted that several were built on 50 foot lots, while others were situated on double lots. Moreover, he observed that several protestants were concerned about jeopardizing their own views of the water. Further, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">Mr. Grammer indicated that the proposed home would meet all County requirements for setbacks but could not meet the area and lot width regulations. As such, he believed that the subject property qualifies under Section 304 since the lot was recorded prior to March 30, 1955, that all other requirements except area and width will be complied with, and the owner does not own sufficient adjoining land to conform to the area and width requirements. Again, in regard to the latter requirement, he noted that <em>lot 66 was already undersized and there would he no sense to take land from this undersized lot as this would also require a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number><em>variance. </em>In addition, he noted that the property could not meet the zoning regulations imposed upon it many years after it was laid out and recorded. This would amount to both a hardship and practical difficulty. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">The opinion continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\n<em>Findings of fact and conclusions of law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In regard to what was requested in terms of variance, I find that there are special circumstances or conditions existing, that are peculiar to the land or structure, which is the subject of the variance request. The subdivision was recorded in the 1940\u2019s much before the DR 3.5 regulations were imposed. I recognize that the case of <em>Cromwell v. Ward, </em>102 Md.App. 691, 651 A.2d 424, (1995) seems to indicate that there must be some physical uniqueness in the size[,] shape or environment of the property to qualify for a variance. However, I do not believe the Court addressed the issue of old subdivisions having new zoning regulations imposed upon them. In such a case, <em>the imposition of the new regulations impacts the lot in the old subdivision disproportionately as compared to lots in the area laid out in accord with the regulations. I find that under these circumstances the property passes the first test and is unique. There is no way for the 50 ft. lots, which were designed before the new regulations, to meet the new 70 ft. width or area requirements. Requiring such would be a hardship and a practical difficulty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">However, as I indicated at the hearing, I must also find that the variance can be granted in strict harmony with the spirit and intent of said regulations, and in a manner as to grant relief without injury to the public health, safety and general welfare. To me, this means that I look to the pattern of development in the immediate area to see if the old undersized lots are generally developed with single-family homes on 50 ft. lots or has the \u201cneighborhood\u201d been developed with double lots. In my way of thinking, <em>the proposed new home should be compatible with the existing neighborhood. </em>Said another way, allowing new homes on 50 ft. lots in neighborhoods which have been developed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>double lots would be out of place with and change the character of the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><em>I think it also important to arrive at the same result using Section 30h or the formal variance procedure. Both have been requested here. This lot meets all the criteria of Section 30Jf.l as it is a pre-1955 lot, the new home will meet all regulations other than lot width and area, and there is no adjoining land from which the owner could take to make the lot conform. </em>I distinguish the Clark\u2019s Point Road case referred to me by the protestants because the Clark\u2019s Point Road owner had three lots that could be combined to produce two lots which would meet the regulations. However, <em>here, lot 66 is not large enough to contribute land without creating just another variance case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Also, by Section 304.4, I am additionally charged with finding whether or not the proposed dwelling is \u201cappropriate\u201d. <em>I find that it is \u201cappropriate\u201d in this case because the neighborhood has been developed with single-family homes on 50 ft. wide lots in the past. As evidenced above, I find that the pattern of development shows that most of the lots are developed as single family homes on 50 ft. lots. </em>I acknowledge that there are a few double lots on the edge of this neighborhood. I define the neighborhood to be the water front and water view properties shown on Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit No. 1. Just as the water front lots are generally developed as single-family homes on the 50 ft. lots, the protestants [sic] homes across Bauernschmidt Drive are not developed as double lots, but rather single-family homes on 50 ft. lots. I do not believe that allowing another single-family home on the subject lot will adversely affect the character of the neighborhood as these are already so developed....</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Under the totality of the evidence, <em>I also find that such a variance can be granted in strict harmony with the spirit and intent of said regulations, and in such manner as to grant relief without injury to the public health, safety and general welfare.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Finally, I understand that the protestants have enjoyed the view from across the road for many years. I understand that they would like to continue to enjoy that view. However, they have the opportunity to purchase the development rights on the Petitioner\u2019s lot as it seems that the Petitioner is ready to sell the lot. In this case the Petitioner would maintain his view to the west without an additional neighbor. It may even be possible for an agreement with Mr. Hummel and Koch to similarly restrict the development rights on their waterfront properties. However, I cannot impose such restrictions by law. This must be a matter of agreement among the Parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Pursuant to the advertisement, posting of the property, and public hearing on this petition held, and after considering the testimony and evidence offered by the Petitioners, I find that the Petitioners\u2019 variance request should be granted. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Appellee filed a <em>de novo </em>appeal to the Board, which held an evidentiary hearing on February 3, 2005.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We turn to review the evidence adduced at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">James Grammer, a project manager for McKee &amp; Associates, testified on appellants\u2019 behalf.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a project manager, he reviewed site plans and supervised property surveys. Moreover, for a period of twenty years, he worked with the County zoning office regarding the variance and zoning process. Grammer explained that Lot 67 was created before March 30, 1955, pursuant to a validly approved subdivision; that it has access to public water and sewer service; and that it cannot be further subdivided. He claimed that, with the exception of the D.R. 3.5 area and width requirements, Lot 67 meets all BCZR height and area regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Grammer described a small boat ramp on Lot 67, \u201cnear the line of division\u201d between lots 66 and 67, which he \u201cassume[d]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>was used by the Muellers in conjunction with their home on Lot 66. Grammer also testified that appellants placed an \u201caluminum shed\u201d on Lot 67, and he acknowledged that it \u201cstraddles the property line between Lot 67 and 68[sic]____\u201d He also recognized that \u201csome\u201d of the properties along the waterfront, and some behind the houses on the waterfront, were constructed on double lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The following testimony on cross-examination is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE]: Now, let\u2019s look at the adjoining property where the Muellers have their home. Just to keep the record straight, that\u2019s 2606 [Bauernschmidt Drive].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">[MR. GRAMMER]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE]: Now, is 2606 and 2608 are [sic] combined, if you combine the acreage, will that meet the 10,000 square foot minimum acreage required in the D.R. 3.5?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-10\">[MR. GRAMMER]: Yes, if they were both combined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE]: Would it also meet the front yard requirement of the seventy foot, front footage requirement of seventy feet, if they are combined?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-12\">[MR. GRAMMER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">However, Grammer maintained that, in actuality, it is not possible for Lot 67 to conform to current zoning laws by using land that is part of Lot 66, because Lot 67 \u201cdoes not have sufficient adjacent land to conform to current width and area requirements.\u201d Grammer indicated that the owner of Lot 66 would then be required to seek a variance for reducing the size of that lot. He explained that Lot 66</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-14\">is currently improved with a dwelling. That itself and on its own is an undersized lot. There\u2019s no ground we can acquire from it that would increase our lot to meet the minimum area or the minimum lot width of the building line, in any case, and if we did take any ground from [Lot 66], it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>just make the existing deficiencies on Lot 66, 2606 Bauernschmidt, worse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Mr. Mueller testified that, throughout the years, Lot 66 was used primarily as \u201ca weekend retreat,\u201d while Lot 67 was used \u201cto play ball on, the kids went over, and ran on it.\u201d He maintained that he \u201cnever\u201d intended to merge the two lots, which are separately deeded and taxed. Although Lot 67 is situated \u201cto the side\u201d of the house on Lot 66, he insisted that \u201cit was a lot,\u201d and did not serve as a \u201cside yard\u201d for Lot 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Appellants\u2019 son-in-law, Steven Glock, has been familiar with both lots for about 30 years, as he knew the Mueller family since he was six years old. He testified that the residence on Lot 66 is used as a \u201cweekend home.\u201d Moreover, he stated that Lot 67 was \u201calways characterized ... as a separate lot\u201d and referred to as \u201cthe lot.\u201d He added: \u201cI call it that because that\u2019s what we referred to it in the thirty years I have been familiar with the property.\u201d According to Glock, the family entertained on Lot 66, not Lot 67. He explained that \u201cthe side lot was simply, you know, a lot,\u201d where the children played ball. With regard to the shed on Lot 67, he claimed it is \u201cvery easily moved\u201d because it is approximately \u201cten-by-ten,\u201d made of aluminum, and is not a permanent structure. Glock also testified that appellants used it to store a riding lawnmower, a push lawnmower, and other handtools. As to Lot 67, he claimed: \u201cThere is no boathouse. There\u2019s a section of a seawall that\u2019s open ... It can be used to take a boat in and out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Since the DR 3.5 zoning regulations were imposed in 1970, residences have been built on other undersized lots within the Bauernschmidt Manor community. For example, in 1972 a residence was built at 2412 Bauernschmidt (waterfront property); in 1979, a residence was built at 2311 Bauernschmidt (non-waterfront); in 1980, a residence was built at 2705 Bauernschmidt (non-waterfront); in 1986 a residence was constructed at 2308 Bauernschmidt (non-waterfront); and in 2004 a residence was built at 2508 Bauernschmidt (waterfront property). The smallest of these properties was 2705 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Bauernschmidt, with an area of 7450 sq. feet.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Appellee presented two witnesses. In addition, appellee presented a petition from neighbors who opposed the variance request..</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Aaron Kluttz has lived at 2618 Bauernschmidt Drive since 1991. That property consists of lots 70 and 71. He acknowledged that he intended to merge his two lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">According to Kluttz, the Muellers have always treated their two lots as one property, with no visible line of separation. When asked about appellants\u2019 use of the properties, Kluttz stated: \u201cI know each holiday, they have a pretty large party ... I don\u2019t know exactly where they put their tents, but it seems like they use both areas consistently.\u201d Further, he testified: \u201cIt\u2019s just all one big yard.\u201d He added that Mr. Mueller keeps the grass on both properties \u201cnice, keeps it all mowed.\u201d He also stated that the Muellers use Lot 67 for recreational activities, and it has a shed on it as well as a sandy \u201cbeach ramp,\u201d from which \u201cyou can launch a boat.\u201d The remainder of both lots is \u201cstraight bulkhead all the way across.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Kluttz maintained that treating appellants\u2019 two lots as one parcel would be consistent with the neighborhood, which is composed of many residences built on double lots. He also testified that on appellant\u2019s waterfront block, two other single, vacant waterfront lots are used by their respective owners as front yards, with their residences located across the street. He added that his neighbor, Perry Leventis, constructed a house in the area in the past 15 years, which he believed was built on a lot exceeding the 10,000 square feet minimum.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Appellants\u2019 counsel questioned Kluttz about a residence built on an undersized lot that had been used as a side lot for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>an existing dwelling owned by Steven Wilson. Although each of Wilson\u2019s properties exceeds 13,000 square feet in area, the property in issue lacked the 70 foot width requirement to meet current zoning regulations. Yet, a variance was granted to build a residence on the vacant lot adjoining Wilson\u2019s residence. Mr. Kluttz expressed concern that development of Lot 67 would obstruct his view of the water. Because the area is designated as a Critical Area, Kluttz was also of the view that development should be restricted in compliance with the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Ronald Wisniewski has lived at 2605 Bauernschmidt Drive, a double lot, since 1982. He conceded that he uses his own lots as \u201cone parcel\u201d; that his house \u201cstraddles\u201d the lot line; and his home is \u201cbuilt in the center\u201d of the two lots. Nevertheless, he explained that it is \u201cvery common\u201d in the neighborhood for houses to be built \u201con double lots.\u201d For that reason, he did not believe construction on Lot 67 would be in keeping with the character of the area. Indeed, he claimed that if appellants\u2019 variance request were granted, it would be \u201cthe first house built on Greyhound Creek within the hundred foot buffer since, I guess, the Muellers built their home.\u201d He expressed concern that he would \u201close [his] waterfront view\u201d if the Petition were granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Wisniewski also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">Like I said before, we, the community association, was successful in preventing any building in the hundred foot buffer along Greyhound Creek.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">You extend that map all the way up, you will see it\u2019s all woodland, all the way around. And from that section of the road there, from Bauernschmidt, that\u2019s the only view, unobstructed view, you have of that creek, and it\u2019s all undeveloped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">And the people enjoy that every day, walking through there, and seeing that view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">Once they build there, no one will even know they\u2019re on waterfront, basically, because you\u2019re going to be looking through houses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>So it not only affects my property value, my loss of view, but it affects everybody\u2019s property value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">According to Wisniewski, appellants \u201cmostly\u201d used their home \u201con weekends.\u201d He also stated that they used Lot 67 to launch and store their boat and for \u201coutdoor activities.\u201d He also claimed that, when hosting social gatherings, appellants used Lot 67 for a variety of purposes, including parking, playing horseshoes, and playing ball, and sometimes tables were put on the line between the two lots. Mr. Wisniewski indicated that he has seen others playing on Lot 67 (i.e., people who are not members of appellants\u2019 family). Wisniewski noted that there is no line of demarcation between lots 66 and 67, and stated that \u201c[t]he major part of sixty-seven was open....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Wisniewski explained that he contacted SDAT about the property taxes for lots 66 and 67, because he was interested in the comparison to his own. He claimed that the property taxes for Lot 67 are lower than that for Lot 66, because SDAT considered Lot 67 a \u201cmowing property,\u201d in that it \u201cwas a lot extension or an unbuildable lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">In a 29-page post-hearing memorandum filed with the Board on March 17, 2005, appellee raised a number of issues. People\u2019s Counsel argued that appellants failed to satisfy the requirements for a variance, including the uniqueness requirement. Moreover, appellee claimed that appellants did not show \u201cpractical difficulty,\u201d and that granting a variance would be \u201cin direct conflict with variance law and the spirit and intent of the regulations,\u201d stating: \u201c... Petitioner wants a radical deviation from the regulations in the D.R. 3.5 zone because he believes he can make more money with two separate lots.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Appellee also argued that \u201cthe merger doctrine supports denial of the Petition under BCZR 304,\u201d and that the use of the two properties over the years created a zoning merger that precluded appellants from obtaining the requested variance. People\u2019s Counsel added that the Petition \u201cfailfed] to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>satisfy Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Standards.\u201d Further, People\u2019s Counsel asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">The site was used effectively by Petitioner with his adjoining property for many years. There is nothing prohibiting Petitioner from selling both lots together, particularly since the SDAT records show both lots were acquired by Petitioner at the same time (5-11-79).... <footnotemark>[10]</footnotemark> It is apparent that the Petitioner intends to separate the site from lot 66 after all these years in the hope of increasing his profit. He rejects the viable alternative of selling the combined lots and improvements together, in compliance with current zoning regulations and long-standing use. But a property owner is not entitled to every use in the zone, only a reasonable use. Nor can a variance be granted to increase Petitioner\u2019s economic gain.... Meanwhile, the evidence demonstrates it is reasonable and common in this area to utilize and transfer two or more of the old lots as a single home site, particularly along the waterfront on Bauernschmidt Drive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">On July 8, 2005, the Board issued its \u201cOpinion,\u201d granting appellants\u2019 Petition, with the caveat that any building must comply with the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area requirements, which would be addressed during the building permit process. The Board considered the variance under BCZR \u00a7 304, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">Petitioners, Grace M. and Herman Mueller, Jr., requested variance relief for property located at 2608 Bauernschmidt Drive in the \u201cBauernschmidt Manor\u201d subdivision, to permit a 6,812 sq. ft. lot in lieu of the minimum required 10,000 sq. ft.; to permit a lot width of 61 feet in lieu of the minimum 70 feet per \u00a7 304 of the <em>Baltimore County Zoning Regulations </em>(BCZR); and to permit an undersized lot per \u00a7 304.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">After the Board reviewed the evidence, it set forth its \u201cDiscussion,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>The Board of Appeals members deliberated this request for a variance on May 4, 2005. After much discussion the members agreed on the following.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">The property was developed in the early 1940\u2019s and the Muellers purchased two lots in 1947.<footnotemark>[11]</footnotemark> A home was built on lot 66 in 1948 that conformed to zoning requirements which were changed in 1970. <em>The outcome of this zoning change, to already existing properties, resulted in a legitimate nonconforming use, causing the property to become unique. </em>Based upon the evidence and testimony received at [the] hearing, we find that <em>there are special circumstances or conditions which exist that are peculiar to the land or structure that is the subject of the variance request.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">While it appears from <em>Cromwell [v. Ward, </em>102 Md.App. 691, 651 A.2d 424 (1995) ] that there must be some physical uniqueness in the size and shape or environment of the property to qualify for a variance, we believe that the court did not address <em>the imposition of new zoning regulations on old subdivisions. In such cases, the imposition of new regulations impacts the lots in the old subdivision disproportionately as compared to lots in the area developed after and in accordance with new regulations. We therefore find that, under these circumstances, the property passes the first test and is unique. </em>This subdivision was recorded in the 1940s prior to D.R. 3.5 zoning, and <em>denying the requested variance would result in a hardship and practical difficulty.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">As to the issues brought up in People\u2019s Counsel\u2019s memorandum:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">1. Profitability, inconvenience, or preferable alternative-The Board finds that as a result of the new zoning imposed after 1950 makes these issues moot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>2. The variance request does not conflict with the spirit or intent of the regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-4\">3. As to the issue of \u201cmerger,\u201d <em>there is no mention of intent by the owner to combine the lots as one unit. </em>It appears through testimony by the owner that he has never considered merging the two lots as one property as further indicated by the separate tax bills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">4. As to the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area requirements, this issue will be addressed with the building permit per DEPRM [Department of Environmental Protection and Resource Management] and ZAC [Zoning Advisory Committee] comments when the owner applies for a building permit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">The Board Members also feel that the development of this lot will not harm or change the nature of the area. Denying the requested variance relief would relinquish the use of lot 67 to only expansion of the current yard of lot 66. Therefore, this Board will grant the requested variance relief and it will so order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The Board issued the following Order:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">ORDERED that the Petitioners\u2019 request to permit a 6,812 sq. ft. lot in lieu of the minimum required 10,000 sq. ft. and permit a lot width of 61 feet in lieu of the minimum 70 feet per \u00a7 304 of the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations (BCZR) be and the same is hereby GRANTED, with the following restrictions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">1. Compliance with the ZAC comments submitted by DEPRM [Department of Environmental Protection and Resource Management] dated may 20, 20024[sic], a copy of which is attached hereto and made par hereof;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-11\">2.

When applying for a building permit, the site plan filed must reference this case and set forth and address the restrictions of this Order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Thereafter, on July 15, 2005, appellee filed a \u201cPetition for Judicial Review.\u201d Appellants sold Lot 66 sometime during the Fall of 2005, and the new owner recorded title on December 15, 2005. Following a hearing on January 9, 2006, the circuit court reversed the Board\u2019s decision. In a well written \u201cMemorandum Opinion\u201d and \u201cJudgment Order\u201d dated January 25, 2006, the court said, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In this case, the properties at issue were re-zoned in 1970 in a manner that increased the minimum lot size and width. Further construction was thereby limited, unless parties owned adjacent parcels or a variance was obtained. Testimony established that many, if not most, of the homes originally constructed in the subdivision are now on lots construed to be undersized, based upon the re-zoning. New construction has occurred within the subdivision on double lots, in compliance with the new zoning restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u2756 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The decision of whether to grant a variance under either provision [of the BCZR] is a two-step process. The first requires a determination of whether the property, in and of itself, is \u201cunique and unusual in a manner different from the nature of surrounding properties such that the uniqueness and peculiarity of the subject property causes the zoning provisions to impact disproportionately upon that property.\u201d <em>Cromwell v. Ward, </em>102 Md.App. 691, 694 [651 A.2d 424] (1995). If that \u201cuniqueness\u201d does not exist, no variance may be granted. If it does, then the second hurdle is to determine whether practical difficulty and/or unreasonable hardship result from the disproportionate impact of the zoning ordinance caused by the property\u2019s unique quality. <em>Cromwell, supra </em>at 694-695 [651 A.2d 424].</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The Board found, and the [appellants] currently argue, that application of the new zoning in 1970 disproportionately impacts undeveloped lots in the old subdivision, such as the Muellers, and that alone suffices for a finding that the property is \u201cunique.\u201d Additionally, the [Muellers] cite to the testimony of their expert, James Grammer, who notes that Lot 67 would be rendered unusable for residential purposes if the variance were not granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">This analysis ignores the requirements under <em>Cromwell </em>that the impact on the property at issue be somehow different from that of surrounding properties. In fact, the impact here is the same as to every undeveloped lot in the subdivision. Construction of that fact, alone, as rendering a property \u201cunique\u201d would effectively gut the impact of the rezoning. Every undersized lot throughout the community would then be able to claim it was unique on the basis of the re-zoning alone, and the increased lot size restrictions would be virtually meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\n<em>B. C.Z.R. affords some limited relief to property owners like the Muellers who own undersized lots in older subdivisions. By its express terms, however, relief under B. C.Z.R. 304.1 is not permitted if the owner has sufficient adjoining land to conform, with the area and width restrictions set forth in the applicable zoning. At the time these matters were before the Board, the combined lots permitted construction of one residence that met with the regulations. It would be contrary to the intent of this regulation, and to the zoning modification overall, to allow construction of a second structure on this same site.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The requested variance must fail for other reasons as well. At the time this case was before the Board, the Muellers owned Lots 66 and 67, which are contiguous. This fact is also crucial to the variance analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\"><em>The doctrine of merger has developed in zoning analysis to allow consideration of the lot sizes of contiguous parcels with common ownership, where development on a single </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>parcel would violate the zoning restriction. </em>This doctrine of merger was first formally recognized in Maryland in <em>Friends of the Ridge, supra, </em>at which time the Court of Appeals held that a landowner who clearly desires to combine or merge several parcels of lots of land into one larger parcel may do so to allow consideration of the contiguous lots in service of a single structure or project. In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted a split in the approach to merger employed in other jurisdictions. The majority required some evidence, often minimal, of the owner\u2019s expression of intent to merge the parcels. However, some jurisdictions presume merger automatically. In <em>Friends of the Ridge, supra, </em>the court was not required to determine which of these approaches Maryland should follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">In <em>Remes v. Montgomery County, </em>387 Md. 52 [874 A.2d 470] (2005), the Court of Appeals further explored the doctrine of zoning merger. In <em>Remes, </em>the Court held that two contiguous lots held in common ownership that were used by prior owners in service to one another had merged for zoning purposes. Thus permits could not be issued to permit construction on the vacant lot, where such construction would create a non-conforming use on the adjacent lot. As the Court noted, when zoning merger occurs, the lots remain divided, and the doctrine simply operates as an adjustment of zoning requirements. <em>Remes </em>at 478. However, once that occurs, one can\u2019t later sell off a parcel without correcting nonconformance issues and simply seek a variance. To hold otherwise would allow the original owner to \u201cflip-flop between his or her adjacent parcels, thwarting the intent of the land development regulations and, perhaps more egregiously skirting [the] County\u2019s exacting requirements for subdivision.\u201d <em>Remes </em>at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\"><em>At the time the Board considered the Mueller\u2019s [sic] variance request, they had adjacent parcels. The undeveloped parcel had been used in combination with the developed parcel for over [0 years. </em>The dock used by the family was on the undeveloped lot, and a shed straddled the property line. While never formally \u201cmerged\u201d into a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>deed, the properties had shared a common address for many years. <em>The double lot had sufficient area to comply with the revised zoning restrictions. </em>To allow the owners to now claim they are entitled to a variance to permit construction of a home on the undeveloped parcel would be contrary to the analysis employed by the Court in <em>Remes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">Finally, the [Muellers] argue that the December sale of [Property I], leaving them owners of only the undeveloped lot, eliminates the merger analysis. This argument must fail for several reasons. First, in the posture of this case, this Court is bound to analysis of the facts and issue [sic] before the Board. <em>To the extent that new facts develop that may impact on the Board\u2019s analysis, the proper remedy is to remand for further review, not to analyze those facts in the first instance on appeal. </em>Second, in the analysis under B.C.Z.R. 304. 1, at the time of application the Muellers owned adjoining land. Thus this development is not one that this Court may consider in the first instance as according a basis for relief by grant of a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">For the reasons stated, the Court finds that the July 8, 2005 decision of the Board of Appeals was premised on an erroneous interpretation of the law, and thus was in error. For that reason, the decision of the Board of Appeals is REVERSED, and this case is remanded for an entry of a ruling consistent with the ruling set forth in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">On February 7, 2006, appellants filed a \u201cMotion to Alter or Amend Judgment,\u201d which was denied on March 9, 2006. The court said: \u201cFor the reasons previously stated, this Court does not believe BCZR 304.1 authorized the relief granted below.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">\u201cThe very essence of zoning is territorial division [of land within a jurisdiction] according to the character of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>land and the buildings, their peculiar suitability for particular uses, and uniformity of use within the zone.\u201d <em>Heath v.

Horman, </em>46 Md.App. 491, 497-98, 418 A.2d 1249 (1980). Zoning and planning are separate functions, however. <em>Howard Co. v.

Planning is a broader concept, encompassing the development of a community and the creation of \u201cgoals for orderly growth and development including the establishment of viable neighborhoods for which it delineates appropriate boundaries,\u201d and \u201csuggesting] methods for implementation and achievement of those goals, including proposals for future land use and zoning classifications.\u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>292 Md. at 362, 438 A.2d 1339. <em>See Washington County Taxpayers Assoc., Inc. v.

Baltimore County, </em>39 Md.App. 257, 259, 385 A.2d 96 (1978). Then, on March 30, 1955, the County adopted \u201ca new set of comprehensive zoning regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260, 385 A.2d 96. However, it also enacted BCZR \u00a7 304 to \u201cgrandfather\u201d lots that had become substandard as a result of the zoning law, allowing them to be developed under certain conditions. BCZR \u00a7 304 was intended to mitigate the harsh effect of the zoning scheme, and to avoid constitutional takings violations. The County sought to balance the expectancy interests of landowners who, in the 1940\u2019s and 1950\u2019s, may have intended to build on land that was later affected by the zoning scheme, and the long-term interests of the County in protecting against over-development and overcrowding.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">In 1970, the zoning ordinance was amended again to add area and density provisions to its zoning scheme for the purpose of improving the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. At that time, the present minimum width and minimum area requirements were established. The ordinance was amended again in 1991 to add a \u201ccompatibility review\u201d to the process, requiring a landowner who seeks a building permit to show that the proposed dwelling is appropriate to the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\u201c \u2018A variance is an authorization for [that] ... which is prohibited by a zoning ordinance____\u2019 \u201d <em>Cromwell v.

Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>195 Md. 395, 400, 73 A.2d 491 (1950). In general, \u201cthe specific need for the variance \u2018must be substantial and urgent and not merely for the convenience of the applicant[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Chesley v.

Ordinarily, a variance is warranted if the \u201c \u2018applicable zoning restriction ... is so unreasonable as to constitute an arbitrary and capricious interference with the basic right of private ownership,\u2019 \u201d or otherwise results in \u201cunwarranted hardship.\u201d <em>Belvoir Farms, </em>355 Md. at 276, 282, 734 A.2d 227 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Writing for this Court in <em>Cromwell, </em>102 Md.App. at 694, 651 A.2d 424, Judge Cathell explained that the variance process \u201cis at least a two-step process.\u201d He stated, <em>id. </em>at 694-95, 651 A.2d 424:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">The first step requires a finding that the property whereon structures are to be placed (or uses conducted) is \u2014 in and of itself \u2014 unique and unusual in a manner different from the nature of surrounding properties such that the uniqueness and peculiarity of the subject property causes the zoning provision to impact disproportionately upon that property. Unless there is a finding that the property is unique, unusual, or different, the process stops here and the variance is denied without any consideration of practical difficulty or unreasonable hardship. If that first step results in a supportable finding of uniqueness or unusualness, then a second step is taken in the process, i.e., a determination of whether practical difficulty and/or n unreasonable hardship, resulting from the disproportionate impact of the ordinance <em>caused by </em>the property\u2019s uniqueness, exists. Further consideration must then be given to the general purposes of the zoning ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Noting that a variance is often confused with a special exception, the Court observed, <em>id. </em>at 699-700, 651 A.2d 424: \u201c[T]he variance and exception are designed to meet two entirely different needs. The variance contemplates a departure from the terms of the ordinance in order to preclude confiscation of property, while the exception contemplates a permitted use ... [once] the prescribed conditions therefore are met.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Moreover, the Court stated: \u201cThe general rule is that the authority to grant a variance should be exercised sparingly and only under exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 703, 651 A.2d 424 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We turn to review the zoning regulations pertinent here. BCZR \u00a7 304 is titled \u201cUse of Undersized Single-Family Lots.\u201d The first part, \u00a7 304. 1, sets out threshold criteria for eligibility, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">Except as provided in Section 4A03, a one-family detached or semidetached dwelling may be erected on a lot having an area or width at the building line less than that required by the area regulations contained in these regulations if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">A.

The owner of the lot does not own sufficient adjoining land to conform to the width and area requirements contained in these regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">If the threshold requirements of BCZR \u00a7 304.1 have been met, the inquiry proceeds to the \u201ccompatibility review\u201d outlined in BCZR \u00a7 304.2, captioned \u201cBuilding Permit Application.\u201d It provides, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b93-14\">A.

Furthermore, any such variance shall be granted only if in strict harmony with the spirit and intent of said height, area, off-street parking or sign regulations, and only in such manner as to grant relief without injury to public health, safety and general welfare. They shall have no power to grant any other variances. Before granting any variance, the Zoning Commissioner shall require public notice to be given and shall hold a public hearing upon any application for a variance in the same manner as in the case of a petition for reclassification.[ ] Any order by the Zoning Commissioner of the County Board of Appeals granting a variance shall contain a finding of fact setting forth and specifying the reason or reasons for making such variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">As to BCZR \u00a7 307, the <em>Cromwell </em>Court said, 102 Md.App. at 698-99, 651 A.2d 424:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">The Baltimore County ordinance requires \u201cconditions ... peculiar to the land ... and ... practical difficulty....\u201d Both must exist. But the terms \u201cpractical difficulty\u201d and \u201cunreasonable hardship\u201d are stated in the ordinance disjunctively. Thus, at least as to variances other than use variances,\" if the property is found to be unique, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>practical difficulty standard would then apply----However, as is clear from the language of the Baltimore County ordinance, the initial factor that must be established before the practical difficulties, if any, are addressed, is the abnormal impact the ordinance has on a specific piece of property because of the peculiarity and uniqueness of <em>that </em>piece of property, not the uniqueness or peculiarity of the practical difficulties alleged to exist. It is only when that uniqueness is first established that we then concern ourselves with the practical difficulties (or unnecessary hardships in use variance cases).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Section 4A03, entitled \u201cGrowth Management Plan for Bowleys Quarters and Back River Neck Areas,\u201d is similar to BCZR \u00a7 304, except that it applies to residential property \u201clocated in the Bowleys Quarters and Back River Neck areas____\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A03.2. But, \u00a7 4A03 imposes two additional requirements: (1) the property must meet the criteria for a variance under BCZR \u00a7 307; and (2) the property must have access to public sewer service.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Under \u00a7 4A03.1, an undersized lot is defined as follows: \u201cAn unimproved platted lot or a lot of record on or before August 6,1999, that does not meet the area, height or setback requirements in these Zoning Regulations to allow the construction of a dwelling.\u201d Section 4A03.4 is titled \u201cBuilding permits.\u201d Section 4A03.4.B provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>A building permit may be issued for the construction of a dwelling on an undersized lot subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">1. The owner of the lot does not own sufficient adjoining land that if combined with the adjoining land would allow the property owner to conform to the current zoning requirements;</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">2. No further subdivision of the lot is allowed;</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">3. The property owner obtains a variance as provided in Section 307 of these Zoning Regulations; and</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">4. The property owner connects to a public sewer where available and with adequate capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">BCZR \u00a7 4A03.5.B contains the same site design and architectural design requirements as set forth in BCZR \u00a7 304.2.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">As noted, the majority of the land comprising lots 66 and 67 is located within the 100-foot Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Buffer. Baltimore County Code \u00a7 33-2-401 bars construction within that buffer unless a variance is granted in accordance with the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area criteria. BCZR \u00a7 500.14 prohibits the Board from rendering any decision on a petition for special exception or a variance within the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area setback unless:</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">[T]he Zoning Commissioner has received from the Director of the Department of Environmental Protection and Resource Management, or his designated representative, written recommendations describing how the proposed request would:</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">A. Minimize adverse impacts on water quality that result from pollutants that are discharged from structures or conveyances or that have run off from surrounding lands;</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">B. Conserve fish, wildlife and plant habitat; and</p>\n<p id=\"b97-13\">C. Be consistent with established land use policies for development in the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area which accommodate growth and also address the fact that, even if pollution is controlled, the number, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>movement and activities of persons in that area can create adverse environmental impacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">BCZR \u00a7 104.1 concerns nonconforming uses. It states:</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">A nonconforming use (as defined by Section 101) may continue except as otherwise specifically provided in these regulations, provided that upon any change from such nonconforming use to any other use whatsoever, or any abandonment or discontinuance of such nonconforming use for a period of one year or more, the right to continue or resume such nonconforming use shall terminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Appellants claim that the Board properly applied the requirements of BCZR \u00a7 304.1 in granting their Petition for undersized lot relief. In their view, the Board\u2019s decision \u201cwas based on substantial evidence within the record that the Appellants met all of the requirements ...\u201d of that section. Therefore, they urge us to reverse the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">According to appellants, BCZR \u00a7\u00a7 304.1 and 307 are \u201cindependent methodologies available to obtain authority to build a residence on an undersized lot.\u201d They explain: \u201cSection 304.1 is simply an undersized lot provision, which is an alternative methodology to the much more general Section 307 variance process.\u201d Moreover, appellants contend that they satisfied the criteria of \u00a7 304.1, which does not require a determination that a property is unique and unusual in a manner different from the nature of the surrounding properties. Rather, appellants argue that \u00a7 304.1</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">allows for the construction of a residence on an undersized lot if three elements are met: (A) the subdivision was created prior to March 30, 1955; (B) other height and area regulations are satisfied; and (C) insufficient adjoining land is available. <em>Importantly, nowhere does Section 304.1 require application of Section 307\u2019s standards.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">Appellants maintain that the circuit court \u201ccorrectly accepted that elements A and B [of \u00a7 304.1] were established,\u201d but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>\u201crefused to recognize the substantial evidence presented by the Appellants that Property II does not have sufficient adjoining land in order to conform to the current zoning regulations.\u201d They posit: \u201cThe Appellants could not simply \u2018borrow\u2019 land from the already developed, undersized Property I in order to make Property II of lawful size so as to permit construction of a residence. As stated by Mr. Grammer, the effect would only have been to require a variance for the existing, developed Property I.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">In any event, appellants argue that the Board properly found Lot 67 unique, a factor under BCZR \u00a7 307, based on the imposition of new zoning regulations on an old subdivision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Urging this Court to affirm the Board, appellants state: \u201cFinding lawfully created lots that pre-dated zoning to be \u2018unique\u2019 is appropriate.\u201d In appellants\u2019 view, Lot 67 \u201cis disproportionately impacted as compared to properties in other subdivisions or communities that were subdivided consistent with the requirements of D.R. 3. 5.... \u201d Moreover, they argue that the <em>Cromwell </em>decision \u201cnever suggests that in determining whether a property is unique, it must be compared only to those properties within its immediate vicinity.\u201d Appellants assert that, \u201c[b]y focusing solely on the Bauernschmidt Manor subdivision,\u201d the court \u201cdid not take into account ... that the D.R. 3.5 zoning regulations affect a much broader area than just Bauernschmidt Manor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In addition, appellants maintain that the Board was legally correct in determining that, without a variance, practical difficulty will result. According to appellants, \u201cProperty I, an undersized and developed lot, did not afford Appellants adequate adjoining land to make the non-conforming Property II \u2018conforming.\u2019 \u201d They suggest that, if they are not granted a variance, Lot 67 \u201cwill have to remain vacant,\u201d rendering it \u201cessentially worthless as compared to Property I or any other developed property in the same subdivision.\u201d Based upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>alleged \u201ceconomic harm\u201d that would accrue to appellants if they are not granted a variance, appellants ask this Court to find that strict compliance with the zoning regulations will result in practical difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Further, appellants maintain that the Board correctly found that a variance would not violate the spirit and intent of the sixty-year old community, which is substantially developed. They point out that twenty-three of the properties on Bauernschmidt Drive were developed prior to the enactment of D.R. 3.5 regulations, and were constructed on what are now undersized lots. Appellants also allege that, since the enactment of D.R. 3.5 zoning in 1970, structures have been built on undersized lots on five occasions. Therefore, they insist that granting their request would not injure the public health, safety, or welfare of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Appellants also contend that, in addition to meeting all three requirements of \u00a7 304. 1, they satisfied the additional requirements set forth in \u00a7 4A03.4B. In this regard, they note that the properties cannot be further subdivided, and Property II has access to public water and sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">In addition, appellants insist that they \u201cshould not be barred from obtaining County permission to construct a home on Property II simply based on the fact that they sold Property I.\u201d They insist that they did not \u201ccreate\u201d a hardship as to Lot 66. Appellants also contend that \u201cthe record lacks any evidence demonstrating that the doctrine of merger applies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">People\u2019s Counsel suggests that Lot 67 does not qualify for relief under BCZR \u00a7 304 or BCZR \u00a7 307. Claiming that the Board erred \u201con every legal issue,\u201d appellee asserts: \u201c[C]ontrary to the [Board\u2019s] Opinion, a variance must stand on its own merits under the <em>Cromwell </em>standards for uniqueness and practical difficulty and under BCZR 307. Alternatively, the property must qualify for undersized lot relief under BCZR 304. There is no evidence to support relief under either scenario.\u201d In appellee\u2019s view, the Board\u2019s \u201cdecision is inadequate in form and substance. It lacks even a minimal analysis of the facts and application of the law required under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>fairly debatable standard for judicial review.\u201d Among other things, argues appellee, the Board ignored the evidence that, over the years, Lot 67 was utilized as a side yard for Lot 66, as well as the fact that other dwellings were constructed on double lots in the subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">According to appellee, the Board\u2019s \u201cmost serious\u201d mistake concerned its finding as to uniqueness, and \u201cthe justification of a variance based on the imposition of D.R. 3.5 zoning in 1970.\u201d Appellee explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">The implications of this premise turn upside down long standing [sic] zoning principals [sic] on reclassification, variance, and nonconforming use. There is no authority to expand the definition of uniqueness to include a condition unrelated to the geographic features of the site or improvements. Further, the [Board] interjects a standard \u2014 size\u2014 that is not contemplated by the definition of uniqueness cited in <em>Cromwell v. Ward </em>102 Md.App. 691 [651 A.2d 424] (1995). It also grants a prohibitive increase in density under the variance statute, B.C.Z.R. 307. This misinterpretation in turn conflicts with the limited and conditional statutory relief afforded undersized lots under B.C.Z.R. 304.1. It also seriously usurps and undermines the legislation [sic] authority of the Baltimore County Council under Md. Ann.Code, Art. 25A(X) to rezone residential property, including the concomitant increase in minimum lot size. Finally, the legal errors expand nonconforming uses, a violation of longstanding zoning principles to reduce or restrict such uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">If the variances are granted here, it creates instability for residential reclassifications that seek to reduce density by increasing minimum lot size. There are 6 D.R. classifications and 8 Resource Conservation (R.C.) zones, each with varying densities per acre. If a variance is granted to reduce lot area, it effectively supercedes a site\u2019s zoning classification, which in turn collapses the comprehensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>zoning authority of the County Council under Md. Ann. Code, Art. 25A(X).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Insisting that there was \u201cno evidence of uniqueness causing practical difficulty to prevent a reasonable use,\u201d appellee contends that the Board \u201cfoisted its own standard for uniqueness,\u201d and \u201cdisguised its errors by giving lip service to legitimate variance standards____\u201d Appellee elaborates, asserting that a finding of uniqueness \u201cmust relate to conditions on the land itself.\u201d Thus, appellee contends that the Board \u201cillegally expanded] a reasonable use standard for practical difficulty to include the petitioner\u2019s preferred uses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Moreover, People\u2019s Counsel claims that the Board\u2019s decision \u201chas the disturbing side effect of extending and expanding a nonconforming use, contrary to conventional zoning principles to eliminate such uses.\u201d Appellee comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">In adopting a conflicting and unauthorized standard for definition of uniqueness, the [Board] acted illegally and exceeded its authority. The impact on statutory construction and administrative and zoning law is seismic. In addition to subverting the Charter authority of the County Council, the decision violates the traditional definition of uniqueness, which must relate to the conditions on the land itself. <em>Cromwell, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Similarly, appellee maintains that the Board\u2019s \u201cassessment of practical difficulty is woefully inadequate and insufficient under the legal standard of review____\u201d Appellee argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\">Even if practical difficulty is an issue here, the variances must be denied because the characteristics of the site do not prohibit a reasonable use in conjunction with lot 68<footnotemark>[14]</footnotemark> and consistent with other uses in the neighborhood. Appellants may desire a second dwelling as a different use now, but that is not the standard for practical difficulty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">Further, appellee argues that \u201ca variance cannot be granted for a perceived economic advantage. Zoning principles have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>long rejected variance relief based on convenience and profitability for the property owner.\u201d Appellee continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">The decision gives protective non-conforming status to a use that did not exist when the new law became effective. In other words, when D.R. 3.5 was applied to the site, lot 67 was used as a side yard for the dwelling on lot 68[sic], not for a second dwelling. The [Board\u2019s] decision gives a type of \u201cretroactive\u201d nonconforming use for a dwelling on lot 67 as a justification for variance relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In addition, appellee maintains that BCZR \u00a7 304 does not apply. Appellee explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">Variance relief cannot conflict with this statute. Zoning regulations are not like a smorgasbord. BCZR 307 must be applied harmoniously with BCZR 304. It is contradictory and arbitrary to grant a variance for lot size, if BCZR 304[.l](e) prohibits the same relief. Unfortunately, the [Board] ignored the proper application [of] BCZR 304(c), which is not intended to permit every use, or maximize the owner\u2019s profits, but rather assure some use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">People\u2019s Counsel also maintains that the Board\u2019s decision is \u201clegally flawed in the interpretation and application of the merger doctrine[.]\u201d According to appellee, the owner of two adjoining parcels need not state an intention to merge the properties in order for merger to occur. In appellee\u2019s view, \u201cconstruction of a second dwelling is a <em>de facto </em>illegal expansion or change of a nonconforming use under BCZR 104.1.... If the relief is granted, both lots 67 and 68<footnotemark>[15]</footnotemark> are nonconforming uses, contrary to the policy to eliminate, not increase, such uses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Finally, People\u2019s Counsel complains that the requested variance violates Chesapeake Bay Critical Area standards, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATm\">The Critical Area Regulations, enacted in 1988, prohibit new construction within the 100 ft[.] buffer of tributaries that flow into the Chesapeake Bay. It is significant that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>new construction has been permitted along the waterfront here, including Grey Hound Creek in this area, since the enactment of the Critical Area Law. E.39. Petitioner\u2019s request would be the first new house built along the water on Bauernschmidt Drive, except for 2515 Bauernschmidt, a 14,134 sq ft double lot, built in 1983 prior to the critical area law. E.39. B.C.Z.R. 500.14 imposes standards and findings to be made by the [Zoning Commission or Board] applicable to all zoning petitions in the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area. The [Board] completely ignored this provision and made no such findings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\">\u201cAs to the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area requirements, this issue will be addressed with the building permit per DEPRM and ZAC comments when the owner applies for a building permit.\u201d Opinion p. 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">We review the final decision of the Board, rather than the circuit court, in accordance with the well established principles of administrative law. <em>See, e.g., People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County v.

However, the Board discussed several variance criteria, such as the uniqueness of the property, which is an element under BCZR \u00a7 307 and \u00a7 4A03. Nevertheless, in its Order, the Board expressly relied solely on BCZR \u00a7 304. In its analysis, the circuit court considered BCZR \u00a7 304, as well as BCZR \u00a7 307 and \u00a7 4A03. But, as we have seen, we must review the Board\u2019s decision. And, an appellate court will review an agency decision \u201c \u2018solely on the grounds relied upon by the agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schwartz v. Md.

In contrast, \u00a7 307 applies generally to all variance requests. Therefore, \u00a7 304 controls. BCZR \u00a7 304 does not contain elements of practical difficulty or uniqueness, which are embodied in \u00a7 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">The grandfather clause of \u00a7 304 has limits, however. BCZR \u00a7 304.1.(C) provides relief only to owners who \u201cdo not own sufficient adjoining land to conform to the width and area requirements contained in these guidelines.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We pause to review 4 Kenneth H. Young, <em>Anderson\u2019s American Law of Zoning </em>\u00a7\u00a7 9.66-9.67 (4th ed.1997), with regard to grandfather clauses in zoning matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">Before the subdivision of land was subjected to municipal control, a great deal of municipal land had been divided into small lots, many with less than 30 feet of frontage and less than 3,000 square feet of space. When greater frontage and area requirements were superimposed upon this pattern, many owners were left with substandard lots. Strict and literal enforcement of the more stringent regulations would have made such lots useless to their owners and to the community. In addition, the regulations which destroyed the use value of such substandard lots would have been held confiscatory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">To avoid this result, most ordinances provide some relief for the owner of a substandard lot---- Under such an ordinance, the owner of a substandard lot which was of record prior to the adoption of the restrictive ordinance need not seek administrative relief. He is entitled as of right to develop his lot within the limits of the exception. <em>His right to such relief may be lost where he treats a number of lots as a single unit </em>for the purpose of constructing a condominium. If the determination of his qualification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>for an exception is committed to an administrative board, as is true under some ordinances/-<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the task of the board is simply to determine whether the lot was one of record on the effective date of the ordinance. <em>The board is without discretion to deny a permit if the specific requirements of the ordinance are </em>met____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\"><em>The common exception of lots which were recorded prior to the effective date of a restrictive ordinance is limited to lots which were in single and separate ownership on that date. Under such a provision, an owner is entitled to an exception only if his lot is isolated. If the oumer of such a lot owns another lot adjacent to it, he is not entitled to an exception. Rather, he must combine the two lots to form one which will meet, or more closely approximate, the frontage and area requirements of the ordinance. Where, for example, a landowner held four contiguous lots which each had a frontage of 20 feet, he was regarded as owning 80 feet of frontage and was required to redivide the land consistent with the zoning regulations. This requirement was held reasonable as it permitted him some reasonable use of his land. </em>The same result was reached where the owner of a lot containing 5,000 square feet acquired a contiguous lot of the same size. Under the ordinance he was considered to own a lot of 10,000 square feet. However, the requirement that adjacent substandard lots be merged may be unreasonable if the lots are the same size as most other lots in the area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">(Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">In this case, there is no dispute that appellants satisfied BCZR, \u00a7 304.1(A) and (B). The question is whether appellants satisfied BCZR \u00a7 304.1(C), which states: \u201cThe owner of the lot does not own sufficient adjoining land to conform to the width and area requirements____\u201d As noted, the Board was of the view that there was no adjoining parcel available to appellants under the circumstances of this case. In contrast, the circuit court ruled, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>had a \u201cdouble lot\u201d and thus they \u201chad sufficient area to comply with the zoning requirements.\u201d We disagree with the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Appellants\u2019 house was constructed on Lot 66 prior to enactment of the current area and width requirements. Lot 67 remained undeveloped and vacant. Had appellants requested a variance as to Lot 66, it is clear that appellants would have had adjoining land \u2014 Lot 67 \u2014 a vacant and undeveloped lot, which could have been combined with Lot 66 so as to render Lot 66 a conforming parcel. In this case, however, we must analyze whether Lot 67 had sufficient adjoining land available to it from Lot 66 so as to create a conforming parcel on Lot 67. To the extent that the circuit court determined that appellants had an adjacent parcel to enable them to satisfy current zoning requirements, it erred.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">In <em>Cromwell, </em>102 Md.App. 691, 651 A.2d 424, this Court made clear that self-inflicted hardships cannot justify a variance. There, we said, <em>id. </em>at 722, 651 A.2d 424:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">Were we to hold that self-inflicted hardships in and of themselves justified variances, we would, effectively not only generate a plethora of such hardships but we would also emasculate zoning ordinances. Zoning would become meaningless. We hold that practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship for zoning variance purposes cannot generally be self-inflicted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The Court added, <em>id. </em>at 726, 651 A.2d 424:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>It is not the purpose of variance procedures to effect a legalization of a property owner\u2019s intentional or unintentional violations of zoning requirements. When administrative entities such as zoning authorities take it upon themselves to ignore the provisions of the statutes enacted by the legislative branch of government, they substitute their policies for those of the policymakers. That is improper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">As we see it, however, appellants\u2019 use of Lot 66 does not give rise to a claim of self-inflicted hardship with regard to Lot 67.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The \u201ctypical type of self-created hardship\u201d arises from \u201can act of commission by the owner\u201d or his predecessor. <em>Richard Roeser Prof'l Builder, Inc. v. Anne Arundel Co., </em>368 Md. 294, 317, 793 A.2d 545 (2002). <em>See Stansbury, </em>372 Md. at 198, 812 A.2d 312 (recognizing that subdividing property in accordance with all applicable statutes does not, generally, constitute a self-created hardship, even though the act of subdivision was an act of commission). Put another way, a self-created hardship results from affirmative \u201cactions of the landowner,\u201d rather than from the \u201cimpact ... of the zoning ordinance on the property.\u201d <em>Roeser, </em>368 Md. at 314, 793 A.2d 545. <em>See, e.g., Ad+Soil, Inc. v. County Comm\u2019rs of Queen Anne\u2019s County, </em>307 Md. 307, 316, 513 A.2d 893 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">This case is unlike those in which the landowner took an affirmative action that resulted in the hardship. Here, the elder Muellers acquired Lot 67 several years after their residence was constructed on Lot 66. And, when they acquired Lot 67, it was a buildable lot. Neither Lot 66 nor Lot 67 was rendered nonconforming by virtue of actions taken by the elder Muellers, or appellants, <em>after </em>the zoning law in issue was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">To be sure, zoning ordinances often limit grandfather clauses to lots of record that are in single or separate ownership. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Put another way, an ordinance may limit the grandfather clause by a provision that, in effect, merges contiguous, vacant, substandard lots under common ownership, so that they are treated as a single parcel for purposes of zoning area and frontage requirements. But, appellants correctly argue that they did not own sufficient adjoining land to enable Lot 67 to comply with the zoning ordinances. This is because, with regard to Lot 67, appellants did not own an adjoining, <em>unimproved </em>parcel. Rather, the adjoining parcel, Lot 66, was improved before the change in the zoning law. Thus, appellants could not \u201cborrow\u201d land from Lot 66 to enlarge Lot 67 without making Lot 66 more substandard than it already is.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Appellee cites <em>Board of Zoning Appeals of the City of Hammond, Lake County v. Waskelo, </em>240 Ind. 594, 168 N.E.2d 72 (1960), to support its position. In our view, <em>Waskelo </em>is distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">In <em>Waskelo, </em>the court denied a variance for property owners who voluntarily subdivided their property. At the time of the purchase of the subject property in that case, the property was one lot and conformed to the applicable zoning regulations. After the subdivision, the owners sold the improved lot and retained the remaining lot, which did not meet frontage requirements. The owners then sought a variance to construct a dwelling on the substandard lot. In that circumstance, the court refused to find a hardship to justify a variance, stating: \u201cThe property as it existed at the time of purchase conformed fully with the provisions of the zoning ordinance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73. The court went on to state that the owners\u2019 decision to sell the improved portion of their property, with full knowledge of the restriction on the use of the remaining portion, is \u201cnot the result of any invalid application of terms of the zoning ordinance to their particular property, even though landowners might have been under a hardship in utilizing the portion of the lots which they retained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Unlike the landowners in <em>Waskelo, </em>appellants did not subdivide a conforming lot, thereby creating a substandard or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>nonconforming lot. Instead, appellants\u2019 relatives purchased two lots at separate times, both of which were conforming when acquired. And, they developed the first lot years before they even purchased the second lot. As a result of rezoning, both lots became nonconforming. The creation of the nonconforming lots was not of appellants\u2019 doing, however. Thus, appellants did not create a hardship for themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">We find the reasoning in <em>Burke v. Board of Adjustment of the Borough of Spring Lake, </em>52 N.J.Super. 498, 145 A.2d 790 (App.Div.1958), persuasive. There, the town of Spring Lake increased its frontage requirements for a building permit from 50 feet to 100 feet, and adopted a provision to \u201cgrandfather\u201d current owners, which stated, in part, <em>id. </em>at 792:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMz\">\u2018Notwithstanding the Lot Area and Lot width requirements of (the area here involved) * * *, a single family dwelling may be erected on any lot separately owned and not adjacent to any lot in the same ownership [on] the effective date of this ordinance.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In 1946, before the new zoning ordinance was passed, the plaintiff purchased two contiguous lots, each having 50 feet of frontage. The plaintiff erected a dwelling house on one of the properties when the old zoning ordinance was in force. A year after the new ordinance was adopted, the plaintiff sought permission to erect a dwelling on the undeveloped lot, which had become undersized. The local zoning board denied her application for a variance, on the ground that the lot failed to comply with the new frontage requirements. The plaintiff appealed, arguing that, unless permitted to construct a dwelling on the property, the lot was \u201cuseless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791. The trial judge concluded that the variance should be granted on the grounds of undue hardship. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">On appeal, the defendants, the Board of Adjustment of the Borough of Spring Lake and its building inspector, argued that the ordinance expressly sanctioned dwellings on 50 foot frontage lots only when \u201c \u2018not adjacent to any lot in the same ownership.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 792. The defendants also challenged the trial court\u2019s finding of undue hardship, arguing that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>tiff caused the undue hardship. The Superior Court disagreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-4\">We fail to perceive ... any justification for holding that a property owner who constructs her home on a 50-foot frontage lot and who leaves <em>untouched </em>another adjoining lot with the same dimensions \u2014 all done many years before the enactment of an amendatory ordinance increasing the frontage requirements \u2014 has in any culpable sense contributed to her own hardship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-5\"><em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Rejecting the defendants\u2019 claim that plaintiff was not entitled to relief because she owned an adjoining lot, the court upheld the award of variance. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">The evident purpose of [the] provision is to allow dwellings on 50-foot frontage lots unless the owner himself has the wherewithal to make his lot comply with the new requirements, <em>i.e., </em>adjacent property, in which event he would not need a variance, at the expense of the community-at-large. But the exclusion of those lots \u2018adjacent to any lot in the same ownership\u2019 does not faithfully reflect the purpose of the provision unless it is limited to <em>vacant </em>adjacent lots. That plaintiff finds herself with the adjacent lot 17, which because of the dwelling thereon, she cannot use to make lot 16 comply is clearly no reason for denying her the benefit of the cited ameliorative provision. Realistically, the plaintiff has a house on one 50-foot lot and another vacant 50-foot lot. If she cannot build on the latter, it will be forever useless. That the two lots are adjacent does not mitigate her hardship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abo\"><em>Id. </em>at 793 (Italics in the original; boldface added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">As in <em>Burke, </em>we believe the grandfather clause in \u00a7 304 was meant to limit the construction of residences on undersized lots when a landowner possesses a contiguous, <em>vacant </em>or undeveloped parcel of property. That is not the situation here, through no fault or action of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Appellee suggests that, even if Lot 66 has been developed, appellants are not entitled to the variance because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the two lots merged into one under merger principles. Notably, the Board rejected appellee\u2019s merger claim. The circuit court, however, agreed with appellee that, based on merger, appellants are not entitled to treat Lots 66 and 67 as distinct properties. As we discussed earlier, we may not set aside a factual finding that is \u201cfairly debatable,\u201d i.e., \u201cbased upon evidence from which reasonable persons could come to different conclusions.\u201d <em>White, </em>356 Md. at 44, 736 A.2d 1072. In our view, the matter is \u201cfairly debatable,\u201d and thus the Board\u2019s finding as to lack of merger was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we shall not disregard it. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Merger, in the context of land use, is the joining of contiguous parcels under common ownership, so that they are viewed as a single parcel for purposes of zoning regulations. 3 Ziegler, <em>Rathkopfs Law of Zoning and Planning, </em>\u00a7 32.04, n. 1 (1994). Zoning merger in Maryland can occur as a result of a property owner\u2019s use of contiguous lots under the same ownership. <em>See Friends of the Ridge v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>352 Md. 645, 724 A.2d 34 (1999)(reeognizing existence of zoning merger).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">4 Arden H. Rathkopf, et al., Rathkopfs, <em>The Law of Zoning and Planning, </em>\u00a7 49.13 (4th ed.2001), provides guidance. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">Zoning ordinance provisions often limit exemptions or grandfather clauses to lots of record that are in single or separate ownership. <em>Either implicitly by such provisions or expressly by \u201cmerger\u201d requirements in the ordinance itself, contiguous substandard lots under common ownership may lose their separate identity and be treated as a single parcel for purposes of zoning area and frontage requirements and subdivision restrictions. Merger provisions generally have been upheld against due process, equal protection, and taking claims. The application of merger provisions when a variance is sought is often the subject of litigation and denial of a variance is frequently sustained by courts based on such provisions. Merger requirements may operate upon contiguous undeveloped lots or upon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number><em>contiguous lots where one or more of the lots are already developed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-4\">In dealing with substandard lots, as with nonconforming uses which are analogous, the point of reference is the effective date of the bylaw. The basic purpose of the ordinance provision establishing generally applicable minimum lot requirements has as its corollary the purpose to freeze and minimize substandard lots. If there is a merger provision in the ordinance, it is designed to result in a maximum number of standard lots from each separate tract of land in single ownership at the effective date of the ordinance. The number of separately described parcels which an owner or his predecessors in title may have acquired over the course of time to make up the entire tract is thus immaterial.1 ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">(Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Appellee claims that, by the way in which appellants used both lots, a merger occurred. Appellee directs our attention, <em>inter alia, </em>to <em>Sciacca v. Caruso, </em>769 A.2d 578 (R.I.2001), for the proposition that appellants \u201ccannot \u2018unmerge\u2019 \u201d their properties. In that case, Caruso held two adjacent lots, each of which met the minimum buildable lot size at the time they were acquired by her in the 1960\u2019s. The owner constructed a dwelling on Lot 91 and landscaped and placed a shed on lot 92. <em>Id. </em>at 579. Nearly twenty years later, the town amended its zoning ordinance, which increased the minimum lot size and frontage requirements. As a result, the lots did not meet the frontage or area requirements under the new ordinance. However, if combined, the lots satisfied the new regulations. In the same amendment to the zoning ordinance, the town included \u201ca so-called merger provision^] pursuant to which contiguous lot Nos. 91 and 92 merged into one lot to meet this particular residential zoning district\u2019s minimum lot area and frontage requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579-80.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>In 1997, Caruso sought to build a dwelling on Lot 92. To \u201cunmerge\u201d the lots, she was granted approval to subdivide the property along its original lines. She then sought a variance from the minimum area and frontage requirement. Although several neighboring property owners objected to the variance request, it was ultimately granted by the zoning board. <em>Id. </em>at 581. The opponents then challenged that ruling in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Under Rhode Island statutory law, in order for a property owner to be entitled to a variance from frontage or area requirements, the owner must satisfy the zoning board \u201cthat the hardship suffered by the owner of the subject property if the dimensional variance is not granted amounts to more than a mere inconvenience, which means that there is no other reasonable alternative to enjoy a legally permitted beneficial use of one\u2019s property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583 (emphasis omitted). Moreover, before a zoning board grants a variance, it must be satisfied that any hardship suffered was \u201cnot the result of any prior action of the applicant and does not result primarily from the desire of the applicant to realize greater financial gain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cGiven this statutory language and the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>stances concerning how Caruso created the substandard lot that was the subject of her variance request,\u201d the Supreme Court of Rhode Island ruled that \u201cthe zoning board\u2019s grant of a dimensional variance ... improperly ignored the \u2018prior action of the applicant\u2019 in creating the alleged hardship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584. It continued, <em>id.: </em>\u201cHere, the undeniable fact is that Caruso\u2019s prior action caused the planning board to subdivide her single-conforming lot into two substandard-sized parcels, thereby creating the undersized lot in question. This \u2018prior action\u2019 resulted in the self-created hardship that she later used as the basis for her variance request.\u201d[ ]</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">In overruling the zoning board, the court concluded: \u201cTo rule otherwise would allow Caruso and other similarly situated property owners to circumvent applicable zoning laws pertaining to the validity of merger provisions like those in the town\u2019s zoning ordinance, as well as to evade the threshold showing of hardship that is required to obtain relief from their application through the granting of a dimensional variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">We are not persuaded by <em>Sciacca. </em>The question remains whether the doctrine of merger applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In <em>Friends of the Ridge, </em>352 Md. 645, 724 A.2d 34, the property owner, BG <em>&amp; </em>E, sought a declaration that three adjacent properties it owned merged for zoning purposes, so that the site was of sufficient size to allow it to enlarge an electricity substation. BG <em>&amp; </em>E applied for a variance from certain setback requirements in order to operate the larger substation. The Board determined, however, that no variance was necessary. <em>Id. </em>at 648 n. 3, 724 A.2d 34. The petitioners, Friends of the Ridge, appealed, asserting that because the parcels were never legally combined, BG &amp; E was required to obtain a variance to use the three parcels as one. <em>Id. </em>at 649, 724 A.2d 34. The Court of Appeals sustained the Board\u2019s decision that the variance criteria of BCZR did not apply, reasoning that the assemblage of contiguous parcels was sufficiently large to overcome the conditions triggering the need for a variance. <em>Id. </em>at 662, 724 A.2d 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>With regard to the principles of merger, the Court said, <em>id. </em>at 653-54, 724 A.2d 34:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">Efforts throughout the country, including Baltimore County, have been to restrict undersize[d] parcels, not oversized parcels. These efforts have resulted in the creation and evolution in zoning of the doctrine of merger, which, in zoning cases, generally prohibits the use of individual substandard parcels if contiguous parcels have been, at any relevant time, in the same ownership and at the time of that ownership, the combined parcel was not substandard.1 ] In other words, if several contiguous parcels, each of which do not comply with present zoning, are in single ownership and, as combined, the single parcel is usable without violating zoning provisions, one of the separate, nonconforming parcels may not then <em>or thereafter </em>be considered nonconforming, nor may a variance be granted for that separate parcel. Some cases discuss automatic merger, but most require that the intent of the owner to merge the parcels be expressed, though little evidence of that intent is required. As far as we can discern, the zoning doctrine of lot merger has never been applied in any jurisdiction to limit the creation of parcels that exceed minimum dimensional requirements; merger has been applied only to prohibit the later creation of undersized parcels. This, perhaps, is due to the general lack of objection to large parcels.1 ] A discussion, however, of how the doctrine of merger applies conversely to the present case may help emphasize that, in the context described above, merger occurs without the need for official subdivision or conveyancing. It is accepted automatically in some jurisdictions or, most often, with minimum proof of the owner\u2019s intent in other jurisdictions and always without the necessity of official action. We see no reason why a doctrine that seeks to prevent the proliferation or use of nonconforming, undersized lots by holding that they have been combined or merged into a larger parcel should not, as far as zoning is concerned, be applied properly to permit the creation, through the combining by use of a larger parcel from already conforming smaller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>parcels, without the necessity of official action or conveyancing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Ultimately, the Court held that \u201ca landowner who clearly desires to combine or merge several parcels or lots of land into one larger parcel may do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658, 724 A.2d 34. Of import here, the Court said: \u201cAn owner of contiguous parcels of land <em>may merge those parcels to form one tract if he desires to do so. </em>An intent on the part of the owner to do so may be inferred from his conduct with respect to the land and the use which he makes of it.... Intent is a question of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659, 724 A.2d 34 (italics in original; boldface added). The Court recognized that one way for a landowner to manifest intent to merge contiguous properties is by \u201cintegrating] or utilizing] the contiguous lots in the service of a single structure or project....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658, 724 A.2d 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\"><em>Remes v. Montgomery County, 387 </em>Md. 52, 874 A.2d 470 (2005), is also pertinent. There, the Court applied the concept of zoning merger to treat two residential lots as one, even though the owner wanted to treat them separately. Ralph and Yiolette Duffie purchased a parcel of property in 1951 (Lot 12), located in a subdivision created in 1945. They constructed a residence on that lot. <em>Id. </em>at 57, 874 A.2d 470. Several years later the Duffies purchased an adjoining parcel, Lot 11. <em>Id. </em>Over the years, both properties had been assessed as one lot for tax assessment purposes, and the properties shared the same address. <em>Id. </em>at 58, 874 A.2d 470. In addition, the Duffies installed a driveway that traversed both lots and, in 1959, they received a building permit to construct a swimming pool on Lot 11, \u201cas an accessory use to their home on Lot 12....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57, 874 A.2d 470. In 1963, the Duffies again sought a building permit to construct an addition to the residence, which resulted in an encroachment to the setback requirements on the Lot 11 side of the residence. <em>Id. </em>at 58, 874 A.2d 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In 1999, after the Duffies\u2019 deaths, both properties were transferred to their son by a single deed describing both properties. <em>Id. </em>On January 15, 2003, the Duffies\u2019 son executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>a deed conveying one of the two lots to Design-Tech Builders, Inc. In 2002, before it purchased the property, Design-Tech obtained a building permit to construct a single-family dwelling on the property it eventually purchased. <em>Id. </em>at 59, 874 A.2d 470. Shortly after the sale of January 15, 2003, David Remes, an owner of property adjacent to the lot purchased by Design-Tech, filed an action in circuit court seeking a declaration that the Duffies\u2019 two lots had merged for zoning purposes, and to rescind the sale to Design-Tech. <em>Id. </em>at 60, 874 A.2d 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The Court of Appeals held that although the properties were separately deeded, it \u201cdoes not lead us to the necessary conclusion that these lots for zoning limitations are not subject to the doctrine of zoning merger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80, 874 A.2d 470. The Court reiterated what it had said in <em>Ridge, </em>\u201cthat merger may be derived from the common owner\u2019s intent, as evidenced by \u2018integrating] or utilizing] the contiguous lots in the service of a single structure or project____\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66, 874 A.2d 470 (citing <em>Ridge, </em>352 Md. at 658, 724 A.2d 34).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Underscoring that \u201c[e]ach case must be examined on its own,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 68, 874 A.2d 470, the Court said, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">In the case at bar, there is ample evidence to conclude the elder Duffies intended to use their Lot 11 and Lot 12 as one property for zoning purposes: the pool on Lot 11 violates (or violated) the prescribed setbacks from the street and from Lot 12, unless it was dedicated for zoning purposes to Lot 12, and from the time of its creation was thus an accessory use to the structure or use of Lot 12; the additions to the house on Lot 12 encroach upon that lot\u2019s setbacks; the circular driveway traverses both Lot 11 and Lot 12; until very recently the lots were assessed for tax purposes as a single parcel; and the subsequent personal representative\u2019s deed conveying Lot 11 and Lot 12 to Mr. Duffie described a single lot comprised of two lots, in that it reads \u201cLot numbered eleven (11) and twelve (12).\u201d[]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">The Court concluded that the properties had merged for zoning purposes because they \u201cwere under common owner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>ship, and at the time of that common ownership, they were used in service to one another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87, 874 A.2d 470. It reasoned that, in order for the adjacent property to be \u201cutilized separate and apart from [the other], there would have to be a resubdivision of the combined lot, creating two lots both of which meet the requirements of both the zoning ordinance and the subdivision regulations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">This case is distinguishable from <em>Remes </em>on its facts. Appellants made no improvements to Lot 67 of a kind that are remotely comparable to those made to Lot 11 in <em>Remes. </em>The elder Muellers acquired Lot 66 in 1947, and Lot 67 in 1960. The evidence before the Board indicated that the family\u2019s boat launch and a moveable storage shed were located on Lot 67. Mr. Mueller and appellants\u2019 son-in-law both testified that Lot 67 was generally utilized for recreational activities, such as ball playing. However, no permanent structures were erected on Lot 67, such as a swimming pool or a common driveway. Nor was Lot 67 used in service of Lot 66 in a way comparable in degree to the way that Lot 11 served Lot 12 in <em>Remes. </em>Moreover, Mr. Mueller testified that it was never his intent to merge the two properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">To be sure, there was no physical or structural line of demarcation separating the lots. But, that is not required to preclude merger. Nor were appellants or the elder Muellers required to abstain entirely from the use of Lot 67 in order to preclude merger. If the Board were compelled to find merger on these facts, it would mean that almost any time a landowner owns adjoining and contiguous parcels, they would merge as a matter of law for zoning purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">On these facts, the Board was not clearly erroneous in concluding that appellants\u2019 use of Lot 67 did not create a merger. We agree with appellants, who argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">[N]ot all uses of an adjacent undeveloped property result in a merger. It is improper and without legal foundation to suggest that Appellants\u2019 occasional recreational use of Property II caused Properties I and II to merge. If the Appellants had bought an undeveloped lot somewhere else <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>in the community, and \u201cplay[ed] ball\u201d on it or placed a shed on it, such actions would never be considered merger. Moreover, the mere existence of a shed-not constructed on a foundation and not a structure for which a building permit was sought \u2014 cannot be viewed as similar to a permanent improvement benefitting the other parcel or a driveway being built across one lot to access another. The Appellants never needed the undeveloped Property II for them to enjoy the use of their developed Property I.<footnotemark>[22]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REMAND TO THE BOARD FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.

Appellants state that BCZR \u00a7 4A03 \"applies to Lot 67 because the property is in the Back River Neck Area.\u201d The Board made no such finding, however. Indeed, in its opinion, the Board only mentioned \u00a7 4A03 in its \"Testimony\u201d section, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">Mr. Grammer testified [that i]n 1948 lot 67 did meet the zoning requirements for building a home.
