The program permits Medicaid recipients who need health-related care to receive care at home or in a community-based assisted living facility, instead of a nursing home.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\u201cDepartment\u201d), appellant, denied the application of Ida Brown, appellee, for health care services under the Older Adults Waiver Program. The Department concluded that Ms. Brown did not satisfy the level of medical care required for admission. Ms. Brown requested a hearing at the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d). The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) affirmed the denial of Ms. Brown\u2019s application, agreeing with the Department that she was medically ineligible for the Older Adults Waiver Program. Ms. Brown appealed to the Department\u2019s Board of Review (\u201cBoard\u201d). The Board held a hearing and thereafter issued an order affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision and adopting the \u201cFindings of Fact and Conclusion of the Law set forth therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Ms. Brown sought judicial review. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City, following a hearing, reversed the Board\u2019s decision. The circuit court ruled from the bench that the ALJ and the Board applied the incorrect standard for determining Ms. Brown\u2019s medical eligibility to participate in the Older Adults Waiver Program. The court identified what it believed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>to be the correct eligibility standard, applied that standard to the facts developed at the hearing before the ALJ, and concluded that Ms. Brown \u201cis eligible for an adult waiver.\u201d The court then issued a written order reversing the decision of the Board and finding Ms. Brown eligible for benefits under the Older Adults Waiver Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The Department appeals the court\u2019s decision and presents two questions, which we have reworded slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">I. Did the ALJ, as affirmed by the Board of Review, apply the proper legal standard in determining that Ms. Brown was ineligible for the health care services under the Older Adults Waiver Program?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">II. Was the ALJ\u2019s decision supported by substantial evidence in the record?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude, as did the circuit court, that the ALJ did not apply the proper legal standard in denying Ms. Brown\u2019s application for health-related assistance through the Older Adults Waiver Program. We disagree, however, with the circuit court\u2019s decision to apply what it believed to be the correct legal standard to the facts of Ms. Brown\u2019s case as they were developed at the evidentiary hearing before the ALJ. The proper standard, as we shall define it in this opinion, should be applied to Ms. Brown\u2019s case in the first instance at the agency level. Accordingly, we shall vacate the judgment of the circuit court and direct that the case be remanded to the Board, which, in turn, is directed to remand the case to the OAH for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">The principal issue raised by this appeal requires consideration, as a preliminary matter, of the structure of Maryland\u2019s Older Adults Waiver Program and how it fits within the overall Medicaid scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">A. <em>Medicaid and Maryland\u2019s Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">Medicaid is a joint federal-state program established by Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 <em>et seq. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>(2000).

The HCBS permits participating states to apply for a waiver from the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) to fund community-based services, \u201cpursuant to a written plan of care to individuals with respect to whom there has been a determination that but for the provision of such services the individuals would require the level of care provided in a hospital or nursing facility ... the cost of which could be reimbursed under the State plan.\u201d 42 U.S.C. ,\u00a7 1396n(c)(l); <em>see </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.217.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The Older Adults Waiver Program, at the center of the present appeal, is one such program authorized by the HCBS.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">B. <em>The Older Adults Waiver Program</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">We have said that, by participating in Medicaid, MAP must provide Medicaid recipients with, among other services, \u201cnursing facility services.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(a)(4)(A).

Ascertaining that level of care is the central focus of this appeal. Bearing in mind that no participating state\u2019s Medicaid program may establish more restrictive eligibility requirements than those set by federal law, we look to the Medicaid statute and related regulations that establish the required level of care as the benchmark for eligibility under Maryland\u2019s plan. The level of care required for receipt of Medicaid nursing facility care is found in the federal statutory and regulatory provisions that define the terms \u201cnursing facility\u201d and \u201cnursing facility services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Beginning in the 1970s, the Medicaid program provided benefits for nursing home services at both the \u201cskilled\u201d level of nursing care and at what was known as the \u201cintermediate\u201d level of nursing care. Congress eliminated the distinction between skilled level of nursing care and intermediate level of nursing care in 1987, when it enacted the Nursing Home Reform Law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(a).

Rather, in some instances, the services need only require \u201cthe supervision of nursing personnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">The Code of Federal Regulations contains two definitions of \u201cnursing facility services.\u201d One regulation evidently pertains to services that are provided at facilities addressed in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(a)(l)(A), essentially \u201cskilled level care,\u201d and the other pertains to services that are provided at facilities addressed in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(a)(l)(C), \u201cintermediate level care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>The regulation that addresses skilled level care, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.40(a)(i), describes skilled nursing services as those that are \u201c[n]eeded on a daily basis and required to be provided on an inpatient basis under \u00a7\u00a7 409.31 through 409.35 of this chapter.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 409.31(a)(2)-(3) in turn defines \u201cskilled services\u201d as those that \u201c[r]equire the skills of technical or professional personnel such as registered nurses [or] licensed practical (vocational) nurses ... furnished directly by, or under the supervision of, such personnel,\u201d on a daily basis. The second regulation defining \u201cnursing facility services,\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.155, addresses the \u201cintermediate\u201d level of care described in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(a)(l)(C). 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.155 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">(a) \u201cNursing facility services, other than in an institution for mental diseases means services provided in a facility that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">(1) Fully meets the requirements for a State license to provide, on a regular basis, health-related services to individuals who do not require hospital care, but whose mental or physical condition requires services that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">(i) Are above the level of room and board; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">(ii) Can be made available only through institutional facilities^]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Plainly, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.155 does not require involvement of, or service provided by, skilled or trained medical personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">The parties are in apparent agreement that the nursing facility level of care that Ms. Brown claims to require for admission into Maryland\u2019s Older Adults Waiver Program (which we shall discuss next) is the level of care addressed by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(a)(l)(C) and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.155. That level of nursing care is not \u201cskilled nursing care,\u201d but, rather, what used to be described in the federal law as \u201cintermediate\u201d nursing facility level of care. That is, Ms. Brown seeks to qualify under Maryland\u2019s Older Adults Waiver Program as needing, \u201con a regular basis, health-related care and services to individuals who because of their mental or physical condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>tion require care and services (above the level of room and board) which can be made available to them only through institutional facilities----\u201d42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(a)(1)(C); <em>see </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.155.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">C. <em>Maryland\u2019s Regulations on the Subject</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Since Maryland began participating in Medicaid, it has been required to provide nursing facility services. The definition of \u201cnursing facility\u201d set forth in Maryland regulations is, not surprisingly, virtually identical to the federal definition provided in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(a)(l)(A)-(C). Set forth in COMAR 10.09.10.01B(30)(a), \u201cnursing facility\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">an institution which is primarily engaged in providing to residents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">(i) Skilled nursing care and related services for residents who require medical or nursing care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">(ii) Rehabilitation sendees for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-11\">(iii) On a regular basis, health-related care and services to individuals who, because of their mental or physical condition, require care and services (above the level of room and board) which can be made available to them only through institutional facilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">Maryland\u2019s definition of \u201cnursing' facility services\u201d is found at COMAR 10.09.10.01B(31). Like the Maryland regulation defining \u201cnursing facility,\u201d and indeed, like the definition of \u201cnursing facility services\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(f), the Maryland regulation defining nursing facility services incorporates all three forms of services provided at nursing facilities: skilled nursing care, rehabilitation services, and, relevant to this case, intermediate level of care. COMAR 10.09.10.01B(31) describes those services as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A94O\">services provided to individuals who do not require hospital care, but who, because of their mental or physical condition, require skilled nursing care and related services, rehabilitation services, <em>or, on a regular basis, health-related care and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>services (above the level of room and board) which can be made available to them only through institutional facilities under the supervision of licensed health care professionals.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnU\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">The portion of COMAR 10.09.10.01B(31) that we have emphasized, unlike 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(a)(l)(C) and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.155, requires that the health-related care and services at the intermediate level of care be provided <em>under the supervision of licensed health care professionals. </em>Furthermore, to the extent that the Maryland regulation governing nursing facility services seeks to parrot 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(f) (defining \u201cnursing facility services\u201d), we see that it does not. Whereas the Maryland regulation requires that the intermediate level of care be provided <em>under the supervision of licensed health care professionals, </em>the federal statute provides that the health-related care need only require \u201cthe supervision of nursing personnel.\u201d And certainly, the federal regulation governing nursing facility services at the intermediate level of care does not require that the care be provided under the supervision of a licensed health care provider <em>on a daily basis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">D. <em>Maryland\u2019s Older Adults Waiver Program</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Before 1999, Maryland had a Medicaid waiver program for older adults, which was limited to providing nursing facility services in nursing homes. Then, in 1999, the General Assembly enacted SB 593, requiring the Department to submit an application, under the Older Adults Waiver Program provided by the HCBS, to permit Maryland to allow eligible applicants to obtain nursing facility services at home or in a community-based assisted living facility. The testimony of the bill\u2019s sponsor, Senator Paula Hollinger, before the House Environmental Matters Committee, sets the stage for understanding the purpose of that legislation. We quote part of that testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">The bill that I am submitting to you today directs the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to apply to the Federal Health Care Financing Administration for an amendment to Maryland\u2019s Home and Community Based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Waiver that will expand eligible services in the community for our Medicaid eligible population.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\">The bill will allow citizens who have spent down their financial resources and who are in need of nursing facility services to qualify not only for skilled care in the community, but for an intermediate level of care as well. Many people prefer to remain in their home or in assisted living facilities in their communities and should not be forced to enter nursing homes in order to be eligible for Medicaid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">This bill ... clarifies the definition of intermediate level of care for those whose need for assistance falls short of the skilled level of nursing care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">Intermediate level of care includes health related care and services to individuals who do not require hospital or skilled level of nursing facility care, but whose mental, physical, functional, or cognitive condition requires health services that are above the level of room and board, are provided on a regular basis, and can be made available through institutional facilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">SB 593 was enacted into law. Codified at Maryland Code (1994 Repl.Vol., 1999 Supp.), \u00a7 15-132 of the Health General Article (\u201cHG\u201d), the statute authorized the Department to seek approval from the Health Care Finance Administration (HCFA), now CMS, for the State\u2019s Older Adults Waiver Program. The statute had, at the time, three principal subsections. Subsection (a) established the standard for level of care for the waiver program. Subsection (b) required the Department to submit a new waiver application by August 1, 1999. What was then subsection (c) (now subsection(d)), directed the Department to include five specific items in the subsection (b) waiver application. Those items are now listed in (d)(1) through (5).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subsequent amendments to HG \u00a7 15-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>132 have caused the renumbering of the subsections that are pertinent to this opinion. For convenience, we shall hereinafter refer to the subsections as they are numbered in the most recent version of HG \u00a7 15-132, found in the 2005 Replacement Volume of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Subsection (b) of HG \u00a7 15-132 requires the Department to submit an application for a home and community-based services waiver for individuals who are \u201cmedically and functionally impaired.\u201d The phrase \u201cmedically and functionally impaired\u201d is defined in subsection (a)(10) as meaning \u201can individual who is assessed by the Department to require services provided by a nursing facility as defined in this section, and who, but for the receipt of these services, would require admission to a nursing facility within 30 days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Subsection (a)(ll) of HG \u00a7 15-132 defines \u201cnursing facility.\u201d Despite the elimination in federal law of the distinction between \u201cskilled nursing care\u201d and \u201cintermediate level of care,\u201d the statute defines \u201cnursing facility\u201d to include facilities that provide services to individuals requiring an \u201cintermediate level of care.\u201d Subsection (a)(ll) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">(i) \u201cNursing facility\u201d means a facility that provides skilled nursing care and related services, rehabilitation services, and health related care and services above the level of room and board needed on a regular basis in accordance with \u00a7 1919 of the federal Social Security Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">(ii) \u201cNursing facility\u201d includes a facility that provides services to individuals certified as requiring an intermediate level of care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">\u201cIntermediate level of care\u201d is defined in HG \u00a7 15-132(a)(9) as follows: \u201cIntermediate level of care,\u201d for purposes of paragraph (ll)(ii) of this subsection, includes health related care and services provided to individuals who do not require hospital or a skilled level of nursing facility care but whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>mental, physical, functional, or cognitive condition requires health services that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">(i) Are above the level of room and board;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">(ii) Are provided on a regular basis at least 5 days in a 7-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">day period; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">(iii) Can be made available to the individuals through institutional facilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">Although the definitions in subsection (a) were not explicitly conditioned on CMS approval, they were tied to the waiver program sought under then subsection (c) (now an subsection (d)) to extend to eligible older adults home care or community-based assisted living services in lieu of nursing home placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">We have said that the controversy in the present case centers on whether Ms. Brown satisfies the medical eligibility requirements, under Maryland\u2019s Older Adults Waiver Program, for the intermediate level of care. The dispute more particularly concerns whether the Department has set the standard for intermediate-level-of-care eligibility higher than federal law, and, for that matter, state law, permits. Ms. Brown argues that the Department has set the bar higher than the law permits. The Department insists that it has not. Before addressing that dispute, we turn to the facts concerning Ms. Brown that were developed at the administrative proceedings. We also trace in greater detail the procedural history of the case that brings us to this juncture.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">II. <em>This Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">Ms. Brown was born on September 13, 1922. She suffers from multiple medical conditions, including Alzheimer\u2019s Dementia, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, elevated cholesterol levels, hypertension, bilateral cataracts, and a benign brain tumor. On April 13, 2005, Ms. Brown, with the help of her daughter, Diane Byus, applied for home and community-based services under Maryland\u2019s Older Adults Waiver Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">At the time of her application, Ms. Brown was alert and oriented to person but was only partially oriented to time and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>place. Ms. Brown was prescribed to take up to seven oral medications and various supplements, almost all of which were prescribed to be taken on a daily basis. She required assistance in taking her medications as well as using the telephone, managing money, and housekeeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">By letter dated May 4, 2005, the Department informed Ms. Brown that her application for the Older Adults Waiver Program was denied because she did not satisfy the standard for medical eligibility (it is undisputed that she satisfies the standard of financial eligibility). Ms. Brown appealed the Department\u2019s decision to the OAH.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">On August 23, 2005, an evidentiary hearing was conducted before an ALJ to determine Ms. Brown\u2019s eligibility for the Older Adults Waiver Program.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ms. Byus, a registered nurse, testified at the hearing on her mother\u2019s behalf. Ms. Byus testified that she brought her mother to her home in April 2003 because Ms. Brown was unable to live alone. Ms. Byus explained that she could not leave her mother unsupervised while she worked because her mother \u201cwouldn\u2019t drink, she wouldn\u2019t take meds, she wouldn\u2019t eat right.\u201d Ms. Byus testified that Ms. Brown also has problems with wandering, no short term memory, difficulty making decisions, and poor processing and judgment skills. Ms. Byus stated that she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>difficulty finding reliable in-home care for Ms. Brown, and, in April 2004, she placed Ms. Brown in an assisted living facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Ms. Byus testified that Ms. Brown sees her primary care physician, Dr. Donna Chambers, every three months unless she requires more frequent attention. Ms. Byus stated that Ms. Brown most recently met with Dr. Chambers on June 27, 2005, who supported the notion that Ms. Brown should be in a nursing facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">During Ms. Byus\u2019s testimony, counsel for Ms. Brown offered into evidence medical records from Dr. Chambers. The records included a comprehensive history, a physical exam, a health care practitioner physical assessment, prescribed medication treatment orders, and physician orders. Counsel for the Department stipulated to the admissibility and authenticity of the medical records. The ALJ also admitted into evidence, without objection by counsel for the Department, Ms. Brown\u2019s medical records from a physical examination with Dr. Chambers that took place on March 15, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Counsel for Ms. Brown then offered into evidence a medical report from a physical examination with Dr. Chambers on June 27, 2005, over two months after the Department reviewed Ms. Brown\u2019s application to the waiver program. Counsel for the Department objected to the admission of the report on the ground that the examination took place after the Department\u2019s consideration of Ms. Brown\u2019s application. The ALJ sustained the objection, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">If you [Ms. Brown] wish to provide [the medical record] to Dr. Friedman or the Department of Health after this hearing, then obviously you\u2019re free to do so. But my understanding of my task is that it is to determine whether the decision that has already been made based on the information that the Department was provided at the time of the decision was correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Counsel for Ms. Brown also sought to have admitted into evidence a letter from Dr. Chambers, dated June 28, 2005, which provided that Ms. Brown needed assistance with \u201call activities of daily living\u201d and that she \u201cwould be a danger to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>herself if left unsupervised.\u201d Counsel for the Department objected to the admission of the letter, again on the ground that it was dated two months after Ms. Brown\u2019s application was considered. The ALJ admitted the letter, stating that it was unclear to her whether the statements contained in the letter referred to Ms. Brown\u2019s condition at the time her application was reviewed or her current condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Counsel for Ms. Brown then sought to have admitted a second letter from Dr. Chambers, dated August 18, 2005. The letter stated that Ms. Brown, in Dr. Chambers\u2019s opinion, required placement in a \u201cskilled nursing facility.\u201d Counsel for the Department objected on the grounds that the letter was dated after Ms. Brown\u2019s application was considered, and Dr. Chambers was not available for cross-examination, rendering it unreliable hearsay. The ALJ overruled the objection, reasoning that counsel for the Department waived the objection by not making it with regard to any previously admitted documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Barbara Best, a registered nurse for the Delmarva Foundation for Medical Care (\u201cDelmarva\u201d), also testified at the hearing before the ALJ. She explained that Delmarva reviews applications from individuals seeking Medicaid services through the State, and that she has reviewed applications for long-term care for Delmarva for seventeen years. Ms. Best described the process of applying for the Older Adults Waiver Program. She explained that an applicant first fills out the required paperwork, which is then reviewed by a nurse. If the nurse denies the application, the application is sent to a physician advisor for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Dr. Barry Friedman, medical director of the long-term care and waiver services section of the Department, testified at the hearing. The ALJ received him as an expert in the area of general medicine. Dr. Friedman testified that an applicant is eligible for the Older Adults Waiver Program in one of three ways: if the applicant: (1) has a \u201cskilled nursing need,\u201d which requires, on a daily basis, the hands-on activity of a nurse or a physician; (2) requires physical therapy or rehabilitative ther<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>apy, ordered by a physician and performed by a licensed therapist, five days per week; or (3) requires \u201chealth-related services above the level of room and board that could only be provided in an institutional setting under licensed health care professionals.\u201d Dr. Friedman testified that applicants must require the \u201chealth-related services\u201d on a \u201cregular\u201d basis, which he testified \u201chas a long-standing interpretation of daily basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Dr. Friedman testified that applicants for the Older Adults Waiver Program are initially put on a waiting list. Once an applicant reaches the top of the list, the Department conducts an assessment to determine the applicant\u2019s eligibility for a waiver. He testified that, when he conducts an assessment, he \u201cmust consider the medical conditions at the time of the application.\u201d He stated that Department policy prevents him from considering evidence of an applicant\u2019s medical condition that post-dates the date of application.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Dr. Friedman reviewed Ms. Brown\u2019s application on April 13, 2005. He considered the application, the intensive physical done a year before, and the AER nurse\u2019s evaluation. Dr. Friedman testified that Ms. Brown \u201cclearly did not meet any of the three criteria that I\u2019ve explained, the three levels, where I could give a level. Therefore, I could not overrule the physicians and nurses at the Delmarva Foundation, and I upheld the decision to deny.\u201d Dr. Friedman further testified that \u201cjust the use of a caretaker or custodial care\u201d does not medically qualify a person for the program. He read at the hearing the June 2005 and August 2005 letters submitted by Dr. Chambers, finding them inconsistent with application information and not grounds sufficient to warrant a change in opinion. He concluded that Ms. Brown did not meet the nursing facility level of care necessary for acceptance into the Older Adults Waiver Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Counsel for the Department argued in closing that the standard of eligibility for nursing facility services is \u201cwhether or not a person needs licensed health care professionals on a daily basis.\u201d Counsel further argued that Ms. Brown \u201cdoes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>not have any needs that rise to the level of needing a nurse or some sort of health care practitioner, licensed health care practitioner, on a daily basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">On October 5, 2005, the ALJ issued a written decision upholding the Department\u2019s denial of Ms. Brown\u2019s application to the Older Adults Waiver Program. The ALJ set forth the standard of care that, in her view, an applicant must require to qualify for the Waiver Program. The ALJ wrote: \u201cThe evidence fully supports that [Ms. Brown] can use the assistance and supervision provided to her in an assisted-living facility. The question to be addressed in this case, however, is whether [Ms. Brown\u2019s] needs require <em>skilled nursing facility </em>level of care.\u201d The ALJ continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">In order to receive the level of care requested by the Appellant, an applicant would have to require either skilled nursing care, such as daily injections, surgical dressing changes, or tube feedings; rehabilitative services, such as occupational, physical, or speech/language therapy; or some sort of health related services, above the simple provision of room and board, that can only be provided by a licensed professional, such as monitoring of an individual frequently in and out of congestive heart failure. Custodial services, such as help with activities of daily living (\u201cADLs\u201d) or medication management, are not sufficient on their own to qualify for services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The ALJ concluded that, although Ms. Brown requires custodial care and supervision, she does not need twenty-four-hour supervision by licensed health-care professionals. The ALJ determined that Ms. Brown\u2019s medical needs were not \u201csevere enough to merit provision in an institutional setting.\u201d Concluding that Ms. Brown \u201cdoes not require a nursing facility level of care,\u201d the ALJ ruled that Ms. Brown is \u201cnot medically eligible to receive reimbursement for nursing facility services from the Medical Assistance Program under COMAR 10.09.10.01B(31).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The ALJ decided that the two letters from Dr. Chambers, dated June 28, 2005 and August 18, 2005, were \u201cnot sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>to rebut Dr. Friedman\u2019s testimony.\u201d The ALJ concluded that the- June 28, 2005 letter, in which Dr. Chambers wrote that Ms. Brown would be a danger to herself if left unsupervised, did not demonstrate that Ms. Brown required a skilled nursing level of care. The ALJ also concluded that the August 18, 2005 letter, in which Dr. Chambers opined that Ms. Brown required a skilled nursing facility level of care, was \u201ctoo conclusory to overcome the live testimony and documentary evidence opposing this opinion.\u201d We shall discuss those evidentiary rulings later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Ms. Brown took an appeal to the Board. Following a hearing on January 26, 2006, the Board adopted the ALJ\u2019s \u201cFindings of Fact and Conclusion of the Law set forth [in the written decision].\u201d Ms. Brown sought judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. The case was subsequently transferred to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, at the request of Ms. Brown, who at the time was a party to a related declaratory judgment action in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">On August 4, 2006, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City held a hearing on the matter. The Department acknowledged that the ALJ mistakenly referred to \u201cskilled nursing care\u201d as the standard for medical eligibility for the Older Adults Waiver Program. The Department nonetheless defended the standard applied by the ALJ, arguing that Ms. Brown properly was denied benefits because she did not require medical care on a daily basis \u201cperformable only by a licensed professional.\u201d Counsel added: \u201cThe standard for requiring medical administration services that are professional is that you\u2019re unstable, that you need to be monitored closely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Ms. Brown argued that the Department, the ALJ, and the Board had set the eligibility standard too high by requiring a showing that she needed monitoring on a daily basis by a licensed health care provider. Ms. Brown argued that the standard for \u201cintermediate care\u201d set forth in HG \u00a7 15-132(a)(9) was the proper standard for eligibility under the waiver program, and she qualified under that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>The circuit court agreed with Ms. Brown. Ruling from the bench, the court concluded that the ALJ applied the incorrect legal standard in assessing Ms. Brown\u2019s eligibility for the waiver program. The court further ruled, based on the factual findings by the ALJ, that Ms. Brown was eligible for services through the Older Adults Waiver Program, by application of the definitions in HG \u00a7 15-132(a) of \u201cnursing facility,\u201d and \u201cintermediate level of care.\u201d The court also ruled that the ALJ erred in discounting evidence provided by Dr. Chambers and in failing to apply the facts adduced at trial to the appropriate standard of eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">When asked by the Department at the close of the hearing to consider remanding the case to the OAH so that the ALJ could apply the proper eligibility standard to the facts of Ms. Brown\u2019s case, the court declined, stating: \u201cThey [the Board] already had their shot to essentially internally remand, and they elected not to do that and, I believe, in exercising my discretion, I think it would be more appropriate to reverse than to remand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">III. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The appellate courts review an administrative agency\u2019s decision under the same standards as does the circuit court. <em>Miller v. Comptroller of Maryland, </em>398 Md. 272, 280, 920 A.2d 467 (2007). \u201cA court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow, it is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280, 920 A.2d 467 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">We review the agency\u2019s decision on the facts by application of the substantial evidence test. <em>Cornfeld v. State Bd. of Physicians, </em>174 Md.App. 456, 468-69, 921 A.2d 893 (2007). \u201cThat test requires us to affirm an agency decision, if, after reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>agency, we find a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Md. State Bd. of Physicians v. Eist, </em>176 Md.App. 82, 114, 932 A.2d 783 (2007) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). It is within the province of the agency, not us, to resolve conflicting evidence and draw inferences from that evidence. <em>Id. </em>The agency\u2019s decision \u201ccarries with it a presumption of correctness and validity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">We give some deference to an agency\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Miller, </em>398 Md. at 281, 920 A.2d 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The <em>Miller </em>Court said, in that regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">\u201cEven with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Maryland Aviation Admin. v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 572, 873 A.2d 1145 (2005)) (some citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Such deference, however, does not preclude us from reviewing the agency\u2019s legal conclusions and correcting them if they are wrong:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">\u201cWith respect to an agency\u2019s conclusions of law, we have often stated that a court reviews <em>de novo </em>for correctness. We frequently give weight to an agency\u2019s experience in interpretation of a statute that it administers, but it is always within our prerogative to determine whether an agency\u2019s conclusions of law are correct, and to remedy them if wrong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-10\"><em>Miller, </em>398 Md. at 282, 920 A.2d 467 (quoting <em>Schwartz v. Maryland Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 534, 554, 870 A.2d 168 (2005)). Put another way: \u201c[EJven though an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is often persuasive, the reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>court must apply the law as it understands it to be.\u201d <em>Christopher v. Montgomery County Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>381 Md. 188, 198, 849 A.2d 46 (2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">IV. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The Department asks us to reinstate the decision of the Board upholding the denial of Ms. Brown\u2019s application for the Older Adults Waiver Program. The Department argues that the Board did not err in adopting the ALJ\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions. In its first (and principal) contention, the Department insists that the ALJ applied the correct legal standard for determining the level of care required for medical eligibility for the waiver program. In its second contention, the Department argues that the ALJ correctly discounted the June 27, 2005 physical examination report by Ms. Brown\u2019s personal physician, Dr. Chambers. The Department asserts that the ALJ correctly determined that, because the information contained in the report post-dated the Department\u2019s denial of Ms. Brown\u2019s application to the Waiver Program by approximately two months, the document was irrelevant to the question of whether the Department correctly denied the application. We shall consider each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">A. Did the ALJ apply the correct legal standard for determining medical eligibility for the Older Adults Waiver Program?</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">We begin our assessment of this issue by repeating that neither party asserts that Ms. Brown requires skilled nursing care. Indeed, the Department acknowledged at the hearing before the circuit court that the ALJ had mistakenly used the word \u201cskilled\u201d in her written decision. The parties further agree that, for Ms. Brown to be medically eligible for the Older Adults Waiver Program, she must require a level of care that is provided at Medicaid nursing facilities. The parties disagree, however, on the precise level of care provided at nursing facilities that an individual must require in order to qualify for participation in the Older Adults Waiver Pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>gram. They further disagree about whether HG \u00a7 15-132 is even relevant to the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Ms. Brown asserts that HG \u00a7 15 \u2014 132(a)(9) and (11) define the level of care needed to satisfy the medical eligibility requirement for admission into Maryland\u2019s Older Adults Waiver Program because that is the specific level of care described by the General Assembly in seeking approval from HCFA (now CMS) to establish the waiver. For convenience, we repeat the relevant portions of HG \u00a7 15-132(a)(9) and (11). Subsection (a)(ll) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">(i) \u201cNursing facility\u201d means a facility that provides skilled nursing care and related services, rehabilitation services, and health related care and services above the level of room and board needed on a regular basis in accordance with \u00a7 1919 of the federal Social Security Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">(ii) \u201cNursing facility\u201d includes a facility that provides services to individuals certified as requiring an intermediate level of care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Subsection (a)(9) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">\u201cIntermediate level of care,\u201d for purposes of paragraph (ll)(ii) of this subsection, includes health related care and services provided to individuals who do not require hospital or a skilled level of nursing facility care but whose mental, physical, functional, or cognitive condition requires health services that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">(i) Are above the level of room and board;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">(ii) Are provided on a regular basis at least 5 days in a 7-day period; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">(iii) Can be made available to the individuals through institutional facilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">The Department argues that HG \u00a7 15-132(a) only provided definitions for terms used in subsequent subsections of that section, and those provisions were not intended to establish, and do not establish, the level of nursing facility services needed for admission to the Older Adults Waiver Program. The Department insists that the medical eligibility standard for the nursing facility level of care required for admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>into the Waiver Program is the standard that is spelled out in COMAR 10.09.10.01B(31) (defining nursing facility services). We repeat that regulation, for convenience: \u201cNursing facility services\u201d are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">services provided to individuals who do not require hospital care, but who, because of their mental or physical condition, require skilled nursing care and related services, rehabilitation services, or, <em>on a regular basis, health-related care and services (above the level of room and board) which can be made available to them only through institutional facilities under the supervision of licensed health care professionals.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae4C\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The Department argues that COMAR 10.09.10.01B(31) \u201ccombines attributes formerly divided between a \u2018skilled nursing facility\u2019 and an \u2018intermediate care facility,\u2019 by parroting the language of [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(a)(l)(C) ],\u201d and is identical to the federal standard for nursing facility level of care. We disagree. We have pointed out that 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.155, which is the federal regulation concerning nursing facility services at the intermediate level of care, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(a)(l)(C), which defines nursing facility care at the intermediate level of care, do not require direct involvement of, or even supervision by, licensed health care professionals. Neither does the statutory definition of \u201cnursing facility services,\u201d set forth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396(d)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">As we see it, COMAR 10.09.10.01B(31) is written broadly to include all three levels of care that, since 1990, come within the meaning of \u201cnursing facility services.\u201d We believe that the inclusion of the phrase \u201cunder the supervision of licensed health care professionals,\u201d relates not to the level of care but to the requirement that all nursing facilities be staffed with the requisite number of licensed health care professionals necessary to care for residents at those facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">But even if we are wrong in that regard, it remains that Maryland cannot set a higher bar for eligibility under the Older Adults Waiver Program than is prescribed by the federal government. <em>See Alexander, </em>469 U.S. at 289 n. 1, 105 S.Ct. 712; <em>Jackson, </em>369 Md. at 595-96, 801 A.2d 1034. As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>have noted, nowhere that we can discern in the federal law is it required that the intermediate level of care be \u201cunder the supervision of licensed health care professionals.\u201d If, as the Department seems to be urging, Maryland\u2019s regulation governing nursing facility services requires that all levels of care (not just skilled care) be performed under the supervision of a licensed health care professional, then it is more restrictive than federal law and cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">We conclude that HG \u00a7 15-132(a)(9) sets forth the federal standard for intermediate level of care. It is the standard that the General Assembly adopted for waiver services at the intermediate level of care, and, to the extent that it differs from COMAR 10.09.10.01B(31), it controls over the regulation. <em>See Comptroller of the Treasury v. Citicorp Int\u2019l Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>389 Md. 156, 180, 884 A.2d 112 (2005); <em>Cecil County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Russell, </em>159 Md.App. 594, 611, 861 A.2d 92 (2004). Our conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the definition set forth in HG \u00a7 15-132(a)(9) for intermediate level of care is entirely consistent with the definition of nursing facility care in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(a)(l)(C) and the regulation governing nursing facility services at the intermediate level of care in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.155.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">We therefore hold that the standard that the Department must follow in determining medical eligibility for the Older Adults Waiver Program for an applicant who needs intermediate care is the standard reflected in the definition of intermediate level of care in HG \u00a7 15-132(a)(9). Under that standard, the applicant need only require \u201chealth related care and services\u201d; \u201cabove the level of room and board\u201d; that are \u201cprovided on a regular basis at least 5 days in a 7-day period\u201d; and \u201c[c]an be made available to the individuals through institutional facilities.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Department did not ask the ALJ to apply that standard, and the ALJ certainly did not apply that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>We agree with Ms. Brown (and therefore with the circuit court) that the ALJ applied the incorrect legal standard when assessing whether the Department mistakenly found Ms. Brown to be medically ineligible for the waiver program. The Board\u2019s decision adopting the ALJ\u2019s conclusions of law must therefore be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">But, unlike the circuit court, we shall not endeavor to apply to the particulars of Ms. Brown\u2019s case the correct standard for assessing medical eligibility at the intermediate nursing facility level of care. That is the job, in the first instance, of the agency, not us. <em>See Belvoir Farms Homeowners Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. North, </em>355 Md. 259, 270, 734 A.2d 227 (1999) (\u201cGenerally, when an administrative agency utilizes an erroneous standard and some evidence exists, however minimal, that could be considered appropriately under the correct standard, the case should be remanded so the agency can reconsider the evidence using the correct standard.\u201d). We therefore shall vacate the judgment of the circuit court and remand the case with the direction that the court vacate the decision of the Board and remand the case to the Board, for further remand to the OAH for application of the proper legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">B. Did the ALJ err in discounting evidence relating to Ms. Brown\u2019s physical condition post-dating the review of the Department\u2019s denial of her waiver application?</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The circuit court ruled that \u201cthe ALJ also erred in discounting the evidence provided by Dr. Chambers and by failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>apply the facts as set forth by Dr. Chambers, as well as those provided through other medical records introduced into evidence, to the appropriate standard of eligibility.\u201d The Department disagrees with the circuit court\u2019s assessment of the ALJ\u2019s evidentiary rulings. The Department claims that the ALJ considered all of the medical evidence that was <em>properly </em>before it and that the evidence presented at the hearing supports, by substantial evidence, the ALJ\u2019s determination that Ms. Brown did not meet the nursing facility level of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Because we have concluded that the ALJ erred in affirming the Department\u2019s denial of Ms. Brown\u2019s application, we need not ascertain whether the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. For the benefit of the Board and the ALJ on remand, we shall address the Department\u2019s argument that the ALJ, when reviewing the Department\u2019s denial of Ms. Brown\u2019s application for the Older Adults Waiver Program, properly declined to consider evidence of Ms. Brown\u2019s medical condition post-dating the review of her waiver application.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The Department does not contest that Ms. Brown was entitled to an administrative hearing to review the Department\u2019s denial of her waiver application. Indeed, the Department directs us to COMAR 10.01.04.02, which provides for a \u201cfair hearing.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 4. The Department does argue, however, that services rendered through the Older Adults Waiver Program, unlike services to which a state Medicaid plan recipient is entitled, are not subject to the same Medicaid fair hearing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Ms. Brown responds that the ALJ was obligated to conduct a hearing that includes consideration of all evidence relevant to her eligibility for the Older Adults Waiver Program. She argues that the State has similar due process obligations in determining eligibility for the Waiver Program as it does when determining eligibility for mandatory Medicaid benefits. As such, Ms. Brown argues, the ALJ erred in excluding the June 27, 2005 medical report on the ground that the examination took place after the Department assessed Ms. Brown\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Federal law requires states to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing to any individual whose application or claim for Medicaid is denied or not acted upon with reasonable promptness. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(3); <em>see also Albert S., </em>166 Md.App. at 748, 891 A.2d 402 (\u201cStates participating with the federal government in the Medicaid program are required to provide applicants who have been denied benefits an opportunity for a fair hearing and a final decision of the matter.\u201d). A Medicaid fair hearing must meet the due process requirements set forth in <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970). <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.205; <em>see generally Goldberg, </em>397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (requiring, <em>inter alia, </em>the opportunity to be heard, an opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, and that the decision to a recipient\u2019s eligibility rest solely on the legal rules and evidence adduced at the hearing). \u201cFederal and state regulations further require that, upon consideration of all of the evidence presented at a fair hearing, the AL J must render a final decision as to a person\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid.\u201d <em>Albert S., </em>166 Md.App. at 748-49, 891 A.2d 402 (citations omitted); <em>see </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 431.244(a). Assuming the sufficiency of the evidence, it is the AL J\u2019s obligation to render a decision on the merits concerning an applicant\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid. <em>Albert S., </em>166 Md.App. at 750, 891 A.2d 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u201c[W]hen a state elects to provide an optional service, that service becomes part of the state Medicaid plan and is subject to the requirements of federal law.\u201d <em>Doe 1-13 v. Chiles, </em>136 F.3d 709, 714 (11th Cir.1998) (citations omitted); <em>accord Bryson v. Shumway, </em>308 F.3d 79, 89 (1st Cir.2002); <em>Lewis v. N.M.

Therefore, as we see it, a state\u2019s obligation to comply with fair hearing requirements in federal and state law for an \u201coptional\u201d service such as the Older Adults Waiver Program is no less than the state\u2019s obligation when a \u201cmandatory\u201d service is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">COMAR \u00a7 10.01.04.06 sets forth the fair hearing requirements established under federal law for applicants who have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>been denied Medicaid services. Of particular relevance to the present case is Part D of the regulation, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqH\">When a hearing involves medical issues, such as those concerning a diagnosis, an examining physician\u2019s report or a medical review team\u2019s decision, an additional medical assessment of the appellant\u2019s condition shall be obtained and made part of the record if the hearing examiner considers it necessary. Any additional medical assessment shall be made by a person other than a person who made the original medical determination and shall be obtained at the Department\u2019s expense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">By including the requirement that \u201can additional medical assessment of the appellant\u2019s condition shall be obtained and made part of the record if the hearing examiner [i.e., the ALJ] considers it necessary,\u201d the Department has not limited the medical evidence at the hearing to the evidence that the Department considered in its review for medical eligibility. We recognized as much in <em>Albert S., </em>when we concluded that an individual who applies for Medicaid eligibility on the basis of disability is entitled to have the ALJ consider recent medical evidence that was not available to the medical experts on the State Review Team. <em>See </em>166 Md.App. at 748-50, 891 A.2d 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Because the ALJ was required to provide Ms. Brown with a full evidentiary hearing, she erred in excluding from evidence the June 27, 2005 medical report concerning Dr. Chambers\u2019s physical examination of Ms. Brown. The August 23, 2005 hearing before the ALJ was intended to provide Ms. Brown with the benefits of a full evidentiary hearing. <em>See id. </em>Contrary to the view of the ALJ, urged upon her by the Department, she was not limited in her review of the evidence to the record before the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">On remand from the circuit court, the Board shall vacate the decision of the ALJ and remand the case to the OAH for further proceedings. At those proceedings, the ALJ shall give appropriate consideration to the June 27, 2005 medical report of Dr. Chambers in deciding whether Ms. Brown satisfies the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>correct standard of medical eligibility for the Older Adults Waiver Program, as we have stated it in this opinion. Furthermore, to the extent that the ALJ discounted the June 28, 2005 and August 18, 2005 letters written by Dr. Chambers on behalf of Ms. Brown because they, like the June 27, 2005 report, post-dated the Department\u2019s review of Ms. Brown\u2019s application, the ALJ on remand should give appropriate consideration to those letters as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">JUDGMENT VACATED.
