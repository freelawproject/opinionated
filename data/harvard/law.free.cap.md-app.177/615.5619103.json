The Commissioners\u2019 Summary of this Act included the following highlights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">\u2022 Allows owners of investment securities to designate death beneficiaries when the issuers provide such a service to their customers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-10\">\u2022 Frees issuers of any liability for a good faith transfer to any beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-11\">\u2022 Preserves the rights of a deceased owner\u2019s creditors in securities that are transferred to any beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-12\">\u2022 Preserves a customer/owner\u2019s control over the securities, including the power to revoke any beneficiary designation, during the life of that customer/owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-13\">\u2022 Provides that TOD transfers are nontestamentary transfers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-14\">\u2022 Does for investment securities what POD (Pay on Death) statutes have done for cash accounts in almost every state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-15\">Section 9 of the Uniform Act, in pertinent part,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-16\">(c) A transferee ... is subject to liability to any probate estate of the decedent for allowed claims against that estate and statutory allowances to the decedent\u2019s spouse and children to the extent the estate is insufficient to satisfy those claims and allowances. The liability of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>... transferee may not exceed the value of [TOD] transfers received by that transferee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Clarke A. Gravel, Esq. of Burlington, Vermont, was on the Commissioners\u2019 Committee that drafted the Uniform Act. When Vermont adopted that Act, Mr. Gravel authored a Vermont Bar Journal article in which he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">Under the uniform law, the transfer-on-death form retains for the owner of the property (such as stocks, etc.) all control until the owner\u2019s death. The TOD designee has absolutely no power over the securities until that occurrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">Existing creditors\u2019 interests do not change. If a creditor had any interest in or to the assets of the deceased, those rights carry over to the new owner of the same assets. The new owner must satisfy the creditor\u2019s claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">In addition to protecting creditors\u2019 claims, the Act protects statutory allowances to the decedent\u2019s spouse and children to the extent the estate is insufficient to satisfy those claims and allowances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-9\">This Act provides an effective, efficient and thus useful tool for the probate practitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">Clarke A. Gravel, <em>The Uniform Transfer on Death Security Registration Act (No. 23, Acts of 1999), </em>25-SEP Vt. B.J. 14 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">The Vermont statute that was the subject of Mr. Gravel\u2019s article included the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-12\">(b) A transferee of a nonprobate transfer is subject to liability to any probate estate of the decedent for allowed claims against that estate and statutory allowances to the decedent\u2019s spouse and children to the extent the estate is insufficient to satisfy those claims and allowances. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>liability of a nonprobate transferee may not exceed the value of nonprobate transfers received by that transferee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABa\">West\u2019s Vermont Statutes Annotated, Title Nine, Part 5, Chapter 134, \u00a7 4359(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Maryland has adopted some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the provisions of the Uniform Act. Maryland TOD transfers are controlled in part by the Maryland Uniform TO D Security Registration Act (the Maryland Act), Title 16 of the Estates and Trusts Article. Although the Maryland Act does not include a provision similar to Section 9 of the Uniform Act, \u00a7 16 \u2014 109(b) provides that \u201c[t]his title does not limit the rights of creditors of security owners against beneficiaries and other transferees under other laws of this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Included in the legislative history of the Maryland Act, which took effect on October 1, 1994, is an article authored by Professor Richard V. Wellman of the University of Georgia Law School, in which Professor Wellman notes that \u201cthe valid contractual protections ... for the issuer of a TOD registration ... might not protect an account beneficiary against being compelled to make restitution to a deceased owner\u2019s creditor or spouse claiming the protection of a domiciliary law against the deceased owner\u2019s nonprobate gifts at death.\u201d In a 1987 Georgia Law Review article, Professor Wellman stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVU\">The effectiveness of a TOD directions against claims of a deceased registrant\u2019s creditors, the right of a registrant\u2019s spouse to elect against any will ... are untested against the will-like effect of a TOD registration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-7\"><em>Tmnsfer-On-Death Securities Registration: A New Title Form, </em>21 Ga.L.Rev. 789, 823-24 (1987). This appeal from the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County presents the question of whether the \u201cstatutory share\u201d of a decedent\u2019s surviving spouse includes the decedent\u2019s Transfer-On-Death (TOD) accounts. For the reasons that follow, we answer \u201cyes\u201d to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Two of the parties to this appeal \u2014 Kathleen Sexton Schoukroun (Kathleen), appellant/cross-appellee, and appellee/cross<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>appellant Bernadette Schoukroun (Bernadette) were married to the late Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun, who died on October 18, 2004. The third party to this appeal, Maryse L. Karsenty, is Mr. Schoukroun\u2019s sister and is the Personal Representative (PR) of his estate, which was opened in the Orphans\u2019 Court for Anne Arundel County on February 2, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Mr. Schoukroun and Bernadette were married on October 10, 1987. On April 20, 1990, Bernadette gave birth to their only child, Lauren Schoukroun. Mr. Schoukroun and Bernadette were divorced by a judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County that was entered on September 5, 1995. On June 23, 2004, Mr. Schoukroun (1) executed the final version of his Last Will and Testament, (2) created a revocable trust, the Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun Trust (hereinafter \u201cTrust\u201d), of which he was the trustee and settlor, and (3) transferred assets from three financial accounts into the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">In his will, Mr. Schoukroun designated his sister, Maryse L. Karsenty, appellee, the Personal Representative of his estate. Clause Three of the will stated: \u201cI give all my tangible personal property, together with any insurance providing coverage thereon, to my wife, KATHLEEN M. SEXTON, of Crofton, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland....\u201d In Clause Four, Mr. Schoukroun bequeathed the \u201crest, residue and remainder\u201d of his estate to the Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">When Mr. Schoukroun created the Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d), he named himself settlor and trustee, appointed appellee Maryse L. Karsenty trustee of the Trust upon his death,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and designated Lauren as the sole beneficiary of the Trust. Clause Two of the Trust, in pertinent part, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">The Settlor reserves the right to amend or terminate this trust from time to time by notice in writing delivered to the Trustee during the lifetime of the Settlor, and any amendment or termination shall be effective immediately upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>delivery thereof to the Trustee, except that changes with respect to the Trustee\u2019s duties, liabilities or compensation shall not be effective without its consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">On the same day that he created the Trust, Mr. Schoukroun transferred into the Trust assets that he held in three financial accounts: (1) E*Trade Financial Account Number 4607-7939,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) Fidelity Investments Account # Y94-061670,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (3) Fidelity Investments Account # Z75-163619.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">On July 12, 2004, Mr. Schoukroun made changes to two other investment accounts, Fidelity Investments Account # Y94-130192,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Fidelity Investments Account #475-549479,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> so that the Trust was listed as the beneficiary of the two accounts. Thus, these two accounts were to \u201ctransfer-on-death\u201d (TOD). At the time of Mr. Schoukroun\u2019s death, the assets of all five financial accounts totaled approximately $422,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">On November 2, 2004, Kathleen\u2019s lawyer sent a letter to Fidelity Investments stating that Kathleen</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">1) Claims an interest in the accounts and any other accounts in the name of the deceased or in the name of the Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>2) Objects to the implementation of the registration in beneficiary form, of the accounts and any other accounts in the name of the deceased or in the name of the Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">On February 2, 2005, the PR filed a Petition for Administration of Mr. Schoukroun\u2019s estate with the Register of Wills for Anne Arundel County, and was appointed the personal representative of the estate on the same day.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">On March 1, 2005, Kathleen filed an Election to Take Statutory Share of Mr. Schoukroun\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">On May 5, 2005, the PR filed an inventory of Mr. Schoukroun\u2019s estate with the Register of Wills for Anne Arundel County, in which the total value of the estate was appraised at $32,483.17. In the First Account of the estate, the PR recorded disbursements from the estate totaling $12,171.49, thus reducing the balance of the estate to $20,758.11.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">On March 22, 2005, Kathleen filed a \u201cCOMPLAINT FOR FRAUD ON MARITAL RIGHTS and to impose a Constructive Trust and COMPLAINT FOR CONSTRUCTIVE FRAUD\u201d against the PR and Bernadette (in Bernadette\u2019s capacity \u201cas custodian of Lauren Schoukroun[,] a minor child and trust beneficiary\u201d). Kathleen\u2019s complaint included the following assertions:</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">15. That as the Husband of the Plaintiff, Kathleen Sexton Schoukroun, Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun had both a legal and an equitable duty arising out of the marital relationship between the parties. A material part of said marital relationship was the trust and confidence placed by Kathleen Sexton Schoukroun in Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun, which trust and confidence was accepted by Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>16. That Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun, breached his legal and equitable duties and committed a fraud against the Plaintiff Kathleen Sexton Schoukroun, by his conveyance of all, or substantially all, of his assets to his revocable Trust during his lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">17. That the transfer by Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun of all or substantially all of his assets to the Trust was not a good faith transaction; it was a device to retain actual ownership, use and enjoyment of the property until death, and at the same time to defeat the right and interest of the Plaintiff under the law of descent and distribution in such property at death.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">18. The actions described in paragraphs 5-9 above were all done in fraud of the martial [sic] rights of Kathleen Sexton Schoukroun, the spouse of Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff prays:</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">A. That this Court enter its order, judgment and decree declaring that whatever right or claim that either of the defendants hold or asserts to the accounts, (and any other accounts similarly transferred to the Trust) and their proceeds, is held as a constructive trust for the benefit of Plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">B. That this Court further order, adjudge, and decree that the accounts (and any other accounts similarly transferred to the Trust) and their proceeds, were and are, an asset belonging to the Estate of Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun, deceased, and that the same was transferred and conveyed to the revocable Trust in fraud of the marital rights of the Plaintiff, Kathleen Sexton Schoukroun.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">Bernadette filed a Counterclaim that included the following assertions:</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">2. That the Counter-Plaintiff was married to Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun on October 10, 1987. As a result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>marriage, one child was born, namely Lauren R. Schoukroun, born on April 20,1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">3. That the Counter-Plaintiff and Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun were divorced on September 5, 1995 by virtue of a Judgment of Absolute Divorce entered on that date, a copy of which is attached hereto, labeled \u201cExhibit 1\u201d, and hereby incorporated herein by reference thereto. The Judgment Of Absolute Divorce incorporated, but did not merge, a Separation and Property Settlement Agreement which the Counter-Plaintiff and Mr. Schoukroun had entered into on August 21, 1994, a copy of which is attached hereto, labeled \u201cExhibit 2\u201d, and hereby incorporated herein by reference thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">5. That pursuant to the Separation and Property Settlement Agreement entered by and between the Counter-Plaintiff and Mr. Schoukroun, Paragraph 5 therein, entitled \u201cLife Insurance\u201d, provided as follows: \u201cThe parties each agree to maintain and keep in full force and effect life insurance policies in the amount of at least $150,000 on their lives wherein the irrevocable beneficiary is the minor child, with the other party, namely the Husband and Wife, as the trustee. In December of each year, the parties shall present to each other evidence of a paid current insurance policy with the above provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">6. That, upon information and belief, the said Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun did not have a policy of life insurance in effect at the time of his death naming his minor child, Lauren R. Schoukroun, as the irrevocable beneficiary. Instead, he had a policy of life insurance in effect in an amount equal to or greater than $150,000.00, naming his then surviving spouse, the Counter-Defendant, as the beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>7. That, upon the death of the said Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun, life insurance proceeds in an amount equal to or greater than $150,000.00 were paid to the Counter-Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">9. That the life insurance proceeds paid to the Counter-Defendant were paid in derogation [sic] of the obligation of Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun to maintain life insurance for the benefit of his minor daughter, Lauren R. Schoukroun.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">10. That to permit the Counter-Defendant to retain said life insurance proceeds would permit her to be unjustly enriched, and it would be inequitable for her to retain said proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">11. That the imposition of a constructive trust upon those insurance proceeds received by the Counter-Defendant, or those funds or assets created by, substituted for, purchased by or derived from said insurance proceeds is necessary to protect the interests in same by the minor child, Lauren, who has a higher equitable call on the property than does the Counter-Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">WHEREFORE, the Counter-Plaintiff prays:</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">A. That this Court enter an Order that $150,000.00 of the life insurance proceeds on the life of the late Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun paid to the Counter-Defendant (and/or those funds or assets derived therefrom) be held as a constructive trust for the benefit of the Counter-Plaintiff (on behalf of her minor child, Lauren R. Schoukroun);</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">B. That this Court further Order that $150,000.00 of the life insurance proceeds on the life of the late Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun paid to the Counter-Defendant (and/or those funds or assets derived therefrom) be transferred and surrendered to the Counter-Plaintiff (on behalf of her minor child, Lauren R. Schoukroun); and</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">C. For such other and further relief as the nature of her cause may require.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>On September 27, 2006, at the conclusion of a bench trial, the circuit court resolved Kathleen\u2019s claims against her and denied Bernadette\u2019s request for imposition of a constructive trust. The circuit court\u2019s on-the-record opinion included the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">The plaintiff, Kathleen Schoukroun, has sued requesting that I find that Mr. Gil\u00edes Schoukroun committed fraud on her marital estate, on her marital property, and requests that I impose a constructive trust on the funds being held by Ms. Karsenty, as trustee of the Gil\u00edes Schoukroun trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">In count two, she sues for constructive fraud on the part of Gil\u00edes Schoukroun with reference to the very same trust amounts and asks that I grant a judgment in the amount of $150,000....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">Let me tell you that I find as a matter of fact that there is no fraud on the part of Mr. Gil\u00edes Schoukroun in the creation of this trust, actual or even constructive fraud. I find no actual fraud whatsoever. And I find no constructive fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">I am impelled in that direction by a number of things. First of all, his actions took place at a time when he knew he was sick. He knew he was ill....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">So that when ... he sat down to draw this last will and testament and this trust, I have to find that he knew exactly what he was doing vis-\u00e1-vis his assets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">It is apparent that what he was doing was setting up a trust for Lauren, however you pronounce it.... Interestingly enough, when he drew both the trust and his will, he set up Ms. Karsenty as the trustee and the personal representative. But if she were unable to serve or declined to serve, he set up the plaintiff as the trustee and/or personal representative, which tells me that he certainly wasn\u2019t trying to defraud Ms. Sexton. In fact, quite the contrary, he was in reliance on her. He relied on her. He intended to rely on her if he had to, if it became necessary, if his sister couldn\u2019t serve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>It doesn\u2019t sound like the actions of somebody who is trying to defraud another. And everything I\u2019ve heard about this man, this estate, these trusts, imply or tells me that he was trying to cover all bases. He was trying to cover everybody. Now what he didn\u2019t do is, of course, he didn\u2019t take out an insurance policy that he was supposed to take out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\">But let me finish up. It is urged upon me that I find Knell versus Price in the Court of Appeals establishes a per se guideline for fraud in cases where one spouse disposes of their property by means of, in this case, a trust and, in setting up that trust, sets up a revocable trust, which gives them absolute control up through and to the time of their death, that that is per se a fraud upon the marital rights of their then-existing spouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">Now while I think that\u2019s what Judge Orth said in Knell versus Price, I think and I agree with Mr. Murnane that, while it may not be the clearest thing you can read, but he says I\u2019m talking about this case, I\u2019m talking about these facts. And the facts in that case were that Mr. Knell strawdeeded the property out and strawdeeded it back. And the net result was he ended up with a life estate in which he had reserved to himself the absolute powers of disposition up until the time of his death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">But I read that to refer to that case and that case alone, those facts and those facts alone. A deed, a deeded situation of real property. It is not real clear, but that\u2019s what I read.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">This is a case, however, of [a revocable] trust, a very common way of handling one\u2019s estate prior to death to avoid the testamentary laws, very common. I make no comment whatsoever on the anticipation of death, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s large enough to worry about, the anticipation of death. But the old CPA, he says, wait a minute, there\u2019s an anticipation of death, get our tax money. But I don\u2019t think this estate is large enough to get tax money out, so I don\u2019t think it makes that much difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Anyway, I don\u2019t think Knell versus Price controls this case. I do not think that the creation of a revocable trust to the benefit of one\u2019s child, and admittedly in derogation of the estate, and as a consequence of the wife, her one-third entitlement, is a per se act of fraud. If I\u2019m wrong in that, it should be very easy to reverse me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-4\">Also, as I said earlier, I reiterate I find no instance, of fraudulent conduct on the part of Mr. Schoukroun in dealing with Kathleen Sexton Schoukroun. So I decline \u2014 I find for all defendants in the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">Now I must address the counter-complaint. It is urged upon me that I should impose a constructive trust on funds being held by Ms. Sexton as a result of a life insurance policy that Mr. Schoukroun took out prior to their marriage. And she testified they had these discussions prior to their marriage, that they should have insurance. And he took his out in favor of her, and she took hers out in favor of her estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">And it is suggested that I should follow those funds, because they are, it is urged upon me, they are somehow in derogation or funds that should have belonged to Lauren. Well, admittedly, Lauren was entitled to an insurance policy in the amount of $150,000 by agreement between her mother and her father. I cannot find that without even commenting on the innocence of Ms. Sexton, she is obviously the innocent party. She had nothing to do with it one way or the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">But as Mr. Murnane points out, the case of Starleper says that, really, that\u2019s not what\u2019s important. What\u2019s important are the equities. Well, I find it to be totally inequitable to go after a life insurance policy that did not even exist at the time of the divorce and had nothing to do with the divorce. It\u2019s just property that was later created. In order for me to find that that property [ought] to be chased, I would have to find that any life insurance policy, quite possibly any property purchase, made by Ms. [sic] Schoukroun when he was in default of what I believe to be his contract, should be subject to a constructive trust without making a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>that, A, the beneficiary, Ms. Sexton in this case, was somehow culpable or somehow involved in diverting the funds that eventually were to her interest, or, B, these funds themselves that were used to buy this life insurance policy were actually in derogation of funds that should have been used for Lauren.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">I decline to so find. I don\u2019t find either of those things to be correct. And so, therefore, I find in favor of the counter-defendant in the counterclaim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Neither Kathleen nor Bernadette was entirely satisfied with the judgments of the circuit court. Kathleen now asks (in the words of her brief):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">1. Was it error for the Circuit Court to find that deceased husband\u2019s transfers of various securities accounts to a revocable trust that he created four months prior to his death, through both direct transfers to the trust and through TOD (transfer on death) designations of the same trust as beneficiary of other accounts, was not for the purpose of defrauding Appellant of her statutory share in her deceased spouse\u2019s estate?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">This question may be divided into two sub-questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-9\">a) <em>where the deceased maintains total control, </em>(here through a TOD accounts [sic] with a revocable trust as beneficiary and through direct transfers to a revocable trust) will the court have to do a <em>\u201cWhittington </em>\u201d equitable analysis, or does <em>Knell </em>establish a \u201cbright line rule\u201d that, as a matter of law, the transfer on death is in fraud of marital rights?

Kathleen\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Kathleen, who is entitled to a one-third share of Mr. Schoukroun\u2019s estate,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> argues that the transfers made by Mr. Schoukroun into the revocable Trust were \u201cfor of defrauding appellant of her statutory share in her deceased spouse\u2019s estate,\u201d and therefore requests (in the words of her brief): [T]hat the Court issue a mandate reversing the Circuit Court\u2019s Judgment in favor of the Appellees on Count One of the Appellant\u2019s Complaint to impose a constructive trust, and that said mandate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-8\">A. Declare that whatever right or claim that either of the Appellee\u2019s [sic] hold or asserts to the accounts, (and any other accounts similarly transferred to the Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun Trust) and their proceeds, is held as a constructive trust for the benefit of Appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-9\">B. Order, adjudge, and decree that the accounts (and any other accounts similarly transferred to the Gil\u00edes H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Schoukroun Trust) and their proceeds, were and are, an asset belonging to the Estate of Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun, deceased, and that the same was transferred and conveyed to the revocable Trust in fraud of the marital rights of the Appellant, Kathleen Sexton Schoukroun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">C. Order, adjudge and decree that Appellee\u2019s [sic] relinquish and surrender the accounts and any right or claim Appellee\u2019s [sic] may assert to the accounts (and any other accounts similarly transferred to the Gil\u00edes H. Schoukroun Trust) and their proceeds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">D. Issue a broader holding that: <em>where the deceased maintains total control, </em>over assets in the form of TOD accounts with a revocable trust as beneficiary and through direct transfers of assets to a revocable trust, then, as a matter of law, the transfer on death is in fraud of marital rights, in that it defrauds wife of her statutory share in her deceased husband\u2019s estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The circuit court was not clearly erroneous in finding that Mr. Schoukroun had not acted with the intent to defraud his widow or his daughter. That finding, however, is not of dispositive consequence to Kathleen\u2019s appeal. Kathleen relies on <em>Knell v. Price, </em>318 Md. 501, 569 A.2d 636 (1990), for the proposition that \u2014 as a matter of law \u2014 a deceased spouse\u2019s transfer of property during the marriage constitutes fraud on the marital rights of the surviving spouse <em>whenever, </em>as is the situation in the case at bar, the \u201ctransfer\u201d was not \u201ccomplete, absolute, and unconditional.\u201d In <em>Knell, </em>a husband who had separated from his wife transferred real property to a \u201ctrustee,\u201d but the deed \u2014 which purported to create a life interest in the husband, with a fee simple interest passing to the husband\u2019s female companion upon the husband\u2019s death \u2014 contained a habendum clause that reserved to the husband the power to \u201csell, mortgage, lease, convey and dispose [of that property] at any time he may deem expedient^]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 503, 569 A.2d 636. When the husband died, his widow argued that the real property should be included in his estate. The circuit court rejected that argument, and this Court affirmed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>decision in <em>Knell v. Price, </em>77 Md.App. 331, 550 A.2d 413 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The Court of Appeals granted the wife\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari to answer the question, \u201cWere the deeds executed by the deceased husband and trustee in December 1978 for purposes of defrauding [Mrs. Knell] of her statutory share in her deceased spouse\u2019s estate?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505, 569 A.2d 636. The Court of Appeals answered that question in the affirmative, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">[I]t is perfectly clear that Mr. Knell retained control of the property during his lifetime by establishing a life estate in himself with unfettered power in him, while living (except by will), to dispose of all interests in the property in fee simple. He did not part with the absolute dominion of the property during his life. His conveyance, through a straw man, of the remainder of the property was not complete, absolute, and unconditional. The law pronounces this to be a fraud on the marital rights of Mrs. Knell. His reluctance to relinquish control over the disposition of the property during his lifetime defeated his intention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 512, 569 A.2d 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">According to Kathleen, <em>Knell </em>is applicable to the case at bar, in which the deceased spouse\u2019s TOD transfers were not complete, absolute, and unconditional. Kathleen argues that Mr. Schoukroun\u2019s intent is simply of no consequence because the law <em>pronounces </em>a TOD transfer to be a fraud on the rights of the surviving spouse. In support of this argument, Kathleen notes that the Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers \u00a7 9.1 interprets the <em>Knell </em>holding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">[T]he Maryland Court of Appeals issued a sweeping holding that any transfer in which the decedent retained \u201cdominion and control\u201d over the property during life is subject to the spouse\u2019s forced share.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">In a 2003 <em>Catholic University Law Review </em>article, Professor Angela M. Valario of the University of Baltimore School of Law noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>The Maryland General Assembly has not prompted legislative change in light of <em>Knell </em>despite repeated efforts by the Maryland State Bar Association to receive clarification. <em>See </em>H.B. 265, Gen. Assem. Reg. Sess. (Md.2000); H.B. 665, Gen. Assem. Reg. Sess. (Md.1997). <em>Knell </em>presented unique facts, such as the involvement of the decedent\u2019s attorney as a strawman in the decedent\u2019s efforts to disinherit his estranged spouse. <em>See </em>Knell, 569 A.2d at 641. Moreover, Mr. and Mrs. Knell had been separated for twenty-seven years at the time of the conveyance, and the real property was purchased with separate funds and accumulated by Mr. Knell well after the parties went their separate ways. <em>See id. </em>at 636-38. In awarding Mrs. Knell one-third of the decedent\u2019s property, the court in <em>Knell </em>seemed to focus exclusively on the fact that Mr. Knell had not parted with \u201cabsolute dominion and control\u201d and deemed this factor a per se fraud on marital rights. <em>See id. </em>at 640-42. This case provides no clarification for other non-probate assets such as joint ownership, life insurance, or other multiple party accounts. <em>See id.; see also </em>Md.Code Ann., Fin. Inst. \u00a7 1-204 (1998 &amp; Supp.2002). Moreover, section 3-203 of the Maryland Code fails to include any reference to <em>Knell </em>in its annotations to net probate assets. See Md.Code Ann., Est. and Trusts \u00a7 3-203 (2001). The failure to articulate a clear position further suggests the ambiguity and need for clarification in the Maryland statute and case law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Angela M. Vallario, <em>Spousal Election: Suggested Equitable Reform for the Division of Property at Death, </em>52 Cath. U.L.Rev. 519, 537 n. 65 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">We are persuaded that Kathleen\u2019s interpretation of <em>Knell </em>is correct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We therefore hold that Mr. Schoukroun\u2019s decision to retain the power to revoke the Trust requires that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>the assets of the Trust be included in his estate for purposes of calculating Kathleen\u2019s statutory share.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The <em>Knell </em>decision also applies to the two financial accounts that were to be transferred to the Trust upon Mr. Schoukroun\u2019s death. Md.Code Ann., Estates and Trusts Article \u00a7 16-106 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">The designation of a TOD beneficiary on a registration in beneficiary form has no effect on ownership until the owner\u2019s death. A registration of a security in beneficiary form may be canceled or changed at any time by the sole owner ... without the consent of the beneficiary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Md.Code Ann., Estates and Trust Article \u00a7 16-109(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">A transfer-on-death resulting from a registration in beneficiary form is effective by reason of the contract regarding the registration between the owner and the registering entity and this title and is not testamentary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">During his life, Mr. Schoukroun retained the power to alter the beneficiary of the financial accounts he owned at Fidelity Investments. As we interpret the holding in <em>Knell, </em>even though the circuit court was not clearly erroneous in finding that none of Mr. Schoukroun\u2019s actions were undertaken with \u201ca fraudulent intent,\u201d the assets in those accounts must also be included in his estate for purposes of calculating Kathleen\u2019s statutory share.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">The Orphans\u2019 Court for Anne Arundel County allowed a claim on Lauren\u2019s behalf against Mr. Schoukroun\u2019s estate on the ground that he had breached his agreement to maintain a life insurance policy that would, upon his death, pay $150,000 to Lauren. In an unreported opinion filed simultaneously with this opinion, we have affirmed that decision. <em>Schoukroun v. Karsenty, et al, </em>No. 557, September Term, 2006. Pursuant to \u00a7 3 \u2014 203(a)(3), Lauren has an enforceable claim against the estate, and the amount of that claim reduces the \u201cnet estate.\u201d Under these circumstances, in her capacity as both residuary legatee and TOD beneficiary, (1) Lauren is liable to Mr. Schoukroun\u2019s estate, but <em>only </em>to the extent that the estate is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>insufficient to satisfy Kathleen\u2019s statutory allowance, and (2) Lauren\u2019s liability does not exceed the value of what she is entitled to receive as legatee and beneficiary. We therefore direct that on remand (unless the parties \u201cdo the math\u201d and agree to distribute the estate\u2019s assets in conformity with this opinion), the circuit court shall (1) determine the amount of Kathleen\u2019s statutory share, (2) determine the amount of Lauren\u2019s liability, and (3) enter a judgment that will provide the estate with the funds needed to satisfy Kathleen\u2019s statutory allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">II. Bernadette\u2019s Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">We must apply the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard to Bernadette\u2019s cross-appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018Abuse of discretion\u2019 is one of those very general, amorphous terms that appellate courts use and apply with great frequency but which they have defined in many different ways.\u201d <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 13, 648 A.2d 1025 (1994). Writing for this Court in <em>North, </em>Chief Judge Wilner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">There is a certain commonality in all of these definitions [of abuse of discretion], to the extent that they express the notion that a ruling reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard will not be reversed simply because the appellate court would not have made the same ruling.
