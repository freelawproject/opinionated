L. Henry, which said instrument to the tenor following: \u201cSan Augustine, Texas,________________________192-------- --------No-------\u201cSilsbee State Bank of Silsbee, Texas. \u201cPay to Cash or bearer Seven &amp; 50/100 Dollars</p>\n<p id=\"b162-18\">\u201cC. E. Landrum.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-19\">\u201cOn back thereof, E. L. Henry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-20\">The evidence appears undisputed that appellant wrote the check in question and therefore if there was any forgery it consisted of the unauthorized placing of Henry\u2019s name on the back thereof as an indorsement. There are no averments in the indictment which make it plain\u2019 that it was the purpose and intent of the pleader to charge the forgery of said indorsement. The very question controlling was discussed at length in the recent case of Cochran v. State, 30 S. W. (2d) 316. See also Miller v. State, 117 Texas Crim. Rep., 247, 34 S. W., 267; McBride v.
