Hearing a commotion in the dining room, Mr. Edge, who had just answered a telephone call, upon making an investigation, saw appellant going down the back steps. He pursued appellant for about two and one-half blocks and finally caught him. Appellant spoke to him in Spanish, telling him that he was drunk. Mr. Edge delivered appellant into the custody of the officers.
