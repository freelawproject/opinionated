The position is untenable. See Tucker v. State, 94 Texas Crim. Rep., 505; Vernon\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., 1925, vol. 1, p. 438, note 14; Benson v. State, 95 Texas Crim. Rep., 313; Stockton v.

Rep., 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">The contention is untenable for the additional reason that to require review of the charge of the court, there must be exception to the charge during the trial, as provided by article 658, C.
