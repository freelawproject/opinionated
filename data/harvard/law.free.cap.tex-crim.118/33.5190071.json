The matter was submitted to the jury in the charge of the court of which there is no complaint or faults so far as has been observed. No exception was addressed to__it on the trial, and the complaint of it in the motion for new trial cannSt he considered. See Vernon\u2019s Ann. Tex. C. C. P., vol. 2, arts. 658, 659, and 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-24\">The verdict, as returned, found the appellant guilty as charged in the indictment and assessed his punishment at confinement in the penitentiary for a period of two years. The judgment sets out the verdict and is entirely regular.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The sentence, in place of the words \u201cguilty af assault with intent to murder\u201d uses the words \u201cadjudged guilty of <em>attempt </em>to murder.\u201d Article 847, C. C. P., 1925, says the Court of Criminal Appeals \u201cmay reform and correct the judgment, as the law and nature of the case may require.\u201d This declaration of the Legislature has been uniformly construed to confer upon this court the authority and impose upon it the duty of amending the sentence, as well as the judgment, to coincide with the verdict. Many of these cases will be found collated in Vernon\u2019s Ann. Tex. C. C. P., 1925, vol. 3, p. 252. See McCorquodale v. State, 54 Texas Crim. Rep., 344, 98 S. W., 879; Robinson v.

Many others are cited in the supplement to the statute above mentioned, page 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The sentence will be reformed so as to accord with the verdict and judgment, and the accused, J. J.'Boyd, who has been adjudged guilty of an assault with intent to murder and whose punishment has been assessed by the verdict of the jury at confinement in the penitentiary for a period of two years, will be delivered by the sheriff of Rains county to the superintendent of the penitentiary of the State of Texas or persons legally authorized to receive convicts, and the said J. J. Boyd shall be confined in said penitentiary for two years in accord with the provisions of the law of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The motion for rehearing will be granted to the extent indicated by the reformation of the judgment.
