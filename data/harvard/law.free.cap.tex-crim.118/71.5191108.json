E. Carden with the intent to commit the offense of theft. Nowhere in the indictment is it alleged that the entry was made with the intent to take property from the \u201cpossession\u201d of anybody. This is a necessary element of the offense of theft which must be averred in charging burglary with intent to commit that offense. The indictment in the present case is exactly like that in Mitchell v. State, 118 Texas Crim. Rep., 77, 37 S. W. (2d) 1018. See authorities cited in the opinion in the Mitchell case; see also, Culpepper v. State, 112 Texas Crim. Rep., 350, 16 S. W.
