Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal is dated November 17, 1930, and the statement of facts was filed February 16, 1931. This, was too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-21\">We find in the record what purports to be a bill of exception complaining of the refusal of a continuance. We are sorry we can not consider said purported bill because it does not bear the approval of the trial court. The only other bill of exception is a copy of the motion of appellant for a new trial and presents nothing for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-22\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-23\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
