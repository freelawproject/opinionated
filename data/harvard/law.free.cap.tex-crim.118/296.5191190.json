This court will take judicial knowledge that \u201cbeer\u201d is intoxicating, but there was no claim that Timmins bought any beer, and the record shows affirmatively that the other parties with him bought the beer. This court will also take judicial knowledge that whisky is an intoxicating liquor, but there is no testimony in this record that the \u201cliquor\u201d referred to by the sheriff and Timmins was whisky, or any other character of intoxicating liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In this state of the record this court can do nothing less than reverse because of an absence of proof that the liquor claimed to have been sold by appellant to Timmins was intoxicating.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
