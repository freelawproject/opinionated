There are two counts: one charging unlawfully transporting intoxicating liquor; the other charging the unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor for the purpose of sale. An examination of the charge of the court reveals that but one count was submitted to the jury, namely, that of unlawfully transporting intoxicating liquor. From the state of the record, the presumption that the evidence supported that phase of the indictment is conclusive upon this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
