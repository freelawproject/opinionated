There is no averment that the switch referred to was a part of or connected with any railroad track. Said switch might have been abandoned, or might not yet have been installed as part of the track or in the yards of the railway company. The indictment appears to us to be bad. There are many kinds of switches. For instance, telephone switches, electric light switches, etc. [These might be the property of a railway company. The evident intent of the statute in question as here applicable is to punish any person who shall wilfully displace or interfere with any switch in the track of any railroad. We think it unquestionably necessary that it be averred that the switch was. part of the track or connected with the track of said railway company.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>For the error of the indictment referred to, the judgment will be set aside and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
