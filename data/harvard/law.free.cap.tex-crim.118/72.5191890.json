The statement of facts was filed on the 19th day of January, 1931, which seems to have been. twenty-one days more than ninety days after notice of appeal was entered. The statute (article 760, C. C. P., 1925) demanding that a statement of facts, to warrant consideration, must be filed within ninety days after notice of appeal, precludes the consideration of the so-called statement of facts in the present record.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>The indictment seems regular.
