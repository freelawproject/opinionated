Since 1947, she has resided at the Vineland Developmental Center (VDC), an institution operated by the New Jersey Department of Human Services, Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD). In 1967, the DDD\u2019s Bureau of Guardianship Services (BGS) was appointed Moorhouse\u2019s guardian, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 30:4-165.1 to -165.6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">On May 27, 1990, Moorhouse was found breathless and pulseless in her residential unit at VDC. She was immediately brought to the VDC emergency room, where she was resuscitated. Moorhouse was then sent to the intensive care unit and connected to a respirator. She has never regained consciousness and continues to be connected to a respirator.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">On August 28, 1990, Chester Miros, Ph.D., Chief of BGS, wrote to the Public Advocate stating his intention to bring guardianship proceedings for Moorhouse. Dr. Miros stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>that Moorhouse was \u201cbrain dead,\u201d on life support and that Barbara Horan, her sister and only known relative, wished to become Moorhouse\u2019s legal guardian in order to make medical decisions for her. BGS apparently did not institute court proceedings allowed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-165.4 to .16 to have Moorhouse judicially declared incompetent and to have Horan replace BGS as guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">On November 2, 1990, Alice Cesaretti, Deputy Attorney General, notified the Public Advocate that Moorhouse was \u201cbrain dead\u201d and that Horan had asked that the respirator be disconnected. She stated that the hospital\u2019s prognosis committee would be meeting on the following Thursday to decide whether to concur with Horan\u2019s decision. If it did concur, the respirator would be disconnected.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">On November 8, 1990, the Public Advocate filed a verified complaint and order to show cause with temporary restraints in the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Probate Part, Cumberland County. It sought to restrain removal of life-support treatment from Moorhouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The assigned judge heard oral argument on November 8, 1990, appointed Linda Pirolli, Esq., as guardian <em>ad litem </em>for Moorhouse and instructed her to review Moorhouse\u2019s records, interview the YDC hospital staff attending Moorhouse, Moor-house\u2019s treating physicians and her sister and review all DDD records on Moorhouse. In addition, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>was directed to \u201csubmit written recommendations as to the legal standards which should be used and the procedures which should be followed before implementing any decision to terminate life-sustaining treatment for Ms. Moorhouse.\u201d The judge then signed a revised order to show cause returnable November 16, 1990, restraining the withdrawal of life support from Moor-house until further order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">On November 16, 1990, the trial judge received briefs from the Public Advocate, the Attorney General and the guardian <em>ad litem </em>and made the guardian <em>ad </em>litem\u2019s report part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>record. The report indicates that the guardian <em>ad litem </em>had reviewed Moorhouse\u2019s medical records, had visited Moorhouse, and had spoken with Horan. Although the report does not make it clear whether all members of the VDC prognosis committee, including Dr. Asha Gandhi, Moorhouse\u2019s treating physician, were interviewed, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>orally reported that she indeed had spoken with Dr. Gandhi.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The guardian <em>ad litem </em>produced several members of the prognosis committee at the November 16, 1990 hearing and requested that the court consider hearing their testimony with regard to the appropriateness of Moorhouse\u2019s sister being named guardian and the precise nature of Moorhouse\u2019s medical condition. However, the trial judge heard no testimony from any committee member, stating: \u201cI will not require the testimony of the other members of the Developmental Center who are present. I am satisfied that the record itself today is clear and convincing respecting the medical condition of this patient, and the issue simply is does the sister qualify.\u201d At that point, the record consisted of the parties\u2019 and guardian <em>ad </em>litem\u2019s briefs and oral statements. With the exception of Moorhouse\u2019s sister, there was no testimony given by anyone at either hearing. The only medical records of Moorhouse submitted to the court were uncertified copies of five pages of handwritten \u201cprogress notes\u201d of two doctors contained in an Exhibit in DDD\u2019s trial brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">After hearing Horan\u2019s testimony on November 16, 1990, the trial judge found that Horan had a sincere lifelong interest in Moorhouse\u2019s welfare, that she had no improper motives and that she would not gain financially from Moorhouse\u2019s death. He then appointed Horan to act as Moorhouse\u2019s guardian with the power to terminate Moorhouse\u2019s life-support treatment and denied the Public Advocate\u2019s request for a stay of the order. Following an application for emergent relief, we stayed the authorization to terminate life support pending the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>In his opinion, the trial judge established a procedure to be followed before allowing removal of life-support treatment from DDD/BGS clients living in state institutions: When a state institution receives a request from a family member or friend to terminate life-support and the hospital medical-ethics committee concurs with the decision after two neurologists diagnose a persistent vegetative state, DDD shall, upon notification to the Public Advocate, apply to the court for the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem, </em>even if the patient already has a guardian. The guardian <em>ad litem, </em>who must be an attorney, must file a report with the court within 10 days after appointment and, if desired, may obtain an independent neurological evaluation. A court hearing shall be conducted within five court days after the guardian <em>ad </em>litem\u2019s report is received. The court will use a clear and convincing evidentiary standard in determining whether a persistent vegetative state is confirmed and whether that determination confirms the propriety of the request to discontinue a life-support system.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">A review of our Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in so-called right-to-die cases is a necessary predicate to our review of the procedures fashioned by the trial court in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The case of <em>In re Quinlan, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>10, 18, 355 A.2d 647 <em>cert. den. sub nom. Garger v. New Jersey, </em>429 <em>U.S. </em>922, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>319, 50 L.Ed.2d 289 (1976), concerned 21-year-old Karen Quinlan, who was in a persistent vegetative state. The Court held that Karen\u2019s family and guardian could elect whether to remove her from a respirator under the following conditions: (1) the patient\u2019s attending physicians must conclude that there was no reasonable probability of the patient emerging from her comatose condition to a cognitive, sapient state and that life-support systems should be discontinued; (2) upon concurrence of the patient\u2019s guardian and family, the physicians should consult with the hospital ethics committee or a like body and if it agrees that there is no reasonable possibility of the patient ever emerging from a comatose condition to a cognitive sapient state, the life-support system can be withdrawn without any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>civil or criminal liability by any participant. <em>Quinlan, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 54-55, 355 A.2d 647. The Court specifically noted that a judicial proceeding was not necessarily required for the above procedure. <em>Id. </em>at 55, 355 A.2d 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\"><em>In re Conroy, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>321, 335-36, 486 A.2d 1209 (1985), involved an incompetent nursing-home patient who was awake and conscious, but with severely limited mental and physical functioning. The patient\u2019s guardian sought permission to remove a feeding tube from the patient. The Court held that because of the special vulnerability of mentally and physically impaired elderly persons in nursing homes and the potential for abuse with unsupervised institutional decision making in such homes, life-sustaining treatment should not be withdrawn from a nursing-home resident in the absence of a guardian\u2019s decision made in accordance with the tests set forth below. <em>Id. </em>at 381, 486 A.2d 1209. If the patient already has a general guardian, the court should determine whether that guardian is a suitable person to represent the patient with respect to the medical decision in question. <em>Id. </em>at 383, 486 A.2d 1209. Such a determination necessitates an inquiry into the guardian\u2019s knowledge of the patient and motivations or possible conflicts of interest. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">A necessary prerequisite to substitute decision-making by a guardian is that the patient has been proven incompetent to make the particular treatment decision for himself and that a guardian for the incompetent patient has been designated if the patient does not already have one. <em>Id. </em>at 381, 486 A.2d 1209. Such a determination is necessary even if the patient previously-had been adjudicated an incompetent and had had a general guardian appointed pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:12-25. <em>Id. </em>at 382, 486 A.2d 1209. The procedure fashioned by the Court requires clear and convincing medical evidence of the patient\u2019s alleged incompetency. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Evidence concerning the patient\u2019s condition is to be furnished by the attending physicians and nurses. Two other physicians <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>unaffiliated with the nursing home and attending physician are to be appointed to confirm the patient\u2019s medical condition and prognosis. Once the two physicians supply the necessary medical foundation, the guardian, with the concurrence of the attending physician or another physician chosen by the guardian, may withhold or withdraw life-sustaining medical treatment if he believes in good faith, based on the medical evidence and any evidence of the patient\u2019s wishes, that it is <em>clear </em>that one of the three tests set out in <em>Conroy </em>(subjective, limited-objective, or pure-objective) is met. <em>Id. </em>at 384, 486 A.2d 1209 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The three tests established by the Court are as follows and apply to an elderly, formerly competent but presently incompetent nursing-home resident with severe and permanent mental and physical impairments and a life expectancy of approximately one year or less. <em>Id. </em>at 363, 365, 366, 486 A.2d 1209. Under the \u201csubjective\u201d test, when it is clear that the patient would have refused the. treatment under the circumstances involved, life-sustaining treatment may be withheld or withdrawn from the patient. <em>Id. </em>at 360, 486 A.2d 1209. The limited-objective test applies when the patient has not unequivocally expressed his desires before becoming incompetent. <em>Id. </em>at 365, 486 A.2d 1209. Here, life-sustaining treatment may be withheld or withdrawn from a patient when there is some trustworthy evidence that the patient would have refused the treatment and the decision maker is satisfied that it is clear that the burdens of the patient\u2019s continued life with the treatment outweigh the benefits of that life for him and that the treatment would merely prolong the patient\u2019s suffering. <em>Id. </em>Under the \u201cpure-objective\u201d test, applicable when there is no trustworthy evidence that the formerly competent patient would have declined the treatment, the net burdens of the patient\u2019s life with the treatment should clearly and markedly outweigh the benefits that the patient derives from life. <em>Id. </em>at 366, 486 A.2d 1209. The recurring, unavoidable and severe pain of the patient\u2019s life with the treatment should be such that it would be inhumane to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>administer life-sustaining treatment. <em>Id. </em>Ordinarily, court involvement will be limited to a determination of incompetency and the appointment of a guardian, unless a personal guardian has been previously appointed, who will determine whether the prescribed standards have been satisfied. <em>Id. </em>at 385, 486 A.2d 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The Court held that while <em>Quinlan </em>suggested a decision-making procedure for comatose or chronic, persistent vegetative state patients, that procedure was not entirely appropriate to patients confined to nursing homes because of nursing-home patients\u2019 vulnerability, among other reasons. <em>Id. </em>at 358-59, 374-75, 486 A.2d 1209. The vulnerability of several groups of people, including mentally retarded people, was noted by the Court. <em>Id. </em>at 359, 486 A.2d 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The Court explained, however, that it had not attempted to set forth guidelines for decision-making with respect to life-sustaining treatment in a variety of other situations not currently before it, such as the ease of a never-competent adult suffering from a painful and debilitating illness, and held that \u201c[w]e do not deem it advisable to attempt to resolve all such human dilemmas in the context of this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387-88, 486 A.2d 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">In the case of <em>In re Grady, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>235, 240-42, 426 A.2d 467 (1981), the Court dealt with the attempts of parents to appoint a special guardian authorized to consent to sterilization of their daughter who suffered from Down\u2019s Syndrome and lived with them. The Court ruled that only a court, and not a guardian, could substitute for the incompetent\u2019s consent. <em>Id. </em>at 251, 426 A.2d 467. The Court recognized that this was a departure from <em>Quinlan, </em>but noted that the alternatives available in <em>Quinlan </em>were more clear-cut: the patient could continue to live indefinitely in a coma with the life-support system attached or she could have the apparatus removed and allow natural forces to take over, probably resulting in her death. <em>Id. </em>at 251 n. 4, 426 A.2d 467. Thus, in <em>Quinlan, </em>other than considering the medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>cal opinions to determine the chances for the patient\u2019s future recovery, there were few factors for a Court to weigh in deciding what was in the incompetent\u2019s best interest. <em>Id. </em>This was contrasted with the case in <em>Grady, </em>where the Court noted that sterilization of incompetents, especially the mentally impaired, has been the subject of abuse in the past and steps must be taken to ensure it is not permitted to continue. <em>Id. </em>at 252, 426 <em>A.</em>2d 467. In addition, the Court noted, sterilization of incompetents, along with such cases as adoption and custody cases, warrant close supervision by our courts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\"><em>In re Farrell, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>335, 344-45, 529 <em>A.</em>2d 404 (1987), concerned the application of a husband to be appointed special medical guardian and to be given express permission to remove the respirator from his competent wife, who suffered from Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease and lived at home. The Court held that when dealing with an alleged competent patient living at home, in a hospital, or in\" a nursing home, two non-attending physicians must examine the patient to confirm that he is competent and fully informed about his prognosis, the medical alternatives available, risks involved, and likely outcome if medical treatment is disconnected. <em>Id. </em>at 356, 529 <em>A.2d </em>404. The Court noted that judicial review of a competent patient\u2019s refusal of life-sustaining medical treatment is generally inappropriate and is useful only in unusual circumstances, such as a conflict among the physicians, family member, or other health-care professionals. <em>Id. </em>at 357, 529 A.2d 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\"><em>In re Peter, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>365, 370-71, 529 A.2d 419 (1987), involved the application of a close friend designated to make surrogate medical decisions for Hilda Peter to be appointed her guardian. The Court noted that elderly nursing-home patients in the persistent vegetative state are threatened by the same conditions that put patients like Ms. Conroy at risk, <em>i.e., </em>an uneven level of care, minimal medical supervision and frequent lack of family support. <em>Id. </em>at 383, 529 A.2d 419. The Court then held that upon a surrogate\u2019s decision to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining medical treatment from an elderly nurs<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>ing-home patient in a persistent vegetative state, it must be determined whether the patient left clear and convincing evidence of his or her medical preference. <em>Id. </em>at 384-85, 529 A.2d 419. The Court noted that if a persistently vegetative patient\u2019s attitude toward life-sustaining treatment is not clear, the guidelines and procedures established in <em>Quinlan </em>and in <em>In re Jobes, infra, </em>are to be applied. <em>Id. </em>at 385, 529 A.2d 419. In every case, the ultimate decision is not for the Court and rather, is primarily that of the patient, competent or incompetent, and the patient\u2019s family or guardian and physician. <em>Id. </em>The Court also noted that in absence of a close family member or a specific designation by the patient of a close friend to make surrogate medical decisions on his behalf, a guardian for the patient must be appointed. <em>Id. </em>at 384-85, 529 A.2d 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In the case of <em>In re Jobes, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>394, 400, 529 A.2d 434 (1987), the Court considered a husband\u2019s request to remove life-sustaining food and hydration systems from his comatose non-elderly wife who resided in a nursing home and had not adequately expressed her attitude toward such treatment prior to her entering a persistent vegetative state. The Court began its analysis by noting that the court does not decide whether to withdraw life-supporting treatment, but rather establishes criteria for those who make that decision which respect the right to self-determination while protecting incompetent parties. <em>Id. </em>at 399, 529 A.2d 434. In addition to the testimony of many nurses and nurses aides, medical experts testified for the Public Advocate, the guardian <em>ad litem, </em>the husband and the nursing home. <em>Id. </em>at 407, 408, 529 A.2d 434. These experts disagreed as to whether Jobes was in a persistent vegetative state or fell slightly outside the definition of such. <em>Id. </em>at 407, 529 A.2d 434. The Court reaffirmed its holding in <em>Conroy </em>that all medical determinations made in the course of a decision to withhold treatment from an incompetent person must be based on clear and convincing medical evidence. <em>Id. </em>The Court defined \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence as that which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>produce[s] in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established, evidence so clear, direct and weighty and convincing as to enable [the fact finder] to come to a clear conviction, without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise facts in issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 407-08, 529 A.2d 434 (quoting <em>State v. Hodge, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>369, 376, 471 A.2d 389 (1984) (citations omitted)). The Court found clear and convincing evidence had been given in the form of testimony by several medical experts, notwithstanding the fact that they had been contradicted by the nursing home\u2019s expert\u2019s testimony and reports. <em>Id. </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 408, 529 A.2d 434. The Court then noted that in any case involving a patient in a persistent vegetative state, \u201cwe look primarily to <em>Quinlan </em>for guidance\u201d and do not apply any of the tests set out in <em>Conroy. Id. </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 413, 529 A.2d 434. Any provision for judicial review of this procedure is unnecessary and \u201cimpossibly cumbersome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421, 529 A.2d 434. With regard to the opinions of the patient\u2019s family members, the Court noted that they are the proper parties to make a substituted medical judgment on the patient\u2019s behalf, <em>id. </em>at 415, 529 A.2d 434 (citing <em>Quinlan, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 41, 355 A.2d 647), not only because of their peculiar grasp of the patient\u2019s approach to life, but also because of their special bonds with him or her. <em>Id. </em>at 416. This applies even to family members\u2019 substituted judgments about medical treatment for irreversibly vegetative patients who did not clearly express their medical preferences while they were competent. <em>Id. </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 418, 529 A.2d 434. However, in the absence of family members who are a spouse, parents, adult children, or siblings, there should be no deference to relatives of the patient and a guardian would have to be appointed unless the attending health-care professionals determine that another relative functions in the role of the patient\u2019s nuclear family and should be treated as a close and caring family member. <em>Id. </em>at 419, 529 A.2d 434. In addition, whenever a health-care professional becomes uncertain about whether any family members are properly protecting a patient\u2019s interests, termination of life-support treatment should not occur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>without the appointment of a guardian. <em>Id. </em>at 419, 529 A.2d 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The Court also noted that the \u201csubstituted judgment\u201d approach to decision making for patients in the persistent vegetative state \u201cis our ideal\u201d and that in some cases, such as when the patient has always been incompetent, it may be unworkable. <em>Id. </em>at 424, 529 A.2d 434 (quoting <em>President\u2019s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research, Deciding to Forego Life-Sustaining Treatment </em>132-33 (1983), for the proposition that \u201c[t]he substituted judgment standard can be used only if a patient was once capable of developing views relevant to the matter at hand\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In a concurrence to <em>Jobes, </em>Justice Handler noted that where there is no basis for deciding what choice the patient would have made, courts must be alert to the possibility of abuse, which in this context included not only discontinuing treatment for patient who would have wanted it continued, but also the continuation of treatment for a patient who would have wanted treatment stopped. <em>Jobes, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 431, 529 A.2d 434 (Handler, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Justice Pollock noted in a concurrence that with adults who have always been incompetent, it is practically impossible for anyone to ascertain their preferences. <em>Jobes, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 449, 529 A.2d 434 (Pollock, J., concurring). When there is no evidence of a patient\u2019s preferences, the decision maker should focus on the best interests of the patient. <em>Id. </em>However, he noted that although \u201cwe must beware of the slippery slope that could lead to the unwarranted termination of life,\u201d courts are not the right place to make utilitarian judgments about the value of human life. <em>Id. </em>For patients in a persistent vegetative state, the focus should be on the likelihood of the patient\u2019s return to a cognitive and sapient life. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Peter, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 374, 529 A.2d 419; <em>Quinlan, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 51, 355 A.2d 647).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>The vulnerability of mentally retarded persons recently noted by our Supreme Court in <em>Conroy, Peter, Grady </em>and by Justice Handler in his concurring opinion in <em>Jobes </em>has historically been recognized in this state. As a result, New Jersey courts have zealously safeguarded the personal and property rights of incompetent parties. <em>East Paterson v. Karkus, </em>136 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>286, 289, 41 <em>A.</em>2d 332 (1945). This case deals with the most important right of a mentally retarded person: her right to life. Our concern for ensuring that they are afforded this right is not diminished by their residency in a state hospital, rather than a private hospital or nursing home. With a ward of the State such as Moorhouse, the State acts <em>in parens patriae </em>and thus, has a much higher interest in ensuring that the patient\u2019s rights are protected. Consequently, a clear and convincing standard of evidence of the patient\u2019s medical condition must be met before consideration is given to removal of life support from the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The Court in <em>Quinlan </em>and <em>Jobes </em>specifically rejected judicial review of the established procedure, once all its elements were met, as unnecessary and \u201cimpossibly cumbersome\u201d unless there was a dispute between the members of the patient\u2019s family, the guardian and the physicians involved. <em>Jobes, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 421, 423-24, 529 A.2d 434. However, <em>Quinlan </em>and <em>Jobes </em>did not consider the case of a never-competent ward of the State who, for the reasons explained above, requires an enhanced degree of protection. This protection can be provided by the public advocate\u2019s involvement as shown below.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">We agree with much of what the trial judge said in his opinion, but modify the trial judge\u2019s suggested procedure for removal of life support from a never-competent ward of the State as follows: Upon the determination of family member(s) or friend(s) of an institutionalized mentally retarded patient to withdraw life support from the patient, with the concurrence of the attending physician, the hospital\u2019s prognosis committee and at least two independent physicians knowledgeable in neurology that the patient is in a persistent vegetative state with no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>reasonable possibility of recovering to a cognitive, sapient state, notice of that determination shall be sent to the Public Advocate for further review. The Public Advocate will review the medical records and undertake any other review needed to satisfy it that the family/medical decision is well founded, including, if it so chooses, interviewing the physicians and family member(s)/friend(s) making the application, visiting the patient and, if necessary, seeking an independent medical opinion. If, after its review, the Public Advocate determines that there is no reasonable basis upon which to challenge the decision, judicial involvement is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">However, if any one of the involved parties, including the Public Advocate, disagrees with the decision to terminate life support, the decision cannot be implemented without a court order. The court shall appoint a guardian <em>ad litem </em>to represent the ward\u2019s interest,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> visit the ward and all involved parties and file a report to the court. If the court finds that the movant has produced clear and convincing evidence (1) that the ward is in a persistent vegetative state with no reasonable possibility that he or she might recover to a cognitive sapient state, (2) that the ward\u2019s interests have been sufficiently protected and (3) that the movant would be a proper guardian for the patient, the judge shall allow the family member/friend to remove life-support treatment from the patient.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Here, while we generally agree with the trial judge\u2019s discussion of the law, we are concerned about his evidentiary rulings, his hurried pace and his refusal to hear the medical witnesses present in the courtroom. The trial judge found clear and convincing evidence regarding Moorhouse\u2019s medical condition, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">based upon clear and convincing evidence from the testimony presented today, that the request [to remove life-support equipment] has been made, that the hospital medical ethics committee concurs with that opinion, and that two neurologists have confirmed that Miss Moorhouse is presently living in a vegetative state and that she will never become a sapient, competent individual were she to be maintained on life support systems in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Although the evidence presented at the two hearings suggested that Moorhouse was in a persistent vegetative state with no chance of recovery, the only testimony heard was that of Horan. The guardian <em>ad litem </em>produced several members of the VDC prognosis committee who she suggested give oral testimony. However, the trial judge inexplicably refused to hear the testimony of any of them, although they were present in the courtroom and prepared to testify. The judge nevertheless found clear and convincing evidence of the hospital medical ethics committee\u2019s and neurologists\u2019 findings and of Moor-house\u2019s medical condition without hearing the testimony or admitting the records of any doctor or medical expert although readily available in court. Horan is not an expert in the field of medicine and did not attempt to be qualified as such. She is a caring and loving sibling. The only document contained in the record was the report of the guardian <em>ad litem. </em>This document contained a synopsis of the case, recommendations and a discussion of applicable case law. Thus, the record was virtually devoid of admissible credible medical evidence of Moorhouse\u2019s condition. Because the trial judge\u2019s findings were not based on sufficient credible evidence in the record, we reverse his finding of clear and convincing evidence of Moorhouse\u2019s medical condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>tion. <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co. of America, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162-63, 199 A.2d 809 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">We also take issue with the trial judge\u2019s refusal to grant a stay pending emergent appeal and his failure to promptly issue an order memorializing his oral allowance of removal of life support from Moorhouse. Both of these were clearly improper. The judge orally allowed Horan to remove life support on November 16, 1990. However, no order was entered memorializing the court\u2019s ruling until December 7, 1990, nearly a month later. The court should have immediately entered an order memorializing its ruling. It is clear to us that, but for the Public Advocate\u2019s intervention on a matter of such grave importance as this life and death issue, Moorhouse would most likely have died before the court had entered its decision on the matter and thus, prior to appellate review, including normal emergent review, of the trial judge\u2019s decision. Similarly, even if the trial judge had legitimate questions regarding the efficacy of the Public Advocate\u2019s request for an emergent stay, the court\u2019s denial of the Advocate\u2019s request for a stay pending emergent appeal nearly rendered Moorhouse\u2019s case moot. The hospital prognosis committee was scheduled to meet that afternoon and upon meeting, not only could have concurred, but did concur in the decision to remove life support from Moorhouse, allowing such removal to take place forthwith. Thus, if the deputy attorney general had not suggested restraint pending the Public Advocate\u2019s application to us and if we had not acted as we did in hearing the Advocate\u2019s emergent appeal without the trial judge\u2019s signed order, life support would have been removed from Moorhouse, almost certainly resulting in her death without the benefit of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Moreover, there was no need for the trial judge to include in his procedure strict time frames in which the guardian <em>ad litem </em>must file a report to the court and following which the court must hold a hearing. Our Court Rules specifically allow judges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>to relax or dispense with any rule which would result in an injustice in a pending action. <em>R. </em>1:1-2. <em>Hudson City Sav.
