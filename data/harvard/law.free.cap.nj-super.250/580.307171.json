In 1984, Werts was involved in a single-car accident which left her permanently disabled. She received basic income continuation benefits pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4b and opted for added income continuation benefits of $175 per week up to a limit of $18,200. When this limit was reached and defendant refused further payment, Werts instituted this action for reformation of the insurance contract to include income continuation benefits \u201cfor so long as the disability may persist\u201d and for recovery of all unpaid benefits, on the ground that defendant never offered her the coverage required under the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act (No-Fault Law or the Act) <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10) and the regulation promulgated thereunder <em>(N.J.A.C. 1</em>1:3-7.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">In response, defendant claimed to have fulfilled all of its statutory, regulatory and contractual obligations to plaintiff. Defendant moved for summary judgment on the issue of income continuation benefits which motion was granted. This appeal by Werts followed. We have carefully reviewed this record in light of Werts\u2019s contentions and have concluded that defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment was properly granted. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">In 1973, the No-Fault Law came into effect. The statute provided in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">Every automobile liability insurance policy insuring an automobile as defined in this act against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury, death and property damage sustained by any person arising out of ownership, operation, maintenance or use of an automobile shall provide additional coverage, as defined herein below, under provisions approved by the Commissioner of Insurance, for the payment of benefits without regard to negligence, liability or fault of any kind, to the named insured and members of his family residing in his household who sustained bodily injury as a result of an automobile accident, to other persons sustaining bodily injury while occupying the automobile of the named insured or while using such automobile with the permission of the named insured and to pedestrians, sustaining bodily injury caused by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>named insured\u2019s automobile or struck by an object propelled by or from such automobile. \u201cAdditional coverage\u201d means and includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">b. Income continuation benefits. The payment of the loss of income of an income producer as a result of bodily injury disability, subject to a maximum weekly payment of $100.00, per week. Such sums shall be payable during the life of the injured person and shall be subject to an amount or limit of $5,200.00, on account of injury to any one person, in any one accident. [L.1972, c. 70, \u00a7 4].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">In another section, the statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">Additional personal injury protection coverage. Insurers shall make available to the named insured covered under section 4, suitable additional first-party coverage for income continuation benefits, essential services benefits, survivor benefits and funeral expense benefits. Income continuation in excess of that provided for in section 4 must be provided as an option by insurers to persons for disabilities, as long as the disability persists, but not beyond age 65, up to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>an income level of $35,000.00 per year, with the excess between $5,200.00 and the amount of coverage contracted for to be written on the basis of 75% of said difference. The Commissioner of Insurance is hereby authorized and empowered to establish, by rule or regulations, the amounts and terms of income continuation insurance to be provided pursuant to this section. [L.1972, <em>c. </em>70, \u00a7 10].<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In response to the Legislature\u2019s mandate, the Commissioner promulgated <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.3 which prescribed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">(a) Appendix A outlines the minimum schedule of \u201cadditional personal injury protection\u201d coverage benefits that insurers must make available in accordance with Section 10 of the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">(b) In the Appendix A table, only five weekly indemnity schedules are shown, with a two-year benefit duration. It is believed that these ranges of benefits will meet the demand for this additional coverage in most cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">(c) Consequently, at least for the initial period, it will be sufficient if your manuals exhibit these minimum benefit schedules with corresponding rates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-9\">(d) However, benefits in excess of those set forth in Appendix A must be made available at the option of the named insured at reasonable intervals subject to the specific approval by the Commissioner, up to a maximum additional weekly loss of income benefit of $35,000 per year, as well as reasonable essential service benefits, survivor benefits and funeral expense benefits, as required by Section 10 of the Act.

[17 <em>N.J.R. </em>708 (March 18, 1985) ].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-49\">Defendant acknowledges that its 1981 offering to Werts did not contain any information about income continua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>tion benefits \u201cfor as long as the disability persists.\u201d It argues that the decision in <em>Olivero v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>367, 547 A.2d 710 (App.Div.1988), <em>certif. denied, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>76, 556 A.2d 1219 (1989), established that such benefits did not have to be offered until 1982 and that therefore the initial insurance contract with Werts conformed with all applicable laws. We disagree with this argument and with <em>Olivero. </em>Contrary to <em>Olivero, </em>we conclude that, since its inception in 1973, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10 has mandated that insurers provide income continuation benefits \u201cfor as long as the disability persists.\u201d Indeed, the statute explicitly states that such coverage \u201cmust\u201d be provided. Where a statute is clear on its face, we need not look behind the statutory terms to divine legislative intent. <em>State v. Churchdale Leasing, Inc., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>83, 101, 557 A.2d 277 (1989). Apparently, the Commissioner interpreted the Act as we do, since the regulation enacted on the heels of the statute repeated the mandatory theme: \u201cbenefits in excess of those set forth in Appendix A <em>must be made </em>available at the option of the named insured . . . .\u201d 4 <em>N.J.R. </em>270 (Nov. 9, 1972); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.3 (emphasis added). That the availability of such coverage is mandatory could not be clearer. As was said in <em>Lumbermens, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 444, 406 A.2d 994 (emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">The regulation and its appendix carry forth the legislative intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10 by setting up a schedule of optional additional personal injury protection coverage pursuant to the act. While recognizing that that schedule of five options would meet the demand for coverage in most cases, the Commissioner iterated, in the language of the statute, that benefits <em>in excess </em>of those in Appendix A were required to be made available at the option of the named insured. This language refers to the statutory mandate for income continuation benefits for as long as the disability persists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-8\"><em>Olivero </em>relied on the Commissioner\u2019s \u201cregulations and directives\u201d in reaching a contrary conclusion. Without belaboring the point, we think the Commissioner was without power to eliminate a class of coverage mandated by the Legislature. \u201c[A]n administrative regulation may not narrow or restrict the scope of an otherwise specific and clearly-worded statute.\u201d <em>Terry v. Harris, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>482, 496, 420 A.2d 353 (Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Div.1980). Thus, even if the <em>Olivero </em>conclusion had been the Commissioner\u2019s intention here, it could not be countenanced. More importantly, we do not believe that the Commissioner ever contemplated the <em>Olivero </em>result. His initial regulation enacted in 1972 (effective January 1, 1973) replicated the mandatory language of the statute by providing that \u201cbenefits in excess of those set forth in Appendix A \u201cmust be made available.\u201d 4 <em>N.J.R. </em>270 (Nov. 9, 1972); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.3. His regulation in 1985 repeated the theme: \u201cIncome continuation benefits for as long as the disability persists <em>shall </em>be made available ...\u201d <em>17 N.J.R. </em>708 (March 18,1985); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.4 (emphasis added). The current regulation provides: \u201cEach insurer <em>shall </em>make available as an option additional income continuation benefits for as long as the disability persists.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.2(e) (emphasis added). While, as <em>Olivero </em>pointed out, the Commissioner allowed insurers to limit their manuals initially to the five weekly indemnity schedules, this was no indication that that coverage was all that was available. In fact, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.3(b) explained the reason for this: \u201cIt is believed that these ranges of benefits will meet the demand for this additional coverage in <em>most </em>cases.\u201d 4 <em>N.J.R. </em>270 (Nov. 9, 1972) (emphasis added). The rule went on to enunciate that benefits <em>\u201cin excess\u201d </em>of the five outlined \u201cmust be made available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The interim 1982 revision which states that broader forms of coverage \u201cmay be made available\u201d on a \u201crefer to Company\u201d basis is no support for <em>Olivero. </em>\u201cMay,\u201d as used in that section, obviously refers to the method of offer \u2014 either on a refer to company basis or more directly. It does not render permissive the statutory mandate that the offer be made. Further, <em>Olivero\u2019s </em>citation to the August 1982 regulation as providing rates for \u201cunlimited\u201d benefits for the first time is inaccurate in two respects. First, the unlimited portion of the table in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.4 was not enacted in 1982 but in 1985. <em>See </em>17 <em>N.J.R. </em>708 (March 18, 1985). More importantly, the fact that the table specifically detailed unlimited options for the first time in 1985 is no indication that unlimited benefits did not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>to be made available in accordance with the statute prior to that date. <em>See Clendaniel v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>361, 476 A.2d 263 (1984) (holding that prior to 1981, an insurer was \u201crequired\u201d to offer the named insured and resident relatives Section 10 benefits); <em>Smith v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>610, 497 A.2d 602 (Law Div.1985) (holding that income continuation benefits \u201cfor as long as the disability persists\u201d were available in 1981). Most likely, the unlimited options contained in the table were viewed by the Commissioner as he viewed the original options in 1973: \u201cIt is believed that these ranges of benefits will meet the demand for this additional coverage in <em>most </em>cases.\u201d 4 <em>N.J.R. </em>270 (Nov. 9, 1972); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-6.3 (emphasis added). In short, we reject the conclusion reached in <em>Olivero.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Even if this were not the case, <em>Olivero </em>requires (and defendant concedes) that income continuation benefits for as long as the disability persists had to be offered as of 1982. In 1982 and 1983 with her renewal information, Werts, in fact, received a document entitled \u201cform A-993\u201d from defendant. This form set forth a schedule of Added Personal Injury Protection benefits and included the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">\n<em>Broader forms of Added Personal Injury Protection are available on a refer to company basis.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\"><em>Below is a special order form for your use in adding or changing Added PIP. </em>If any changes are to be made, Part D must be completed.

Human Services Dep\u2019t. </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>376, 385-86, 443 A.2d 178 (1982). The Commissioner\u2019s \u201cbroader forms language\u201d meets that standard. That being the case, defendant\u2019s offer to Werts, which utilized the very words of the regulation, is unassailable. This is particularly so in light of defendant\u2019s added question form which advised Werts and other insureds to check Box C if added PIP benefits other than those beyond the schedule were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>desired. Even if Werts was in doubt as to the meaning of the phrase \u201cBroader Forms of Added Personal Injury Protection are available on a refer to company basis,\u201d the added question clearly advised her that greater coverage could be had. She had only to check Box C to be advised of her options. Obviously, she was not interested in expanding her coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">We are thus satisfied that Werts is not entitled to reformation.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 now reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">Every automobile liability insurance policy, issued or renewed on or after January 1, 1991, insuring an automobile as defined in section 2 of P.L.1972, c. 70 (C. 39:6A-2) against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury, death and property damage sustained by any person arising out of ownership, operation, maintenance or use of an automobile shall provide personal injury protection coverage, as defined hereinbelow, under provisions approved by the Commissioner of Insurance, for the payment of benefits without regard to negligence, liability or fault of any kind, to the named insured and members of his family residing in his household who sustained bodily injury as a result of an accident while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile, or as pedestrian, caused by an automobile or by an object propelled by or from an automobile, to other persons sustaining bodily injury while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using the automobile of the named insured, with the permission of the named insured, and to pedestrians, sustaining bodily injury caused by the named insured\u2019s automobile or struck by an object propelled by or from such automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">\"Personal injury protection coverage\u201d means and includes:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">b.
