DeVries, commenced this action against her former employer, McNeil Consumer Products Co. (McNeil), and its parent, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Inc. In her complaint she asserted a cause of action for wrongful discharge under the principles announced in <em>Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>58, 417 A.2d 505 (1980). DeVries alleged that McNeil had discharged her \u201cin violation of the public policy supporting the doctrine of equitable estoppel.\u201d The complaint also alleged, in the third count, that defendants \u201cdid falsely and maliciously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>accuse and criticize DeVries in her professional capacity and caused it to be believed that she was not competently discharging her duties and that she was engaging in unprofessional and unethical practices,\u201d and that this constituted defamation <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Plaintiff now appeals from summary judgments entered on all counts of the complaint in favor of defendant, McNeil.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">DeVries was employed by McNeil as a sales representative, sometimes referred to in the industry as a detail person. In that capacity she called on physicians to acquaint them with McNeil\u2019s products and to establish and promote good will on behalf of her employer. The ultimate objective of this exercise was to motivate physicians to prescribe or recommend McNeil products. One of those products was Extra Strength Tylenol caplets. Plaintiff worked for McNeil from 1983 until her discharge in 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s discharge arose out of a confrontation with one of her assigned physicians, a Dr. LaPoff. The controversy arose when DeVries left samples of Extra Strength Tylenol caplets with Dr. LaPoff\u2019s office. Those samples contained expiration dates. At the time DeVries left those samples at LaPoff\u2019s office the dates either had expired or were close to expiring. DeVries contends that the short-dated samples were left at physicians\u2019 offices at McNeil\u2019s instructions. Pursuant to those instructions, she informed the doctors\u2019 staffs that they were not to be given to patients because they were short dated, but that they were being left for the personal use of the doctors and their staffs. According to DeVries, she also explained to the staffs that caplets used beyond the expiration date were safe and that they merely began to lose effectiveness due to age.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>To provide the full flavor of DeVries\u2019 version of her instructions from McNeil, we quote from a handwritten activities report prepared by plaintiff on September 9, 1986, approximately five months after she left the caplets at LaPoff\u2019s office:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">During the last week in March the company (McNeill) sent representatives a huge case of EST caplet (8\u2019s) expiring in April 1986 with the instruction to be given to office staff with explicit instructions to tell the staff it was for them only and perfectly safe. This I did in every office I went to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">In the beginning of May I dropped off said samples with instructions for staff on safety and for staff usage only. During the first week in June a Dr. Steven LaPoff at the Immediacenter, 1358 Broad Street in Clifton, screaming hysterically over the telephone \u2014 irate that I left \u201cout of date medication to his staff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">In her deposition testimony, DeVries stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">The letter that I got at the end of March said in a few weeks you would receive a huge shipment of extra strength Tylenol samples that will be outdated at the end of April. I received that shipment probably the middle of April.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">Unfortunately, no one has been able to find a copy of the written instructions or letter referred to by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">Apparently Dr. LaPoff\u2019s office gave some of the outdated Tylenol to patients who, noticing the expired dates, complained to Dr. LaPoff. One of LaPoff\u2019s reactions was to call DeVries and berate her in somewhat intemperate language. Several months later, DeVries was in the office of Dr. Basista, one of Dr. LaPoff\u2019s associates in practice, when LaPoff again confronted and criticized her. It is uncontroverted that as plaintiff left his office, with LaPoff continuing to berate her, plaintiff told LaPoff to \u201cgrow up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">The office confrontation resulted in a letter from LaPoff to McNeil dated September 14, 1986:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-13\">I would like to bring to your attention the unprofessional and unethical practices of your representative Nancy DeVries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-14\">Several months ago, Ms. DeVries knowingly distributed <em>expired </em>samples of Tylenol. When confronted, Ms. DeVries justified this action as appropriate. She stated that the samples were meant to be given to our staff. Unaware that these samples had past expiration dates, several had been given to patients unknowingly. We were placed in a very uncomfortable situation having to explain this action when patients called us concerning the expired product. I subsequently spoke to Ms. DeVries and asked her never to return to this office. Last week, Ms. DeVries returned to Immedicenter to detail us. She offered no apology and had no insight on the levity of her past actions. I once again asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>her to leave. Her retort, within earshot of patients and staff was that I \u201cshould grow up\u201d and that I was \u201cimmature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">Needless to say, my partners and I were appalled over this action by a McNeil representative. Knowingly and willingly giving expired samples of Tylenol is a travesty, especially in light of the past problems McNeil (and parent company Johnson &amp; Johnson) have experienced. In addition, berating a physician with verbal abuse within full view of his patients and staff is disrespectful and downright intolerable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">Immedicenter is an ambulatory care center and it sees approximately 30,000 patients a year. There is great potential to recommend a full line of McNeil products. However, <em>my partners and I will be actively prescribing alternatives to these products unless a satisfactory remedy to this situation is reached. </em>We recommend that Ms. DeVries be dismissed from her position as her actions discredit all the integrity that McNeil has tried to attain. We certainly would <em>never </em>allow her in this office or any future satellite offices. In addition, we will not see any McNeil representative should this situation just be allowed to rest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Val Brunell, McNeil\u2019s national professional sales manager, responded by letter dated September 25, 1986. Brunell apologized to Dr. LaPoff and informed him that the district manager, Mr. Carmen Simone, would contact LaPoff \u201cso that We have a full understanding of the problem and can take appropriate corrective action.\u201d Simone called Dr. LaPoff. We find it necessary to quote extensively from Simone\u2019s deposition regarding his conversation with Dr. LaPoff. Simone testified that LaPoff</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">said, <em>does your company have a policy of giving out expired samples, and I said, no, sir, we do not.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">Q. <em>So you told LaPoff, no, that was not a company policy. Is that </em>right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9E\">A. <em>Yes, sir, I did.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\">Q. What else did he ask you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-11\">A. <em>He said, well, if it is, then it must be Mrs. DeVries\u2019 fault. </em>He proceeded to tell me what she was doing. She had come in their office, gave \u2014 I think it was vials of Extra Strength as samples for his \u2014 he either said nurses to use or I think he said.nurses to use or staff, because he said he had a large staff, and somehow those samples got to the patients and the patients \u2014 I don\u2019t know how many he said, if it was one or more \u2014 said they came back in the office and called him up and threatened to sue him because they said Dr. LaPoff, how dare you give this stuff out, it expired and it\u2019s no good, and Dr. LaPoff was very very angry. I mean that \u2014 I was trying to calm him down on the phone, and I was doing a good job, because he says, it\u2019s about time I get someone that knows how to handle the situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>He said, well, if it wasn\u2019t the company\u2019s fault, it\u2019s Nancy\u2019s fault. </em>Let me tell you other things that she\u2019s done, this happened awhile ago, and she had the audacity to come back in my office. She said we sat her down and I was telling her off and Nancy got up, walked out on me and turned around in front of my patients in the waiting room and shouted at me. He might have said what \u2014 he might have told me what she said, but I don\u2019t recall that or what did she shout. He says I was completely embarrassed that \u2014 to have that done in front of my patients, and he was \u2014 he said I want her \u2014 he says, unless you fire her, we will convert all our Tylenol usage to your competitor, and I believe he mentioned Advil, to be exact. He said I will stop using Tylenol and Extra Strength altogether and we will convert and I will recommend only your competition if you don\u2019t terminate her. I believe this woman should be terminated, and if someone does not get back to me with that \u2014 with the facts that she has been terminated, I will do that and____ [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Simone informed Brunnell of his conversation with LaPoff, and Brunnell ordered Simone to fire DeVries. According to Simone, Brunnell told him to attribute her firing to poor human relations skills and poor attitude. Those reasons were placed on DeVries\u2019 termination report as the official reasons for her termination. However, according to Simone, Brunnell, upon ordering Simone to fire DeVries, instructed Simone to \u201ctell Dr. LaPoff that we complied with his wishes.\u201d Simone also testified that Brunnell said, \u201cI guess the moral of the story and the lesson to be learned is we shouldn\u2019t send out samples like this again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Simone carried out his orders and terminated DeVries.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">We first address the summary judgment on the defamation count. The trial court expressed its ruling in three sentences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1v\">In regard to the defamation issue, there is no specific affirmative defamatory statement as a matter of law. The defamatory statement is an indication or inference arising from single conversation between LaPoff and Simone. I\u2019m not satisfied that the inference from that language rises to defamation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The threshold issue in a defamation action is whether the statements complained of are reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning. <em>Decker v. Princeton Packet, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>418, 424, 561 A.2d 1122 (1989); <em>Romaine v. Kallinger, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>282, 290, 537 A.2d 284 (1988). This threshold issue is a question of law for the court. If a \u201cstatement is susceptible of one meaning only, and that meaning is defamatory, the statement is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>libelous as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Romaine, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 290, 537 <em>A.</em>2d 284. \u201cConversely, if the statement is susceptible of only a non-defamatory meaning, it cannot be considered libelous, justifying dismissing the action.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cHowever, in cases where the statement is capable of being assigned more than one meaning, one of which is defamatory and another not, the question of whether its content is defamatory is one that must be resolved by the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290-291, 537 A.2d 284. <em>Accord Decker, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 425, 561 <em>A. </em>2d 1122.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">In addressing this threshold issue, \u201cthe court must evaluate the criticized language \u2018according to the fair, and natural meaning which it would be given by persons of ordinary intelligence.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Herrmann v. Newark Morning Ledger Co., </em>48 <em>N.J.Super. </em>420, 431, 138 <em>A.2d </em>61 (App.Div.), <em>affd on rehearing, </em>49 <em>N.J.Super. </em>551, 140 A.2d 529 (App.Div.1958)). In evaluating the language for defamatory content, \u201cthe court must view the publication as a whole and consider particularly the context in which the statement appears.\u201d <em>Romaine, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 290, 537 A.2d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\"> Certain categories of statements are defamatory as a matter of law. For example, statements alleging that the subject committed a crime are defamatory <em>per se. Lawrence v. Bauer Publishing &amp; Printing Ltd., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>451, 459, 446 A.2d 469 (1982); <em>Sokoloy v. Edlin, </em>65 <em>NJ.Super. </em>112, 121, 167 A.2d 211 (App.Div.1961). Similarly, \u201cone who falsely and without a privilege to do so publishes a slander which ascribes to another conduct, characteristics or a condition incompatible with the proper conduct of his lawful business, trade, or profession is liable for slander <em>per se.\u201d Sokoloy, supra, </em>65 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 121-122, 167 A.2d 211. <em>See Mick v. American Dental Ass\u2019n, </em>49 <em>N.J.Super. </em>262, 274, 139 A.2d 570 (App.Div.1958) (words imputing to a dentist lack of professional information); <em>Herrmann v. Newark Morning Ledger Co., </em>48 <em>N.J.Super. </em>420, 430, 138 A.2d 61 (App.Div.1958), (editor of labor publication charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>with lack of proper credentials as labor leader), <em>affd on rehearing, </em>49 <em>N.J.Super. </em>551, 140 A.2d 529 (App.Div.1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">We are satisfied that a jury could conclude that the exchange between Simone and LaPoff, particularly Simone\u2019s denial that it was McNeil\u2019s policy to distribute expired samples, when taken in context had the capacity to impugn DeVries\u2019 professionalism in the health care industry.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> LaPoff, in his September 14, 1986 letter accused DeVries of knowingly distributing expired samples. Simone\u2019s failure to explain the circumstances and his denial that it was McNeil\u2019s policy to do such a thing, constituted an accusation by McNeil that DeVries had acted unilaterally. That is how LaPoff interpreted his exchange with Simone. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 563 (1976) (\u201cThe meaning of a communication is that which the recipient correctly, or mistakenly but reasonably, understands that it was intended to express\u201d). As previously indicated, LaPoff told Simone, \u201cWell, if it wasn\u2019t the company\u2019s fault, it was Nancy\u2019s fault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">We reject, therefore, McNeil\u2019s contention that its employees made no defamatory communication to anyone regarding DeVries but merely failed to dispute LaPoff\u2019s accusations. <em>See </em>Restatement, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 559, comment a, at 156 (\u201cThe word \u2018communication\u2019 is used to denote the fact that one person has brought an idea to the perception of another.\u201d); <em>see also Jimenez-Nieves v. United States, </em>682 <em>F.</em>2d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1982) (dishonoring checks negotiated by plaintiff implied defamatory statements about him).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Moreover, by acceding to LaPoff\u2019s request that McNeil terminate DeVries, McNeil confirmed the impression it had created, that DeVries had acted unilaterally without McNeil\u2019s authority or knowledge and against company policy. A jury could find that McNeil chose to suppress the true facts to mollify a customer at the expense of DeVries\u2019 reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>McNeil contends that Simone\u2019s statement to LaPoff that it was not McNeil\u2019s policy to distribute expired Tylenol was true and, therefore, not actionable. <em>See Lawrence v. Bauer Publishing &amp; Printing Ltd, supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 460, 446 <em>A.2d </em>469. According to McNeil, it has no policy authorizing the distribution of <em>expired </em>samples. On the contrary, it has a written policy contained in a publication entitled <em>McNeil Consumer Products Company Professional Sales Representative\u2019s Manual. </em>It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\">\n<em>Expired Products</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">Products which have passed the expiration date must be incinerated or poured down a drain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Although the trial court did not rule on McNeil\u2019s truth defense in granting summary judgment, we deem it appropriate to analyze it for the trial court\u2019s benefit on remand. There is little doubt that DeVries received a communication from her employer regarding a shipment of short dated Tylenol. According to DeVries, she was ordered to distribute the expiring product to physicians and their staff with instructions that they were for personal use only and were not to be given to patients. McNeil\u2019s contention is that once the expiration date was reached, DeVries should have destroyed the remaining product pursuant to the instruction in its sales manual. Therefore, argues McNeil, distribution by DeVries after the April 30 expiration date was a unilateral act by DeVries in violation of company policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">After a trial, a jury may determine that McNeil\u2019s contention is valid. However, the evidence would also suggest that, in light of the surrounding circumstances, the instruction super-ceded the manual. DeVries serviced over 200 physicians. The timing of DeVries\u2019 receipt of the instructions and the shipment may have reasonably suggested to DeVries that the originator of the instruction was aware that not all of the product would be distributed before the expiration date and that she was impliedly authorized to distribute the Tylenol after expiration, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>given the fact that the product was safe and was not to be given to patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Validity of the truth defense does not turn completely on whether McNeil had a written policy regarding expired product in its manual. The issue is whether DeVries exceeded her authority and acted unilaterally in distributing the expired product, for that is the sting of McNeil\u2019s communication with LaPoff. <em>See Lawrence, supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 460, 446 A.2d 469 (\u201cFor the defense to apply, however, the truth must be as broad as the defamatory imputation or \u2018sting\u2019 of the statement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">For the same reason, McNeil cannot preserve the summary judgment by relying on a qualified privilege. McNeil contends that it enjoyed a qualified privilege because it had an interest in the subject and pursuant to that interest it made a statement to a person with a corresponding interest. <em>See Jorgensen v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>541, 564, 138 A.2d 24 (1958) (quoting <em>Rothholz v. Dunkle, </em>53 <em>N.J.L. </em>438, 440, 22 A. 193 (E. &amp; A.1891)). However, even if the privilege is applicable, an issue not reached by the trial judge, it may be lost by abuse. <em>See Bainhauer v. Manoukian, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>9, 42-43, 520 A.2d 1154 (App.Div.1987). Whether McNeil abused the privilege is a jury question. <em>Erickson v. Marsh &amp; McLennan Co., </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>539, 565-567, 569 A.2d 793 (1990); <em>Bainhauer, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 40, 520 A.2d 1154. \u201c[T]he privilege is lost if the speaker knows the matter is false or acts in reckless disregard of its falsity.\u201d <em>Bainhauer, supra, </em>215 <em>NJ.Super. </em>at 42, 520 A.2d 1154. Thus, if the jury finds that McNeil created the false impression that DeVries acted unilaterally, and that McNeil knew that the impression it created was false or acted in reckless disregard of its falsity, then the qualified privilege would not protect McNeil.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>We reverse the summary judgment in favor of defendant McNeil on the third count of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">We affirm, however, the judgment in favor of defendant on plaintiff\u2019s cause of action under <em>Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>58, 417 <em>A.</em>2d 505 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">We recently addressed <em>Pierce </em>and its boundaries in <em>Hennessey v. Coastal Eagle Point Oil Company, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>297, 303-304, 589 A.2d 170 (App.Div.1991), where we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">In <em>Pierce, </em>the New Jersey Supreme Court recognized that an employee at will has a cause of action for wrongful discharge if \u201cthe discharge is contrary to a clear mandate of public policy.\u201d <em>Pierce, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 72, 417 A.2d 505. Although <em>Pierce </em>recognized the cause of action, it affirmed a summary judgment for the employer. <em>Id. </em>at 76, 417 A.2d 505. On the record before it, the Court found that plaintiff, a medical doctor engaged in pharmaceutical research, merely had become involved in \u201ca difference in medical opinion\u201d with her corporate supervisors regarding drug research which was subject to PDA approval and control, and, therefore, it found no violation of public policy in her termination. <em>Id. </em>at 75-76, 417 A.2d 505.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">The <em>Pierce </em>cause of action is not unique to New Jersey. Other jurisdictions had recognized a cause of action for discharges violative of public policy, and they were discussed in the <em>Pierce </em>opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 67-70, 417 A.2d 505. In <em>Pierce, </em>the Court stated \u201c[t]he sources of public policy include legislation; administrative rules, regulations or decisions; and judicial decisions,\u201d that \u201c[i]n certain instances, a professional code of ethics may contain an expression of public policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 417 A.2d 505.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\">Recently, New Jersey courts have addressed the application of <em>Pierce. </em>In <em>Velantzas v.

The Court held that this allegation, if true, would constitute a violation of the public policy established by the Legislature when it adopted New Jersey\u2019s Law Against Discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 192-193, 536 A.2d 237; <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 <em>et seq.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-10\">In <em>Cerracchio v.

Carter-Wallace, Inc., </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>42, 556 A.2d 353 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>154, 564 A.2d 874 (1989), plaintiff alleged that he had been terminated because he had complained to his supervisor about the shipment of a product he deemed to be contaminated. We affirmed a summary judgment in favor of the employer, holding that the mere voicing of opposition to corporate policy provides an insufficient foundation for assertion of a <em>Pierce </em>claim. <em>Id. </em>at 49, 556 A.2d 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">We held in <em>Schwartz v. Leasametric, Inc., </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>21, 30, 539 A.2d 744 (App.Div.1988), that termination of an employee to avoid paying commissions did not violate a clear mandate of public policy. We stated that \u201ca cause of action under <em>Pierce </em>has been recognized if the firing was in retaliation for an employee\u2019s refusal to commit an act which would violate a statute or for assertion of a right protected by legislation, or for firings which were \u2018invidiously discriminatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30, 539 A.2d 744 (citing <em>Citizens State Bank of N.J. v. Libertelli, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 195, 521 A.2d 867 (App.Div.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">In <em>Alexander v. Kay Finlay Jewelers, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>503, 508, 506 A.2d 379 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>466, 517 A.2d 449 (1986), we held that in the absence of a statute or regulation prohibiting discharge in retaliation for a civil suit against the employer arising out of a salary dispute, there was no <em>Pierce </em>cause of action. We noted that \u201cthe dispute giving rise to the termination of plaintiff\u2019s employment involved a matter having no significance beyond the private interests of plaintiff and defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508, 506 A.2d 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The distinction between personal and public interests guided this court in <em>Warthen v. Toms River Community Mem. Hosp., </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>18, 488 A.2d 229 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>255, 501 A.2d 926 (1985). Plaintiff, a nurse, had refused to dialyze a terminally ill double amputee because of her moral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>and philosophical objection to performing the procedure under those circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 21, 488 A.2d 229. She was discharged. Although plaintiff based her refusal on an ethical code for nurses, we held that plaintiff was motivated by her personal morals, precluding application of <em>Pierce. Id. </em>at 28, 488 A.2d 229. We observed that \u201c[b]y refusing to perform the procedure she may have eased her own conscience, but she neither benefited the society-at-large, the patient nor the patient\u2019s family. <em>Id. </em>at 28-29, 488 A.2d 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">We conclude that DeVries\u2019 discharge did not violate a clear mandate of public policy. Although it may have been unfair, it implicated only the private interests of the parties. DeVries reinstatement or an award of damages to her for wrongful discharge would not further any public interest or serve to vindicate any identifiable public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Plaintiff relies on the principle of equitable estoppel as the public policy McNeil violated. In support of her contention, plaintiff cites a trial court decision, <em>Crowell v. Transamerica Delaval, Inc., </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>298, 502 A.2d 573 (Law Div.1984). The context of plaintiff\u2019s discharge in <em>Crowell </em>resembled the circumstances in the present case. The <em>Crowell </em>court characterized the circumstances in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">The plaintiff here was led by his supervisor to believe that the manufacturing defect which he ignored was one that the company invited him to ignore. Promptly thereafter Transamerica fired him for accepting its invitation. That conduct is unconscionable. It violates public policy and creates a cause of action in contract, tort or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 306, 502 A.2d 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Based on those facts the trial court ruled that the principle of equitable estoppel applied and that \u201c[a]ny conceivable definition of \u2018public policy\u2019 as that term is used in <em>Pierce, </em>would have to embrace the concept [of equitable estoppel].\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">We disagree with <em>Crowell </em>and hereby disapprove of it. <em>Pierce </em>recognized a limited exception to the right of an employer to discharge an at will employee. <em>Pierce, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 73, 417 A.2d 505 (\u201cIf an employee does not point to a clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>expression of public policy, the court can grant a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment\u201d). Despite attachment of the equitable estoppel label, the discharge in <em>Crowell, </em>though unfair, like DeVries discharge, involved private, not public, interests. <em>Cf. Erickson, supra, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 560, 569 A.2d 793 (an employer has an absolute right to discharge an \u2018at-will\u2019 employee even if that employee has retained a lawyer to protest the employer\u2019s action \u2014 provided only that the employer not violate any clear mandate of public policy.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The summary judgment on counts one and two are affirmed; the summary judgment on count three is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Plaintiffs notice of appeal limited the appeal to \"the order granting summary judgment to McNeil Consumer Products Co.\" Accordingly the judgment in favor of defendant Johnson &amp; Johnson, Inc. is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b197-9\">DeVries also has a nursing degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b199-8\">If it is determined that McNeil enjoyed a qualified privilege, then plaintiff must establish its abuse by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Erickson, supra, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 565, 569 A2d 793.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
