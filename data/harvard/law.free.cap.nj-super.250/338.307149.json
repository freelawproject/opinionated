He claimed that he was fired because of his obesity, a condition unrelated to his ability to do his job as office manager for a car rental agency. His employer claimed that he was terminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>because of inadequate job performance. The Director of the Division of Civil Rights, confirming the findings of the administrative law judge, concluded that the employer\u2019s reason for termination was pretextual, not bona fide, and that Gimello really was fired because of his actual or perceived obesity and not for any legitimate business reason. The employer now appeals this decision by the Director that Gimello was a victim of discrimination entitled to relief under our Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -42 (LAD or Law). We conclude that the record supports the decision of the Director. We affirm the adjudication of discrimination. We modify the damage award.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">We summarize the highlights of the facts developed at the hearing in the Division of Civil Rights before Administrative Law Judge Duncan. Employer, Agency Rent-A-Car Systems, Inc. (Agency or employer), is a rental car agency with a principal office in Solon, Ohio. During 1978 and 1979, when Gimello started with Agency, it had about 130 offices throughout the country. At the time of the initial hearing in 1988, Agency had 493 offices nationally, including about 20 in New Jersey. Each office employed between two and five employees divided into two positions, office managers and management trainees. The job description of a manager trainee in the employer\u2019s manual states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">This is a two fold position; to deliver, prep and pick up rental units for our valued customers and to become actively involved in training and preparation for the management position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The job description of an office manager states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">The office manager is responsible for organizing and coordinating the daily activities within their respective rental offices in accordance with standard company operating procedure, while working to expand the office through cooperative efforts with the sales representatives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">In addition, the office manager is responsible for the training and development of the manager trainee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The then-district manager Donald Mogar hired Gimello as a management trainee in Agency\u2019s Camden office on January 10, 1978. The two had known each other before the hiring because Mogar was friendly with Gimello\u2019s younger brother. Gimello had stated on his employment application that he was 5'8\" and 225 pounds. One month later on February 16, 1978 Agency promoted Gimello to office manager in the Trenton office. At first no management trainees worked at the Trenton office but soon one was assigned to Gimello\u2019s supervision. His salary increased from $8,300 annually as a management trainee to $734 per month ($8,808 annually) as an office manager. Gimello received several raises in the following months. On April 16, 1978 Agency raised Gimello\u2019s salary to $776 per month ($9,312 annually); on June 1, 1978 to $818 per month ($9,816 annually); on August 16, 1978 to $860 per month ($10,320 annually); on November 16, 1978 to $900 per month ($10,800 annually), and on May 16, 1979 to $942 per month ($11,304 annually). The then-district manager Gary Gradl recommended the raises and commented favorably on Gimello\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">While Gimello worked at the Trenton office he also received several bonuses for maintaining high levels of sales of \u201cDeductible Protection Coverage\u201d (DPC). Agency\u2019s manual describes DPC as \u201cextremely important\u201d and \u201cbeneficial to Agency.\u201d Employees sell the coverage in connection with car insurance, explaining that the coverage \u201celiminates the $750 deductible on the physical damage coverage.\u201d The manual states that DPC costs the customer a flat fee of $3.50 a day plus tax. Offices attaining 55% or greater monthly DPC sales received bonuses from Agency. Gradl noted Gimello\u2019s high DPC sales percentages on the form reflecting Gimello\u2019s raises. Interoffice memoranda from James Thatcher, Agency\u2019s Eastern Regional Director, congratulated the offices for DPC sales and bonuses. The memos also contained handwritten personal notes of congratulations to Gimello from Thatcher. In June 1978 Gimello\u2019s Trenton office had 91.9% DPC sales and received a memo from Thatcher with the office\u2019s percentage circled and \u201cJoe! Great\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>written in the margin. On the memo showing the office\u2019s 100% sales quota \u201caverage through February 13, 1979\u201d DPC sales, Thatcher wrote: \u201cJoe: OUTSTANDING ... WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY. THANKS. JIM T.\u201d In March 1979, Gimello\u2019s office showed 102.5% (apparently a ratio of sales to sales quota) DPC sales and Thatcher wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">JOE: THIS IS A \u201cCOMPANY\u201d ALL TIME RECORD-INCREDIBLE JOB. JIM T.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The memos from Thatcher for both February and March DPC sales noted that all regional offices qualified for the bonuses by achieving at least 55% DPC sales. On Gimello\u2019s memo reflecting March sales Thatcher circled the Trenton office\u2019s percentage and wrote \u201cJOE!\u201d next to the figure. The last memo reflects DPC sales through mid-April when Gimello\u2019s office showed DPC sales of 102.9%.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">On June 11, 1979 Agency transferred Gimello to the Cherry Hill office. Gimello received a salary increase to $968 per month, or $11,616 annually. At the Cherry Hill office Gimello supervised three management trainees and a larger volume of business than at the Trenton office. Gimello\u2019s wife also worked at Agency\u2019s Cherry Hill office part-time starting in 1979. On November 1, 1979 Gimello received another raise, bringing his yearly salary to $1,008 per month or $12,100 annually. In January 1980 Agency instituted a program it called the \u201c14/14 Incentive Bonus Plan\u201d in which office managers would receive a $14,000 base salary plus monthly bonuses equalling 7% of the office\u2019s monthly net income. While Agency\u2019s memo stated that \u201conly the most competent and experienced office managers will be offered participation in the plan[,]\u201d its memo approving the salary changes indicated that all office managers in the Eastern Region participated in the new compensation program. Gimello\u2019s only truly bad month was February 1980 when he received just a 32&lt;t bonus. That figure seems to be an aberration, however, since in all other months he earned at least a few hundred dollars and once up to about $1,200.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Agency also sent \u201cCommendation Awards\u201d to \u201cthose offices that have exceeded the highest level of competence in their respective markets.\u201d Gimello\u2019s Cherry Hill office received eight commendations from late 1979 through early 1983. Gimello also pointed to other letters from Agency\u2019s upper management in support of his performance as office manager. Sam Frankino, then chairman of Agency\u2019s board, commended Gimello and Mogar on \u201cthe fine performance of the Cherry Hill Office\u201d in a May 15, 1981 letter. Another letter, dated August 9, 1982, accompanied a bonus check and complimented Gimello on the Cherry Hill office\u2019s \u201chigh performance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The district manager for the territory including the Cherry Hill office managed the district from the Cherry Hill office location. Between June 1979 and June 1983 three district managers supervised Gimello: Lynn Tobiason (from June 1979 to sometime shortly after); Anthony Giannone (to October 1979); and Donald Mogar (to June 1983 when Gimello was fired). The only comment by Tobiason apparent in the record is in her recommendation of a raise for Gimello when he transferred from Trenton to Cherry Hill. Giannone complimented Gimello on his performance in September 1979 on a form reflecting one of Gimello\u2019s raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The record includes two evaluations of Gimello\u2019s performance compiled by Mogar. The first, dated December 8, 1981, described Gimello as a \u201cgood\u201d office manager, but conditioned a recommendation for promotion on Gimello\u2019s taking a \u201ccourse in employee/public relations.\u201d The second evaluation, dated May 1, 1982, contained more specific information: Mogar noted that Gimello should soften his telephone skills with customers and should try to manage dispatching and scheduling more efficiently. Mogar again recommended a course in \u201cemployee/public relations\u201d but urged promotion more emphatically than he did in his December evaluation. Mogar explained at the hearing that he believed the course would improve Gimello\u2019s public speaking skills rather than his skills in dealing with employees. He testified that since a promotion to district manager would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>give Gimello more opportunities to give speeches and go on \u201csales calls,\u201d the course would be an \u201casset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Agency conducted several \u201caudits\u201d of the Cherry Hill office while Gimello was the office manager. These \u201caudits\u201d apparently are spot-checks of the office\u2019s cash, paperwork and procedures performed at two to five-month intervals from January 20, 1982 to March 30, 1983. The audits noted several problems with the office, including missing contracts, paperwork and contracts not completed correctly, and employees not requiring deposits on DPC purchases. The audits also showed that the \u201crevenue\u201d in the office was \u201coff,\u201d but with discrepancies of only $1.50, $3, $17.50 and $4. In his comments on the audit, Gimello explained that the mistakes in revenue were due to trainees\u2019 carelessness. Gimello said that the rate of turnover in his Cherry Hill office was \u201cheavy\u201d and that \u201c[m]any mistakes can be attributed to [the] turnover of trainees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In the spring of 1982, Richard Brindisi became Regional Director for the area, including the Cherry Hill office. Gimello stated that although he spoke to Brindisi \u201cfrequently\u201d on the phone, the two did not meet until September 1982 when Mogar brought Brindisi to the office for a tour and evaluation. Gimello testified that Brindisi complimented him on the office\u2019s \u201cstats,\u201d \u201coverall numbers\u201d, and \u201crevenue and collections.\u201d Brindisi told Gimello to \u201ckeep up the good work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Mogar testified that after that discussion he and Brindisi went out to lunch to discuss business. The two men discussed which employees in the district were \u201cpromotable.\u201d Mogar told Brindisi that he felt Gimello was \u201cpromotable to a district manager\u2019s spot.\u201d Mogar testified that Brindisi said, \u201cI don\u2019t feel Joe is promotable because of his size and weight.\u201d Mogar stated that Brindisi thought that Gimello would not be able to travel from office to office to perform a district manager\u2019s functions. Mogar stated that at first he laughed because he thought Brindisi was joking but he later realized that Brindisi was serious. When Mogar later told Gimello about the conver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>sation, Gimello was \u201csurprised\u201d but \u201chandled it kind of lightly\u201d because he felt his \u201ctrack record would stand for itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">As Gimello reflected on Brindisi\u2019s comment, he decided to try to lose weight. He consulted Dr. Samuel Goldman, a specialist of 30 years in the field of weight loss, who had successfully treated obesity in a person Gimello knew. On his first visit to Goldman on February 7, 1983 Gimello weighed 324 pounds. Dr. Goldman put Gimello on a diet and prescribed a diuretic and \u201c[p]hendimetrozine and pheneramine,\u201d non-amphetamine appetite suppressants. Gimello lost 52 pounds and was down to 272 pounds in May 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Goldman testified at the hearing both as a treating physician and as an expert in the field of treating obesity. He stated that a normal weight for a man of Gimello\u2019s height, age and frame was about 180 to 200 pounds. Goldman stated that while overeating, heredity and metabolism were factors that might cause obesity, pinpointing the exact cause of any patient\u2019s obesity is difficult. The doctor also related Gimello\u2019s statements about his life-long weight problem and family history of obesity. In Goldman\u2019s opinion, Gimello\u2019s weight did not impede his ability to perform his job. He said: \u201cMr. Gimello has been obese the majority of his life, and I doubt very much that it has been a detriment to his work in any way. It has no bearing on his ability to perform his duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">At some point during Gimello\u2019s period of weight loss regime in early 1983, Mogar spoke to Brindisi and told the regional director about Gimello\u2019s dieting progress. Mogar testified that he told Brindisi that Gimello \u201cdropped 30 or 40 pounds\u201d and \u201ctwo or three notches in his belt.\u201d Mogar said that Brindisi only responded by saying \u201che [has] to go a long way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Gimello contends that Brindisi made other comments about Gimello\u2019s weight. In February or March 1983 a police officer came to the office to ask questions about unpaid parking tickets on the rental cars. Mogar called Brindisi to ask what to do. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Mogar explained that the officer threatened to take Gimello to the station unless they could pay the tickets. Mogar testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au2\">I mentioned to Rick [Brindisi] the cop is a pretty big boy and he will take Joe away. He came back with, well, he can\u2019t be bigger than Joe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Gimello then picked up another telephone extension. He described the rest of the conversation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">So I got on the line, and Don [Mogar] stayed on the line as well, and Rick [Brindisi] said, is there a cop really bigger than you? And the cop was pretty gigantic, and I said, Yes, he is bigger than me, but he emphasized with overexaggeration, is he really bigger than you, about three times, and I just ignored the statements since he was a superior and proceeded with the facts at hand, what we were trying to accomplish.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Mogar also testified that during various telephone conversations, Brindisi would refer jokingly to Gimello\u2019s weight. Once, Mogar stated, Brindisi asked if Gimello was still eating his \u201cno-cal donuts.\u201d When Mogar once told Brindisi what Gimello ordered for lunch, Brindisi asked: \u201chow can a guy eat two cheesesteaks and ... a diet coke? What\u2019s the sense of a diet coke?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">In April 1983 Brindisi and Vince Garrenton, a vice president of operations, visited the office on a \u201csneak attack\u201d unannounced audit. Mogar said they \u201ctore the office apart\u201d and searched through files, drawers, desks, cars and his and Gimello\u2019s briefcases. Gimello stated that they \u201cappeared to be looking for something.\u201d Later Brindisi and Garrenton talked with Mogar and Gimello and explained that there was a problem with employee turnover in the office. Gimello testified that this discussion was the first time anyone in upper management had referred to a turnover problem with the office. Gimello stated that neither Brindisi nor Garrenton offered any suggestions about how to deal with turnover in the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Mogar testified that when Gimello returned to the front of the office to assist customers, Garrenton told him that Gimello was the cause of the problem \u201cbecause of his size and appearance.\u201d Garrenton pointed to Gimello through a window between the offices and said, \u201cthat\u2019s your problem over there, that fat slob.\u201d At the hearing Gimello produced a handwritten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>note which he wrote following a conversation with Mogar. Gimello testified that the Division of Civil Rights had advised him to keep records of things his superiors said and did when he first consulted them in early 1983. The note is dated April 21, 1983 and says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\">FROM DON [Mogar]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">They fear I would hire fat sloppy people 4-21-83 8:05 a.m.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Gimello stated that he wrote the note after Mogar told him that Brindisi said that if Gimello were promoted he would hire fat, sloppy people. Though Mogar did not remember the comment, he did recall that around that time Brindisi told him that Gimello could not hire new employees without Mogar\u2019s approval. When Mogar talked to Brindisi the following day, Brindisi told Mogar to get Gimello to resign. Gimello would not resign. Brindisi put Gimello on \u201c30 day probation\u201d and told Mogar to fire Gimello if another new manager trainee quit or was fired. Mogar said that the office had recently hired a new manager trainee and was running an advertisement to recruit more applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">On May 23 and June 8, 1983 two manager trainees at the Cherry Hill office quit. When Gimello would not resign, Mogar fired him on June 9, 1983 at Brindisi\u2019s direction. The \u201cemployee change notice\u201d form reflecting Gimello\u2019s termination shows that he was fired for: \u201cNot providing the service to our customers, as ARAC offers ea [sic]; delivering washing rental units, due to turnover of manager trainees.\u201d Four days later, Agency fired Gimello\u2019s wife, Terrie, from her part-time job in the Cherry Hill office.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Vince Garrenton testified at the hearing. At the time that Gimello was the Cherry Hill office manager, Garrenton was Agency\u2019s vice-president of operations. Garrenton stated that he could recall \u201chorror stories\u201d about Gimello\u2019s Cherry Hill office \u201cwith respect to customer complaints and employee turnover.\u201d Garrenton testified that when he visited the office with Brindisi he witnessed Gimello\u2019s interaction with customers and employees. He described Gimello\u2019s manner as \u201ccrude\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>\u201cvery, very harsh.\u201d Brindisi had shown Garrenton a \u201ccomputer sheet\u201d listing employees who had been terminated from the Cherry Hill office. Garrenton stated that an office manager\u2019s \u201cprimary responsibility\u201d is to recruit and train employees for advancement, and felt that the employee turnover in Gimello\u2019s office was unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Agency also presented testimony from Terry Holt, a senior vice-president. Holt did not state that he had any personal experience working with Gimello. Holt testified that several men who worked for Agency were \u201cheavier folks\u201d about \u201c240 and up.\u201d Gimello established on cross examination that none of these \u201cheavier folks\u201d were supervised by Brindisi. Holt said that the number of employees terminated while Gimello managed the Cherry Hill office was \u201cextremely out of line\u201d and unacceptable. Holt described the commendation awards as monthly motivational tools awarded on a \u201crotation basis.\u201d According to Holt, the regional directors distributed the \u201coffice of the month\u201d plaques twice per month but the awards did not commemorate exceptional performance because regional directors could award the plaques for many reasons \u2014 especially if it was merely that office\u2019s turn to get one. Holt stated that Gimello\u2019s mistakes \u201cwouldn\u2019t be tolerated\u201d if Gimello worked for Agency currently.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">When questioned about employee sales of DPC, Holt stated the DPC sales percentages could be \u201ctoo high,\u201d suggestive of employees using \u201carm-twisting\u201d sales techniques. He testified that average DPC sales of about 50% were \u201cvery acceptable.\u201d Percentages consistently over 70 to 75%, he said, indicated questionable sales techniques.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">At the hearing Agency also presented several witnesses who had worked with Gimello. Robert Shinault started as a management trainee with Gimello in January 1980. Shinault described Gimello as \u201crough and callous\u201d and that Gimello had called him \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201ca f \u2014 ing a--hole\u201d on a daily basis. Shinault said that Gimello treated all management trainees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>poorly. Shinault testified that Gimello fired him in July 1980 after a particularly embarrassing argument in the office. The employee \u201cchange notice\u201d reflecting Shinault\u2019s termination states that he quit after a reprimand about his poor attitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Andrew Drexler also testified for Agency. Gimello hired Drexler as a manager trainee in August 1980. Drexler testified that although a local employment agency referred him to the job, Gimello falsely told the agency that he did not hire Drexler in order to save the $900 fee. Drexler said that Gimello was \u201cobnoxious\u201d and \u201carrogant\u201d towards customers and even made a remark stereotyping Jewish people when he learned that Drexler was Jewish. Gimello fired him in November 1980 for not following instructions and being \u201cvery slow on the road,\u201d though the change notice reflects that Mogar initiated Drexler\u2019s firing.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Lawrence Ston also testified for Agency. Ston had worked with Gimello at his new job at Insurance Rent-A-Car in 1984. Ston testified that Gimello was moody and once expressed a desire to \u201cget back\u201d at Agency for firing him. Ston also said that when Gimello later had fired him from Insurance Rent-A-Car, he (Ston) pushed Gimello and Gimello fell down. Ston stated that when he read about Gimello\u2019s suit against Agency in the newspapers he contacted Employer\u2019s main office in Ohio, apparently to offer his assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">When Gimello left the office he took several documents that Agency asserts belonged to it. The documents included termination forms for several manager trainees who had worked under Gimello and employment applications completed by applicants Gimello felt could have been hired but were rejected by Agency which also had copies of the documents. Agency alleged that Gimello took them to \u201cfalsely bolster his spurious allegations.\u201d Gimello explained that since the copies he retained were marked \u201cOffice Manager Copy\u201d he was entitled to keep them.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>After he was fired on June 9,1983, Gimello found another job about IV2 years later, in October 1984. Gimello applied for and received unemployment compensation payments of $158 per week beginning July 1, 1983. The State Division of Unemployment sent Gimello a \u201cnotice of determination\u201d which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aia\">You were terminated June 9, 1983 because management felt you were not promotable. There had been no complaints about your work. You worked to the best of your ability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">There is no evidence of willful misconduct in connection with your work. You are able and available for work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Gimello testified that he actively sought another job but had difficulty because prospective employers thought that he must have done something wrong to get fired. Gimello described the first six months of his job search as \u201cextremely aggressive\u201d and \u201can eight-hour job, almost.\u201d Feeling some frustration, his search \u201ctapered off\u201d a bit, but he continued to look for employment for over three to four hours daily. Gimello testified that he kept records of his employment search as required by \u201cthe State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Gimello and his wife testified extensively on the difficulties the family experienced after Agency fired him. Gimello stopped seeing Dr. Goldman because he could not afford to pay him. As a result, he claimed he regained the weight he lost. Both Gimello and his wife testified to the financial difficulties the family experienced following his termination. They incurred medical expenses which would have been covered by Gimello\u2019s insurance including expenses related to a \u201cstress-related ulcer\u201d which Terrie Gimello developed. Once they had depleted their savings, about $3,000, the family sold Terrie Gimello\u2019s car and an antique car, a 1948 Chrysler New Yorker which Gimello kept as a hobby. Gimello then borrowed about $3,500 from his brother and applied for food stamps in May 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Terrie Gimello testified that she noticed a change in her husband\u2019s personality beginning in the fall of 1982. She stated that Gimello had become \u201cwithdrawn, more serious, less jovial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>and very quiet\u201d and Gimello told her about the comments he had received about his weight. She described his behavior as more private, less self-assured and less intimate. Gimello would not change his clothes with his wife in the room; the two rarely slept in the same bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Gimello\u2019s attitude improved when he found another job. In October 1984 Gimello began work as an office manager for Insurance Rent-A-Car in nearby Moorestown. Mogar had left Agency Rent-A-Car and went to Insurance Rent-A-Car as a manager in March 1984. He hired Gimello soon after Gimello contacted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">From this sharply conflicting testimony, AU Duncan made strong credibility findings in favor of Gimello and against Agency. She was not very favorably impressed by Brindisi\u2019s failure to testify and by Agency\u2019s lack of apparent effort to secure his testimony by deposition. She found that \u201cthe Division had been adamant about Brindisi and Garrenton attending the fact-finding conference\u201d but \u201cthose respondents had apparently chosen, for whatever reason, not to do so.\u201d At the time of the fact-finding conference on March 28, 1984, Brindisi was still employed by Agency. At the time of trial, Brindisi was employed in Solon, Ohio where Agency had its home office.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The AU found \u201cwith respect to the contested facts, I am far more persuaded by complainant\u2019s witnesses than respondents\u2019.\u201d Agency\u2019s attempt \u201cto explain away\u201d anything which complimented Gimello on his performance was \u201cunconvincing and reflected negatively on their credibility in general.\u201d She found that Gimello \u201cwas doing his job not merely adequately but exceptionally well.\u201d The AU said that \u201ccomplainant impressed me as candid and sincere\u201d and there was nothing to indicate his version \u201cwas anything but the truth.\u201d She found \u201cthe evidence reveals that turnover at the Cherry Hill office was fairly consistent over the years that complainant was the office manager.\u201d She found that over these years, 1979 to 1983, the office \u201cwas a very profitable one for the company; apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>the turnover did not significantly affect office operations.\u201d She found no <em>reliable </em>evidence of any trainee or customer complaints or that Gimello was the reason for turnover, rather than low pay, long hours and other indigenous factors. The judge was not impressed with the few documents and forms that were taken by Gimello. She seemed to think this insignificant.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The ALJ found that the remarks attributed to Brindisi about Gimello\u2019s weight \u201cwere, in fact, made by him\u201d and \u201cthat his concern with complainant\u2019s weight was the primary reason for his subsequent actions to effectuate the termination of complainant\u2019s employment.\u201d She also found Mogar\u2019s testimony in Gimello\u2019s favor \u201ccandid, sincere and credible\u201d and found that he had recommended Gimello for promotion, a recommendation Brindisi and Garrenton rejected because of Gimello\u2019s size, <em>i.e., </em>he didn\u2019t feel complainant would be able to \u2018get around\u2019 to the offices within the district.\u201d She also found that Garrenton did make the April 1983 remark attributed to him by Mogar\u2014 \u201cthat\u2019s your problem, that fat slob. Could you work for him? I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The AU found no pervasive company-wide policy to discriminate against obese people but that was \u201cnot the issue in this case.\u201d She found Gimello \u201cwas the victim of subtle discrimination.\u201d She found Gimello and his wife \u201ccandid, sincere and credible witnesses\u201d and the facts \u201cto be as complainant\u2019s witnesses have recited them.\u201d She accepted Dr. Goldman\u2019s unopposed expert testimony. She summarized his testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">Dr. Goldman defined obesity as a compilation of fat in body tissue and stated that the known causes of obesity were overeating and heredity. He added that a person\u2019s metabolism plays a role in causing the condition. He described complainant as obese and used that term interchangeably with the term overweight. \u201cThere\u2019s no question ... in this case,\u201d he said. Dr. Goldman described the factors he considers in determining whether a person is obese or overweight; he indicated that there are several charts which prescribe normal ranges but stated that he makes a determination based upon his experiences, considering a person\u2019s height, frame, bone structure, appearance and age, and added that he considers blood pressure in determining what medication to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>prescribe. It was Dr. Goldman\u2019s opinion that the normal range for complainant\u2019s age and frame was 180 to 200 pounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">In response to a question from respondent\u2019s counsel, \u201cDid you make any diagnosis of Mr. Gimello as to whether his particular overweight was due to overeating or was heredity?\u201d, Dr. Goldman responded, \u201cThat\u2019s hard to state. It can be heredity and it can be overeating. It can be both,\u201d and he concluded that any particular diagnosis in this area was \u201cnot possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">As noted, Dr. Goldman found that Gimello\u2019s obesity \u201chas no bearing on his ability to perform his duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The AU concluded that Gimello \u201csuffered from a physical condition perceived by his employer as constituting a handicap and accordingly the provisions of the Law Against Discrimination apply to protect him.\u201d Since he was performing up to legitimate expectations the burden shifted to the employer to establish \u201csome legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the termination.\u201d She found that Agency\u2019s evidence was essentially unreliable hearsay, incredible, irrelevant or undocumented. She was not persuaded that Gimello caused any higher turnover than normal, if such a situation existed, which she doubted. She found the termination a \u201cdirect result of unlawful discrimination on the basis of obesity\u201d and the reasons given \u201cmerely a pretext for discharging complainant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Then-Director of the Division of Civil Rights Hawkins concurred in her findings of fact and conclusions of law in all respects on liability. He concluded that the defense was pretextual and without support. He found that \u201cbased upon the limited medical record in the present case, ... complainant has established that his obesity falls within the ambit of the LAD\u2019s definition of \u2018handicapped\u2019.\u201d He concluded that obesity may not be a handicap in \u201call cases\u201d but the proof was sufficient in this case, whether considered an actual or perceived handicap.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">Appellant Agency attacks the decision of the Director on several grounds. It contends: (1) the decision that Gimello is handicapped within the meaning of LAD is not based on sufficient credible evidence; (2) the LAD does not include perception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>of handicap but even if it does, the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict; (3) the burden of proof was improperly shifted and appellant\u2019s defense should have prevailed; (4) the finding of agency is unsupported, and (5) damages were improperly calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Agency does not seem to contend that obesity can never be considered a handicap subject of the the LAD. Indeed at oral argument Agency\u2019s able counsel said forthrightly that \u201cwe do not argue that obesity could not be a handicap, only that he did not establish that it was in this case.\u201d Counsel for Agency also contended that this is not a true \u201cperception of handicap case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">We conclude that the record adequately supports the factual findings and the legal conclusion that Gimello was a victim of discrimination because of his obesity. We do not think it matters particularly whether his condition is dubbed an actual or perceived handicap. It was a recognized medical condition for which he sought legitimate treatment with but modest success. The record supports the conclusion that he was fired because of this physical condition which his supervisors perceived as a defect and which did not in fact disqualify him in any proven sense from his present job or his career path.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Our scope of review on the facts and reasonably drawn inferences from them is a limited one. We must survey the record and decide if there is sufficient credible, competent evidence in the record to support the Director\u2019s conclusions. <em>Clowes v. Terminix Int\u2019l Inc., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>575, 587, 538 A.2d 794 (1988). We can only reverse if the decision is plainly unwarranted and manifestly mistaken. <em>Id. </em>at 588-589, 538 <em>A.</em>2d 794. We cannot so conclude on this record and we accept the findings in the Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">Our Supreme Court has adopted the approach followed in <em>Loeb v. Textron Inc., </em>600 F.2d 1003 (1st Cir.1979), as the model for a <em>prima facie </em>case of employment discrimination in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>discharge cases. <em>Clowes v. Terminix Int\u2019l Inc., supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 596-597, 538 A.2d 794. Those <em>prima facie </em>elements are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\">1. That the employee was in the protected group;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">2. that he was performing his job at a level that met his employer\u2019s legitimate expectations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">3. that he nevertheless was fired;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">4. that the employer sought someone to perform the same work after he left. <em>[Id. </em>at 597, citing <em>Loeb, </em>600 <em>F.2&amp; </em>at 1014.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">AU Duncan applied these elements in her decision. The first element is really the issue on this appeal. While the parties differ over Gimello\u2019s job performance, the record supports the Division\u2019s finding that he met this one of the four prongs. The third and fourth elements are not in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Though the Director found that Gimello adequately established his obesity as a \u201chandicap\u201d under the LAD, he approached the subject cautiously and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">I find it unnecessary to resolve every issue raised by Respondents concerning the AU\u2019s finding that obesity is a handicap within the Law Against Discrimination since that finding is not determinative of the outcome of this case. In addition to finding that obesity is a handicap under the LAD, the AU also found that \u201cComplainant suffered from a physical condition perceived by his employer as constituting a handicap and accordingly the provisions of the Law Against Discrimination apply to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">The Director found that Agency\u2019s perception of Gimello as handicapped by his obesity \u201cestablished] an independent basis\u201d for finding that Gimello was a member of the class protected by the LAD. The Director also found that Dr. Goldman\u2019s limited but unrefuted testimony sufficed to show that Gimello\u2019s obesity was a handicap within the \u201cbroad intendment\u201d of the statute. He noted, however, that he found Goldman\u2019s \u201climited evidence insufficient [on which] to base a finding that in all cases obesity should be considered a handicap.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">In finding Gimello\u2019s obesity to be a handicap covered by the LAD, the Director relied heavily on <em>Clowes v. Terminix Int\u2019l Inc., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>575, 538 A.2d 794 (1988). In <em>Clowes, </em>our Supreme Court recognized that alcoholism is a handicap within the meaning of LAD, though the plaintiff there failed to offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>sufficient evidence of his own alcoholism to prove that he had the handicap of alcoholism. <em>Id. </em>at 592-595, 538 A.2d 794. In his opinion, Justice Clifford noted that the complainant\u2019s unrefuted expert testimony established that \u201calcoholism is a disease with both mental and physical manifestations\u201d and that the causes of the disease \u201chave not been definitely identified.\u201d The court decided that the definition of \u201chandicapped\u201d in the LAD was sufficiently broad to include alcoholism as described by the unrefuted expert testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 593, 538 A.2d 794. The Director here similarly decided that obesity is within the broad remedial sweep of the LAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The issue of obesity as a handicap is novel in New Jersey. Our Law Against Discrimination generally provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">It shall be unlawful employment practice, or, as the case may be, an unlawful discrimination:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">a. For an employer, because of the race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, sex or atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait of any individual, or because of the liability for service in the Armed Forces of the United States or the nationality of any individual, to refuse to hire or employ or to bar or to discharge or require to retire, unless justified by lawful considerations other than age, from employment such individual or to discriminate against such individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment. [N.J.S.A. 10:5-12].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">The legislature first amended the LAD in 1972, L.1972, <em>c. </em>114, to include \u201chandicap\u201d as a prohibited basis for job-related decision-making and in 1978 amended the pertinent language to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">All of the provisions of the act to which this act is a supplement shall be construed to prohibit any unlawful discrimination against any person because such person is or has been at any time handicapped or any unlawful employment practice against such person, unless the nature and extent of the handicap reasonably precludes the performance of the particular employment. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-4.1, L.1978, c. 137, \u00a7 1].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Our statute defines \u201chandicapped\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6r\">suffering from physical disability, infirmity, malformation or disfigurement which is caused by bodily injury, birth defect or illness including epilepsy, and which shall include, but not be limited to, any degree of paralysis, amputation, lack of physical coordination, blindness or visual impediment, deafness or hearing impediment, muteness or speech impediment or physical reliance on a service or guide dog, wheelchair, or other remedial appliance or device, or from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>any mental, psychological or developmental disability resulting from anatomical, psychological, physiological or neurological conditions which prevents the normal exercise of any bodily or mental functions or is demonstrable, medically or psychologically, by accepted clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5 q].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">New courts, state or federal, have addressed the issue of obesity as a handicap. Those which have addressed the issue understandably have found it troubling.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In <em>Philadelphia Elec. Co. [PECO] v. Pennsylvania Human Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>68 <em>Pa.Commw. </em>212, 448 A.2d 701 (1982), the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court overruled the Human Relations Commission\u2019s [HRC] determination that the complainant was handicapped and that PECO illegally discriminated against her on the basis of her handicap. The Pennsylvania statute did not contain a definition of \u201chandicap,\u201d though the HRC adopted regulations defining the term after the complainant filed her claim. The court used these definitions from Webster\u2019s Dictionary in making the decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">handicap: ... a disadvantage that makes achievement unusually difficult; esp: a physical disability____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">disability: ... a physical or mental illness, injury, or condition that incapacitates in any way____ [/d. 448 A2d at 706.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">The opinion also cited \u201cwith approval\u201d the Human Relations Commission regulation which defined a \u201chandicapped or disabled person,\u201d in part, as someone who \u201chas a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The New Jersey LAD has no such \u201cmajor life activities handicap\u201d requirement. In the PECO decision, Judge MacPhail found that though a morbidly obese person could be handicapped within the meaning of the statute, morbid obesity alone would not qualify as a handicap. He also found that the complainant was not a handicapped individual, noting specifically that she \u201chad none of the diseases, none of the physical restrictions [and] none of the physiological characteristics\u201d to which obese people are susceptible. <em>Id. </em>at 707. A recent decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court seems to agree with this position. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number><em>wealth Pennsylvania Human Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>\u2014 <em>Pa. </em>\u2014, 591 A.2d 281 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">In <em>Greene v. Union Pac. R.R., </em>548 <em>F.Supp. </em>3 (W.D.Wash. 1981), the judge decided that a complainant\u2019s obesity, \u201cborderline hypertension,\u201d and osteoarthritis of the spine were not \u201chandicaps\u201d as defined in the Washington law prohibiting employment discrimination. The Washington statute did not actually define \u201chandicap.\u201d The judge stated that the hypertension and osteoarthritis did not \u201cinterfere with plaintiff\u2019s normal day-to-day activities\u201d and that obesity was not a handicap because obesity \u201cwas not an immutable condition such as blindness or lameness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. The judge also found that even if obesity was a handicap, the employer\u2019s height and weight requirements pertaining to the firefighter\u2019s job plaintiff sought were <em>bona fide </em>occupational qualifications permitted by the Washington law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">However, in <em>State Div. of Human Rights v. Xerox, </em>65 <em>N.Y.2d </em>213, 480 <em>N.E.2d </em>695, 491 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>106 (1985), the New York Court of Appeals upheld the trial court\u2019s finding that obesity was a handicap within that state\u2019s anti-discrimination statute. The New York statute provided that a disability may be a physical, mental or medical impairment which either prevents \u201cthe exercise of a normal bodily function\u201d or is \u201cdemonstrable by medically accepted clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques.\u201d 480 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 698, 491 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>at 109. Judge Wachtler rejected the employer\u2019s contention that the law covered only \u201cimmutable disabilities\u201d; he found that \u201cthe statute protects all persons with disabilities and not just those with hopeless conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He also found that the complainant\u2019s obesity was a \u201cmedical condition\u201d that was \u201cclinically diagnosed\u201d in accordance with the statutory definition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Several other cases considered the issue but left it unresolved. In <em>Oregon State Correctional Inst. v. Bureau of Labor, </em>98 <em>Or.App. </em>548, 780 <em>P.2d </em>743 (1989), the judge remanded the case to the Commissioner of Labor to settle previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>undecided issues on the definition of \u201chandicapped.\u201d <em>Id. </em>780 P.2d at 747-48. In <em>Krein v. Marian Manor Nursing Home, </em>415 <em>N.W.2d </em>793 (N.D.1987), the Supreme Court of North Dakota did not reject the contention that obesity may be a handicap, but required a complainant to make a showing of impaired abilities before she could proceed in a handicap discrimination suit. 415 <em>N.W.</em>2d at 796. The North Dakota statute did not define \u201cphysical or mental handicap\u201d or \u201cdisability,\u201d so the Court turned to Webster\u2019s Dictionary to find \u201cdisability\u201d defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">a physical or mental illness, injury or condition that hinders, impedes or incapacities</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">and \u201chandicap\u201d defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">a disadvantage that makes achievement unusually difficult esp. a physical disadvantage that limits the capacity to work. <em>Id. </em>at 795-796.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The claimant in <em>Krein </em>denied that her obesity disabled her at all and offered no expert testimony \u201cequating [her obesity] to a disability or showing how it impaired her abilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Missouri Court of Appeals in <em>Missouri Comm\u2019n on Human Rights v. Southwestern Bell Tel., </em>699 <em>S.W.2d </em>75 (Mo.Ct.App.1985), held that obesity alone is \u201cprobably not\u201d a handicap under the Missouri law. <em>Id. </em>at 77. The Missouri statute defined \u201chandicap\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">[a] physical or mental impairment resulting in a disability unrelated to a person\u2019s ability to perform the duties of a particular job or position for which he would otherwise be eligible and qualified for employment or promotion. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">The judge refused to find that the complainant\u2019s untreated hypertension, alone or coupled with her obesity, constituted a handicap, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">by ignoring the situation and taking no steps to treat and control her impairment [complainant] cannot get the benefit of the handicap law. <em>Id. </em>at 79.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">Of recent note, in <em>Salve Regina College v. Russell, </em>499 <em>U.S. </em>\u2014, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>1217, 113 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>190 (1991), the plaintiff recovered a verdict in federal District Court for breach of an implied agreement to educate her in the nursing program because she was asked to leave the college on account of her obesity. The federal Supreme Court ruling concerned the duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>of a federal Circuit Court to review the District Court judge\u2019s findings on applicable Rhode Island State contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Both the AIJ and the Director remarked on the succinctness of Dr. Goldman\u2019s unopposed expert testimony here. Despite its brevity, based on his testimony we think that an obese person may be considered \u201chandicapped\u201d under our statute which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">\u201cHandicapped\u201d means suffering ... from any mental, psychological or developmental disability resulting from anatomical, psychological, physiological or neurological conditions which ... is demonstrable, medically or psychologically, by accepted clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5q.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">This is a very broad definition. Undisputedly, Gimello\u2019s obesity exists physiologically and is demonstrable by accepted diagnostic techniques.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">The analytical tools used in <em>Clowes v. Terminix Int\u2019l Inc. </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 590-595, 538 A.2d 794, point almost inexorably towards an affirmance of the Division of Civil Rights. The Court started \u201cfrom the perspective that because the LAD is remedial social legislation, it is deserving of a liberal construction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 590, 538 A.2d 794. The Court reminded us that \u201cin <em>Andersen v. Exxon, </em>[89 <em>N.J. </em>483, 446 A.2d 486 (1982) ] we \u2018adhered to a broad interpretation\u2019 of the Law with regard to the physically handicapped, rejecting the employer\u2019s contention that the Law is restricted in scope only to \u2018severe\u2019 disabilities.\u201d <em>Clowes v. Terminix Intern., Inc., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 590, 538 A.2d at 796. The Court \u201calso place[d] great weight on the interpretation given to the statute by the agency charged with its enforcement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court recalled that the general purpose of the LAD is to fulfill those provisions of the State Constitution that guarantee civil rights and the specific purpose was to eliminate all forms of discrimination in employment based on a person\u2019s physical makeup. <em>Id. </em>at 591, 538 A.2d 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">In <em>Clowes, </em>Justice Clifford reminds us that \u201cthe statutory definition of \u2018handicapped\u2019 is very broad in scope\u201d and \u201cthe Law does not [with few exceptions] define the specific conditions that fall within its sweep.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593, 538 A.2d 794. He points out that in <em>Andersen v. Exxon, supra, </em>and <em>Panettieri v. C. V. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>Hill Refrigeration, </em>159 <em>N.J.Super. </em>472, 388 A.2d 630 (App.Div.1978), the prevailing plaintiffs both suffered from handicaps not specifically defined in the LAD, <em>i.e., </em>spinal ailment and heart attack. He then concludes that since alcoholism is a disease that manifests itself both physically and psychologically, it falls within the LAD. We think obesity must also.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The Director also found that the AU\u2019s decision that Agency discriminated against Gimello due to a \u201cperceived handicap\u201d provided an \u201cindependent basis\u201d for finding in favor of Gimello. Agency contends on appeal that the LAD does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of a perceived handicap. In the alternative Agency asserts that if perceived-handicap discrimination is covered by the LAD, the AU and Director based their decisions on insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Both the AU and the Director relied on <em>Rogers v. Campbell Foundry Co., </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>109, 447 A.2d 589 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>529, 453 A.2d 852 (1982), in deciding that the LAD addresses the perceived-handicap theory of coverage. In <em>Rogers </em>Judge Antell found that an employer discriminated against a complainant who had a \u201cprominent hilar shadow on his left side.\u201d 185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 111, 447 A.2d 589. The Director had found that Rogers\u2019 condition was normal and non-disabling and that the employer nevertheless denied employment to the complainant as a matter of \u201ccompany policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Judge Antell held that even though the complainant was not actually \u201chandicapped\u201d within the LAD\u2019s definitions, the LAD\u2019s prohibition against discrimination applied to cases where the complainant\u2019s condition is non-disabling. <em>Id. </em>at 112-113, 447 A.2d 589. Judge Antell noted the Supreme Court\u2019s apparent approval of the perceived-handicap theory of discrimination in <em>Andersen v. Exxon Co., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>483, 495 n. 2, 446 A.2d 486 (1982), in part as the basis for the decision in <em>Rogers. </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 112-113, 447 A.2d 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In <em>Andersen, </em>our Supreme Court found that the complainant offered sufficient evidence to demonstrate his spinal and lum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>bar disc \u201cailments\u201d to support a finding that he was \u201chandicapped\u201d within the LAD. 89 <em>N.J. </em>at 494, 446 A.2d 486. The Court, while distinguishing <em>Andersen </em>from a perceived handicap case, noted the \u201cimplications\u201d of the perceived-handicap theory that were present \u201cwhere the employer has determined that the complainant\u2019s condition was serious enough to deny him employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495 n. 2, 446 A.2d 486. <em>See also Poff v. Caro, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>370, 549 A.2d 900 (Law Div.1987), where the Director obtained a preliminary injunction in a case involving discrimination by a landlord against three homosexual men whom he refused to lease to because he feared they might contact AIDS. The prospective tenants did not in fact have AIDS and were not \u201chandicapped\u201d under the LAD. <em>Id. </em>at 377, 549 A.2d 900. Nevertheless, Judge Humphreys issued the injunction, stating that \u201c[distinguishing between actual and perceived handicaps makes no sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He noted that the LAD could not be \u201creasonably read\u201d to allow a landlord to discriminate against someone whom he erroneously thought was a member of a religious or racial minority, since that interpretation would only protect against discrimination in cases where the wrongdoer accurately perceived the discriminatee\u2019s \u201cclassification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377-378, 549 A.2d 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">In June 1985 the DCR adopted rules specifying that the LAD includes a prohibition of discrimination on the basis of a perceived handicap. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-1.3(1) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">\u201cHandicap\u201d as used in this chapter will have the same meaning as that term is given by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5(q). It is also unlawful to take any action prohibited by these regulations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">1. Because of a perception or belief that an individual suffers from a handicap, whether or not that individual is actually handicapped____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Agency contends that this regulation is an attempt by the DCR to legislate without authority through regulations. DCR calls the regulation \u201cmerely a codification of the Division\u2019s longstanding interpretation\u201d and of the <em>Rogers </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Our search discloses that courts in other jurisdictions have interpreted their states\u2019 anti-discrimination laws consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>the perceived handicap principle. In <em>Barnes v. Washington Natural Gas Co., </em>22 <em>Wash.App. </em>576, 591 P.2d 461 (Wash.Ct.App.1979), the court reversed the trial judge\u2019s decision dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s handicap discrimination claim. The trial judge had found that the plaintiff could not pursue the claim because he was not \u201chandicapped.\u201d 591 P.2d at 462-63. The Washington statute did not specifically prohibit discrimination on the basis of a perceived handicap. <em>Id., </em>591 P.2d at 463. The plaintiff had been fired because his employer erroneously believed that he had epilepsy. <em>Id., </em>591 P.2d at 462. The Washington intermediate court allowed plaintiff to proceed with his claim, holding that the \u201cclass protected by the statute is those persons whom the employer discharges or intends to discharge because he believes the person is afflicted with a \u2018mental, sensory, or physical handicap.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>591 P.2d at 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In <em>Dairy Equip. Co. v. Department of Indus., </em>95 Wis.2d 319, 290 <em>N.W.2d </em>330 (1980), the Wisconsin Supreme Court decided that an employer which fired an employee because the employee had only one kidney had illegally discriminated. The Wisconsin statute did not contain a definition of the word \u201chandicapped\u201d and the lower court turned to Webster\u2019s dictionary to find \u201chandicapped\u201d defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqn\">... a disadvantage that makes achievement unusually difficult; esp. a physical disability that limits the capacity to work. [290 <em>N.W.2d </em>at 335.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Since the complainant in <em>Dairy Equip, </em>was fully functional, he had no \u201cdisadvantage that ma[de] achievement unusually difficult\u201d and was not \u201chandicapped\u201d within the dictionary definition. <em>Id. </em>The Wisconsin Supreme Court agreed with the trial judge, holding that the employer illegally perceived the complainant as handicapped. Though the language of the statute did not specifically cover perceived handicaps, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">It would be both ironic and insidious if the legislative intent in providing the protection of the Pair Employment Act were afforded to persons who actually have a handicap that makes \u201cachievement unusually difficult\u201d or limits their capacity to work, but the same protection is denied to those whom employers perceive as being handicapped. <em>[Id. </em>at 335].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>In any event, we do not think the \u201cperceived handicap\u201d issue is critical to our decision here. The fact is that Gimello was obese, as demonstrated by unrefuted medical evidence. The employer\u2019s actual perception may not be particularly important when a real medical or pathological condition exists. The important point is that the record supports the Director\u2019s finding that the employer terminated Gimello because of a condition covered by the broad language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5q which condition did not prevent him from doing his job. This is employment discrimination under the LAD and is actionable. This type of prejudice \u201cis the fountainhead of discrimination engulfing medical disabilities which prove on examination to be unrelated to job performance or to be non-existent.\u201d <em>Barnes v. Washington, </em>22 <em>Wash.App. </em>576, 591 <em>P.2d </em>461, 465 (Wash.Ct.App.1979), cited with approval, <em>Andersen v. Exxon Co., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 495 n. 2, 446 A.2d 486. <em>See Jansen v. Food Circus Supermarkets Inc., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>363, 541 A.2d 682 (1988), where Justice Pollack says: \u201cThe essence of discrimination ... is the formulation of opinions about others not on their individual merits, but on their membership in a class with assumed characteristics.\u201d 110 <em>N.J. </em>at 378, 541 A.2d 682. We affirm the Director\u2019s decision finding unlawful employment discrimination Gimello because of his obesity.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">We reject appellant Agency\u2019s contentions that the complainant\u2019s ultimate burden of proof was not met or was improperly shifted, that the defense of justifiable termination should have prevailed as a matter of law, and that principles of agency law should not impute liability here. They are clearly without merit and require no discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(l)(D) and (E). We conclude from the record that complainant shouldered and fully carried his burden of proof. Obviously, the AU found Agency\u2019s proofs completely unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">We turn to the issues of damages. Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-17 the Director ordered Agency<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to pay Gimello the following as damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">1. back pay from June 10, 1983 to the date of the Director\u2019s decision [April 17, 1989]; less Gimello\u2019s interim earnings and value of a car he used while at Insurance Rent-A-Car; plus prejudgment interest on the award pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:42-11.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">2. $2,876.31 as \u201cincidental compensatory damages\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">3. $10,000 for \u201cpain, humiliation and suffering;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-11\">4. attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">Employer claims that (1) back pay should stop accruing when Gimello found \u201ccomparable employment,\u201d (2) the Director improperly valued the car Gimello used at Insurance Rent-A-Car, and (3) 1983 backpay figure was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">A. BACK PAY FOR 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">The parties agree that the Director used the wrong figure for Gimello\u2019s 1983 income. The Director used $10,659.58 but Gimello earned $12,058.63. Accordingly, the back pay award should be reduced by $1,399.05 and interest should be recomputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\">B. BACK PAY ACCRUAL AFTER GIMELLO BECAME EMPLOYED WITH INSURANCE RENT-A-CAR.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-16\">Employer contends that once Gimello became employed by Insurance Rent-A-Car on October 3, 1984 the back-pay award should stop accruing. We disagree. Employer\u2019s reliance upon <em>Goodman v. London Metals Exchange, Inc., </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>19, 429 A.2d 341 (1981), in support of this assertion is misplaced. <em>Goodman </em>states that back-pay accrual ceases when the complainant becomes \u201cemployed in an equivalently paying position.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 429 A.2d 341. Though Gimello\u2019s job at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Insurance Rent-A-Car was certainly \u201ccomparable employment\u201d appropriate to mitigate Gimello\u2019s damages, see <em>Goodman, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 36, 429 A.2d 341, it did not provide \u201cequivalent pay\u201d as <em>Goodman </em>mandates. Ordinarily back pay accrues from the date of discharge to the date of the decision and is reduced by interim earnings. <em>Goodman, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 34, 429 A.2d 341, <em>see also Herrin v. Newton Cent. Appraisal Dist., </em>687 <em>F.Supp. </em>1072, 1078 (E.D.Tex.1987), <em>new trial denied </em>706 <em>F.Supp. </em>511 (E.D.Tex.1988); <em>Ackerman v. Western Elec. Co., </em>643 <em>F.Supp. </em>836, 855 (N.D.Cal.1986), <em>affd, </em>860 <em>F.2d </em>1514 (9th Cir.1988). \u201cThe basic purpose of awarding back pay is to make the discriminatee whole by reimbursement of the economic loss suffered, though it should correlatively discourage and deter unlawful discrimination.\u201d <em>Goodman, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>34-35, 429 A.2d 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Insurance Rent-A-Car paid Gimello a starting base salary of $14,000 annually, which increased in $1,000 increments to $25,-000 by November 1987, when the hearing started. Until 1987 Insurance Rent-A-Car did not have a program for bonuses but did provide a company car for Gimello to use, a benefit he did not enjoy at Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">At least until 1987, Gimello did not earn pay equivalent to what he would have been paid had Agency not fired him. In 1987 Gimello\u2019s earnings exceeded the comparable salary he might have made if he were working for Agency. Agency contends that Gimello\u2019s achievement of equivalent pay terminates its obligation for back pay, even though in 1988 Gimello earned somewhat less than the amount paid by Agency. We agree that the award of back-pay terminates as of 1987 when the earnings became equivalent.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">C. THE DIRECTOR\u2019S CALCULATION OF BACK PAY.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">In calculating the back pay the Director compared Gimello\u2019s interim earnings to the sum earned by Agency\u2019s highest-paid office manager. Agency asserts that rather than using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>the highest-paid manager\u2019s salary for comparison, the Director should have used Gimello\u2019s successor\u2019s salary to determine the correct amount of back pay. Here is a comparison between Agency\u2019s highest-paid manager\u2019s salary and Gimello\u2019s successor\u2019s salary for the years in implicated:</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Highest Gimello\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">paid manager successor</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">1983 $24,100.00 $21,806.89</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">1984 $24,778.96 $23,644.16</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">1985 $24,130.10 $20,885.80</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">1986 $26,478.55 $27,313.47</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">1987 $26,760.97 $23,431.01</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">Gimello asserts that the Director used the correct salary for comparison because his successor\u2019s earnings were not a proper reflection of what a more experienced manager might earn. We affirm the Director\u2019s method. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-17 provides the Director with substantial discretion to order appropriate remedies upon finding a party liable. <em>Talman v. Board of Trustees, </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>535, 541-542, 405 A.2d 423 (App.Div.) <em>certif. denied, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>407, 408 <em>A.</em>2d 801 (1979); see <em>Jackson v. Concord Co., </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>113, 126-128, 253 A.2d 793 (1969). The salaries of Agency\u2019s highest-paid manager and of Gimello\u2019s successor were not so disparate that choosing either for purposes of comparison constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">D. THE VALUE OF THE CAR IN COMPUTING GIMELLO\u2019S INTERIM EARNINGS.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">Insurance Rent-A-Car provided Gimello with a company car each year during his employment. The AU accepted Agency\u2019s method of placing a value on the car in order to calculate Gimello\u2019s mitigation of damages. Agency asserted that the method advanced by its treasurer, Edward Hammer, was the appropriate method to place a value on the car. Hammer described a lengthy calculation on the value of the car and concluded that the result of his calculation represented the amount \u201cGimello would have had to earn to buy that asset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The Director rejected the AU\u2019s decision to rely on Hammer\u2019s calculations. The Director instead employed the IRS\u2019s methodology to determine the value of the car to Gimello. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adk\">I find it inappropriate to attribute a value to an employee benefit far beyond that which the Federal Government attributes to that same employee for that same benefit. I know of no legal precedent for such a formulation and find that the methodology urged by Respondents will only serve to burden future litigation on such issues with the necessity of expert testimony when the IRS has already developed an acceptable alternative valuation of the same benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The computation ordered by the Director reflects the amount that the IRS would consider taxable income to Gimello. We affirm the Director\u2019s decision. We fail to see why the value of the car for IRS purposes is not a suitable figure for determining mitigation of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">E. THE DELAY IN THE DECISION AND THE EFFECT ON DAMAGES.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Agency asserts that it should not be \u201cpenalized\u201d for the DCR\u2019s delay in arriving at a final decision. Gimello filed his complaint in July 1983. The Director filed his decision on liability in April 1989. The Director filed the final order specifying damages in April 1990. Agency cites <em>EEOC v. Peterson Howell and Heather Inc., </em>702 <em>F.Supp. </em>1213 (D.Md.1989), in support of its argument. In <em>Peterson, </em>the District Court held that the EEOC could not recover damages on behalf of a class of Title VII discrimination victims because the EEOC had inexplicably delayed filing suit. Though a charge was filed with the EEOC in September 1980, the EEOC did not file a lawsuit until five years and two months later in November 1985. The employer received the complaint in January 1986. The judge held that the doctrine of laches will bar a plaintiff\u2019s recovery when the defendant employer is able to demonstrate prejudice from \u201cunreasonable or unexplained delay in bringing proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Unlike the situation in <em>Peterson, </em>however, Gimello filed his claim almost immediately after he was fired. Five years and nine months elapsed between Gimello\u2019s filing a claim with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>DCR and the Director\u2019s decision on liability. Though this passage of time is similar to that in <em>Peterson, </em>Agency has not demonstrated that there was any \u201cdelay in bringing proceedings\u201d by Gimello or how it was unfairly prejudiced by the unfortunately lengthy duration of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">We affirm the Director\u2019s decision on liability but modify the damage award, as indicated. We remand without retention of jurisdiction for calculation and modification of the damage award consistent with our ruling within 30 days.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-17\">The claims against Brindisi and Garrenton as individuals were dismissed by the ALJ. There is no cross-appeal pressed from the dismissals as to these individuals.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
