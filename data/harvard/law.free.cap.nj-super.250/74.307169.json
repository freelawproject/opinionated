The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence discovered in his automobile. Thereafter, defendant entered into a plea bargain with the State pursuant to which he pled guilty to possession of a handgun without a permit and the State agreed to dismiss the remaining charges. The court sentenced defendant to a four year term of imprisonment for the weapons offense. Defendant appeals from the order denying his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">Defendant was stopped for speeding on Route 527 in Manalapan Township on August 19, 1989, based on a radar clocking which indicated he had been traveling 51 miles per hour in a 40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>mile per hour zone. A check of defendant\u2019s driving credentials disclosed that his license was suspended. Defendant was directed to get out of the car, placed under arrest, handcuffed and put in the back seat of the patrol car. The arresting officer then returned to the car and directed the two passengers, Bernardo and Pierce, to get out and produce some form of identification. After examining this identification, the officer searched the passenger compartment of the car, which revealed a camera case containing a handgun and a jacket containing a cellophane packet with a small amount of cocaine. The officer estimated that approximately two to three minutes elapsed between when he put defendant in the back seat of the patrol car and when he searched the passenger compartment of defendant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">In an oral opinion delivered on June 8, 1990, the trial court concluded that the search of the passenger compartment of defendant\u2019s vehicle incident to his arrest was valid under the rule set forth in <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 <em>U.S. </em>454, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2860, 69 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>768 (1981). We agree and therefore affirm the denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\"><em>Belton </em>holds that \u201cwhen a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2864, 69 L.Ed.2d at 775. Moreover, the permissible scope of such a search extends to the contents of any containers found within the passenger compartment. <em>Id. </em>at 460-62, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2864-65, 69 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d at 775-76. The Court further indicated that the validity of a search of the passenger compartment of the arrestee\u2019s vehicle and the containers located therein does not require any showing that the search probably will reveal weapons or evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">It is true, of course, that these containers will sometimes be such that they could hold neither a weapon nor evidence of the criminal conduct for which the suspect was arrested. However, in <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>the Court rejected the argument that such a container \u2014 there a \u201ccrumpled up cigarette <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>package\u201d \u2014 located during a search of Robinson incident to his arrest could not be searched: \u201cThe authority to search the person incident to a lawful custodial arrest, while based upon the need to disarm and to discover evidence, does not depend on what a court may later decide was the probability in a particular arrest situation that weapons or evidence would in fact be found upon the person of the suspect. A custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment: that intrusion being lawful, a search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification.\u201d [453 <em>U.S. </em>at 461; 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2864, 69 L.Ed.2d at 775-76 (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 <em>U.S. </em>218, 235, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>467, 477, 38 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>427, 440-41 (1973))].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-6\"><em>See also State v. Colvin, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>428, 435, 587 <em>A.</em>2d 1278 (1991) (To sustain a <em>Belton </em>search incident to an arrest, \u201cthere need be no probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Defendant does not dispute that he was under arrest when the passenger compartment of his automobile was searched. Nor does he question the legality of his arrest or the fact that the search was conducted immediately after his arrest. Therefore, the search in this case was a contemporaneous incident of a lawful custodial arrest of an occupant of an automobile, which is authorized by <em>Belton. See also United States v. Schecter, </em>717 F.2d 864, 867-68 (3d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The validity of the search is not affected by the circumstance that defendant no longer had effective access to his vehicle when the search was conducted. As pointed out by Professor LaFave:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">[U]nder <em>Belton </em>a search of the vehicle is allowed even after the defendant was removed from it, handcuffed, and placed in the squad car, or even if a single defendant was in the custody of several officers. [3 W. LaFave, <em>Search &amp; Seizure </em>\u00a7 7.1(e) at 15-16 (2d ed. 1987) (footnotes omitted)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-10\"><em>Accord United States v. White, </em>871 <em>F</em>.2d 41, 43-44 (6th Cir. 1989); <em>United States v. Karlin, </em>852 F.2d 968, 970-72 (7th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>1021, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1142, 103 L.Ed.2d 202 (1989); <em>United States v.

Fladebo, </em>113 <em>Wash.3d </em>388, 779 P.2d 707, 711-13 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The validity of the search is also not affected by the circumstance that defendant\u2019s arrest was for a motor vehicle offense. <em>See United States v. White, supra, </em>871 F.2d at 43-44; <em>United States v. Pino, </em>855 F.2d 357, 363-64 (6th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>US. </em>\u2014, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>1160, 107 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1063 (1990); <em>Traylor v. State, supra, </em>458 A.2d at 1173-75; <em>State v. Garcia, </em>801 <em>S.W.2d </em>137, 141 (Tex.Ct.App.1990); <em>State v. Quintero-Quintero, </em>60 <em>Wash.App. </em>902, 808 <em>P.2d </em>183, 185 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">This case is significantly different from <em>State v. Barksdale, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>404, 540 A.2d 901 (App.Div.1988), in which this court invalidated a search of the interior of an automobile conducted more than ten minutes after the arrest of its occupants and after the automobile had been pushed manually for seventy-five feet. The court in <em>Barksdale </em>characterized this search as \u201canything but \u2018a contemporaneous incident of that arrest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415, 540 A.2d 901; <em>see also United States v. Vasey, </em>834 F.2d 782, 787-88 (9th Cir.1987) (warrantless search of automobile conducted anywhere from thirty to forty-five minutes after defendant was arrested, handcuffed and placed in rear of patrol car was not contemporaneous with the arrest). In contrast, the search in this case was conducted immediately after defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">We also reject the suggestion in defendant\u2019s brief that we should construe the New Jersey Constitution to impose a more restrictive limitation upon the search of an automobile incident to the arrest of an occupant than the Supreme Court of the United States set forth in <em>Belton. </em>Although the Supreme Court of New Jersey has not directly addressed this issue, <em>see State v. Alston, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>211, 235 n. 15, 440 A.2d 1311 (1981), it has noted the holding of <em>Belton </em>on several occasions without suggesting that the New Jersey Constitution should be construed to require a more restrictive approach. <em>See, e.g., State v. Colvin, supra, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>at 435, 587 A.2d 1278; <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number><em>Lund, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>35, 38, 573 A.2d 1376 (1990); <em>State v. Bruzzese, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>210, 218, 463 A.2d 320 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 <em>U.S. </em>1030, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>1295, 79 L.Ed.2d 695 (1984); <em>State v. Esteves, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>498, 506 n. 2, 461 A.2d 1128 (1983). This court also has treated <em>Belton </em>as the controlling law in New Jersey on a number of occasions. <em>See, e.g., State v. Barksdale, supra, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 412-15, 540 A.2d 901; <em>State v. Sarto, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>565, 574, 481 A.2d 281 (App.Div.1984); <em>State v. Nittolo, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>344, 346-47, 476 A.2d 1253 (App.Div.1984); <em>State v.
