After reciting the substantial evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt, we said, \u201cWe conclude that this evidence suffices to support a finding that the homicide was both knowing and purposeful and committed either in the course of committing or attempting to commit a robbery.\u201d We also rejected defendant\u2019s arguments that the victim\u2019s bloodstained shirt was erroneously admitted into evidence, that in his charge the trial judge misstated the testimony of a witness, and that the judge erroneously failed to have the jury consider the lesser crime of reckless manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">We now have before us for review Judge Sullivan\u2019s order denying defendant\u2019s petition, dated November 1,1989, for post-conviction relief. Although <em>R. </em>3:22-1 requires that a person convicted of a crime \u201cfile [a petition for post-conviction relief] with the county clerk of the county in which the convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>tion took place,\u201d there is no evidence in the record submitted to us that defendant ever did so. However, his papers were stamped \u201cReceived Nov 15 1989\u201d by Judge Sullivan. In this appeal the State argues for the first time that defendant\u2019s petition is barred by the five-year limitations rule. <em>R. </em>3:22-12. The rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">A petition to correct an illegal sentence may be filed at any time. No other petition shall be filed pursuant to this rule more than 5 years after rendition of the judgment or sentence sought to be attacked unless it alleges facts showing that the delay beyond said time was due to defendant\u2019s excusable neglect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The period between the date of defendant\u2019s sentence, November 9, 1984, and the date on which Judge Sullivan marked defendant\u2019s papers \u201creceived,\u201d November 15, 1989, exceeds the limitations period by six days.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Defendant does not claim that he is entitled to relief from the bar by \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d Rather he contends in his reply brief that Judge Sullivan delayed stamping his papers \u201creceived\u201d until after the limitations period had expired. Aside from the fact that defendant\u2019s statement in his brief is not evidence, the rule is intended to avoid such disputes by requiring the convicted person to file a petition for post-conviction relief with the county clerk where its date of receipt is routinely recorded. We therefore conclude, on the record before us, that defendant\u2019s petition is out of time and should not have been considered. Unfortunately, the State failed to raise the matter below where a fuller record could have been developed. We will therefore proceed to consider defendant\u2019s petition solely on the chance that evidence may later be discovered that the petition was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Defendant raises the following points in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-10\">I. THE FAILURE TO INDICT DEFENDANT FOR THE CRIME OF ROBBERY OR ATTEMPTED ROBBERY AND TO REQUIRE THE JURY TO CONVICT DEFENDANT OF ROBBERY OR ATTEMPTED ROBBERY AS A PREREQUISITE TO CONSIDERATION OF FELONY MURDER VIOLATED HIS RIGHTS GUARANTEED BY THE FEDERAL AND STATE CONSTITUTIONS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-11\">II. THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS WHICH DEFINED ATTEMPTED ROBBERY CONSISTENT WITH <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1 WERE UNCONSTITUTIONAL<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>LY VAGUE AS REQUIRING BUT A \u201cSUBSTANTIAL STEP\u201d TOWARD A CRIMINAL PURPOSE VIOLATING DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW GUARANTEED BY THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">III. THE STATE FAILED TO PROVE ALL ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME OF ATTEMPTED ROBBERY THEREBY VIOLATING HIS RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW GUARANTEED BY THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT AND INVALIDATING HIS FELONY MURDER CONVICTION PREMISED UPON THE KILLING BEING COMMITTED DURING AN ATTEMPTED ROBBERY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">IV. DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW UNDER THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT WAS VIOLATED WHEN THE TRIAL COURT INSTRUCTED THE JURY THE DEFENDANT MUST PROVE BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD A DIMINISHED MENTAL CAPACITY WHICH PRECLUDED HIM FROM POSSESSING THE REQUIRED STATE OF MIND TO COMMIT A KNOWING OR PURPOSEFUL MURDER.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">V. DEFENDANT WAS DENIED THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL IN VIOLATION OF HIS SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS BOTH AT TRIAL AND DURING THE PROSECUTION OF HIS DIRECT APPEAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Defendant raises the following additional points in his reply brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">I. DEFENDANT\u2019S PETITION FOR POST-CONVICTION RELIEF WAS IMPROPERLY DENIED, ANY SUGGESTION THAT THE PETITION WAS UNTIMELY, WAS NOT ENDORSED BELOW AND SHOULD NOT BE ACCEPTED BY THIS COURT, FOR THESE REASONS THERE CANNOT BE THE EXPRESS RULING THE STATE SEEKS DENYING RELIEF ON A PROCEDURAL BAR CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL DUE PROCESS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">II. THE FAILURE TO INDICT THE DEFENDANT FOR THE CRIME OF ROBBERY OR ATTEMPTED ROBBERY AND TO REQUIRE THE JURY TO CONVICT DEFENDANT OF ROBBERY OR ATTEMPTED ROBBERY AS A PREREQUISITE TO THE CONSIDERATION OF FELONY MURDER VIOLATED- HIS RIGHTS GUARANTEED BY THE FEDERAL AND STATE CONSTITUTIONS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-11\">III.

DEFENDANT WAS DENIED THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL IN VIOLATION OF HIS SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS BOTH AT TRIAL AND DURING THE PROSECUTION OF HIS DIRECT APPEAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">We are satisfied that all of defendant\u2019s arguments are barred by <em>R. </em>3:22-4, which bars post-conviction relief on grounds that could have been raised in a direct appeal from a conviction. The rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-11\">Any ground for relief not raised in a prior proceeding under this rule, or in the proceedings resulting in the conviction, or in a post-conviction proceeding brought and decided prior to the adoption of this rule, or in any appeal taken in any such proceedings is barred from assertion in a proceeding under this rule unless the court on motion or at the hearing finds (a) that the ground for relief not previously asserted could not reasonably have been raised in any prior proceeding; or (b) that enforcement of the bar would result in fundamental injustice; or (c) that denial of relief would be contrary to the Constitution of the United States or the State of New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">The trial judge correctly found no basis to overcome the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">We will nevertheless briefly discuss the diminished capacity argument, which, as defendant described it in arguing the matter below, is the \u201cmeat and potatoes\u201d of his petition. The judge who conducted the trial instructed the jury on the issue using language later approved in <em>State v. Breakiron, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>591, 532 A.2d 199 (1987) and <em>State v. Zola, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>384, 548 A.2d 1022 (1988), <em>cert. den. </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>1022, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1146, 103 L.Ed.2d 205 (1989). Thereafter, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals held in another case that such language unconstitutionally shifts the burden of proof to the defendant. <em>Humanik v. Beyer, </em>871 <em>F.2d </em>432 (3d Cir.1989), <em>cert. den. </em>493 <em>U.S. </em>812, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>57, 107 L.Ed.2d 25 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Our Supreme Court has not modified its holding in <em>Breakiron </em>and we must therefore follow it in the absence of a contrary holding by the United States Supreme Court. <em>State v. Norflett, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>268, 286, 337 <em>A.</em>2d 609 (1975). In memoranda dated October 27 and December 8, 1989, our Chief Justice directed that as a practical matter the holding in <em>Humanik </em>be followed in pending and future trials and appeals to avoid the reversal of convictions in later federal <em>habeas </em>proceedings. The memoranda do not purport to apply to post-conviction relief proceedings, so we are obliged to follow <em>Breakiron </em>unless the Chief Justice or our Supreme Court directs otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Although barred by <em>R. </em>3:22-4, we have considered the other points defendant has raised and are satisfied from a careful review of this record that they are clearly without merit and require no further discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
