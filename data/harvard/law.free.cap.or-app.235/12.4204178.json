J.</author>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">Plaintiff appeals a limited judgment, challenging the dismissal of his claims concerning alleged asbestos exposure against defendants as a sanction for his violation of a court order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Among other things, plaintiff contends on appeal that, because he was unable to comply with the court\u2019s order, the trial court abused its discretion by dismissing his case. As amplified below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The material facts are procedural. Plaintiff filed his complaint in 2004, alleging claims concerning asbestos exposure against defendants. Two attorneys, Shadduck and Niebling, from the law firm representing plaintiff were involved in the various hearings that led to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Plaintiffs case was one of several on the trial court\u2019s August 2006 asbestos docket. On August 21, the trial date for all cases on the August docket, the court held a hearing with the parties\u2019 attorneys to consider various pretrial matters, including scheduling issues and motions <em>in limine. </em>Among those motions were several that requested that the court conduct OEC 104 hearings outside the presence of the jury to determine the admissibility of expert testimony and other scientific evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">During the August 21 hearing, two decisions were made that are pertinent to the issues raised on appeal. First, the court deferred ruling on the motions <em>in limine </em>until the trial in each case had actually begun. Second, the court and the parties agreed to the \u201c48/24\u201d rule \u2014 that is, the parties agreed to disclose the identity of each expert 48 hours before the expert testified and to provide opposing counsel with each expert\u2019s file 24 hours before the expert testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Three days later, on August 24, the court held another hearing concerning plaintiffs case. By that time, plaintiffs case was one of only two cases on the August docket <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>that had not yet been resolved. Because the court was scheduled to be gone at the beginning of the following week and because the selection of a jury, for what was scheduled to be a lengthy trial, would likely be easier after Labor Day, the court set September 5 as the first day of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">In sum, as of August 24, the parties understood that plaintiffs case would proceed in the following manner: (1) Trial would begin on September 5 \u2014 that is, the Tuesday after the Labor Day holiday. (2) The motions <em>in limine </em>would be decided when each expert was scheduled to testify \u2014 that is, <em>after </em>jury selection and opening statements. (3) The \u201c48/24\u201d rule would apply to the disclosure of expert names and files.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">A week later, on August 31, the sequence of events that precipitated this appeal began. On the afternoon of August 31, at the request of the trial court, an attorney for one of the defendants sent an e-mail to the other attorneys in the case, including Niebling. That e-mail indicated that the trial court had scheduled a pretrial hearing for the next day \u2014 -that is, September 1, the Friday before the Labor Day weekend \u2014 at 10:00 a.m. According to the e-mail, one purpose of the hearing was to \u201ctake up some <em>motions </em>in limine <em>prior to trial.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Because plaintiffs other attorney, Shadduck, had planned to be out of town from the afternoon of August 31 through the morning of September 1, Niebling appeared at the hearing. While addressing the motions <em>in limine, </em>the trial court noted that plaintiffs case had \u201cstriking similarities\u201d to another case on the August asbestos docket and that \u201con [its] own motion\u201d it was \u201creconsidering\u201d and would \u201cmake an order concerning defendant\u2019s motions <em>in limine.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Specifically, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-8\">\u201cI believe that there are serious issues here concerning causation that trigger a careful analysis of the Oregon Evidence Code and are requiring * * * Rule 104 hearing[s] <em>before we bring a jury in.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">(Emphasis added.) The court identified five motions <em>in limine </em>that it intended to address during the OEC 104 hearings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>on the following Tuesday \u2014 that is, September 5 \u2014 and reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-4\">\u201cOn these motions, I\u2019m going to start Tuesday off \u2014 your case is set at 9 o\u2019clock. I\u2019m going to conduct a Rule 104 hearing, which I expect to be extensive, and deal, among other things, with these scientific evidence issues on the matters that I\u2019ve indicated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">In sum, contrary to the parties\u2019 understanding when they arrived at the hearing (and to the procedure the court had outlined as of August 24), the trial court had significantly changed course, ruling that the OEC 104 hearings concerning the pertinent motions <em>in limine </em>would occur <em>before the jury was selected </em>and not thereafter when each expert was scheduled to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">In the colloquy that followed, one defendant sought the names of plaintiffs experts so that defendants could prepare over the weekend for the Tuesday morning OEC 104 hearings. The trial court agreed. Niebling\u2019s primary response was that plaintiff would be \u201cready to go on Tuesday\u201d according to the procedure that the court had outlined as of August 24. Significantly, however, he did not object to the trial court\u2019s rulings at the hearing concerning the exchange of expert names and files and the appearance of those experts on Tuesday morning. Instead, he provided the court with the names of some of plaintiffs experts and indicated that Shadduck would have additional information that afternoon. The court concluded by cautioning plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">\u201cSo that\u2019s the sequence [in which the experts will be examined]. And plaintiff needs to have these people here and ready to go. Plaintiff is at risk, plaintiff \u2014 and I had to warn plaintiffs on [one of the other asbestos cases], if you don\u2019t have witnesses here and ready to go, you\u2019re at risk of the Court granting a motion to dismiss for failure of prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-8\">* * Hi \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">\u201cSo I also expect everyone to exchange all of the other information and documents prior to trial that\u2019s supposed to be exchanged. And things are just going to go \u2014 you know, one step after another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>The court\u2019s ruling was embodied in an order that provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-3\">\u201cIT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT an OEC Rule 104 hearing will be conducted at 9:00 a.m. on September 5, 2006. <em>At this hearing, plaintiff will bear the burden to establish the admissibility and qualification of the experts listed below and each witness will state each of their opinions and the basis for those opinions. </em>In conjunction with this Order and the Court\u2019s previous Order regarding the disclosure of an expert\u2019s entire file twenty-four hours prior to offering testimony, <em>plaintiff must produce the entire files of the experts noted, below by 5:00p.m. today, September 1, 2006.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">(Emphasis added.) The order specifically indicated that Ken Cohen was the first expert that would be subject to an OEC 104 hearing on September 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Shadduck returned to the office the afternoon of September 1. After speaking to Niebling about what had transpired\u2014and, specifically about the court\u2019s order that plaintiffs experts appear for purposes of examination at the OEC 104 hearings on the morning of September 5\u2014he delivered a letter to the trial court and defense counsel in which he implicitly asserted that the court\u2019s order was invalid because plaintiff would be unable to comply with it. Shadduck\u2019s letter named three of the four out-of-state expert witnesses that he intended to call and indicated that he had previously \u201cscheduled [his] witnesses with firm commitments\u201d to testify on September 7, 8, 11, and 12. Shadduck concluded by stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">\u201c[t]hese are all of the expert witnesses I intend to call on behalf of the Plaintiff. * * * <em>I regret to inform the court that the witnesses you would like to conduct OEC 104 hearings on will not be available until their scheduled times I have designated above. </em>I would request that the court conduct a 104 hearing at the times the respective witnesses are scheduled to appear. We will prepare and submit declarations, to the extent possible, and bring them Tuesday.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">(Emphasis added.) Plaintiff did not disclose the names of all of his experts and the experts\u2019 files by the court-ordered 5:00 p.m. deadline on September 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Thereafter, on Tuesday, September 5, the parties appeared at the time scheduled for the OEC 104 hearings. By that point, a defendant that is not a party to this appeal had moved to dismiss plaintiffs case for violation of the court\u2019s September 1 order or, alternatively, to impose other sanctions for plaintiffs discovery violations. All defendants joined in that motion, which stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-4\">\u201cPursuant to ORCP 46 B(2)(b) [(concerning the court\u2019s authority to impose a sanction for violation of a discovery order)] and/or ORCP 54 B(l) [(concerning the court\u2019s authority to dismiss a case when plaintiff fails \u2018to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court\u2019)], [defendants] move[ ] the Court for an order on the following: (1) dismissing this action based on Plaintiffs failure to provide witnesses to prove causation of Plaintiffs alleged injury for the OEC 104 hearings ordered by this Court on September 1,2006; (2) the imposition of discovery sanctions for Plaintiffs violation of the Court\u2019s order entered herein on September 1,2006, which order required Plaintiff to produce the entire file of each expert identified by him in open Court during the pre-trial hearing 24 hours before the OEC 104 hearing set for September 5, 200[6]; and (3) the exclusion of testimony by an unnamed Certified Industrial Hygienist and unnamed pathologist * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">\u201cPlaintiff has willfully violated an Order of the Court by refusing to identify his expert witnesses, refusing to produce [the] experts\u2019 files, and refusing to produce those named experts at a Court scheduled OEC 104 hearing. The court should sanction Plaintiff appropriately by excluding testimony of all Plaintiffs expert witnesses and, ultimately, dismissing this action as to all defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">As for plaintiff, Shadduck appeared at the hearing, but none of plaintiffs experts was present as ordered. Further, with one exception described in detail below, plaintiff did not submit any declarations from any of his identified expert witnesses, explaining the reasons for their nonappearance. Plaintiffs attorneys also did not submit declarations detailing their efforts between the time of the court\u2019s September 1 directive and the 9:00 a.m. hearing on September 5 to secure the attendance of the experts or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>obtain declarations from the experts substantiating valid reasons for their failure to attend as ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The court began by addressing defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiffs case for failure to comply with the court\u2019s September 1 order. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. So we\u2019ve had a number of statements and we have this motion for sanctions involving dismissing the case based on alleged violations of failing to identify expert witnesses, failing to produce files, refusal to produce expert witnesses for the [OEC] 104 hearings that I ordered to take place at 9 o\u2019clock this morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\"><em>\u201cAnd, Mr. Shadduck, based on what\u2019s been stated, I want to hear from you now entirely in terms of response to the arguments, </em>but it is my understanding * * * I did receive a letter from you and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">\u201cMR. SHADDUCK: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014and it is my understanding that essentially you\u2019re refusing to produce experts pursuant to my order of September 1. And it\u2019s now 10:07 a.m. on September 5th and you have no experts here, specifically the very first expert who we were to start with, Mr. Ken Cohen * * *. Is that \u2014 am I right that he\u2019s not here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">\u201cMR. SHADDUCK: You are correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: And that you\u2019re refusing to follow my order; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-11\">\u201cMR. SHADDUCK: I\u2019m not refusing. These witnesses simply will not be here today on their own volition. We\u2019ve contacted everybody except Mr. Richard Cohen, who was in court on Friday, as I understand it, in San Francisco.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-12\">\u201cAll three of these gentlemen, Mr. Ken Cohen, Richard Cohen, and Dr. Brodkin are all out-of-state witnesses. I have a declaration from [Dr.] Brodkin that he\u2019s in practice today in Seattle and he just simply will not fly here and be here today.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] So how you use the term \u2018refuse\u2019 or I\u2019d prefer to use the term\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Well, * * * the wording of your letter is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\">\u201cMR. SHADDUCK: \u2014they\u2019re not able.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: * * * your letter was quoted earlier and, T regret to inform the Court that the witnesses you would like to conduct an OEC 104 hearings on will not be available until their scheduled times that I have designated above.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">\u201cMR. SHADDUCK: I apologize for the type of language, but * * * they are not available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: And you \u2014 well, okay. <em>Do you have any argument?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">\u201cMR. SHADDUCK: <em>No, I don\u2019t. If the Court wants to dismiss the case, I can\u2019t say anything further.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: So, just so I understand, <em>you don\u2019t have</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\"><em>any responses to * * * what\u2019s been set out and to * * * what are contended to be grounds for the sanction of dismissal at this time </em>for essentially failing to prosecute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-11\">\u201cMR. SHADDUCK: <em>I </em>\u2014 I <em>can\u2019t make wine out of water. I can\u2019t get these gentlemen here today, not on such short notice. </em>I apologize.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b45-14\">That colloquy demonstrates that the gravamen of plaintiffs position before the trial court was that he was not subject to any sanction for his noncompliance with the September 1 order because he was unable to comply with its terms. Significantly, plaintiff did not assert to the trial court that, to the extent that he was subject to some sanction for his noncompliance, the sanction of dismissal was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-15\">Ultimately, the court dismissed plaintiffs case for failure to comply with its September 1 order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court indicated that its decision to dismiss plaintiffs case was based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>several considerations, including the following: (1) After presiding over a related case on the August docket, the court had reason to believe that plaintiff would be unable to offer <em>prima facie </em>expert proof of causation. Consequently, given the very substantial burden and expense to the court and potential jurors of empanelling a jury in a complex product liability case,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it was appropriate to assess the admissibility of plaintiffs proof of causation before jury selection began. (2) Plaintiff made \u201cno showing\u201d as to why Ken Cohen, the witness who had been ordered to testify first on September 5, was unable to appear. (3) Plaintiffs noncompliance with the court\u2019s order substantially and impermissibly impaired the court\u2019s administration and management of its asbestos case docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">When Shadduck then attempted to respond to the motion to dismiss, the court stated that it had made its ruling and that \u201cthe time to make a record is when the Court asks for oral argument.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiff ultimately appealed the trial court\u2019s limited judgment, dismissing his case against defendants with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">On appeal, plaintiff raises a single assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\"><em>\u201cThe Circuit Court erred in granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss </em>for failure to prosecute and failure to comply with discovery obligations when plaintiffs \u2018failures\u2019 were due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the court\u2019s improper, unexpected and impossible to meet order on the eve of trial and plaintiff was prepared and able to proceed with trial as previously scheduled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">(Capitalization omitted; emphasis added.) The scope of that assignment is limited to the propriety of dismissing plaintiffs case as a sanction for his failure to comply with the September 1 order. Plaintiff does not assign error to any other ruling, including those in the trial court\u2019s September 1 order. Indeed, in his reply brief, plaintiff expressly confirms that he \u201cdoes not challenge these orders here.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court and is assigned as error in the opening brief in accordance with this rule * * *.\u201d); ORAP 5.45(3) (\u201cEach assignment of error shall identify precisely the legal, procedural, factual, or other ruling that is being challenged.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Specifically, we understand plaintiffs assignment of error to encompass two related contentions. First, plaintiff contends that, because he was unable to comply with the terms of the September 1 order, the trial court should have imposed <em>no </em>sanction for his noncompliance. Second, plaintiff contends that, to the extent that he was subject to some sanction for his noncompliance, the sanction of dismissal was inappropriate. Thus, according to plaintiff, the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Defendants respond that plaintiff failed to preserve the issues raised on appeal. Further and alternatively, as to the merits, defendants contend that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing plaintiffs case.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>We begin with preservation. Whether a contention is preserved for review is guided by the principles described in <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 15 P3d 22 (2000). Consistently with those principles, we determine whether the trial court was sufficiently and specifically alerted to a particular error so that the court could \u201cconsider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Here, as previously described, plaintiffs sole contention before the trial court in opposing the motion to dismiss was that the trial court should not impose <em>any </em>sanction because he was, and had been, unable to comply with the terms of the September 1 order. <em>See </em>235 Or App at 21. Conversely, before the trial court, plaintiff failed to raise his present, alternate appellate contention that, even if he was subject to some sanction for his violation of the September 1 order, because he had failed to demonstrate his inability to comply with that order, dismissal was an inappropriate sanction. Consequently, the former contention was preserved for our review, but the latter was not. <em>See Wyatt, </em>331 Or at 343 (explaining that, where a party \u201cdoes not deny at trial that it is subject to <em>some </em>sanction, its failure to object to the particular sanction imposed by the judge or, in the alternative, to argue for some other sanction, fails to preserve a claim on appeal that the judge erred in failing to consider the availability of a less onerous sanction\u201d (footnote omitted; emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">We turn to the substance of plaintiff s preserved contention. That contention is based on the factual premise that plaintiff was unable to comply with the court\u2019s order. Accordingly, our analysis reduces to whether that factual premise exists in this case \u2014 that is, whether plaintiff demonstrated his inability to comply with the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">As we have previously described, <em>see </em>235 Or App at 20-21, at the September 5 hearing, the trial court repeatedly solicited plaintiffs response to defendants\u2019 request for dismissal. Plaintiff indicated, however, that he had no response \u2014 that is, plaintiff told the court that, \u201c[i]f the Court wants to dismiss the case, I can\u2019t say anything further\u201d and later remarked, \u201cI can\u2019t make wine out of water. I can\u2019t get these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>gentlemen here today, not on such short notice.\u201d At the hearing, plaintiff presented a single declaration to the trial court from Brodkin, one of his four experts. As the trial court indicated, Brodkin\u2019s declaration was insufficient because it did not explain why he was unable to arrange his schedule to comply with the court\u2019s order to appear in court. Specifically, the court noted that Brodkin</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-4\">\u201csimply says that he has an obligation to arrange office work and prepare medical records in his clinic in Kirkland, Washington. It doesn\u2019t say anything about treating patients * * * those vague statements, there\u2019s question as to whether they arise to a level of good cause, given the prior court orders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Further, as late as the September 5 hearing, plaintiff did not demonstrate to the court, through declarations or otherwise, that any of his other expert witnesses were unable to comply with the court\u2019s order or that plaintiff made reasonable efforts to secure his experts\u2019 appearances and disclose their files. Indeed, in ruling on defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, the court noted that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs first witness, based on my order, which is critical to these motions * * * deals with Mr. Ken Cohen, the expert, and * * * there\u2019s no showing why he cannot be present.\u201d Bluntly, plaintiff failed to prove the factual premise underlying his <em>position </em>\u2014 viz., that he was unable to comply with the court\u2019s order. Accordingly, plaintiffs contention that no sanction was warranted fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In sum, plaintiff did not preserve the issue whether, to the extent that a sanction was warranted, dismissal was inappropriate. Further, plaintiff failed to demonstrate that, because he was unable to comply with the court\u2019s order, no sanction was warranted. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs case as a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-9\"> In this opinion \u201cdefendants\u201d refers to Domco Products Texas, L.P., Kentile Floors, Inc., and Wanke Panel Company, the only defendants that are parties to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-10\"> OEC 104(1) provides, in part, that \u201c[p]reliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness * * * or the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b44-13\"> Specifically, Brodkin\u2019s declaration stated that (1) he had been contacted by plaintiffs law firm on September 1 \u201cto find out [his] availability for a pre-trial hearing\u201d on September 5; (2) he was out of town for the Labor Day weekend; (3) he was not available for a pretrial hearing on September 5 \u201cdue to [his] obligations to arrange office work\u201d and \u201cprepare medical records\u201d for his clinic in Kirkland, Washington; and (4) he was currently scheduled to testify on September 11 and was \u201cavailable for any pre-trial hearing the court deems appropriate on this date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>As noted, Brodkin\u2019s declaration was the only one presented to the trial court at the hearing. Plaintiff did not present declarations from any of his other expert witnesses, explaining the reasons that they were unable to comply with the court\u2019s order to appear in court on September 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b45-19\"> We note that, although, in its ruling, the trial court spoke in terms of \u201cfailing to prosecute and failing to comply with discovery obligations,\u201d its dismissal was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>fundamentally predicated on plaintiffs violation of the court\u2019s September 1 order, which required the disclosure of expert names and files and required the appearance of plaintiffs witnesses in court for OEC 104 hearings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b46-11\"> The court noted that the projected duration of the trial in this case was \u201cthree weeks.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b46-13\"> The court told plaintiff that, to the extent that plaintiff sought relief from its dismissal of his case, plaintiff could \u201cmake whatever filing you want to make\u201d hut that the court had made its ruling. A couple of days after the hearing, plaintiff filed what he denominated as a response to defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and a motion for a new trial under ORCP 64. Thereafter, in his reply to defendants\u2019 response, plaintiff also sought to set aside the dismissal pursuant to ORCP 71 C.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-14\">The court subsequently held a hearing concerning plaintiff\u2019s submissions. At that hearing, plaintiffs attorney did not assert that the court should revisit its oral ruling dismissing the case either because the content of plaintiffs submissions included declarations demonstrating his inability to comply with the court\u2019s order or because a sanction less onerous than dismissal was warranted. Rather, plaintiffs argument focused solely on the propriety of obtaining a new trial or ORCP 71 relief. Ultimately, the trial court denied plaintiffs requests, and the court\u2019s rulings in that regard are not assigned as error on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b47-7\"> To be sure, at other points in the briefing, plaintiff suggests that dismissal based on noncompliance with the September 1 order was improper because the terms of that order were simply \u201cunreasonable\u201d and \u201cplaintiff <em>could not comply\u201d </em>with them and because \u201cpretrial expert discovery is prohibited in Oregon.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Those collateral attacks, even if somehow presented for our review, lack merit for two reasons. First, broadly construed, Shadduck\u2019s September 1 letter alerted the court that plaintiff could not comply with the order because his witnesses \u201cwill not be available until their [originally] scheduled times.\u201d Nonetheless, as late as the September 5 hearing, plaintiff did not demonstrate to the court, through declarations or otherwise, that those witnesses (specifically Ken Cohen) were unable to comply with the order or that plaintiff made reasonable efforts to secure their appearance and disclose their files. Second, the parties in this case had agreed to the \u201c48/24\u201d rule that required the pretrial expert discovery about which plaintiff now complains.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
