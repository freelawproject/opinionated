J.</author>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Claimant petitions for review of an Employment Appeals Board (EAB) order denying his claim for unemployment benefits on the ground that he voluntarily left work without good cause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ORS 657.176(2)(c). He argues that the EAB erred because ORS 657.176(11) provides an exception to the general rule that an individual who voluntarily leaves work is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits when, among other things, that individual volunteers to be laid off after the employer has decided to lay off employees. Because we conclude that the EAB\u2019s determination that claimant did not qualify for the ORS 657.176(11) exception is unsupported by substantial reason, see <em>Drew v. PSRB, </em>322 Or 491, 500-01, 909 P2d 1211 (1996) (describing substantial reasons rule), we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">For context, we pause to describe ORS 657.176(2)(c) and (11). ORS 657.176(2)(c) disqualifies an individual from receiving unemployment benefits if he or she \u201c[voluntarily left work without good cause.\u201d ORS 657.176(11) provides an exception to that general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">\u201cAn individual may not be disqualified from receiving benefits under subsection (2)(c) of this section and shall be deemed laid off if the individual:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">\u201c(a) Works under a collective bargaining agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">\u201c(b) Elects to be laid off when the employer has decided to lay off employees; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">\u201c(c) Is placed on the referral list under the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">With ORS 657.176(2)(c) and (11) in mind, we turn to the undisputed facts of this case, which we take from the EAB findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-11\">\u201c(1) * * * At the time of his separation from work, claimant worked for [employer] as a network technician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-12\">\u201c(2) The employer decided to reduce the work force in targeted titles and locations. The employer joined with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>claimant\u2019s union to offer a voluntary separation payment program (VSPP) that provided for enhanced benefits. The enhanced offer included all of the contractual provisions of the voluntary separation payment program discussed in the agreement between claimant\u2019s union and the employer, plus a 25 percent premium in the standard voluntary separation severance payment ($1,375 per year of service to a maximum of $48,125), recall rights for individuals who participated in the enhanced VSPP and a surplus transitional leave of absence option.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">\u201c(3) In claimant\u2019s department, the employer had determined that, if one person did not elect to leave under the VSPP, the person with the least seniority would be laid off. Claimant had worked for the employer for approximately 35 years. He had seniority and would not be the person laid off in his department if he did not elect to accept the VSPP.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">\u201c(4) Claimant accepted the VSPP and left the employer\u2019s payroll in accordance with the VSPP schedule on April 3, 2008. Claimant was placed on a recall list. He believes that all of the other 50 employees who accepted the VSPP package qualified to receive unemployment insurance benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Based on those factual findings, the EAB concluded that claimant was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits because he left work without good cause. ORS 657.176(2)(c). Further, the EAB concluded that \u201c[t]he record does not establish that the employer had reached the point that it had \u2018decided to lay off employees as called for in ORS 657.176(ll)(b).\u201d The EAB reasoned that employer had not yet decided to lay off employees because (1) employer specified that one employee would be laid off in claimant\u2019s department, but a layoff would only occur if no employee in claimant\u2019s department accepted the VSPP offer; (2) claimant testified that employer offered the VSPP to avoid terminating the employment of a contract worker before terminating a union member as required by the collective bargaining agreement; and (3) employer did not lay off any employees after the VSPP ended. That reasoning conflicts with the EAB\u2019s express findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>ORS 657.176(ll)(b) applies when an employer has decided to lay off employees, but it does not require that an employer has decided to lay off more employees than those who volunteer. The EAB found that, \u201c[i]n claimant\u2019s department, the employer had determined that, if one person did not elect to leave under the VSPP, the person with the least seniority would be laid off.\u201d That finding establishes that employer would not lay off any other employees after claimant accepted the VSPP. Thus, the first and third reasons the EAB gave for concluding that employer had not yet decided to lay off employees conflict with the EAB\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Moreover, the EAB\u2019s second reason to support its conclusion, that \u201c[c]laimant testified that the employer was attempting to avoid forced layoffs because it did not want to have to eliminate all of its contract employees,\u201d also conflicts with the EAB\u2019s findings. Employer offered the VSPP to solicit volunteers to be laid off. Contrary to the EAB\u2019s reasoning that employer was trying to avoid its obligation to terminate contract employees, and thus had not yet decided to lay off employees, the EAB found that \u201cemployer had determined that, if one person did not elect to leave under the VSPP, the person with the least seniority would be laid off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The EAB erred in denying claimant unemployment benefits. Its conclusion that claimant did not qualify for the exception under ORS 657.176(11) because employer had not decided to lay off workers is not supported by substantial reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-13\"> Neither the employer nor the Employment Department appeared in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
