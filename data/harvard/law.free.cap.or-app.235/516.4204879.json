J.</author>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">In this tort action, plaintiff sought to impose liability on defendants Archdiocese of Portland and Mt. Angel Abbey for the conduct of two priests. This court upheld the trial court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs claims as time barred. <em>Schmidt v. Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon, </em>218 Or App 661, 180 P3d 160 (2008). The Supreme Court reversed, <em>Schmidt v. Mt. Angel Abbey, </em>347 Or 389, 223 P3d 399 (2009), and the case is here on remand for consideration of plaintiffs remaining assignment of error. Plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in granting Mt. Angel Abbey\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to the claims involving the conduct of one of the priests, Father Charvet, a former employee of Mt. Angel Abbey.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff contends that the record on summary judgment is sufficient to create a question of fact as to whether Charvet\u2019s conduct was within the scope of his employment so as to provide a basis for imposing vicarious liability. We agree with plaintiff that the trial court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">On review of the trial court\u2019s order granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the facts and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from them are to be viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff. ORCP 47 C. We quote from the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion summarizing the record as it pertains to the claim involving the conduct of Charvet:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201cIn 1958, when plaintiff was a high school freshman at Mt. Angel Seminary, Father Charvet \u2014 plaintiffs freshman advisor \u2014 asked plaintiff to meet Charvet in his office at a specific time. When plaintiff arrived, Charvet was sitting behind his desk and told plaintiff to stand in front of the desk. Charvet then began questioning plaintiff as to what he knew about sexuality and reproduction. Among other things, Charvet asked plaintiff whether he had ever masturbated and explained to plaintiff \u2018what that was about.\u2019 At that point, Charvet became \u2018less technical\u2019 and began using \u2018street or gutter talk as opposed to clinical [terms].\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>During Charvet\u2019s questioning, plaintiff\u2018could see that there was a lot of motion going on under his cassock,\u2019 and, according to plaintiff, it was \u2018pretty obvious\u2019 that Charvet was masturbating. Although Charvet never instructed plaintiff to remain in the room, plaintiff stated that his training as a student in the seminary prevented him from leaving and that he \u2018felt in a locked situation.\u2019 The incident lasted approximately 30 to 45 minutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">347 Or at 392-93 (brackets in original). The record on summary judgment also contains an affidavit by plaintiff stating that Charvet was the teacher in charge of plaintiffs dormitory and that, when Charvet summoned plaintiff to his office, plaintiff felt that he had no choice but to comply. Plaintiff testified that Charvet\u2019s masturbation activity lasted \u201cmaybe ten minutes\u201d and occurred near the end of the 30 to 45 minutes that plaintiff was in Charvet\u2019s office. Plaintiff testified by deposition that, other than the described incident in the office, he had little contact with Charvet.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Plaintiff sought to hold defendant liable for Charvet\u2019s conduct on a theory of <em>respondeat superior, </em>but the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. On appeal, plaintiff contends that there is evidence from which a jury could find that Charvet\u2019s misconduct occurred in the course of his employment, thereby giving rise to a claim based on <em>respondeat superior. </em>Because we determined in our first opinion that the claim was time barred because evidence was lacking from which a jury could find that Charvet\u2019s actions met the definitions of \u201cchild abuse\u201d for purposes of ORS 12.117, we did not address vicarious liability or the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>with respect to Charvet\u2019s conduct. We did, however, address that issue in the context of determining whether the evidence was sufficient to create a question of fact regarding vicarious liability for the conduct of another priest, Father Frank. 218 Or App at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\"> As we explained in our first opinion, under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>an employer is vicariously liable for an employee\u2019s tortious conduct, including intentional torts, when the employee acts within the scope of employment. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Chesterman v. Barmon, </em>305 Or 439, 753 P2d 404 (1988), outlines three requirements that must be met in order to establish that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>employee\u2019s conduct was within the scope of employment: (1) the conduct must have occurred substantially within the time and space limits authorized by the employment; (2) the employee must have been motivated, at least partially, by a purpose to serve the employer; and (3) the act must have been of a kind that the employee was hired to perform. <em>Id. </em>at 442. Although, in <em>Chesterman, </em>the court held that the intentional tort itself unquestionably was outside the scope of employment, <em>id. </em>at 443, the court stated that \u201c[t]he focus should be on the <em>act </em>on which vicarious liability is based and not on when the act results in <em>injury.\u201d Id. </em>at 444 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">In <em>Fearing v. Bucher, </em>328 Or 367, 977 P3d 1163 (1999), the court noted that \u201can employee\u2019s intentional tort rarely, if ever, will have been authorized expressly by the employer. In that context, then, it virtually always will be necessary to look to the acts that led to the injury to determine if <em>those </em>acts were within the scope of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373-74 n 4 (emphasis in original). In <em>Fearing, </em>the question was whether the Archdiocese of Portland was vicariously liable for the conduct of a priest, Bucher, when he allegedly sexually abused the plaintiff. The court stated that, although the sexual assaults themselves were outside the scope of Bucher\u2019s employment, the archdiocese could still be found vicariously liable if acts that were within Bucher\u2019s scope of employment resulted in the acts which led to the plaintiffs injury. <em>Id. </em>at 374. The court stated that whether an employee has acted within the scope of employment at any given time generally is a question for the trier of fact, except in cases where only one reasonable conclusion may be drawn from the facts pled. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In <em>Fearing, </em>the trial court had dismissed the claim on the pleadings; the Supreme Court thus inquired whether the allegations of the amended complaint stated ultimate facts sufficient to establish that acts within Bucher\u2019s scope of employment resulted in the acts that caused injury to the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>The court held that the allegations of the complaint were sufficient to satisfy all three <em>Chesterman </em>requirements: The allegations were sufficient to allow a jury to infer that the sexual assaults \u201cwere the culmination of a progressive series of actions that began with and continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>to involve\u201d Bucher\u2019s performance of his ordinary and authorized pastoral duties; that Bucher\u2019s conduct in cultivating a trust relationship with the plaintiff was motivated, at least in part, by a desire to further the interests of the archdiocese; and that the conduct led to the sexual assaults. <em>Id. </em>at 375. The court rejected the archdiocese\u2019s argument that the allegations of the complaint demonstrated only that that priest\u2019s employment gave him the opportunity to commit the alleged assault but were not the cause of the plaintiffs injury. The court explained that a reasonable jury could infer that the priest\u2019s performance of his pastoral duties \u201cwere a necessary precursor to the sexual abuse and that the assaults thus were a direct outgrowth of and were engendered by conduct that was within the scope of Bucher\u2019s employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377. Thus, the court held that a jury could find that the necessary connection to the employment arose from the priest\u2019s performance of his pastoral duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">This case is here on summary judgment. As we stated in our first opinion with respect to Frank\u2019s conduct, the question is whether the record on summary judgment contains facts from which a jury could find that acts that were within the scope of the priest\u2019s employment resulted in the acts that caused injury to plaintiff. 218 Or App at 690. We agree with Judge Edmonds\u2019s conclusion in his separate concurring and dissenting opinion, 218 Or App at 697-98, that, giving plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences, the case presents a question of fact for the jury as to whether acts that were within the scope of Charvet\u2019s employment resulted in the acts that caused plaintiffs injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The record shows that Charvet was plaintiffs faculty advisor and dormitory proctor and that he asked plaintiff to meet with him in his office during a time when he had authority over plaintiff. There is evidence that the allegedly abusive conduct occurred during the last 10 minutes of a 30- to 45-minute encounter. A jury could reasonably find that the act of counseling plaintiff on the subjects of sexuality and reproduction was within the scope of Charvet\u2019s authority and responsibility and that, as plaintiffs faculty advisor and dormitory proctor, Charvet was partially motivated, at least initially, to fulfill those employment duties. A jury also could reasonably infer that the alleged abusive conduct resulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>from the employment-related conduct. We thus conclude that the record on summary judgment gives rise to questions of fact as to whether acts within the scope of Charvet\u2019s employment resulted in plaintiffs injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">In defendant\u2019s view, <em>Chesterman </em>and <em>Fearing </em>have drawn a narrow exception around a general rule that sexual assaults are not within the scope of employment and that, in order to give rise to a triable question of fact as to vicarious liability, the record must contain evidence of a pattern of grooming over a lengthy period of time or that the defendant used or manipulated a position of trust to ingratiate himself with the plaintiff or to create an opportunity for sexual abuse. We reject that contention. Although the court held in <em>Fearing </em>that such facts would be <em>sufficient </em>to establish the connection between the employment and the abuse, 328 Or at 377, we do not think that the case stands for the rule that an employment connection is established <em>only </em>by such conduct. The necessary employment connection is established by evidence that acts within the defendant\u2019s employment resulted in the acts that caused the plaintiffs injury. <em>Id. </em>at 374. Here, as we have concluded, the record on summary judgment contains evidence from which a jury could find that acts that were within the scope of Charvet\u2019s employment \u2014 the private counseling of plaintiff \u2014 culminated in abuse. We therefore conclude that the trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-8\"> As noted by the Supreme Court, 347 Or at 393 n 1, the archdiocese and Charvet are no longer parties on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
