J.</author>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Plaintiffs, Employers-Shopmens Local 516 Pension Trust (Local 516) and Western States Health and Welfare Trust Fund of the OPEIU (Western), appeal a limited judgment, dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim against defendants, Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America (Travelers) and Hartford Fire Insurance Company (Hartford), after the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of both insurers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the core of this coverage dispute is the meaning of the term \u201cemployee\u201d in both the \u201cWelfare and Pension Plan ERISA Compliance\u201d endorsement to the commercial crime policy that Travelers issued to Local 516 and the materially identical policy that Hartford issued to Western. Broadly stated, the legal issue on appeal is whether the principals of a company that provided investment management services to plaintiffs are \u201cemployees\u201d under the definition in the endorsement. For reasons that we will explain, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of both insurers. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The material facts of this case are essentially procedural or undisputed. Local 516 and Western are trusts subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Local 516 obtained a commercial insurance policy from Travelers that included coverage for the loss of money and securities caused by \u201cemployee dishonesty,\u201d and Western obtained a materially identical policy from Hartford.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In those policies, \u201cemployee dishonesty\u201d was defined to mean \u201conly dishonest acts committed by an \u2018employee\u2019 \u201d under particular circumstances. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Two interrelated policy definitions circumscribe the meaning of the term \u201cemployee.\u201d The first definition is general in nature and refers to natural persons in plaintiffs\u2019 service, who are compensated directly by plaintiffs, and who are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>directed and controlled by plaintiffs while performing services for them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The second definition is contained in the \u201cWelfare and Pension Plan ERISA Compliance\u201d endorsement. (Capitalization and boldface omitted.) Specifically, that endorsement provides, in part, that, \u201c[i]n compliance with certain provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA),\u201d an \u201cemployee\u201d also includes a natural person who is \u201c[a] trustee, an officer, employee, administrator or a manager, except an administrator or a manager who is an independent contractor,\u201d of an ERISA plan. The terms used in that definition of \u201cemployee\u201d <em>(i.e., trustee, officer, employee, administrator, manager) </em>are not specifically defined in the endorsement or in the policy as a whole.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">While that coverage was in effect, plaintiffs had agreements with Capital Consultants, LLC (CCL) to receive investment management services. The precise terms of plaintiffs\u2019 investment advisory agreements were not entirely identical. However, in general terms, both agreements authorized CCL to manage plaintiffs\u2019 designated funds. Specifically, Local 516\u2019s investment advisory agreement provided that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>\u201c[CCL], as it deems advisable, shall on behalf of [Local 516] cause securities to be bought and sold, invest in [CCL\u2019s] Insured, Cash and/or Cash-equivalent Collateralized Note Program, and shall cause all other functions necessary for investment management to be performed for the account.\u201d Similarly, Western\u2019s agreement provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\">\u201c[Western] authorizes [CCL] to invest and reinvest the assets in the Portfolio on behalf of [Western]. [CCL\u2019s] authority includes the power to purchase, sell and exchange property, and exercise whatever rights are conferred upon the holder of property held in the Portfolio including (without limitation) the power to exercise rights, warrants, conversion privileges, redemption privileges, to tender securities pursuant to a tender offer and the like.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Then, in 2004, Local 516 and Western each filed a proof of loss with Travelers and Hartford, respectively, seeking coverage for multiple occurrences of \u201cemployee dishonesty\u201d during the periods in which the policies were in force. Each plaintiff asserted that its losses were caused by certain of CCL\u2019s principals, each of whom was (1) \u201can employee of [CCL]\u201d and (2) a \u201cfiduciary] and/or handler[ ] of the Trust\u2019s assets\u201d who was \u201ctherefore required to be bonded\u201d under ERISA. Travelers and Hartford each denied coverage for the alleged losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a complaint, alleging several claims, including a claim for breach of contract, which is the only claim at issue on appeal. Ultimately, with regard to the breach of contract claim, plaintiffs and defendants filed cross-motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Those motions raised the same general legal <em>issue </em>\u2014 viz., whether the policy provided coverage for the losses alleged to have been caused by CCL\u2019s principals.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">For their part, plaintiffs contended that any losses caused by CCL\u2019s principals were covered under the policy for any of three independent reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number><em>First, </em>plaintiffs contended that, to the extent that \u201cemployee\u201d is defined in the \u201cWelfare and Pension Plan ERISA Compliance\u201d endorsement to include <em>trustees, officers, employees, administrators, </em>and <em>managers, </em>the endorsement \u201cundeniably contemplates the statutory meanings of the terms used.\u201d More specifically, plaintiffs contended that the plain meanings of the terms used in the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d are the meanings ascribed to those terms for purposes of ERISA and that, in light of ERISA\u2019s definitions, CCL\u2019s principals, as a matter of law, are either <em>employees </em>or <em>officers. </em>Accordingly, plaintiffs reasoned that CCL\u2019s principals are \u201cemployees\u201d under the definition in the endorsement such that their acts are covered under the policy. Alternatively, plaintiffs reasoned that, at the least, their construction of the endorsement is reasonable and creates an ambiguity such that the policy must be construed against defendants \u2014 that is, the drafters \u2014 to provide the coverage plaintiffs seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><em>Second, </em>plaintiffs contended that, in the event and to the extent that CCL\u2019s principals are deemed to be <em>administrators </em>or <em>managers </em>(as opposed to <em>employees </em>or <em>officers), </em>as those terms are used in the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in the endorsement, the purported grant of coverage in the endorsement is illusory. According to plaintiffs, because <em>administrators </em>and <em>managers </em>who are in plaintiffs\u2019 service and under their direction and control are already covered by the policy\u2019s general definition of \u201cemployee,\u201d <em>see </em>235 Or App at 577, the references to <em>administrators </em>and <em>managers </em>in the endorsement can be understood to expand coverage only if they refer to <em>administrators </em>and <em>managers </em>who are independent contractors. Based on that understanding, plaintiffs asserted that the independent contractor exclusion in the endorsement \u201cgut[s] the grant of coverage\u201d for <em>administrators </em>and <em>managers. </em>Accordingly, plaintiffs reasoned, any purported coverage is illusory such that the policy must be construed to afford coverage to plaintiffs \u201cfor losses caused by CCL\u2019s principals[ ] * * * irrespective of whether CCL\u2019s principals were independent contractors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><em>Third, </em>plaintiffs contended that the doctrine of statutory incorporation compels coverage consistently with the reasoning in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rhone v. Louis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>282 Or 693, 580 P2d 549 (1978), and our decision in <em>American States Ins. v. Super Spray Service, </em>77 Or App 497, 713 P2d 682, <em>rev allowed, </em>301 Or 78, <em>appeal dismissed by stipulation, </em>301 Or 523 (1986) <em>(Super Spray). </em>Specifically, plaintiffs contended that, because ERISA requires that those who handle plan assets must be bonded and because plaintiffs purchased the policy to comply with that requirement, as a matter of Oregon law, statutory incorporation applies to require coverage that is \u201cconsistent with the coverage requirements of * * * ERISA, including coverage for losses dishonestly caused by its investment manager <em>V(i.e., </em>CCL)], whose principals handled\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Conversely, defendants contended that they were entitled to summary judgment because, as a matter of law, the policy afforded no coverage for the acts of CCL and its principals. According to defendants, the definitions of \u201cemployee\u201d expressly excluded coverage for independent contractors; thus, because CCL was an independent contractor, the policy afforded no coverage. Alternatively, defendants contended that, even if the court were to look at the definitions in the ERISA regulatory scheme to interpret the meanings of the terms in the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in the endorsement, \u201cindependent investment managers\u201d such as CCL and its principals would be <em>administrators, </em>and not <em>employees </em>or <em>officers </em>as plaintiffs contended. Accordingly, defendants reasoned that \u201cthe very same regulations [plaintiffs] ask[ ] this Court to incorporate into the * * * [p]olicies to override the policy language establish that there is no coverage in any event.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Further, defendants contended that the coverage afforded by the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in the endorsement was not illusory because it expanded the general definition of \u201cemployee.\u201d Finally, defendants noted that plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the doctrine of statutory incorporation compels coverage had been \u201csquarely rejected\u201d by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Joseph Rosenbaum, M.D., Inc. v. Hartford Fire Ins., </em>104 F3d 258, 262, 263 (9th Cir 1996) <em>(Rosenbaum), </em>a case involving a materially identical policy issued by Hartford in which the court reasoned that ERISA \u201cdoes not require that any bond be construed to cover all persons required to be bonded\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>that \u201cthe Hartford policy does not say that it provides all bonding of any kind required by ERISA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs\u2019 as to the breach of contract claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court reasoned that, as a matter of law, based on the plain language of the policy, CCL and its principals were independent contractor investment managers that are excluded from coverage. Further, relying on <em>Rosenbaum, </em>the court reasoned that the doctrine of statutory incorporation did not apply because \u201cERISA does not override express insurance policy language to require coverage of anyone who must be bonded under ERISA.\u201d Ultimately, the trial court entered a limited judgment dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Plaintiffs appeal, raising two assignments of error. In those assignments, plaintiffs challenge the trial court\u2019s rulings denying their motions for partial summary judgment and granting defendants\u2019 motions as to the breach of contract claim. On appeal, plaintiffs essentially renew, as do defendants, their contentions raised in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">\u201cWhen there are cross-motions for summary judgment and the granting of one and denial of the other are both assigned as error, both are subject to review.\u201d <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Crutchfield, </em>200 Or App 146, 152-53, 113 P3d 972, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 609 (2005). Specifically, \u201cwe review the trial court\u2019s decision to determine whether there is any genuine issue of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as [a] matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152; <em>see also </em>ORCP 47 C. In light of that standard, we turn to the legal issue in this case \u2014 that is, whether CCL\u2019s principals were covered \u201cemployees\u201d under the definition in the endorsement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Resolution of that broad issue requires that we address three subsidiary legal issues. First, in light of the parties\u2019 specific contentions, we must determine whether, as a matter of law, CCL\u2019s principals are <em>employees, officers, </em>or <em>administrators </em>as those terms are used in the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in the endorsement. Second, we must determine whether the grant of coverage to <em>administrators </em>and <em>managers </em>in the endorsement is illusory. Third, we must determine whether the doctrine of statutory incorporation compels coverage in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">In addressing those issues, we are guided by the principles of interpretation that apply to insurance contracts. As we have previously recognized, \u201c[insurance policies are contractual in nature and are interpreted, for the most part, like any other business contract. Their interpretation is a question of law[.]\u201d <em>Employers Insurance of Wausau v. Tektronix, Inc., </em>211 Or App 485, 502-03, 156 P3d 105, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 363 (2007) (footnote omitted). Our goal \u201cin interpreting an insurance policy is to determine the intent of the parties as interpreted from the perspective of the ordinary purchaser of insurance.\u201d <em>North Pacific Ins. v. American Mfrs. Mutual Ins., </em>200 Or App 473, 478, 115 P3d 970 (2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In turn, the parties\u2019 intent</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">\u201cis determined by a three-step process. The first step is to examine the text of the policy to determine whether it is ambiguous, that is, whether it is susceptible to more than one plausible interpretation. If it is not, the policy is interpreted in accordance with that unambiguous meaning. The text of the policy includes any definitions of disputed terms included in the policy; we must, in fact, construe the policy in accordance with any such definitions. Only if the policy does not define the terms in dispute do we invoke assumptions about \u2018ordinary meaning\u2019 and other aids to construction. If the text of the policy is ambiguous, we proceed to a second step, that is, to examine the disputed terms in the broader context of the policy as a whole. If \u2014 and only if\u2014 the ambiguity persists, we construe the policy against the drafter * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number><em>Andres v. American Standard Ins. Co., </em>205 Or App 419, 423-24, 134 P3d 1061 (2006) (citations omitted); <em>see also Hoffman Construction Co. v. Fred S. James &amp; Co., </em>313 Or 464, 469-70, 836 P2d 703 (1992) (describing principles of interpretation that apply to insurance contracts).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">With those interpretive principles in mind, we begin by addressing whether CCL\u2019s principals are <em>employees, officers, </em>or <em>administrators </em>as those terms are used in the endorsement. According to plaintiffs, the endorsement \u201cexpands the definition of \u2018employee\u2019 to fit the ERISA context,\u201d and, in doing so, it \u201clifts terms directly from ERISA\u2019s regulations (\u2018administrator, officer, and employee\u2019) without redefining them, which means those regulatory policy terms are properly accorded their regulatory meanings.\u201d Based on that understanding, plaintiffs contend that, as a matter of law, CCL\u2019s principals were not <em>administrators, </em>because they were not designated as such in plaintiffs\u2019 plan and trust documents, and, instead, were necessarily <em>employees </em>or <em>officers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">To resolve plaintiffs\u2019 contention, we return to the text of the endorsement. As previously described, the endorsement provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">\u201cWELFARE AND PENSION PLAN ERISA COMPLIANCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">\u201cIn compliance with certain provisions of the Employee</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">\u201c1. \u2018Employee\u2019 also includes any natural person who is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">\u201ca. <em>A trustee, an officer, employee, administrator or a manager, except an administrator or a manager who is an independent contractor, </em>of any Employee Welfare or Pension Benefit Plan (hereafter called Plan) insured under this insurance, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">\u201cb. Your director or trustee while that person is handling funds or other property of any Plan insured under this insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">(Capitalization and boldface in original; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Although the term \u201cemployee\u201d is defined, the terms that comprise the definition <em>{i.e., trustee, officer, employee, administrator, manager) </em>are not. Although we generally turn to dictionary definitions to determine the ordinary meanings of undefined terms,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in light of the subject matter of the endorsement here, doing so would be of limited usefulness.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Instead, we turn to the meaning of those terms for purposes of ERISA\u2019s bonding requirement. That is so because the text of the endorsement strongly suggests an intention that, at the very least, the pertinent provisions in the ERISA regulatory scheme provide context for understanding the meaning of those terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The endorsement is entitled \u201cWelfare and Pension Plan <em>ERISA </em>Compliance.\u201d (Capitalization and boldface omitted; emphasis added.) Further, it explicitly indicates that the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d was intended to be \u201c[i]n compliance with <em>certain provisions\u201d </em>of ERISA. (Emphasis added.) Finally, \u201cemployee\u201d is defined by referencing natural persons who serve \u201cany Employee Welfare or Pension Benefit Plan\u201d in particular positions and the named insured\u2019s \u2014 that is, each plaintiff trust\u2019s \u2014 \u201cdirector or trustee while that person is handling funds or other property\u201d of the plan. In other words, the endorsement expands the general definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in the policy to include natural persons who perform particular functions for ERISA plans, including those in the position of handling plan funds and property. Accordingly, viewing the text of the endorsement from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>perspective of an \u201cordinary purchaser of insurance,\u201d it is clear that the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d was informed, at least in part, by the ERISA regulatory scheme concerning the bonding of those who handle plan funds and property. For those reasons, we turn to the ERISA regulatory scheme to assist in interpreting the meanings of <em>employee, officer, </em>and <em>administrator </em>in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Generally, ERISA requires that \u201c[e]very fiduciary of an employee benefit plan and every person who handles funds or other property of such a plan * * * shall be bonded as provided in this section!.]\u201d 29 USC \u00a7 1112(a). For purposes of this case, our understanding is that there is no dispute that CCL\u2019s principals were required to be bonded under 29 USC section 1112(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">For purposes of that bonding requirement, 29 CFR section 2580.412-3 defines three discrete categories of persons (i.e., administrators, officers, employees) who must be bonded because of their formal or functional relationship to the ERISA plan. We describe each category in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\"><em>First, </em>an \u201cadministrator\u201d is \u201c[t]he person or persons designated by the terms of the plan or the collective bargaining agreement with responsibility for the ultimate control, disposition, or management of the money received or contributed.\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7 2580.412-3(a)(l)(i). Alternatively, \u201c[i]n the absence of such designation,\u201d an administrator is \u201cthe person or persons actually responsible for the control, disposition, or management of the money received or contributed, irrespective of whether such control, disposition, or management is exercised directly or through an agent or trustee designated by such person or persons.\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7 2580.412-3(a)(l)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\"><em>Second, </em>an \u201c \u2018officer\u2019 shall include any person designated by the terms of a plan or collective bargaining agreement as an officer, any person performing or authorized to perform executive functions of the plan or any member of a board of trustees or similar governing body of a plan.\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7 2580.412-3(b).

On the other hand, the terms would not include those brokers or independent contractors who have contracted for the performance of functions which are not ordinarily carried out by the administrators, officers, or employees of a plan, such as securities, brokers who purchase and sell securities or armored motor vehicle companies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">(First emphasis in original; second emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">Against that definitional backdrop, we address plaintiffs\u2019 specific contention that CCL\u2019s principals were <em>employees </em>or <em>officers </em>and were not <em>administrators. </em>That contention rests on the following syllogism:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-11\">(a) The terms <em>administrator, officer, </em>and <em>employee </em>in the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in the endorsement have the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>meaning as the meanings ascribed to those terms under ERISA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-4\">(b) Here, CCL\u2019s principals are not administrators under ERISA because they were not designated as such in the plans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">(c) Consequently, CCL\u2019s principals are necessarily <em>employees </em>or <em>officers </em>as those terms are used in the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in the endorsement and their acts are covered under the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">To resolve plaintiffs\u2019 contention, we need not decide whether the terms <em>administrator, officer, </em>and <em>employee </em>in the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in the endorsement are properly afforded their pertinent meanings under ERISA or whether the ERISA definitions merely provide highly persuasive context for interpreting the meanings of those terms. That is so because, assuming without deciding that plaintiffs are correct that the meanings of the terms <em>administrator, officer, </em>and <em>employee </em>in the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in the endorsement are identical to the meanings of those terms for purposes of ERISA\u2019s bonding requirement, plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that CCL\u2019s principals are not administrators for purposes of ERISA\u2019s bonding requirements is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Application of the ERISA definition of \u201cadministrator\u201d in this case is relatively straightforward. Plaintiffs correctly note that CCL and its principals are not administrators under the terms of 29 CFR section 2580.412-3(a)(l)(i), because the plans do not designate them as such. Nonetheless, we understand that there is no dispute that CCL\u2019s principals \u201cperform[ed] functions for the plan[s] normally performed by administrators\u201d \u2014 that is, management of the plans\u2019 funds. 29 CFR \u00a7 2580.412-3(d). Accordingly, for purposes of ERISA\u2019s bonding requirements, CCL\u2019s principals are properly considered administrators under the terms of 29 CFR section 2580.412-3(d). As a consequence, plaintiffs\u2019 contention on appeal that CCL\u2019s principals are not <em>administrators </em>but necessarily must be <em>employees </em>or <em>officers </em>fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">As noted, the endorsement at issue here explicitly excludes from the definition of covered \u201cemployee[s],\u201d independent contractor administrators or managers. <em>See </em>235 Or App at 583 (quoting policy language \u201cexcept an administrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>or a manager who is an independent contractor\u201d). Plaintiffs do not contend on appeal that the trial court\u2019s grant of defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions was erroneous because there were material factual disputes as to whether CCL\u2019s principals are independent contractors \u2014 and, thus, for purposes of our review that matter is resolved. Accordingly, we must affirm the trial court\u2019s disposition on the ground that CCL\u2019s principals were not \u201cemployees\u201d because they were independent contractors excluded from coverage unless plaintiffs are correct in either of their additional, alternative <em>challenges </em>\u2014 viz., that (1) the coverage for <em>administrators </em>was illusory in light of the exclusion for independent contractor administrators or (2) the application of the doctrine of statutory incorporation requires coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">We turn first to plaintiffs\u2019 contention that coverage for the acts of <em>administrators </em>and <em>managers </em>in the endorsement is illusory. More specifically, plaintiffs\u2019 contention rests on the following syllogism:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">(a) <em>Administrators </em>and <em>managers </em>can be only common-law employees, trustees, or independent contractors \u2014 that is, all administrators or managers must stand in one of those relationships with their principals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">(b) <em>Administrators </em>and <em>managers </em>who are common-law employees are already covered under the policy\u2019s general definition of \u201cemployee\u201d and <em>administrators </em>and <em>managers </em>who are <em>trustees </em>are explicitly covered under the endorsement\u2019s expanded definition of \u201cemployee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">(c) Accordingly, the reference to <em>administrators </em>and <em>managers </em>in the endorsement necessarily refers only to <em>administrators </em>and <em>managers </em>who are independent contractors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">(d) Thus, any coverage for an <em>administrator </em>or <em>manager </em>in the endorsement is illusory because the exclusion for <em>administrators </em>and <em>managers </em>who are independent contractors completely eviscerates such coverage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Assuming without deciding that plaintiffs are correct that <em>administrators </em>and <em>managers </em>can be only common-law employees, trustees, or independent contractors, the correctness of plaintiffs\u2019 position reduces to whether the reference to <em>administrators </em>and <em>managers </em>in the endorsement necessarily refers only to <em>administrators </em>and <em>managers </em>who are independent contractors. For reasons that we will explain, we conclude that the reference to <em>administrators </em>and <em>managers </em>is not so narrowly circumscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">As previously discussed, <em>see </em>235 Or App at 584, the endorsement evinces an intent to expand the general definition of \u201cemployee\u201d to include natural persons who perform particular functions for ERISA plans as informed by the ERISA bonding scheme generally and the pertinent definitions of \u201cadministrator,\u201d \u201cofficer,\u201d and \u201cemployee\u201d specifically. For those reasons, in the context of the endorsement as a whole, the use of the term <em>administrator </em>indicates to an ordinary purchaser that an \u201cemployee\u201d includes an <em>administrator </em>for purposes of ERISA, regardless of whether that person would be considered an \u201cemployee\u201d under the general policy definition, unless, as unambiguously and expressly provided, the ERISA <em>administrator </em>is an independent contractor. Accordingly, because the premise underlying plaintiffs\u2019 syllogism is incorrect \u2014 that is, because plaintiffs are incorrect that the reference to <em>administrators </em>and <em>managers </em>in the endorsement is limited to <em>administrators </em>and <em>managers </em>who are independent contractors \u2014 their contention that coverage for <em>administrators </em>and <em>managers </em>is illusory fails.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Having so concluded, we turn to plaintiffs\u2019 final contention that the doctrine of statutory incorporation compels coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>With regard to that contention, plaintiffs assert that the \u201cdoctrine * * * overrides express policy language to read statutory requirements into insurance policies as if expressly written therein at inception.\u201d Relying on <em>Rhone </em>and <em>Super Spray, </em>plaintiffs assert that \u201cstatutory incorporation * * * applies when (1) the statute regulates what the insured must buy, and (2) the insured procures the policy to comply with the regulatory mandate.\u201d For reasons that we will explain, we disagree that, under the reasoning in <em>Rhone </em>and <em>Super Spray, </em>statutory incorporation applies to require coverage in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">In <em>Rhone, </em>the plaintiff was injured in an accident while a passenger in an automobile that he rented from an automobile rental business. 282 Or at 695. The business\u2019s insurance company contended that the pertinent policy \u201cprovided coverage on rented automobiles only when they were being driven by the rentee, i.e., plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff relied on a portion of a city ordinance that required automobile rental businesses to obtain liability insurance. <em>Id. </em>In particular, the ordinance provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">\u201c* * * Where the insurance covers a drive-yourself vehicle, it shall expressly provide coverage during the time such vehicle is rented out and shall cover the liability of the driver of such vehicle whether or not such vehicle is retained beyond the expected time of return to the licensee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The Supreme Court noted that, \u201c[i]n a number of circumstances the requirements of statutes and ordinances have been deemed covered by insurance policies that were procured for the purpose of complying with those requirements, adding to or displacing contrary provisions of the policy itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695-96. However, the court did not \u201cexamine how far this rule extends, because [the insurance company] concedes both in its brief and on oral argument that it applies to its situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 696. Instead, the insurance company asserted that the ordinance should be interpreted to require insurance for rentee-drivers and that the purpose of the ordinance supported its interpretation. <em>Id. </em>The court rejected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>insurance company\u2019s interpretation of the ordinance. <em>Id. </em>at 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">In <em>Super Spray, </em>the defendants erroneously sprayed the wrong field with herbicide. 77 Or App at 499. When the landowner later planted a potato crop on that field, the herbicide destroyed the crop. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff insurance company contended that the defendants\u2019 policy did not cover the damage because of an endorsement that stated \u201cit did not cover \u2018property damage arising out of the direct application of chemicals, whether intentional or in error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendants asserted, however, that a particular statute required coverage.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 500. Significantly, the defendants also relied on a policy provision which provided that \u201c \u2018[statements in this policy conflicting with insurance statutes of [Oregon] are hereby amended by us to conform to the statutes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(second brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">On appeal, \u201c[t]he parties d[id] not dispute that defendants procured the policy for the purpose of complying with the requirements of ORS 634.116(5).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The issue on appeal reduced to whether, although \u201cplaintiff concede[d] that, under the provision just quoted, the policy provides the public liability coverage that the statute requires,\u201d the statute did not, in fact, require coverage. <em>Id. </em>We held that \u201c[t]he statute require[d] that pesticide operators have insurance for damage to property from application of herbicides, except for damage to \u2018property being worked upon\u2019 by them\u201d and that, \u201c[b]ecause the policy is amended to conform to ORS 634.116, it insures against [the landowner\u2019s] loss, unless the 65-acre <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>parcel was \u2018property being worked upon\u2019 by defendants,\u201d which it was not. <em>Id. </em>at 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><em>Rhone </em>and <em>Super Spray </em>are materially distinguishable from this case. First, unlike the insurer in <em>Rhone, </em>defendants here do not concede the applicability of the doctrine of statutory incorporation. Second, unlike in <em>Super Spray, </em>plaintiffs do not point us to policy language indicating that conflicting policy statements are amended to conform to ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Moreover, to the extent that similar language exists in the policy, we do not understand ERISA\u2019s bonding provision to require an insurance policy to cover all persons that must be bonded. In that regard, we find the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Rosenbaum </em>concerning ERISA\u2019s requirements to be persuasive. The court in <em>Rosenbaum </em>reasoned that, although ERISA requires that certain persons must be bonded, the determination of what coverage is necessary under ERISA and the purchase of a compliant insurance policy are the responsibilities of the plan. 104 F3d at 263. Further, the court reasoned that ERISA \u201cdoes not require that any bond be construed to cover all persons required to be bonded.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>In other words, we understand the court to have reasoned that every policy that is issued for ERISA purposes does not necessarily cover every person who must be bonded regardless of the policy language. Accordingly, because the ERISA bonding provision does not require an insurance policy to cover every person who must be bonded, the doctrine of statutory incorporation does not apply to this case to compel coverage.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">In sum, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 contentions that (1) CCL\u2019s principals were not <em>administrators </em>but rather were <em>employees </em>or <em>officers </em>under the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in the endorsement such that as a matter of law their acts were covered; (2) any coverage for <em>administrators </em>and <em>managers </em>in the endorsement was illusory; and (3) the doctrine of statutory incorporation compels coverage in this case. Accordingly, for the reasons that we have explained, the trial court properly granted defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-7\"> Although another plaintiff and other defendants were involved in this case in the trial court, on appeal, \u201cplaintiffs\u201d refers to only Local 516 and Western and \u201cdefendants\u201d refers to only Travelers and Hartford.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\"> Because the Hartford policy and the Travelers policy are substantively identical in all respects material to our analysis and disposition, we employ the terms \u201cpolicy\u201d and \u201cendorsement\u201d in this opinion to refer to either or both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b621-5\"> Specifically, the general definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in the Crime General Provisions of the policy defines \u201cemployee\u201d to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">\u201ca.
