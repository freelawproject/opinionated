J.</author>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">This case involves a dispute over the premium rates assigned to employer for its workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Employer is a manufacturer of steel replacement parts used in heavy machinery; for purposes of billing employer for workers\u2019 compensation insurance, its insurer classified employer\u2019s business by a code that applies to businesses engaged in the fabrication of \u201cstructural\u201d steel. Employer sought review by the Department of Consumer and Business Services, and the department issued a final order affirming the insurer\u2019s classification. Employer seeks judicial review of that order, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">For background, we recite the description of the workers\u2019 compensation insurance premium classification system set forth in <em>Lemma Wine Co. v. Natl. Council on Comp. Ins., </em>194 Or App 371, 373, 95 P3d 238 (2004) (citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">\u201cThe amount of workers\u2019 compensation insurance premium that an employer must pay is determined by assigning the employer to applicable risk classifications based on the general nature of the employer\u2019s business; different types of businesses involve different levels of risk and, as a result, different levels of premiums. The risk classifications are developed by the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI), a rating organization that is licensed by the department. The classification codes and the resulting premium rates then are filed with, and approved by, the department. NCCI\u2019s classification codes also are published in a <em>Basic Manual of Workers\u2019 Compensation Insurance, </em>known as the <em>\u2018Basic Manual.\u2019 </em>NCCI also publishes a publication entitled <em>Scopes of Basic Manual Classifications, </em>known as the <em>\u2018Scopes Manual,\u2019 </em>which describes and explains the classifications contained in the <em>Basic Manual.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Rule l.D of the <em>Basic Manual </em>provides that an employer is assigned \u201cone basic classification that best describes the business of the employer within a state.\u201d However, where \u201cno basic classification clearly describes the business,\u201d Rule 1.D.2 provides that \u201cthe classification that most closely describes the business must be assigned.\u201d The <em>Basic Manual </em>establishes that NCCI has the right to \u201cdetermine the propriety of classification assignments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>The department found the following uncontested facts that describe employer\u2019s business:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\">\u201c[Employer] operates a business fabricating \u2018wear\u2019 parts out of steel to be used as replacement parts on large machines and equipment. [Employer] has a shop in Woodburn, Oregon, with the following tools and equipment: a plasma cutting table, three forklifts (one large, two small) for moving material such as steel plate, a stationary drill, brake press, welders (carbiding tables) and three overhead cranes or lifts. One of their primary products is a \u2018hammer,\u2019 which can weigh between four and 90 pounds, and is used as replacement grinding teeth on heavy grinders used to grind wood debris into bark or mulch-like products. [Employer] fabricates the hammers, and other replacement parts, then sells them to municipalities and other contractors. The purchaser does all installation of the new parts on their heavy equipment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The insurer audited employer\u2019s premium classification in 2006. <em>See </em>ORS 737.318 (requiring director to establish a premium audit program); OAR 836-043-0110 (explaining the insurer premium audit program). In the course of that audit, the insurer concluded that employer was more appropriately classified in code 3030, a designation for shops engaged in the fabrication of \u201cstructural\u201d steel products, instead of its prior classification in code 3632, a designation for \u201cmachine shops.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The <em>Scopes Manual </em>provides that \u201c[c]ode 3030 is restricted to a permanently located shop in which an insured engages in the fabrication or assembly of structural iron or steel products\u201d and \u201cis applicable to risks engaged in the manufacture of iron or steel structural parts subsequently used by others in the manufacture of heavy machinery.\u201d The <em>Scopes Manual </em>defines \u201cfabricating * * * to mean the laying out of the pieces, and the marking, cutting, sawing, drilling, punching, riveting, bolting, welding and assembly of the pieces into finished structural steel products.\u201d By contrast, the <em>Scopes Manual </em>provides that \u201c[c]ode 3632 applies to the manufacture or repair of machines as well as general job machining\u201d but \u201conly when such operations are not specifically contemplated by another manual classification(s).\u201d The <em>Scopes Manual </em>states that code 3632 operations may involve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>processes \u201csuch as boring, turning, planing, shaping, milling, drilling, punching, grinding, tapping, threading, shearing, bending, forming, riveting, welding, painting, inspecting and testing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Employer objected to the insurer\u2019s reclassification, and, in response, the insurer requested that NCCI perform an independent review of the classification. NCCI conducted a site inspection and concluded that code 3030 was indeed the proper classification. The insurer then submitted a final bill to employer assessing future premiums based on the reclassification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Employer requested that the department review the billing, disputing the reclassification to code 3030 on the basis that that code applies to the \u201cmanufacturing of structural steel products\u201d whereas employer manufactures \u201cwear\u201d parts that are \u201cnot structural.\u201d (Underscoring in original.) <em>See </em>ORS 737.318(3)(d); ORS 737.505(4); OAR 836-043-0170(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">At the hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ), employer\u2019s president described the manufacturing operations, but employer did not introduce any expert testimony on the classification of those operations. The insurer called NCCI\u2019s auditor, Craddock, who testified that he classified employer\u2019s operations based on a site tour during which he observed the equipment, the manufacturing process, and the completed parts. Craddock opined that the equipment was \u201cwhat you see at a typical 3030 shop\u201d and that the manufacturing processes included \u201ccutting,\u201d \u201cdrilling of holes,\u201d and \u201cwelding.\u201d Craddock noticed that the finished parts were \u201cfairly heavy\u201d (weighing, on average, approximately 40 pounds) and consistent with the usage of code 3030 for \u201creplacement parts in heavy machinery * * * [that] are part of the overall structure of the machine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Craddock contrasted employer\u2019s operations with manufacturing operations covered by two other codes: code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>3040, which, according to the <em>Scopes Manual, </em>applies to the fabrication of \u201cnonstructural\u201d and \u201cornamental\u201d iron or steel work, and employer\u2019s former classification of code 3632. Craddock reasoned that code 3040 did not apply to employer because the finished parts are \u201cheavier than anything contemplated under code 3040.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Craddock reasoned that code 3632 was inapplicable for three reasons: (1) code 3632 applies only where no other code is a better fit; (2) employer did not have the machinery that businesses classified in code 3632 would have; and (3) although employer engaged in the cutting, drilling, and welding processes involved in code 3632 operations, the typical code 3632 shop would engage in \u201cmore machining\u201d processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">Based on the evidence, the ALJ issued a proposed order concluding that the assignment of code \u201c3030 is appropriate given the findings made by NCCI.\u201d In addition, relying on <em>Salem Decorating v. Natl. Council on Comp. Ins., </em>116 Or App 166, 170, 840 P2d 739 (1992), <em>rev den, </em>315 Or 643 (1993), the ALJ observed that employer had the burden to present evidence in-support of its position that it should not be classified in code 3030 and that employer had not met its burden. The proposed order concluded that the classification of code 3030 was appropriate to cover employees involved in \u201chauling materials belonging to others.\u201d The insurer filed an exception to the phrase, \u201chauling materials belonging to others.\u201d Employer did not file an exception to the proposed order.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Initially, upon review of the proposed order, the director proposed to conduct further hearings to determine whether code 3030 \u201cmost closely describes the business\u201d under Rule 1.D.2 in the <em>Basic </em>Manual.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The director noted, \u201cAlthough both codes 3030 and 3040 apply to * * * some of the same materials and processes, code 3030 applies to structural byproducts whereas code 3040 applies to nonstructural byproducts.\u201d The director observed that the term \u201cstructural\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>was not defined in either the <em>Basic Manual </em>or the <em>Scopes Manual.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The insurer objected to the director\u2019s request for further hearings, arguing that the <em>Basic Manual </em>provides that NCCI is the entity responsible for applying the codes to individual businesses and that NCCI determined that code 3030 applied to employer\u2019s business. The insurer also argued that, based on Craddock\u2019s testimony, employer\u2019s fabrication of parts used in the \u201coverall structure\u201d of heavy machinery was most analogous to a business within code 3030. Employer responded that it had no objection to proceeding without further hearings but reiterated its argument that the term \u201cstructural\u201d could not be applied to a \u201cwear part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The department then issued a final order without conducting further hearings. The final order adopted the findings of fact and reasoning of the proposed order, interpreted the proposed order to have found \u201cessentially, that code 3030 more closely describes the employer\u2019s operations than code 3632,\u201d and concluded that \u201c[t]he insurer correctly assigned classification code 3030, by analogy, to the employer\u2019s steel \u2018wear\u2019 or replacement part fabrication operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\"> We review the final order to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence in the record. ORS 183.484(5)(c). A finding of fact is supported by substantial evidence \u201cwhen the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the final order must be supported by substantial reason; that is, it must demonstrate \u201cthe <em>reasoning </em>that leads the agency from the <em>facts </em>that it has found to the <em>conclusions </em>that it draws from those facts.\u201d <em>Drew v. PSRB, </em>322 Or 491, 500, 909 P2d 1211 (1996) (emphasis in original). As the ALJ correctly stated, employer had the burden to prove that its classification in code 3030 was incorrect. <em>See Salem Decorating, </em>116 Or App at 170 (the party seeking redress has the burden of proof).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Employer advances three assignments of error and characterizes each error as involving either an error of law or a substantial evidence deficiency. Specifically, employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>argues that the department erroneously concluded that code 3030 applies to its business, that the department should have classified the business in code 3632, and that the department should have found that employer\u2019s finished products were \u201cnonstructural \u2018wear\u2019 parts.\u201d Our initial difficulty addressing employer\u2019s assignments is that, despite employer\u2019s characterizations, they do not actually raise any error of law or suggest that any of the department\u2019s findings lack substantial evidence in the record. Rather, as we understand it, employer argues that the department could not demonstrate any reasoning that would connect those factual findings to the conclusions the department reached \u2014 that is, employer contends, that code 3030 could not apply to a business that is not engaged in the manufacturing of <em>structural </em>parts, and employer\u2019s business therefore must be classified in code 3632 instead of code 3030.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">The problem with employer\u2019s argument is that the department concluded that code 3030 \u201cmore closely describe^]\u201d employer\u2019s operations than code 3632, and it did so without deciding that those operations involve the production of \u201cstructural\u201d parts for purposes of code 3030. That reasoning relies on the mandate of Rule 1.D.2 of the <em>Basic Manual </em>that the insurer must assign the classification that \u201cmost closely describes the business.\u201d The issue, then, is whether a different code more closely describes employer\u2019s operations, not whether employer manufactures \u201cstructural\u201d parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">In rejecting employer\u2019s argument that code 3632 is more appropriate, the department reasoned that code \u201c3030 is appropriate given the findings made by NCCI.\u201d We review the basis for that reasoning: The <em>Basic Manual </em>provides that NCCI may determine the propriety of the classification assignment; NCCI\u2019s evidence on the classification scheme was not rebutted; NCCI explained at the hearing that employer\u2019s equipment, manufacturing process, and completed products are more closely described by code 3030; and the department made factual findings regarding the equipment, manufacturing process, and the products related to employer\u2019s operations. Within that context, we conclude that the department explained the reasoning that connected its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>findings of fact to the conclusion the agency made; the department\u2019s reliance on NCCI\u2019s findings is supported by substantial reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-8\"> The bill increased employer\u2019s premium rate from $4.10 per $100 in wages paid to $8.27 per $100 in wages paid. Insurer expressly waived any right to make that change retroactive due to the advice that it had previously given employer. <em>See </em>ORS 737.310(13) (discussing retroactive application of premium audit reclassifications). The rate change was to he effective as of April 1, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b655-6\"> Code 3040 specifically includes the fabrication of railings, balconies, fire escapes, staircases, iron shutters, or other nonstructural iron or steel products.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\"> The director invited employer to request that this case be suspended pending a decision by the Oregon Workers\u2019 Compensation Rating System Review and Advisory Committee. <em>See </em>OAR 836-043-0200 to 836-043-0240. Employer never sought a hearing before that committee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
