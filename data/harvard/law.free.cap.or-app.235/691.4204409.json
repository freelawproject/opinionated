On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal as to witness tampering because, at the time that he attempted to induce the witness to lie to the district attorney, there was no \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d pending. <em>See </em>ORS 162.285(1) (\u201cA person commits the crime of tampering with a witness if: (a) The person knowingly induces or attempts to induce a witness or a person the person believes may be called as a witness in any official proceeding to offer false testimony or unlawfully withhold any testimony[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Defendant\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>State v. Bailey, </em>346 Or 551, 564, 213 P3d 1240 (2009), in which the court held that, \u201cwhen ORS 162.285(l)(a) defines witness tampering in terms of tampering with a person who the defendant \u2018believes may be called as a witness in any official proceeding,\u2019 <em>it includes tampering that occurs at a time when no official proceeding is pending.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In this case, based on the evidence in the record,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a factfinder could reasonably infer that defendant made threats to the witness that were intended to induce her to lie in defendant\u2019s soon-to-be-commenced criminal prosecution. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the witness tampering charge. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\"> The record includes evidence that defendant was worried about the witness\u2019s \u201cupcoming meeting with the D.A. that was assigned to the case\u201d in advance of a grand jury proceeding, and that defendant attempted to induce the witness to provide the district attorney with a false version of events.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
