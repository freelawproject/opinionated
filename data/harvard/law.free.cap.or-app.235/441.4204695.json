J.</author>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Defendant was convicted on stipulated facts of unlawful possession of a controlled substance, possession of a forged instrument, and identity theft. Defendant filed a pretrial motion to suppress evidence seized in a search of her purse following a vehicle stop. She assigns error to the trial court\u2019s grant of the state\u2019s motion to strike as untimely a memorandum of law in support of her motion to suppress that she filed on the day of trial, which, in effect, resulted in the summary denial of the motion to suppress. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">We take the pertinent facts from an affidavit that defendant\u2019s trial counsel filed with defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. On June 8, 2007, a Hillsboro Police Officer stopped a vehicle because he suspected that the driver was operating the vehicle under the influence of intoxicants. Defendant was a passenger in the vehicle. The driver ultimately was arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicants. In the course of the stop, the officer questioned defendant and conducted a patdown search of defendant\u2019s person. The officer then questioned defendant further, after which he conducted a second patdown of her person. The officer ultimately took defendant into custody and then searched her purse, resulting in the discovery of the evidence that led to her convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">On October 16, 2007, defendant filed a motion to suppress \u201call evidence that resulted from the search of the defendant\u2019s purse.\u201d In the \u201cpoints and authorities\u201d section of the motion, defendant relied on the \u201cOregon Constitution, Article I, Section 9 and all relevant caselaw pertaining thereto. United States Constitution, Amendments IV, V and XIV and all relevant caselaw pertaining thereto.\u201d Defendant\u2019s trial attorney filed an affidavit in support of the motion to suppress that included the pertinent facts set forth above, and the following assertion that, \u201cI have read the police reports in this matter and believe that it is questionable whether [the officer] had reasonable suspicion or probable cause to search [defendant] or her purse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">A hearing on the motion to suppress was set for November 14, 2007, the day of trial. On that day, defendant\u2019s counsel filed an eight-page memorandum in support of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>motion to suppress that included a discussion of the facts and legal principles on which defendant intended to rely. The prosecutor, anticipating that defendant would file such a memorandum, filed a motion to strike or summarily deny defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. According to the state, the motion to suppress failed to comply with Uniform Trial Court Rule (UTCR) 4.060. That rule provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\">\u201c(1) All motions to suppress evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">\u201c(a) must make specific reference to any constitutional provision, statute, rule, case, or other authority upon which it is based; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">\u201c(b) must be accompanied by the moving party\u2019s brief which must be adequate reasonably to apprise the court and the adverse party of the arguments and authorities relied upon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The premises of the state\u2019s motion were (1) the memorandum did not accompany the motion to suppress; (2) without the memorandum, the motion to suppress did not comply with UTCR 4.060(1); and (3) the state lacked sufficient time to prepare a response to the memorandum, because it was filed on the day of the hearing. Defendant, in turn, filed a written response to the state\u2019s motion to strike, asserting that the state\u2019s motion should be denied as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">\u201cCOURT: The concern I have is just on first reading this; I think the defense probably has a valid motion. I mean it doesn\u2019t sound to me that the State had any basis to search the passenger even under officer safety theories, so you need a chance to explore that a little bit if you\u2019re going to try and rely on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Your honor, I respectfully disagree. I think the evidence will show that this officer in the time period \u2014 there is a lot of circumstances, it\u2019s not an officer safety, and that\u2019s what she\u2019s talking about is an officer safety issue. This is completely something different than what is just on the face of this memorandum; I feel strong that I think we have a good motion to suppress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">\u201c* * * [I]t\u2019s just frustrating because there really doesn\u2019t seem to be much of a remedy with regards to getting a memorandum slapped on you the morning of trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>\u201cCOURT: I agree; but I mean again that\u2019s the practical issue * * *. I think * * * you have a valid motion on the motion to strike, that\u2019s clearly not complying with the rules, [defense counsel], and you\u2019ve got to do that. But I\u2019m worried about your client and her constitutional rights being trampled by a rule, but that\u2019s what it does if I enforce the rule. I don\u2019t know where to go with this other than \u2014 I\u2019ll just grant the State\u2019s motion and let the chips fall where they will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">\u201cThe case is on for trial, so I guess we\u2019ll have to try it and eventually somebody will set it aside, if she\u2019s convicted, on the constitutional issue because I think that\u2019s clearly going to be the result, but that\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to be worried about; I\u2019m going to be gone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: The State is willing to take that risk. If this comes back on (inaudible) then so be it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Then, without first offering defense counsel an opportunity to be heard on the motion to strike, the court granted the motion to strike and asked defense counsel how she wished to proceed. Counsel replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">\u201cI don\u2019t know how to proceed other than to request that the Court consider a reset to allow me to re-file my motion together. I think that my client\u2019s constitutional rights are more important than a procedural violation that I made Your Honor. I do think she would have a valid basis to file a post conviction relief against me. I already did inform her of that this morning and discussed it with my office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">After a further discussion between the court and counsel about the availability of witnesses for trial and a brief recess, defendant\u2019s attorney made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">\u201c[J]ust for the record I would like to note that I think my client does have a valid motion to suppress. It was my error on not filing the memorandum of law in a timely fashion, and I think that this is a case that will be coming back on post conviction relief. I think that my client\u2019s constitutional rights are getting violated by her not getting to litigate the motion to suppress, so we would like to proceed and preserve the record via a stip facts trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">After a trial on stipulated facts, the court convicted defendant of all three charged offenses. Defendant appeals from the ensuing judgment of conviction, arguing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>trial court erred by striking or summarily denying her motion to suppress, because her motion and the accompanying affidavit of counsel were sufficient to place the burden on the state to prove the lawfulness of the challenged search.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Defendant\u2019s argument on appeal is straightforward. It consists of three prongs: (1) defendant\u2019s motion to suppress implicitly notified the state that she challenged the search of her purse as warrantless; (2) \u201c[t]he burden to establish the lawfulness of a warrantless search and seizure is on the state,\u201d <em>State v. Sargent, </em>323 Or 455, 461, 918 P2d 819 (1996); ORS 133.693;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (3) without consideration of her memorandum, defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and accompanying affidavit of counsel were sufficient, under a constitutionally permissible reading of UTCR 4.060, to satisfy her obligation to provide the state and the trial court with notice of the issues to be litigated at the suppression hearing. <em>See State v. Miller, </em>269 Or 328, 334, 524 P2d 1399 (1974) (if the defendant alleges absence of a warrant, the state must \u201cproceed to satisfy its burden either at a hearing on the motion or, at the least, by an affidavit stating facts sufficient, if true, to establish the legality of the search\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The state initially replies that none of the prongs of defendant\u2019s argument is preserved. According to the state, defendant never argued before the trial court that her motion and affidavit, by themselves, complied with UTCR 4.060 but, rather, her counsel admitted that, by filing the memorandum on the day of trial, she had violated the rule. In addition, the state argues, defendant did not preserve an argument that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the trial court\u2019s application of the rule violated any particular constitutional right of hers.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Defendant replies that her argument on appeal is preserved, because (1) the trial court made the challenged ruling without first giving her an opportunity to respond to the state\u2019s motion to strike; (2) the court seemed to appreciate that its ruling was erroneous; (3) after the court had ruled, counsel\u2019s assertion that defendant\u2019s \u201cconstitutional rights are more important than a procedural violation that I made\u201d was sufficient to preserve her argument on appeal; and (4) defendant\u2019s counsel did not acknowledge that she had violated UTCR 4.060, but, rather, merely acknowledged that the court had so ruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Generally, we will not consider an issue on appeal that was not preserved in the trial court. <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 341, 15 P3d 22 (2000). In <em>State v. Stevens, </em>328 Or 116, 122, 970 P2d 215 (1998), the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">\u201c[F]or purposes of preserving error, it is essential to raise the relevant issue at trial, but less important to make a specific argument or identify a specific legal source with respect to the issue raised. <em>State v. Hitz, </em>307 Or 183, 188, 766 P2d 373 (1988). Although that principle imparts some degree of liberality to the preservation requirement, it does not transform that requirement into a cursory search for some common thread, however remote, between an issue on appeal and a position that was advanced at trial. Instead, in considering whether an objection at trial raised the \u2018issue\u2019 being advanced on appeal, an appellate court must view the facts in light of the purposes of fairness and efficiency that underlie the requirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">To preserve an error at trial, \u201ca party must provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d <em>Wyatt, </em>331 Or at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">In certain circumstances, the strictures of preservation may be relaxed or excused. As the Supreme Court recently explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>\u201c[p]reservation rules are pragmatic as well as prudential. What is required of a party to adequately present a contention to the trial court can vary depending on the nature of the claim or argument; the touchstone in that regard, ultimately, is procedural fairness to the parties and to the trial court. * * * In some circumstances, the preservation requirement gives way entirely, as when a party has no practical ability to raise an issue. <em>See, e.g., McCarthy v. Oregon Freeze Dry, Inc., </em>327 Or 84, 95 n 6, 957 P2d 1200, <em>modified on recons, </em>327 Or 185, 957 P2d 1200 (1998) (party not required to take action to preserve an issue that first arose when court issued its order).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><em>Peeples v. Lampert, </em>345 Or 209, 220, 191 P3d 637 (2008); <em>see also State v. Gutierrez, </em>170 Or App 91, 94, 11 P3d 690 (2000) (principles underlying preservation requirements not implicated where trial court <em>sua sponte </em>entered a judgment of dismissal with prejudice and, hence, \u201cthere [was] no opportunity to bring the alleged error to the court\u2019s attention before it rule[d]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Here, however, defendant had an opportunity to respond to the state\u2019s written motion to strike before the court ruled. In fact, she filed a written response to the motion on the day of trial, asking the trial court to deny the state\u2019s motion to strike as untimely.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant did not advance any of the prongs of her argument on appeal in that submission. Moreover, the trial court afforded defendant an opportunity to make a record in opposition to the state\u2019s motion to strike after it had ruled, but before proceeding to trial on stipulated facts. Nothing in counsel\u2019s objection alerted the court to her current argument that the ruling was erroneous because her motion to suppress and the affidavit accompanying it satisfied the requirements of UTCR 4.060 by demonstrating that the challenged search was warrantless. <em>See State v. Hammond, </em>218 Or App 574, 584, 180 P3d 137 (2008) (where statute required findings to be made \u201con the record in open court,\u201d defense counsel had a \u201ccomplete contemporaneous opportunity\u201d to address the trial court\u2019s noncompliance; failure to do so rendered defendant\u2019s claim of error unpreserved). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Moreover, without further explication, defense counsel\u2019s argument that defendant\u2019s \u201cconstitutional rights are more important than a procedural violation that I made,\u201d likewise did nothing to signal the argument that she makes on appeal. <em>See State v. </em>Smith, 188 Or App 573, 72 P3d 657, <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 126 (2003) (argument that arrest was \u201cillegal\u201d does not preserve particular constitutional argument). Finally, the trial court\u2019s rumination that, for unstated constitutional reasons, its ruling might not be upheld, has no bearing on the preservation analysis. Accordingly, we conclude that defendant\u2019s argument is unpreserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"> We next consider defendant\u2019s assertion that the trial court\u2019s ruling constitutes error apparent on the face of the record. We may reach unpreserved error if it is an \u201cerror of law apparent on the face of the record,\u201d ORAP 5.45(1), also referred to as \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>See State v. Steen, </em>346 Or 143, 206 P3d 614 (2009) (discussing plain error exception to preservation requirement generally). An error is \u201cplain\u201d for purposes of ORAP 5.45 if (1) the error is one of law; (2) the legal point is obvious, that is, \u201cnot reasonably in dispute\u201d; and (3) to reach the error, \u201c[w]e need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it[.]\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Although the asserted error is one of law, thus satisfying the first prong of the plain error test, defendant\u2019s argument founders on the second prong of the test. It is not obvious. It is true that, in <em>Miller, </em>the Supreme Court held that a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress gives sufficient notice of the necessary facts underlying the motion by alleging only that the search at issue was \u201cwithout a warrant.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>269 Or at 335. However, defendant acknowledges that neither her motion to suppress nor the accompanying affidavit expressly asserted that the challenged search was warrantless.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Defendant remonstrates that her counsel\u2019s assertion in her affidavit that it was questionable whether the officer had reasonable suspicion or probable cause to search defendant\u2019s purse implied that the search was conducted without a warrant. Although it is true that that assertion, together with counsel\u2019s description of the circumstances of the traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>stop that led to the search, implied that the search was conducted without a warrant, the inference is not irresistible.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In any event, no appellate decision to date has held that a motion to suppress that implies \u2014 but does not expressly assert \u2014 that a challenged search was conducted without a warrant, is sufficient, without more, to satisfy the requirements of UTCR 4.060. Although that proposition may be correct, it is not ineluctably so. <em>Cf. State v. Sweet, </em>122 Or App 525, 529-30, 858 P2d 477 (1993) (holding that a motion to suppress was insufficient where it failed to expressly assert that the challenged search was warrantless, even though the motion to suppress and accompanying affidavit showed that the search involved an officer\u2019s inquiry as to the defendant\u2019s well being for purposes of rendering emergency aid where the defendant was in his car). It follows that the asserted error is not apparent on the face of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-6\"> Although the trial court did not expressly deny defendant\u2019s motion to suppress on the record, the state acknowledges that the effect of the court\u2019s grant of its motion to strike defendant\u2019s memorandum was the denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. Accordingly, we treat the court\u2019s ruling as a denial of the motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b488-7\"> ORS 133.693 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">\u201c(3) In any proceeding [to contest the good faith, accuracy and truthfulness of the affiant] under subsection (2) of this section, the moving party shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the evidence presented before the issuing authority was not offered in good faith, was not accurate and was not truthful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">\u201c(4) Where the motion to suppress challenges evidence seized as the result of a warrantless search, the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the validity of the search is on the prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b490-6\"> The trial court did not expressly rule on defendant\u2019s motion but, at least implicitly denied it by granting the state\u2019s motion to strike. Defendant does not assign error to that ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b492-5\"><em> </em>The affidavit stated that the arresting officer questioned defendant and conducted two patdown searches of her person. It then stated, \u201c[Defendant] was ultimately taken into custody and [the officer] then conducted a search of [defendant\u2019s] purse.\u201d It said nothing about how much time passed between defendant being taken into custody and the officer searching her purse. Although the affidavit could be read to imply that the search occurred immediately after defendant\u2019s arrest, it does not exclude the possibility that the officer arrested defendant, took her to the police station, obtained a search warrant, and then searched her purse. Read in that light, counsel\u2019s assertion about reasonable suspicion or probable cause could be understood to imply that the warrant was not properly issued. Thus, it is not beyond reasonable dispute that the motion and affidavit were, by themselves, sufficient to satisfy UTCR 4.060.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
