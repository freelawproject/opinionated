The board\u2019s final order, which affirmed and adopted the proposed order issued by the administrative law judge (ALJ), concluded (1) that petitioner was not entitled to have the funds withdrawn from his Tier Two variable account restored into that account and that PERS properly redeposited all of petitioner\u2019s repaid funds into his regular account and (2) that the doctrine of equitable estoppel did not apply to require that PERS redeposit a portion of petitioner\u2019s repaid funds into his variable account. Petitioner assigns error to those conclusions. We review for errors of law, ORS 183.482(8)(a), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The facts in this case, as found by the ALJ and adopted by the board, are undisputed by the parties. Petitioner was a Tier Two PERS member who participated in PERS\u2019s variable account program. In March 2003, he terminated his employment with his PERS-participating employer. In early August 2004, he requested to withdraw all funds from his PERS member account. On August 20, 2004, PERS withdrew the amounts credited to petitioner\u2019s regular and variable accounts and refunded them pursuant to ORS 238.265.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>On August 31, 2004, petitioner returned to PERSqualifying employment. Within a year of the withdrawal of funds from his PERS account, petitioner sought to redeposit those funds into PERS. In June 2005, PERS sent petitioner a letter regarding its estimate of his voluntary redeposit. In July 2005, pursuant to ORS 238.105,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> petitioner repaid the full amount withdrawn from his PERS account in 2004 plus accrued interest, as had been indicated in PERS\u2019s June 2005 letter. In July 2006, PERS recalculated petitioner\u2019s redeposit amount and invoiced him for the unpaid balance. In February 2007, petitioner requested that PERS redeposit a portion of his restored funds into the variable account. PERS denied that request and explained, \u201cIt is customary PERS practice to transfer the variable account to the regular account immediately prior to a withdrawal. Therefore, when you redeposited your funds, we restored your entire balance as a regular member account balance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Petitioner requested a hearing to challenge the denial of his request. Following that hearing, the ALJ issued a proposed order that reached the conclusions noted above, which the board later adopted. The ALJ opined that, at the time of petitioner\u2019s voluntary redeposit under ORS 238.105, contributions and transfers to a member\u2019s variable account were prohibited by ORS 238.260(3)(b) and (5)(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the ALJ reasoned that OAR 459-007-0025 directed that petitioner\u2019s voluntarily redeposited funds be added to his regular account.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the ALJ determined that, because the arrangement that petitioner sought was contrary to law, the doctrine of equitable estoppel could not operate in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">On appeal, we understand petitioner to argue as follows: (1) although OAR 459-007-0025 \u201callows PERS the discretion\u201d to decide what action is necessary regarding a member\u2019s lump sum payments, including voluntary redeposits, OAR 459-007-0220 \u201cconversely\u201d allows members the opportunity to credit earnings to their variable accounts; (2) ORS 238.105 makes petitioner eligible for restoration of his variable account, and, although ORS 238.260(3)(b) and (5)(d) prohibit future contributions and transfers to the variable account, those provisions do not prohibit restoration of petitioner\u2019s variable account; (3) in \u201ccanceling\u201d petitioner\u2019s variable account, PERS ignores the policy of ORS 238.260, which provides that, once a member places money in the variable account, it cannot be transferred back to the regular account except at retirement and in other particular narrow circumstances; and (4) the doctrine of equitable estoppel requires restoration of petitioner\u2019s variable account. We write only to address petitioner\u2019s first two arguments and reject without discussion his remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"> We begin with petitioner\u2019s argument that OAR 459-007-0025 imposes a discretionary standard on PERS and that the rule is \u201cconverse\u201d to OAR 459-007-0220. We understand petitioner\u2019s argument to oppose the board\u2019s interpretation and application of the rule in denying his request to redeposit funds into his variable account. In <em>Jordan v. Employment Dept., </em>195 Or App 404, 408, 97 P3d 1273 (2004) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>(quoting <em>Trebesch v. Employment Div., </em>300 Or 264, 273, 710 P2d 136 (1985)), we recognized that authorized representatives of an agency \u201c \u2018interpret the law in the process of applying it.\u2019 \u201d However, we ultimately concluded in <em>Jordan </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\">\u201cany interpretation of departmental rules resulting in a conclusion [opposite of that made by the reviewing board] would be implausible, would conflict with the rule\u2019s text, and would, therefore, deserve no deference. <em>[Don\u2019t Waste Oregon Com. v. Energy Facility Siting, </em>320 Or 132, 142, 881 P2d 119 (1994).] Put another way, resolving this case requires no rule interpretation because, on the facts of this case, the rule is perfectly clear; deciding the case requires only straightforward application of the law to facts * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 410. Thus, where there is only one plausible way to interpret an agency\u2019s rule so as not to conflict with its own text, there is no interpretation by the agency, but merely a straightforward application.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">At the time of petitioner\u2019s voluntary redeposit, as well as at the time of his earlier withdrawal, OAR 459-007-0025 (Nov 14, 2003) was straightforward as to its terms and definitions; subsection (5) of that rule directed that PERS \u201cshall\u201d credit member lump sum payments to a member\u2019s regular account. The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d indicated that a mandatory, not a discretionary, action was required of the agency. In addition, OAR 459-007-0025(l)(b)(B) defined \u201c[m]ember lump sum payments\u201d to explicitly include \u201c[voluntary redeposit, as provided under ORS 238.105.\u201d Further, contrary to petitioner\u2019s arguments, OAR 459-007-0220 (Jan 7, 2000) did not address how PERS was required to handle voluntary redeposits, but rather addressed how earnings or losses were to be applied to a Tier Two member\u2019s regular and variable accounts when that member <em>withdrew </em>his or her member account under ORS 238.265.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For that reason, OAR 459-007-0220 was not \u201cconverse\u201d to OAR 459-007-0025.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Given the clarity and specificity of OAR 459-007-0025 (Nov 14, 2003), resolving this case required only that the board apply the rule to the facts in a straightforward manner, without the need to interpret the <em>rule </em>\u2014 i.e., without the need to choose between at least two plausible meanings. And, on these facts, we conclude that the board correctly applied the rule in determining that PERS was required to add all of petitioner\u2019s voluntary redeposit to petitioner\u2019s regular account.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Turning to petitioner\u2019s argument under the governing statutory scheme, we conclude that ORS 238.105 also fails to dictate the result sought by petitioner. When interpreting a statute, our goal is to ascertain the intent of the enacting legislature by examination of the statute\u2019s text and context, along with any relevant legislative history, and if necessary, by resort to relevant cannons of statutory construction. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-73, 206 P3d 1042 (2009); <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). We give words of common usage that are not defined in the statute their plain and ordinary meanings. <em>Id. </em>at 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">ORS 238.105(1) provides that a member\u2019s repayment of funds previously withdrawn, plus interest, restores \u201cthe employee\u2019s rights in the system that were forfeited by the withdrawal[.]\u201d Petitioner equates restoration of an \u201cemployee\u2019s rights in the system\u201d with restoration of an \u201cemployee\u2019s accounts.\u201d We are not persuaded that the phrase \u201cemployee\u2019s rights in the system\u201d is so limited in interpretation. The statutory text and context indicate that the contours of an employee\u2019s restored \u201crights,\u201d under ORS 238.105(1), are shaped by the statutory and regulatory schemes governing PERS. At the time of petitioner\u2019s withdrawal in August 2004, petitioner\u2019s rights in the system were therefore defined, in part, by the then governing regulatory scheme, which included the provisions of OAR 459-007-0025 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>(Nov 14, 2003). As already discussed, OAR 459-007-0025 required that a member\u2019s voluntary redeposit be added to that member\u2019s regular account. Thus, at the time of petitioner\u2019s withdrawal, petitioner was not entitled to have PERS credit to his variable account any future redeposit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">For all the above reasons, we conclude that the board did not err in granting PERS summary determination and denying petitioner\u2019s request that PERS redeposit into his Tier Two variable account funds that he had previously withdrawn from that account and was seeking to repay.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\"> Provisions of the statutes governing PERS, ORS chapter 238, have been amended in various ways since the relevant time period involved in this case. Those amendments do not affect the substance of the statutory provisions that are material to the issues presented here. For ease of reference, we therefore refer to the current provisions of ORS chapter 238 throughout this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">ORS 238.265 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">\u201c(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a member of the Public Employees Retirement System may withdraw from the Public Employees Retirement Fund the amount credited to the member account, if any, for the member if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">\u201c(a) The member is separated from all service with participating public employers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">\u201c(b) The member is separated from all service with employers who are treated as part of a participating public employer\u2019s controlled group under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>federal laws and rules governing the status of the system and the fund as a qualified governmental retirement plan and trust;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6k\">\u201c(c) The member has not attained earliest service retirement age; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW1\">\u201c(d) The separation from service is not by reason of death or disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQR\">\u00ab* H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVz\">\u201c(5) Withdrawal of a member account under this section cancels all membership rights in the system, including the right to claim credit for any employment before withdrawal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaE\">Under ORS 238.005(13)(a), \u201c \u2018[mlember account\u2019 means the regular account and the variable account.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b192-11\"> ORS 238.105 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-12\">\u201c(1) Whenever, within five years after the employee is separated from all service entitling the employee to membership in the system, an employee who has withdrawn the amount credited to the member account of the member reenters the service of an employer participating in the system, the employee\u2019s rights in the system that were forfeited by the withdrawal shall be restored upon repaying to the board within one year after reentering the service of the employer, the full amount so withdrawn together with the interest that would have been accumulated on the sum had the amount not been withdrawn.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b192-13\"> ORS 238.260(3)(b) provides that, \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of this section, a member may not contribute to the Variable Annuity Account after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>December 31, 2003.\u201d ORS 238.260(5)(d) provides that, \u201c[n]otwithstanding paragraphs (a) to (c) of this subsection, a member may not elect to transfer funds under this subsection [from the member\u2019s regular account to the member\u2019s variable account] after December 31, 2003.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b193-9\"> At the time of petitioner\u2019s redeposit in 2005, OAR459-007-0025(l)(b) (Nov 14, 2003) provided that \u201c[m]ember lump sum payments include * * * [voluntary redeposit, as provided under ORS 238.105.\u201d Further, OAR 459-007-0025(5) (Nov 14, 2003) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">\u201cIf the effective retirement date does not occur in the same year as the date of payment, the member lump sum payment shall be made a part of the member\u2019s regular account as of January 1 of the year following the date of payment.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\"> OAR 459-007-0220 (Jan 7,2000) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">\u201cFor <em>withdrawal </em>of contributions of a terminated Tier Two member, not eligible for a retirement allowance, during a period for which no annual distribution of earnings or losses has been made, earnings or losses shall be applied to the Tier Two member\u2019s account to date of distribution as follows!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b195-6\"> We note that petitioner has not challenged the validity of OAR 459-007-0025. Thus, we do not address that issue. <em>See Robison Jewish Home v.

PERB, </em>338 Or 145, 211-12, 108 P3d 1058 (2005), and argues that, as a vested member in the Variable Annuity Program, he is allowed to maintain \u2014 and thus restore \u2014 his variable account. In <em>Strunk, </em>the court held that, although the wording of ORS 238.260(3) (2001), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 3, \u201cdoes not support a continued right to contribute to the variable annuity account program, the wording does evince a legislative promise to reserve until the time of retirement any monies that a member has invested in the variable annuity account program for the purchase of a variable annuity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212. The court then went on to ultimately conclude that the 2003 legislative changes, which were codified in ORS 238.260(3)(b) and (5)(d) and which discontinued permitting PERS members to contribute to their variable accounts, were not inconsistent with the legislative promise to reserve until the time of retirement any funds placed into the variable accounts. <em>Id. </em>at 213. The court in <em>Strunk </em>was not confronted with the circumstances at issue <em>here </em>\u2014 i.e., whether after withdrawing from the system, a member is entitled to redeposit funds to the variable account, despite the prohibition on contributions and transfers to the variable account embodied in ORS 238.260(3)(b) and (5)(d). We therefore do not find the analysis of <em>Strunk </em>to be controlling of the issues in this case and do not address petitioner\u2019s argument further.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
