The dissolution judgment awarded wife an equalizing judgment of $25,777. In our previous opinion, 235 Or App 217, 230 P3d 946 (2010), we ordered a modification of the property division to provide wife with an additional $140,800, as wife\u2019s just and proper share of the marital appreciation of husband\u2019s veterinary clinic. Our disposition stated: \u201cDissolution judgment modified to award wife an additional $140,800, to be paid in monthly installments over 10 years; otherwise affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">In her petition for reconsideration, wife notes that, in his reply brief, husband conceded that wife was entitled an equal share of the after-tax balance of his profit-sharing account, $29,384, and that the judgment should be revised accordingly. Wife inquires whether this court also intends for husband to pay that amount in addition to the original equalizing judgment of $25,777 and the additional $140,800 awarded in our disposition. We conclude that the current disposition reflects a just and proper division of the marital property and adhere to it. Thus, the total equalizing judgment is $166,577, to be paid in monthly installments over 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Reconsideration allowed; opinion clarified and adhered to as clarified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
