For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the trial court did not err by denying defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal but did err by admitting into evidence a certification from the Social Security Administration. We reject defendant\u2019s third assignment of error without discussion, and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The pertinent facts are few and undisputed. Defendant was employed at a restaurant for five years. To establish eligibility for employment, defendant showed his manager a Social Security card and completed a Form 1-9, an employment eligibility verification form, listing the Social Security number shown on the card. Instructions on the form state that a Social Security card is among the documents that may be used to establish employment eligibility and that the form is for employers to verify employment eligibility \u201cto preclude the unlawful hiring * * * of aliens who are not authorized to work in the United States.\u201d The form states, \u201cI am aware that federal law provides for imprisonment and/or fines for false statements or use of false documents in connection with the completion of this form.\u201d (Boldface omitted.) Later, defendant provided two other Social Security numbers to his employer on tax forms; those two numbers differed from each other by one digit.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Some time later, defendant was charged with identity theft. Although ORS 165.800(1) provides that a person may commit the crime of identity theft \u201cwith the intent to deceive <em>or </em>to defraud\u201d (emphasis added), the indictment charged only that he \u201cdid unlawfully with the intent to defraud obtain and possess personal identification of a real or imaginary person, to wit: a fraudulent U.S. government Social Security number, [the number listed on defendant\u2019s Form 1-9].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">At trial, the state offered a certification from a custodian of records of the Social Security Administration (SSA). A police officer testified that he had asked the SSA to provide verification of the Social Security number. The certification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>states that two Social Security numbers, including the number identified in the indictment, \u201cdo not belong to [defendant], These two numbers have been assigned by the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration to two other individuals whom [sic] both are now deceased.\u201d Defendant objected to the certification, and the trial court overruled his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">At the close of the state\u2019s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal. He argued that, although the prosecution had alleged an \u201cintent to defraud,\u201d there is no evidence that defendant intended to defraud anyone of anything. The court denied defendant\u2019s motion, and the jury found him guilty. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">We begin with defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal. On appeal, defendant renews his arguments that the evidence was insufficient to allow a finding that he had the intent to defraud. He contends that, because ORS 165.800(1) requires an \u201cintent to deceive or to defraud,\u201d defraud must mean something distinct from deceive and, under the plain meaning of defraud, \u201cthe state was required to show that [defendant] took or withheld something from some victim.\u201d In defendant\u2019s view, no one was deprived of any possession, right, or interest by his use of the Social Security number.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The state responds that the evidence was sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find an intent to defraud based on defendant\u2019s use of the Social Security number to obtain a benefit to which he was not entitled or to mislead others into acting to his benefit. In the state\u2019s view, defendant caused his employer to rely on false information so that he could maintain employment when he had no legal right to do so, and he caused his employer to report false information to the federal government, preventing the federal government from taking legal action against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">We review the denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal to determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cervantes, </em>319 Or 121, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>125, 873 P2d 316 (1994). We resolve issues of statutory interpretation by applying the principles of <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). We attempt to ascertain what the legislature most likely intended, beginning by examining the text of the statute in context. <em>Id. </em>at 171-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">ORS 165.800(1) provides, \u201cA person commits the crime of identity theft if the person, with the intent to deceive or to defraud, obtains, possesses, transfers, creates, utters or converts to the person\u2019s own use the personal identification of another person.\u201d \u201cPersonal identification\u201d includes a written document that provides or purports to provide information about a person\u2019s Social Security number. ORS 165.800(4)(b)(C). As noted, the indictment in this case alleged that defendant acted \u201cwith the intent to defraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The word \u201cdefraud\u201d is not defined in the statute. It commonly means \u201cto take or withhold from (one) some possession, right, or interest by calculated misstatement or perversion of truth, trickery, or other deception &lt;~ the heirs of the bequests&gt; &lt;citizens <em>~ed </em>of their voting rights&gt; * * * to engage in fraud.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>593 (unabridged ed 2002). <em>Webster\u2019s </em>defines \u201cfraud\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">\u201c1 a : an instance or an act of trickery or deceit esp. when involving misrepresentation * * * <em>or </em>fraud in fact : an intentional misrepresentation, concealment, or nondisclosure for the purpose of inducing another in reliance upon it to part with some valuable thing belonging to him or to surrender a legal right: a false representation of a matter of fact by words or conduct, by false or misleading allegations, or by the concealment of what should have been disclosed that deceives or is intended to deceive another so he shall act upon it to his legal injury * * * b : a means used in trickery : a dishonest stratagem or a spurious thing passed off as genuine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 904 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Those definitions are consistent with the sense of \u201cdefraud\u201d and \u201cfraud\u201d in law. \u201cDefraud\u201d means \u201c[t]o cause injury or loss to (a person) by deceit. See fraud.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>488 (9th ed 2009). <em>Black\u2019s </em>defines \u201cinjury\u201d as \u201c[t]he violation of another\u2019s legal right, for which the law provides a remedy; a wrong or injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 856. \u201cFraud\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>defined to mean, among other things, \u201c[a] knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of a material fact to induce another to act to his or her detriment. \u2022 Fraud is usu. a tort, but in some cases (esp. when the conduct is willful) it may be a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 731. \u201cCriminal fraud\u201d is defined as \u201c[fjraud that has been made illegal by statute and that subjects the offender to criminal penalties such as fines and imprisonment. \u2022 An example is the willful evasion of taxes accomplished by filing a fraudulent tax return.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">We conclude that, under ORS 165.800(1), the intent to defraud includes an intent to cause injury to another\u2019s legal rights or interests.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, a jury could find from defendant\u2019s misrepresentation on the Form 1-9 that defendant intended to defraud the federal government. The jury could infer that, by making an intentional misrepresentation on the Form 1-9, defendant intended to injure the legal interest of the federal government in enforcing its laws. That intent is sufficient to establish the intent \u201cto defraud\u201d under ORS 165.800(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">In addition, the statute\u2019s history suggests that defendant, by misrepresenting his employment eligibility so as to cause his employer to give him a job that he was not legally eligible to have, also had an intent to defraud the employer. Although the dictionary definitions of \u201cdefraud\u201d may be ambiguous as to whether such a misrepresentation is consistent with an intent to defraud, the statute\u2019s history indicates that the legislature intended ORS 165.800 to encompass such misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">When ORS 165.800 was enacted in 1999, the intent element was limited to \u201cthe intent to defraud\u201d; the alternative intent to \u201cdeceive\u201d was added in the next legislative session. Or Laws 2001, ch 870, \u00a7 3. Even before that 2001 amendment, however, the statute provided affirmative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>defenses to identity theft when a person uses personal identification solely for the purpose of misrepresenting the person\u2019s age so as to purchase alcohol or tobacco products or to gain access to an age-restricted place or benefit. ORS 165.800(3) (1999).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The legislature apparently considered such use consistent with an intent to defraud, so that an affirmative defense was required to prevent prosecution for identity theft when, for example, a minor uses false identification to purchase alcohol or to enter a bar. If the legislature had meant the intent to defraud to refer only to taking or obtaining property, that affirmative defense would have been unnecessary because such use does not deprive another of property. Use of personal identification to misrepresent a person\u2019s age does, however, place persons to whom the false identification is presented in the position of unwittingly violating laws prohibiting the sale of alcohol and tobacco to underage buyers, or prohibiting the admission of underage patrons to particular places. If such use of false identification is consistent with an intent to defraud, then defendant\u2019s presentation of a false Social Security number, which placed his employer in the position of unwittingly violating laws concerning employment eligibility, also is consistent with an intent to defraud. The trial court did not err by denying defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"> We turn to defendant\u2019s second assignment of error, which challenges the admission of the SSA certification. Defendant contends that the trial court erred in admitting the certification, because that certification \u2014 which was prepared specifically for use in a criminal prosecution \u2014 was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>testimonial statement and its admission violated defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. The state responds that the certification was not a testimonial statement and that, in any event, it was merely cumulative of other evidence and thus any error was harmless. In the state\u2019s view, defendant\u2019s use of multiple Social Security numbers over the course of his employment was sufficient evidence that he had used false numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">After oral argument was held in this case, the United States Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Melendez-Diaz v. </em>Massachusetts,_US_, 129 S Ct 2527, 174 L Ed 2d 314 (2009). There, the Court considered whether \u201ccertificates of analysis\u201d were testimonial \u2014 and thus whether the affiants were \u201cwitnesses\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment \u2014 where the certificates reported the results of forensic analysis indicating that a particular substance was cocaine. 129 S Ct at 2530-31. The Court concluded that the certificates, which were sworn statements, were affidavits made under circumstances that would cause an objective witness to reasonably believe that they would be used in a trial and thus were testimonial statements. <em>Id. </em>at 2532.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">In responding to the dissent\u2019s view of the certificates\u2019 admissibility, the Court made various observations concerning public records that are pertinent here. Specifically, the Court distinguished between a clerk\u2019s authentication of a record, on the one hand, and a clerk\u2019s creation of a record, on the other:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">\u201cThe dissent identifies a single class of evidence which, though prepared for use at trial, was traditionally admissible: a clerk\u2019s certificate authenticating an official record \u2014 \u25a0 or a copy thereof \u2014 for use as evidence. But a clerk\u2019s authority in that regard was narrowly circumscribed. He was permitted \u2018to certify to the correctness of a copy of a record kept in his office,\u2019 but had \u2018no authority to furnish, as evidence for the trial of a lawsuit, his interpretation of what the record contains or shows, or to certify to its substance or effect.\u2019 <em>State v. Wilson, </em>141 La. 404, 409, 75 So. 95, 97 (1917). See also State <em>v. Champion, </em>116 N.C. 987, 21 S.E. 700, 700-701 (1895); 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1678 (3d ed. 1940). The dissent suggests that the fact that this exception was \u2018narrowly circumscribed\u2019 makes no difference. To the contrary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>it makes all the difference in the world. It shows that even the line of cases establishing the one narrow exception the dissent has been able to identify simultaneously vindicates the general rule applicable to the present case. A clerk could by affidavit <em>authenticate </em>or provide a copy of an otherwise admissible record, but could not do what the analysts did here: <em>create </em>a record for the sole purpose of providing evidence against a defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\">\u201cFar more probative here are those cases in which the prosecution sought to admit into evidence a clerk\u2019s certificate attesting to the fact that the clerk had searched for a particular relevant record and failed to find it. Like the testimony of the analysts in this case, the clerk\u2019s statement would serve as substantive evidence against the defendant whose guilt depended on the nonexistence of the record for which the clerk searched. Although the clerk\u2019s certificate would qualify as an official record under respondent\u2019s definition \u2014 it was prepared by a public officer in the regular course of his official duties \u2014 and although the clerk was certainly not a \u2018conventional witness\u2019 under the dissent\u2019s approach, the clerk was nonetheless subject to confrontation. See <em>People v. Bromwich, </em>200 N.Y. 385, 388-389, 93 N.E. 933, 934 (1911); <em>People v. Goodrode, </em>132 Mich. 542, 547, 94 N.W. 14, 16 (1903); Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1678.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\"><em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>129 S Ct at 2538-39 (some citations and internal quotation marks omitted; footnotes omitted; emphasis in original). The Court went on to explain the grounds for admissibility of business and public records:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">\u201cBusiness and public records are generally admissible absent confrontation not because they qualify under an exception to the hearsay rules, but because \u2014 having been created for the administration of an entity\u2019s affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial \u2014 they are not testimonial. Whether or not they qualify as business or official records, the analysts\u2019 statements here \u2014 prepared specifically for use at petitioner\u2019s trial \u2014 \u25a0 were testimony against petitioner, and the analysts were subject to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 2539-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">We conclude that the certification at issue here \u2014 in which an SSA representative certified that particular Social Security numbers \u201cdo not belong to [defendant]\u201d \u2014 does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>fall within the limited historical exception recognized in <em>Melendez-Diaz. </em>The certification does not constitute an official record. Rather, it was apparently prepared in response to a police officer\u2019s request for information concerning defendant. The certification furnishes evidence that the number used by defendant was not his own. Under <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>admission of the certification violated defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Although the state contends that the certification was merely cumulative, the other evidence was qualitatively different from the certification. The indictment alleged that defendant unlawfully obtained and possessed a specific Social Security number \u2014 the one on the Form 1-9. The evidence that defendant later provided a different Social Security number to his employer, unlike the SSA certification, does not necessarily indicate that the number on the Form 1-9 was not defendant\u2019s. Because we cannot say that the error in admitting the evidence was \u201c \u2018harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Lavadores, </em>230 Or App 163, 176, 214 P3d 86 (2009) (citation omitted), we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-7\"> Our construction of ORS 165.800 is consistent with historical understandings of fraud. <em>See State v. </em>Moyer, 348 Or 220, 234-35, 230 P3d 7 (2010) (noting that \u201cmisrepresentations made with intent to injure or defraud * * * were statutorily prohibited as criminal acts as early as 1864 * * *.
