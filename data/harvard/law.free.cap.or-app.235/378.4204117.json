He contends that the trial court erred in failing to merge the two second-degree robbery convictions, which were based on violations of separate paragraphs of the second-degree robbery statute\u2014 ORS 164.405(1). That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">\u201cA person commits the crime of robbery in the second degree if the person violates ORS 164.395 and the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">\u201c(a) Represents by word or conduct that the person is armed with what purports to be a dangerous or deadly weapon;or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">\u201c(b) Is aided by another person actually present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Defendant did not object at trial to the court\u2019s failure to merge the convictions. He contends, however, that that failure constitutes plain error that we should exercise our discretion to correct. The state concedes that, in light of <em>State v. White, </em>346 Or 275, 211 P3d 248 (2009), the trial court\u2019s failure to merge the second-degree robbery convictions does constitute plain error. We accept the state\u2019s concession, and, based on the considerations described in <em>State v. ValladaresJuarez, </em>219 Or App 561, 564-65, 184 P3d 1131 (2008), we exercise our discretion to correct the error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Convictions on Counts 2 and 3 reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a judgment of conviction of one count of second-degree robbery reflecting that defendant was convicted on both theories and for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-10\"> Defendant raises other contentions in his <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief.
