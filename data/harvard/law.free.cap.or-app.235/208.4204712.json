It assigns error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to include reasonable funeral expenses as part of the restitution order. We review sentencing decisions, including restitution orders, for errors of law. ORS 138.222(4); <em>State v. Ferrara, </em>218 Or App 57, 67-68, 178 P3d 250, <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 539 (2008). For the reasons explained below, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Defendant was convicted of criminally negligent homicide for causing the death of the decedent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ORS 163.145. The decedent had a life insurance policy payable to his brother, Faulkner. Although the policy did not include a benefit for the decedent\u2019s funeral expenses, at Faulkner\u2019s request, the funeral home billed the insurer for those expenses. Faulkner explained that \u201cwe had to come up with the money to \u2014 to pay for the funeral. So what we did is we asked the funeral people to bill the insurance company, since we had a life insurance policy.\u201d The bill from the funeral home lists Faulkner\u2019s name and address and reflects that the bill was paid in full. The insurer paid the funeral home directly and then paid the remainder of the policy benefit to Faulkner.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Following a restitution hearing, the trial court ordered defendant to pay restitution but, despite finding the amount of the funeral expenses to be reasonable, did not include the funeral expenses in the restitution order. The court concluded that Faulkner did not incur economic damages as a result of defendant\u2019s criminal acts, because the decedent eventually would have had funeral expenses, whenever and however he died, and that Faulkner would have paid those expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">This case presents questions of statutory construction, which we resolve by applying the principles set out in <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 206 P3d 1042 (2009), and <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 859 P2d 1143 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>(1993). In determining the meaning of a statute, we attempt to ascertain what the legislature most likely intended. We begin by examining the text of the statute in context, along with any relevant legislative history offered by the parties. <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 171-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">ORS 137.106<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requires that restitution be ordered when a victim has suffered economic damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">\u201c(1) When a person is convicted of a crime * * * that has resulted in economic damages, the district attorney shall investigate and present to the court, prior to the time of sentencing, evidence of the nature and amount of the damages. If the court finds from the evidence presented that a victim suffered economic damages, in addition to any other sanction it may impose, the court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">\u201c(a) Include in the judgment a requirement that the defendant pay the victim restitution in a specific amount that equals the full amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages as determined by the court; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">\u201c(b) Include in the judgment a requirement that the defendant pay the victim restitution, and that the specific amount of restitution will be established by a supplemental judgment based on a determination made by the court within 90 days of entry of the judgment. In the supplemental judgment, the court shall establish a specific amount of restitution that equals the full amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages as determined by the court. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">* <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">\u201c(4) If a judgment or supplemental judgment described in subsection (1) of this section includes restitution, a court may delay the enforcement of the monetary sanctions, including restitution, only if the defendant alleges and establishes to the satisfaction of the court the defendant\u2019s inability to pay the judgment in full at the time the judgment is entered. If the court finds that the defendant is unable to pay, the court may establish or allow an appropriate supervising authority to establish a payment schedule, taking into consideration the financial resources of the defendant and the burden that payment of restitution will impose, with due regard to the other obligations of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>The terms \u201cvictim\u201d and \u201ceconomic damages\u201d are defined by statute. ORS 137.103(4) defines \u201cvictim\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\">\u201c(a) The person against whom the defendant committed the criminal offense, if the court determines that the person has suffered economic damages as a result of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">\u201c(b) <em>Any person </em>not described in paragraph (a) of this subsection <em>whom the court determines has suffered economic damages as a result of the defendant\u2019s criminal activities.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">\u201c(c) The Criminal Injuries Compensation Account, if it has expended moneys on behalf of a victim described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">\u201c(d) An insurance carrier, if it has expended moneys on behalf of a victim described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">(Emphasis added.) ORS 137.103(2) provides that \u201c \u00a3[e]conomic damages\u2019 has the meaning given that term in ORS 31.710, except that \u2018economic damages\u2019 does not include future impairment of earning capacity.\u201d ORS 31.710(2)(a) provides, in turn:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">\u201c \u2018Economic damages\u2019 means objectively verifiable monetary losses including but not limited to <em>reasonable charges necessarily incurred for </em>medical, hospital, nursing and rehabilitative services and other health care services, <em>burial and memorial expenses, </em>loss of income and past and future impairment of earning capacity, reasonable and necessary expenses incurred for substitute domestic services, recurring loss to an estate, damage to reputation that is economically verifiable, reasonable and necessarily incurred costs due to loss of use of property and reasonable costs incurred for repair or for replacement of damaged property, whichever is less.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Thus, under ORS 137.106, the question is whether Faulkner is <em>\u201ca </em>victim\u201d who \u201csuffered economic damages\u201d; if so, the court must require \u201crestitution in a specific amount that equals the full amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages.\u201d Under ORS 137.103(4)(b) and ORS 31.710(2)(a), Faulkner is a victim if he suffered economic damages\u2014 including reasonable charges necessarily incurred for burial and memorial expenses \u2014 as a result of defendant\u2019s criminal activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">There is no dispute that the funeral expenses at issue here were \u201creasonable charges\u201d for \u201cburial and memorial services\u201d within the meaning of ORS 31.710(2)(a). The parties disagree, however, about whether the expenses were \u201cnecessarily incurred\u201d under that statute. The state contends that the legislature chose to make a defendant responsible for funeral expenses when the defendant\u2019s criminal activities cause a death. Defendant argues that Faulkner did not \u201cincur\u201d funeral expenses at all, because he was not billed for them and because, given that the decedent\u2019s death triggered the insurance benefit that was used to pay for the funeral, Faulkner was not worse off financially because of the decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Defendant\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>White v. Jubitz Corp., </em>347 Or 212, 219 P3d 566 (2009), in which the Supreme Court considered the same statutory definition of \u201ceconomic damages\u201d in the context of a negligence claim. There, the defendant \u2014 citing a dictionary defining \u201cincur\u201d as \u201c[t]o become liable or subject to,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 232 n 11 (brackets in <em>White) </em>\u2014 contended that the plaintiff had not \u201cincurred\u201d a \u201cmonetary loss\u201d with respect to medical charges that had been written off as a result of the plaintiffs eligibility for Medicare benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 232. Among other reasons for rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">\u201cA plaintiff who is injured and who obtains necessary medical treatment becomes \u2018liable or subject to\u2019 reasonable charges for that treatment and thereby \u2018incurs\u2019 them. <em>ORS 31.710 does not require that a plaintiff also pay or otherwise satisfy those charges. Whether or by what means the plaintiff or a third party satisfies medical charges is a matter between the plaintiff, the third party, and the medical providers. </em>ORS 31.710 does not make a plaintiffs right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>assert a claim for economic damages against a tortfeasor dependent on those arrangements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 234 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Similarly here, the decedent died as a result of defendant\u2019s conduct, and Faulkner obtained necessary funeral services. The billing arrangements for the decedent\u2019s funeral expenses are a matter between Faulkner, the insurer, and the funeral home. Regardless of the source of the funds used to pay for the decedent\u2019s funeral, when Faulkner obtained funeral services for the decedent, Faulkner became subject to charges for those services and thus incurred the charges. The funeral expenses were economic damages under ORS 31.710.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Defendant contends, however, that for an expense to be \u201cnecessarily incurred\u201d within the meaning of the statute, that expense must be one that the victim was required to pay, not one that the victim volunteered to pay. In defendant\u2019s view, because Faulkner chose to pay for the funeral, Faulkner did not \u201cincur\u201d damages and therefore is not a \u201cvictim.\u201d We rejected a related argument concerning the meaning of \u201cincur\u201d in <em>PGE v. Jungwirth Logging, Inc., </em>151 Or App 789, 951 P2d 1101 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 432 (1998). There, the plaintiff had settled a negligence suit brought by the estate of the defendant\u2019s employee, who was electrocuted by one of the plaintiffs high-voltage power lines in an on-the-job accident. <em>Id. </em>at 791. After settling with the estate, the plaintiff sued the defendant under a statute providing that, if a person or business violates safety rules concerning operations near high-voltage power lines and the violation results in or is a contributing cause of an accident, the person or business is liable to the utility for \u201call costs and expenses, including damages to any third persons, incurred by the utility as the result of the accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted). The defendant argued that the plaintiff \u201cincurred\u201d costs and expenses only if it was liable to the employee\u2019s estate. Noting that the common meaning of \u201cincur\u201d is \u201cto become liable <em>or </em>subject to,\u201d we concluded that the plaintiff had incurred the settlement costs because, but for the defendant\u2019s actions, the plaintiff \u201cwould not have been subject to resolving [the employee\u2019s estate\u2019s] action through settlement or litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 793; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>see also Anderson v. Wheeler, </em>214 Or App 318, 322, 164 P3d 1194 (2007) (construing \u201cincurred\u201d in an attorney fee statute to mean to \u201cbecome liable or subject to\u201d and thus to require that the party seeking fees be liable for the payment of fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">More recently, in <em>State v. Romero-Navarro, </em>224 Or App 25, 29, 197 P3d 30 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 13 (2010), we relied on that definition of \u201cincur\u201d in concluding that the defendant was properly ordered to pay restitution for funeral expenses. There, the defendant was convicted of first-degree manslaughter for killing a 17-year-old child, and the state sought restitution, payable in part to the child\u2019s parents and in part to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Account (account), for funeral expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 27. The defendant argued that, because the child\u2019s father\u2019s employer had paid most of those expenses and the account had paid the remainder, the parents had not incurred the expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 28. Rejecting that argument, we explained that \u201c[t]here is a reasonable inference from the record that the victim\u2019s family was <em>subjected </em>to the enumerated burial expenses for their child, and would have had to pay them if the employer had not paid them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29 (citing <em>White v. Jubitz Corp., </em>219 Or App 62, 66, 182 P3d 215 (2008), <em>aff'd, </em>347 Or 212, 219 P3d 566 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Here, likewise, the record shows that Faulkner was subjected to the decedent\u2019s burial expenses. Faulkner\u2019s testimony and the bill from the funeral home indicate that he had agreed to be responsible for the funeral expenses. But for the defendant\u2019s criminally negligent homicide of the decedent, Faulkner would not have been subjected to those expenses. Faulkner therefore was a victim who incurred economic damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Finally, we consider whether Faulkner incurred the funeral expenses \u201cas a result of the defendant\u2019s criminal activities.\u201d ORS 137.103(4)(b). The answer is apparent: Simply put, if defendant had not killed the decedent, the funeral expenses at issue would not have been incurred. Defendant nevertheless contends that, because the decedent would someday have died anyway and would have had funeral expenses, the funeral expenses here were not a result of defendant\u2019s criminal activity. As the state aptly responds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>however, defendant\u2019s construction of the statutes would mean that, because everyone will die eventually, funeral expenses never could be included in economic damages. Such a result is contrary to the legislature\u2019s choice to include \u201cburial and memorial expenses\u201d in the definition of economic damages that may be the subject of restitution. Accordingly, we conclude that the decedent\u2019s funeral expenses were a result of defendant\u2019s act of criminally negligent homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Because Faulkner suffered economic damages in the form of funeral expenses as a result of defendant\u2019s criminal activities, the trial court erred when it excluded the decedent\u2019s reasonable funeral expenses from the restitution that defendant was ordered to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-8\"> One of the issues on appeal concerns the meaning of the word \u201cvictim\u201d as used in the restitution statute, which provides four alternate meanings of \u201cvictim.\u201d For clarity, therefore, we refer to the victim of the homicide as \u201cthe decedent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b243-10\"> Except as noted, statutory citations are to the 2005 version of the statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b244-11\"> In 2005, the legislature amended the restitution statutes to provide for restitution for \u201ceconomic damages.\u201d Or Laws 2005, ch 564. Before those amendments, restitution was available for \u201cpecuniary damages,\u201d which were defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-12\">\u201call special damages, but not general damages, which a person could recover against the defendant in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting the defendant\u2019s criminal activities and shall include, but not be limited to, the money equivalent of property taken, destroyed, broken or otherwise harmed, and losses such as medical expenses and costs of psychological treatment or counseling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">ORS 137.103(2) (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
