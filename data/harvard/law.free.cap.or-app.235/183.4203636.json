The court also imposed a compensatory fine in the amount of $500 and restitution of $2,000. On appeal, defendant raises six assignments of error. As to defendant\u2019s first four assignments of error, which challenge the conviction, we affirm without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In his fifth and sixth assignments of error, defendant contends that the trial court committed plain error when it imposed restitution and a compensatory fine because those sanctions were unsupported by evidence in the record that the victim had actually suffered a pecuniary loss. The state concedes that the imposition of the fine and restitution constituted plain error. We agree and accept the concession, exercise our discretion to review the error, and conclude the case must be remanded for resentencing. <em>See State v. Harrington, </em>229 Or App 473, 477-78, 11 P3d 972, <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 365 (2009) (reviewing as plain error imposition of restitution unsupported by evidence of the amount of the victim\u2019s loss); <em>State v.
