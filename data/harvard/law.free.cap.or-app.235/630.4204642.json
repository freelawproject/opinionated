The tax assessment against petitioner was for unpaid employment taxes and interest from the fourth quarter of 2003 through the fourth quarter of 2005; the additional assessment was for an amount equal to 50 percent of the unpaid taxes plus interest and was assessed against petitioner because he fraudulently intended to avoid the payment of taxes to the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund. <em>See </em>ORS 657.515(5). The ALJ concluded that (1) the services for remuneration on which the tax assessment was based constitute taxable employment under ORS 657.030 through 657.094; (2) the employment tax assessment is correct; and (3) the additional 50 percent assessment is appropriate. On review, petitioner assigns error to each of those conclusions. We write only to address petitioner\u2019s assertion that the ALJ erred in determining that the employment tax assessment is correct and reject without discussion petitioner\u2019s remaining assignments of error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand the order for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Petitioner operates an entertainment business. In March 2006, the department sent petitioner the notices of tax assessment and additional assessment that are subject to the order now on review. The notice of tax assessment indicated the total amount of unpaid taxes and interest petitioner owed the department ($16,353.78) and the taxable payroll ($46,440.00), tax rate, tax assessed, and interest attributed to petitioner by the department for each quarter of unpaid taxes. The notice of additional assessment indicated the additional amount petitioner owed to the department ($8,176.63) for fraud under ORS 657.515(5). After receiving the notices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>of tax assessment and additional assessment, petitioner requested a hearing pursuant to ORS 657.681 and ORS 657.683(1) and contended that the assessments were incorrect because petitioner did not employ any employees; rather, petitioner asserted that its workers were independent contractors. Petitioner\u2019s request for a hearing was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Before the hearing, the department provided the ALJ and petitioner with copies of the documents it anticipated offering as exhibits at the hearing. Among those documents were the department\u2019s estimated consolidated tax reports for petitioner. Those reports indicated that the department had attributed to petitioner six employees for each month of unpaid taxes. The reports were admitted into evidence at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">At the start of that hearing, the ALJ identified on the record the three issues that were before it: (1) whether the services for remuneration on which the tax assessment was based constituted taxable employment under ORS 657.030 through 657.094; (2) whether the employment tax assessment was correct; and (3) whether petitioner was subject to an additional 50 percent assessment under ORS 657.515(5). The ALJ also noted that the department\u2019s assessments were entitled to a presumption that they were correct and the burden was on petitioner to prove that the assessments were incorrect. Specifically, ORS 657.683(4) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">\u201cAt any hearing held as provided in ORS 657.480, 657.679, 657.681 or 657.682, the determination or assessment of the director or authorized representative [of the department] shall be prima facie correct and the burden shall be upon the protesting employing unit to prove that it is incorrect. Thereafter the administrative law judge shall enter the findings of fact and decision, either affirming, modifying, or setting aside the determination or assessment of the director or authorized representative and in the case of an assessment, the administrative law judge may increase or decrease the amount of the assessment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Both petitioner and the department participated in the hearing. The ALJ determined that the department would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>call its witnesses first.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A department tax auditor and two other department employees presented testimony that established the following. In 2005, the department unsuccessfully attempted to audit petitioner. During that attempted audit, the department was informed that petitioner had been acquired by an individual, Parker. In 2006, the two testifying employees had gone to petitioner\u2019s business to serve a subpoena on Parker. While waiting for Parker to appear, the employees observed the business. In particular, they observed six people working: two bartenders, a DJ or entertainment attendant who operated the sound system, a security guard at the front door, a ticket sales person at the front door, and an office person in the back who appeared to give instructions to the DJ and at least one of the bartenders. The department employees also observed the business\u2019s hours of operation: eight hours per day Sunday through Thursday and 10 hours per day Friday and Saturday, for a total of 60 hours per week. After about an hour and a half, Parker did not appear, and the department employees left.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Based on those observations, the department estimated petitioner\u2019s quarterly payroll for each quarter of unpaid employment taxes. The department used hourly wage figures for three employee categories \u2014 that of bartender ($8.39 to $9.27 per hour), security guard ($10.10 to $13.83 per hour), and entertainment attendant ($8.48 to $9.68 per hour) \u2014 to estimate the average wage for petitioner\u2019s employees at $10.00 per hour. The department did not include any managerial categories in its estimate of the employees\u2019 average hourly wage. The department then estimated petitioner\u2019s quarterly payroll to be $46,440, which was based on six employees each working 60 hours per week at the estimated average wage of $10 per hour for 4.3 weeks per month. That estimated quarterly payroll then served as the basis for the department\u2019s tax assessment against petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>of $16,353.78, which in turn served as the basis of the additional 50 percent assessment of $8,176.63 due to fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">After the department\u2019s employees testified, the department called as a witness a former bartender of petitioner, Martinez, who testified regarding the typical number of individuals who worked at petitioner\u2019s business during the week. According to Martinez, typically five people worked at the business on Fridays and Saturdays and only three people worked at the business the rest of the week. In addition, Martinez described the respective duties performed by those individuals and indicated that some workers took on managerial roles.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Petitioner then called its sole witness, Parker, who, like Martinez, testified regarding the typical number of workers attributable to the business and their respective duties. According to Parker, typically four people worked at the business on Fridays and Saturdays and only two people worked at the business the rest of the week. Parker denied that there was an on-site manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">During closing statements, petitioner argued that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">\u201cwhen we received the exhibits from the tax department, it was impossible to determine exactly how the assessments were calculated. Other than the fact that we saw they were based on six employees, we could not tell what wage was attributed to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">\u201c* * * I would certainly object to both the fact that six employees were attributed to the club. And that the $10.00 an hour assessment was attributed to each employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">The department, in contrast, argued that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-10\">\u201cbased off the testimony that we\u2019ve heard here today, now that we know the more than expanded [role] on what we based our tax assessment on, as in some people were taking managerial roles as to direction and control of the work, direction and control of the money, et cetera, we actually feel that our tax assessment is probably low at this point, but it\u2019s already in place. And so to dispute the balance, if anything, it should be higher.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Following the hearing, the ALJ issued the final order now on review. The ALJ found that \u201c[t]he quarterly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>payroll was calculated as follows: 60 hours per week x 4.3 weeks per month = 258 business hours per month x 6 employees x $10 per hour, per employee = $15,480 total payroll per month x 3 months per quarter = $46,440.\u201d The ALJ, however, also found that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-4\">\u201c[o]n a typical weekend night (Fridays and Saturdays) there were five people working: one bartender, one DJ, an office person/manager, a security guard/bouncer, and a person at the front door who took money. Sometimes a bartender-helper also worked for part of the evening. Another security guard/bouncer worked the parking lot on weekends. On weeknights (Sundays through Thursdays) there were typically only three people working: a bartender, a DJ, and an office person/manager.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">(Citations omitted.) Then, in affirming the department\u2019s tax assessment as correctly calculated, the ALJ opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-6\">\u201cThe employer disagrees with how the Department calculated the tax assessment. Specifically, the employer objects to the Department using six employees and attributing a wage of $10 per hour to each. There is evidence that five or six employees worked on Fridays and Saturdays, but only three employees worked on the other days. However, there was also evidence that suggested that some of the employees had more responsible positions than assumed by the Department, for whom a wage higher than $10 per hour would be appropriate. In any case, the employer did not present evidence to support a more accurate tax assessment. Therefore, the employer failed to rebut the presumption that the Employment Department\u2019s tax assessment is correct. ORS 657.681; 657.683(4).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">On review, petitioner renews its argument that the tax assessment is incorrectly based on six employees working 60 hours each week at an average wage of $10 per hour. Citing testimony in the record, petitioner argues that the calculation for the assessed tax should be based on four employees working two days a week and two employees working five days a week. We understand petitioner\u2019s argument to challenge the ALJ\u2019s finding that petitioner failed to present evidence to support a more accurate tax assessment and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>ALJ\u2019s conclusion that petitioner failed to rebut the presumption that the department\u2019s tax assessment is correct. Petitioner also emphasized at oral argument that the ALJ\u2019s affirmance of the department\u2019s tax assessment is not supported by substantial evidence because, except for evidence concerning the estimated average hourly wage of $10, there is no other evidence in the record as to the applicable wage figures. In response, the department argues that the ALJ correctly determined that petitioner failed to meet its burden to rebut the department\u2019s tax assessment and that substantial evidence and substantial reason support the ALJ\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Under ORS 657.684, \u201cjudicial review of decisions under ORS 657.683 shall be as provided for review of orders in contested cases in ORS chapter 183[.]\u201d Under ORS chapter 183, we review an order in a contested case for errors of law and substantial evidence. ORS 183.482(8)(a), (c). A finding of fact is supported by substantial evidence \u201cwhen the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d ORS 183.482(8)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In this case, the ALJ made findings of fact that support two separate and alternative analytical paths leading to the ALJ\u2019s ultimate conclusion that petitioner \u201cfailed to rebut the presumption that the [department\u2019s] tax assessment is correct.\u201d The first analytical path derives from the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding (1) the department\u2019s method for calculating petitioner\u2019s recurring quarterly payroll, on which the tax assessment was based; (2) the typical number of employees who worked at petitioner\u2019s business; and (3) the appropriate wage for employees who held more responsible positions. The second analytical path is based on the ALJ\u2019s finding that petitioner failed to \u201cpresent evidence to support a more accurate tax assessment.\u201d As we discuss below, both analytical paths are based on findings of fact that lack substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The ALJ found that the department calculated the recurring quarterly payroll on which the tax assessment was based as follows: \u201c60 hours per week x 4.3 weeks per month = 258 business hours per month x 6 employees x $10 per hour, per employee = $15,480 total payroll per month x 3 months per quarter = $46,440.\u201d The department\u2019s tax auditor testified about that calculation method and each of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>variables used (hours of operation, number of weeks per month, number of employees, and average hourly wage); the ALJ\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The ALJ then found that \u201c[o]n a typical weekend night (Fridays and Saturdays) there were five people working[.] * * * Sometimes a bartender-helper also worked for part of the evening. * * * On weeknights (Sundays through Thursdays) there were typically only three people working[.]\u201d The ALJ reiterated later that \u201c[t]here is evidence that five or six employees worked on Fridays and Saturdays, but only three employees worked on the other days.\u201d Because Martinez testified at the hearing that typically five employees worked Fridays and Saturdays and only three employees worked the rest of the week, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The ALJ, however, went on to find that \u201cthere was also evidence that suggested that some of the employees had more responsible positions than assumed by the Department, for whom a wage higher than $10 per hour would be appropriate.\u201d Martinez testified at the hearing that some of petitioner\u2019s employees took on managerial roles. Thus, the first part of the ALJ\u2019s finding \u2014 that \u201csome of the employees had more responsible positions than assumed by the Department\u201d \u2014is supported by substantial evidence. However, <em>no </em>evidence was presented at the hearing regarding managerial wage figures. Indeed, the only evidence as to employee wage figures that was presented at the hearing was the tax auditor\u2019s testimony, in which he described how the department calculated the estimated average wage of the employees to be $10 per hour based on wage figures for the employee categories of bartender, security guard, and entertainment attendant. The ALJ\u2019s finding that \u201ca wage higher than $10 per hour would be appropriate\u201d for employees who had more responsible positions is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">That error would normally require reversal and a remand, except that, in this case, the ALJ made an alternative finding of fact that, if supported by substantial evidence, would render that error immaterial. In particular, the ALJ alternatively found that, \u201c[i]n any case, [petitioner] did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>present evidence to support a more accurate tax assessment.\u201d As noted above, the department presented testimony that expressed the recurring quarterly payroll, from which the tax assessment was derived, as a calculation based on a set of variables, including the number of employees (six). Petitioner\u2019s sole witness, Parker, presented testimony that the typical number of workers was not six, but was actually four workers on Fridays and Saturdays and two workers on the remaining days. Parker\u2019s testimony directly contradicted one of the variables used by the department in calculating the recurring quarterly payroll on which the tax assessment was based. Consequently, the <em>prima facie </em>correctness of the tax assessment under ORS 657.683(4) was rebutted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Given that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>state of the record, a reasonable person could not find that petitioner \u201cdid not present evidence to support a more accurate tax assessment.\u201d The ALJ\u2019s finding to that effect lacks substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Reversed and remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-6\"> Although we reject petitioner\u2019s third assignment of error \u2014 that a 50 percent assessment for fraud was inappropriate \u2014 we note that the amount of that assessment could change on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b680-5\"> OAR 471-040-0025(3), which applies to contested case hearings before the department, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">\u201cThe administrative law judge shall conduct and control the hearing. The administrative law judge shall determine the order of the presentation of evidence, administer oaths, examine any witnesses, and may either on the administrative law judge\u2019s own or a party\u2019s request exclude witnesses from the hearing room. Parties, or their authorized agents, shall have the right to give testimony and to call and examine witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b685-4\"> The text establishing the rebuttable presumption under ORS 657.683(4) is virtually identical to the text establishing the rebuttable presumption under ORS 656.740(1) in the context of workers\u2019 compensation disputes. ORS 657.683(4) provides that \u201cthe determination or assessment of the director or authorized representative [of the department] shall be prima facie correct and the burden shall be upon the protesting employing unit to prove that it is incorrect.\u201d ORS 656.740(1) similarly provides that \u201c[a]n order by the director under this subsection [declaring a person to be a noncomplying employer] is prima facie correct and the burden is upon the employer to prove that the order is incorrect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In <em>Employers Ins. of Wausau v. R. M. Hardy &amp; Co., </em>155 Or App 231, 236, 963 P2d 97 (1998), we described the operative effect of the rebuttable presumption established by ORS 656.740(1). There, the employer had requested a hearing to challenge an order declaring that it was a noncomplying employer because it had not filed a guaranty contract with the Department of Consumer and Business Services. <em>Id. </em>at 234. At the hearing, the employer presented evidence that a guaranty contract, in fact, had been filed. <em>Id. </em>at 236. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">\u201cThe evidence that [employer] presented directly contradicted the proposed order\u2019s conclusion that [employer] was a noncomplying employer because it had not caused a guaranty contract to be filed. Consequently, [employer] did rebut the <em>prima facie </em>case that it was a noncomplying employer. As a result, the ALJ could not simply affirm the proposed order. Rather, the ALJ was required to determine, considering all of the evidence in the record, whether [employer] had, in fact, been a noncomplying employer during the relevant time period. Because [employer] had the burden of proof, the ALJ would have been required to affirm the proposed order if the ALJ had concluded that the evidence was in equipoise. If, however, the evidence was not in equipoise, then the burden would play no role in the ALJ\u2019s conclusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">The rebuttable presumption established by ORS 657.683(4) for assessments operates analogously and has two components: (1) the <em>prima facie </em>correctness of the assessment and (2) petitioner\u2019s burden of proof to establish that the assessment was incorrect. Thus, at the start of the hearing in this case, the tax assessment was entitled to a presumption of <em>prima facie </em>correctness. Because the department presented testimony that expressed the recurring quarterly payroll, on which the tax assessment was based, as a calculation derived from a series of variables, evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>that contradicted one of those variables was sufficient to rebut the <em>prima facie </em>correctness of the assessment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
