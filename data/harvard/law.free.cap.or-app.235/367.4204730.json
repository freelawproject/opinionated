The court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and, over PUC\u2019s objection, awarded attorney fees to plaintiffs by way of a supplemental judgment. PUC appeals that supplemental judgment for attorney fees, raising similar objections to those raised in the circuit court. As explained below, we cannot determine the basis for the court\u2019s award of attorney fees; hence, we cannot meaningfully review the award. For that reason, we remand for additional findings by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">After the court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs filed a statement of attorney fees pursuant to ORCP 68, citing three separate bases for a fee award: ORS 183.497(l)(a) (authorizing a discretionary award of attorney fees for certain actions against state agencies); ORS 183.497(l)(b) (mandating an award of attorney fees against a state agency that has acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law); and the \u201csubstantial benefit\u201d doctrine described in <em>Deras v. Meyers, </em>272 Or 47, 65-66, 535 P2d 541 (1975) (recognizing the courts\u2019 equitable authority to award attorney fees \u201cwhere the plaintiff brings suit in a representative capacity and succeeds in protecting the rights of others as much as [the plaintiffs] own\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Defendant objected to the fee petition on several grounds, including: (1) ORS 183.497 was inapplicable because there was no final agency order in the case; (2) even if that statute applied, and the court had discretion to award fees, it would be inappropriate to exercise that discretion because plaintiffs did not pursue available administrative remedies and did not obtain a particularly favorable result; (3) ORS 183.497(l)(b) did not mandate an award of attorney fees, because defendant had a reasonable basis for its position; (4) plaintiffs had not obtained a \u201csubstantial benefit\u201d; and (5) in the event that some award of attorney fees was authorized, the award should be reduced to account for fees that were duplicative or were for time spent on issues on which plaintiffs did not prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>In a reply brief, plaintiffs cited additional authority for an award of attorney fees \u2014 ORS 183.486, as well as a more developed theory under the \u201csubstantial benefit doctrine,\u201d <em>see generally Crandon Capital Partners v. Sheik, </em>342 Or 555, 157 P3d 176 (2007) \u2014 and also requested a hearing on the fee petition. PUC then moved to strike plaintiffs\u2019 reply, arguing that ORCP 68 does not authorize a reply and that plaintiffs raised new bases for relief in their reply that had not been pleaded or included in their statement of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">On May 1, 2008, the circuit court issued a letter opinion that denied plaintiffs\u2019 \u201ctardy\u201d request for a hearing, but that also denied PUC\u2019s motion to strike. The letter opinion then stated, \u201cPlaintiffs are awarded costs as claimed, and attorney fees of $21,070.00 representing 60.2 hours, at $350.00 per hour.\u201d It concluded, \u201cPlaintiffs may prepare an appropriate Order, together with proposed Findings of Fact, if so desired.\u201d No such order and findings were ever entered by the court; rather, the court entered a supplemental judgment for attorney fees that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">\u201cThe Court, having considered Plaintiffs\u2019 Statement for Attorney Fees and Costs and Defendant\u2019s objections and having issued a letter opinion filed May 1, 2008, setting forth its findings and conclusions and awarding to plaintiffs attorney fees of $21,070 and costs of $310,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">\u201cNOW THEREFORE IT IS ADJUDGED THAT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">\u201cPlaintiffs are entitled to recover $21,070 for attorney fees and $310 for costs from [PUC].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">However, as set out above, the May 1,2008, letter opinion did not actually set forth any \u201cfindings and conclusions\u201d; it simply awarded fees for 60.2 hours, at a rate of $350.00 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">The issue before us is whether that attorney fee award was erroneous. As set out above, plaintiffs sought fees on a number of grounds, each of which required the circuit court to apply different legal standards and make different factual findings. Given the lack of any findings or explanation by the circuit court, we have no way to tell which of plaintiffs\u2019 proffered bases the court ultimately relied on when awarding fees. That is particularly problematic because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>possible bases for attorney fees implicate different standards of review. For example, the circuit court\u2019s exercise of discretion to award attorney fees is reviewed differently from the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that an attorney fee award is mandated by statute. Without knowing the legal or factual basis for the attorney fee award in this case, we cannot meaningfully review that award. Accordingly, we remand for the circuit court to make the findings necessary for meaningful appellate review. <em>See McCarthy v. Oregon Freeze Dry, Inc., </em>327 Or 185, 190-91, 957 P2d 1200 (1998) (on reconsideration) (\u201cEfficient and meaningful appellate review for abuse of discretion cannot occur on the present record, because we can only speculate about the possible relevant facts and legal criteria relied on for the court\u2019s award of attorney fees. Adequate findings about those matters need not be complex or lengthy. Rather, they must describe the relevant facts and legal criteria for the court\u2019s decision to award or deny attorney fees in any terms that are sufficiently clear to permit meaningful appellate review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Supplemental judgment for attorney fees vacated and remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
