On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in failing to merge the three robbery convictions into a single conviction for first-degree robbery. He acknowledges that he did not raise that issue below but urges us to reverse on the basis of error apparent on the face of the record, ORAP 5.45(1). The state concedes that the trial court plainly erred in failing to merge the two convictions for second-degree robbery. We agree with the state\u2019s concession and, for the reasons expressed in <em>State v. Camacho-Alvarez, 225 </em>Or App 215, 216-17, 200 P3d 613 (2009), exercise our discretion to correct that error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Reversed and remanded for merger of convictions for second-degree robbery and for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-6\"> The state does not concede that the single conviction for second-degree robbery should then merge with the conviction for first-degree robbery. Given our remand, the trial court will have an opportunity to address that issue in the first instance. <em>See </em>ORS 138.222(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
