Late in the evening on April 22, 2006, youth and his family travelled to a bar in Yoncalla. Youth\u2019s brother had been involved in a fight at the bar earlier that evening, and the family went to the bar to confront the person with whom youth\u2019s brother had fought. Youth\u2019s mother brought two bats with her to the bar, one of which was a small bat described as a \u201cthumper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Ultimately, youth and his family became involved in a fight outside of the bar. The victim and several other bar patrons left the bar to see what was going on outside. As the victim walked out of the bar, youth\u2019s sister punched him. As the victim turned toward youth\u2019s sister, youth punched him. The victim grabbed youth, they both fell to the ground where they wrestled, and the victim held youth down. The victim repeatedly let youth up and tried to turn toward his other attackers, but \u201cevery time [he\u2019d] let [youth] off the ground * * * [he] would get attacked from [youth] again.\u201d At the same time, as the victim and youth were on the ground together, youth\u2019s mother was hitting the victim in the face with the small bat from one side while a third unidentified person punched the victim from his other side. (The identity of the third assailant, who was punching the victim while youth\u2019s mother hit him with the bat and while youth wrestled with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>him on the ground, is unclear.) The victim testified that his injuries were caused by four blows to his face from the bat. He testified that every time the bat hit him, he saw a \u201cflash! ],\u201d and that the punches \u201cweren\u2019t as strong[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The victim sustained injuries to his elbow, nose, eye, and eyebrow \u2014 which required stitches. He testified that he experienced \u201cenormous pain\u201d from the bat hitting his face. Youth told the investigating officer that he had hit one person, split that person\u2019s eyebrow open, and then \u201cthere was a scuffle for a while.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At trial, one of the state\u2019s theories was that youth had directly caused the victim\u2019s injuries and that youth\u2019s mother was the person actually present and aiding during the assault.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Youth responded that, even if he was the youth seen fighting on the ground and even if he was not acting in self-defense, the state had failed to prove that he had caused any injury to the victim. The juvenile court made the following relevant findings before finding youth to be within its jurisdiction for third-degree assault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">\u201c[F]rom the testimony that I have heard there was no reason for [youth] to hit [the victim] to begin with. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">\u201cAnd [the victim] describes taking him to the ground. That [the victim] holds him to the ground and then I can\u2019t tell you was a couple if not more than that, that he tries letting him up. That is[,] are we done fighting and the guy, that is [youth], continues on the fight. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">\u201cAnd so then you look at were there injuries caused, who caused the injuries[,] and who\u2019s responsible for the injuries. One is responsible for the acts of their aider, the person they\u2019re aiding and abetting, and especially when they\u2019re <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>involved in, that is[,] the individual that is charged is involved in the assault and not just a bystander or that they\u2019re an active participant in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-4\">\u201cAnd that\u2019s the testimony that I have thus far or in this trial, is that [youth] is involved. * * *. He was aided by another person present. That\u2019s clear from the testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">\u201cThat [the victim] was hit by at least two other individuals, one of which was a bat-wielding lady * * * that has been identified as * * * [youth\u2019s] mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">\u201cSo I am finding that the allegations of Assault in the Third Degree, Count 1, have been proven.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">On appeal, youth argues that he cannot be found to be directly liable for third-degree assault because there is insufficient evidence either (1) that he caused the victim\u2019s injuries or (2) that, if he did cause the victim\u2019s injuries, he was aided by another person actually present when he did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The state responds that the evidence established that youth directly caused the victim\u2019s injuries with his fists, or is liable as an assailant whose assaultive conduct was so intertwined with his mother\u2019s assault with the bat that both of them had a legally sufficient role in causing the victim\u2019s injuries. <em>See generally State v. Pine, </em>336 Or 194, 207, 82 P3d 130 (2003) (concluding that a defendant who aids another person in committing an assault, but who does not directly cause physical injury to the victim, cannot be convicted of this type of third-degree assault under a theory of direct liability unless he or she engages in conduct so \u201cextensively intertwined\u201d with the assault that his or her conduct can be said to have produced the injury). In <em>Pine, </em>the defendant participated in an assault on the victim, but the injury to the victim was, at least arguably, caused solely by the other assailant\u2019s assault. <em>Id. </em>at 196-98. The Supreme Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">\u201cthe fact that a defendant provided on-the-scene aid to another person who inflicted physical injury upon a victim does not, in itself, render the defendant liable for third-degree assault under that statute. Rather, such a defendant either must have inflicted physical injury directly himself or herself, or must have engaged in conduct so extensively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>intertwined with infliction of the injury that such conduct can be found to have produced the injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 207.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Youth\u2019s conduct here is comparable to the assaultive conduct of the defendant in <em>State v. Derry, </em>200 Or App 587, 116 P3d 248, <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 34 (2005), even though the assault in that case did not require an additional person to be present. In <em>Derry, </em>the defendant repeatedly shoved the victim during an altercation near a doorway. In the course of that altercation, the victim\u2019s finger was injured when the door was closed on his hand. <em>Id. </em>at 589. We concluded that \u201c[the] defendant\u2019s conduct in repeatedly pushing [the victim] during the altercation was so intertwined with infliction of the injury to [the victim\u2019s] finger that it produced that injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">We conclude that youth\u2019s assaultive conduct was extensively intertwined with the mother\u2019s injury-causing assault with the bat, such that he is directly liable for the injuries to the victim. It is apparent from the record that the blows from the mother\u2019s bat injured the victim. Although youth did not directly assault the victim with the bat, the victim could not even try to stop the mother from assaulting him because, while the mother was hitting him, whenever he would attempt to let go of youth, youth would attack him. Without youth\u2019s active involvement in the assault by the mother, the victim would likely have been able to block or defend himself against her assault \u2014 or to retreat. It follows that youth intentionally injured the victim while being aided by his mother, who was actually present, and is therefore directly liable for third-degree assault. The juvenile court did not err in finding youth to be within its jurisdiction for third-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\"> ORS 163.165(l)(e) provides that a person commits the crime of third-degree assault if the person, \u201c[w]hile being aided by another person actually present, intentionally or knowingly causes physical injury to another[.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\"> We reject youth\u2019s second assignment of error without discussion, and similarly reject youth\u2019s other arguments in support of his first assignment of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b358-8\"> The victim was the only person involved in the fight who suffered an injured eyebrow. Thus, it would seem that the evidence established that youth directly caused at least one of the victim\u2019s injuries when he punched him after youth\u2019s sister\u2019s punch and before youth\u2019s mother began swinging the bat at the victim. However, because youth was charged with third-degree assault, which requires that youth be \u201caided by another person present,\u201d and the state does not argue that youth\u2019s sister was \u201cthe other person,\u201d we analyze the facts of this case under the theory of \u201cextensive intertwinement,\u201d focusing instead on youth\u2019s later conduct in attacking the victim, with his mother as the \u201caider.\u201d <em>See </em>235 Or App at 318-19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b358-9\"><em> </em>The state also argued, alternatively, that youth aided his mother\u2019s assault. In response to that argument, youth argued that there was insufficient evidence that his conduct \u2014 being held to the ground by the victim \u2014 aided his mother in hitting the victim in the head with the bat.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\"> The court distinguished the defendant\u2019s conduct from that of the defendant in <em>State v. Nefstad, </em>309 Or 523, 789 P2d 1326 (1990), <em>cert den, </em>516 US 1081 (1996). In <em>Nefstad, </em>the defendant was found to he \u201cpersonally involved in a homicide even though he argued that he had merely restrained the victim while another individual stabbed him. The court concluded that \u201crestraining the victim so that he cannot avoid the fatal knife thrusts constitutes \u2018personally\u2019 committing the homicide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
