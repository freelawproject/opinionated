On appeal, he asserts three assignments of error, two of which we reject without discussion. We write to discuss only defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred by instructing the jury on elements of unauthorized use of a vehicle (UUV) that were not alleged in the indictment, in violation of Article VII (Amended), section 5, of the Oregon Constitution. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\"> We review the jury instructions for errors of law. <em>State v. Rennells, </em>213 Or App 423, 425, 162 P3d 1006 (2007). In determining whether an instructional error requires reversal, we assess potential prejudice by considering the jury instructions as a whole. <em>Id. </em>at 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Penegor discovered that his white truck was missing from his Goshen business one morning and reported it stolen. That same morning, a witness saw two men and a woman driving away from a burglarized house in Elkton in a white truck that was identified as Penegor\u2019s by the license plate number. The truck was carrying a washer, a dryer, and windows that had been stolen from a home in Drain. About an hour after that, the police stopped Penegor\u2019s truck in Reedsport and arrested a woman, who was driving the truck, along with defendant and another passenger. Nothing about the physical appearance of the truck indicated that it had been stolen: the ignition had not been tampered with, and the truck had its keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">A grand jury indicted defendant, alleging seven crimes, including UUV. ORS 164.135(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">\u201cA person commits the crime of unauthorized use of a vehicle when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-9\">\u201c(a) The person takes, operates, exercises control over, rides in, or otherwise uses another\u2019s vehicle, boat or aircraft without consent of the owner[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">Count 1 of the indictment alleged, in part, that defendant \u201cdid unlawfully and knowingly <em>take </em>a vehicle, to-wit: a Ford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>pick-up without the consent of the owner.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The indictment alleged only a taking and did not mention any of the other means of committing UUV specified in ORS 164.135(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The state\u2019s theory was that defendant participated with two others in taking the truck in Goshen and then using it in their efforts to steal property from the houses in Elkton and Drain. Defendant testified that he did not drive Penegor\u2019s truck or participate in stealing it, but rather that his friends already had the truck when he met them that morning. When the trial judge instructed the jury on Count 1, he gave \u2014 at the state\u2019s request \u2014 the uniform instructions on UUV \u201cby taking\u201d and UUV by \u201calternate means\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">\u201c[THE COURT:] Okay, we\u2019re talking about Unauthorized Use of a Vehicle which is Count 1. Oregon law provides that a person commits the crime of Unauthorized Use of a Vehicle when the person knowingly takes another\u2019s vehicle without the consent of the owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">\u201cIn this case to establish the crime of Unauthorized Use of a Vehicle the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following four elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">\u201cThe act occurred in Douglas County, Oregon, on or about November 5 of the year 2006. And that the defendant, Mr. Pierce, knowingly took a vehicle, the property of another person, and that finally he did not have the consent of the owner to do that, and that owner is alleged to be David Penegor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-9\">\u201cOkay. The crime of Unauthorized Use of a Motor Vehicle can be committed by either taking, operating, exercising control over, riding in or by otherwise using the vehicle. Proof of any means is sufficient to sustain a conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">Defendant objected to instructing the jury that UUV can be committed by means other than \u201ctaking,\u201d the only means alleged in the indictment. The trial court rejected defendant\u2019s argument, taking the state\u2019s view that listing the alternate means in the indictment is not a prerequisite to including them in the jury instruction. The court instructed the jury over defendant\u2019s objection, and the jury found defendant guilty of UUV.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>On appeal, defendant renews his argument that, because the indictment alleged only one means of committing UUV (\u201ctak[ing] a vehicle\u201d), it was a violation of Article VII (Amended), section 5, of the Oregon Constitution<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the trial court to instruct the jury on other means of committing that offense. Defendant cites <em>State v. Mortenson, </em>27 Or App 265, 269, 555 P2d 940 (1976), <em>rev den, </em>277 Or 99 (1977), as support for his view that the various means of committing UUV set forth in ORS 164.135(l)(a) \u201cwere not intended by the legislature to mean the same thing.\u201d He contends that the jury instruction added substantively different means of committing the crime not considered by the grand jury and thereby violated the constitutional prohibition against amendments that alter the essential nature of the indictment. <em>See State v. Pachmayr, </em>344 Or 482, 490-91, 185 P3d 1103 (2008) (discussing whether an amendment to an indictment is one of form or substance).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The state essentially concedes, and we agree, that, \u201cfor purposes of the UUV statute, if the indictment alleges just one of the various means of committing that crime, * * * then it is improper to instruct the jury on other means specified by the statute, insofar as those other means are substantively different from the means alleged in the indictment.\u201d The jury here was instructed that it could convict defendant of committing UUV by means of \u201ctaking, operating, exercising control over, riding in or by otherwise using the vehicle,\u201d when the indictment alleged UUV only by \u201ctak[ing]\u201d the vehicle. Because those additional bases for a conviction were not alleged in the indictment, the instruction permitted a conviction on an unindicted crime. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury violated Article VII (Amended), section 5. <em>See State v. Alben, </em>139 Or App 236, 241-43, 911 P2d 1239, <em>rev den, </em>323 Or 153 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>The state contends, however, that any error was harmless in light of the instructions as a whole and the manner in which the UUV question was tried to the jury. Specifically, the state argues that the jury must have based defendant\u2019s UUV conviction solely on whether he <em>took </em>the truck and not on whether defendant committed the other means of UUV, because the paragraphs preceding the challenged portion of the jury instruction focused only on whether defendant took the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">The record does not support the state\u2019s view. In determining whether instructional error requires reversal, we assess potential prejudice by considering the jury instructions as a whole. <em>Rennells, </em>213 Or App at 426. Although some portions of the jury instructions concerning UUV refer only to taking, the instructions nevertheless list additional means of committing UUV and state that \u201c[p]roof of any means is sufficient to sustain a conviction.\u201d Those instructions permitted the jury to convict even if they found \u2014 as they could have, based on defendant\u2019s testimony that his friends were driving the truck and a police officer\u2019s testimony that defendant was riding in the truck with two other people when the officer stopped them \u2014 that the state proved that defendant rode in the truck but that the state did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant took Penegor\u2019s truck. The instructions as a whole did not cure the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The state further contends that the manner in which the parties presented the UUV issue to the jury rendered any error harmless because, in its opening statement and closing argument, the state focused solely on the taking of the truck, as did defendant\u2019s counsel in closing argument. However, counsel\u2019s arguments are no substitute for proper instructions. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 356, 800 P2d 259 (1990). As is typical, the trial court told the jurors to \u201c[b]ase [their] verdict on the evidence and these instructions,\u201d not the arguments of the lawyers, and jurors are presumed to follow a trial court\u2019s instructions. <em>State v. Walton, </em>311 Or 223, 250, 809 P2d 81 (1991). Accordingly, we reverse and remand defendant\u2019s conviction for unauthorized use of a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Reversed and remanded on conviction for unauthorized use of a vehicle; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-5\"> Article VII (Amended), section 5, of the Oregon Constitution provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">\u201c(3) * * * [A] person shall be charged in a circuit court with the commission of any crime punishable as a felony only on indictment by a grand jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">\u00ab* * * <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">\u201c(6) * * * The district attorney may file an amended indictment * * * whenever, by ruling of the court, an indictment * * * is held to be defective in form.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
