J.</author>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Claimant seeks judicial review of an Employment Appeals Board (board) decision denying unemployment insurance benefits. He contends that the board erred in determining that his submission of a memorandum to a representative of the employer\u2019s human resources department, in which he complained about his department manager and other supervisors, constituted disqualifying \u201cmisconduct\u201d and, specifically, violated the employer\u2019s reasonable expectations that an employee not engage in \u201cdisrespectful\u201d conduct. We conclude that the board\u2019s determination in that regard is not supported by substantial reason and, accordingly, reverse and remand. ORS 183.482(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The circumstances of claimant\u2019s discharge, as recounted in the board\u2019s decision, are, for purposes of our review, undisputed. Claimant began working for employer in September 2002. The employer had an employee handbook, which was provided to claimant and which, at all material times, encouraged employees to talk with their supervisors or managers about their concerns and further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">\u201cIf your management team is unable to help you or you are uncomfortable discussing your concern with them, you should feel free to contact a member of the Human Resources or Legal Departments.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The handbook also provided, \u201cEmployees will face no reprisals for \u2018whistle blowing\u2019 or reporting in good faith any actions that they feel may violate the law or the [employer\u2019s code of conduct].\u201d (Boldface omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">From time to time, including on several occasions in 2007, claimant sent complaints about his supervisors\u2019 conduct and treatment of subordinates to the corporate compliance committee and others \u201cup the chain of command.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">On March 12, 2008, claimant became upset when a supervisor from another work area took issue with his work performance. In response, claimant told the supervisor to get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>out of his work area. As a consequence, claimant was suspended from work for five days for \u201cinsubordination and disrespectful behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">When claimant returned to work, his department manager, Farber, gave him a letter titled \u201cFinal Written Warning.\u201d That letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">\u201cYou have received three formal correction action letters in the past, for various reasons, and this will be your final chance to change your behavior at work. You were recently suspended on March 12th, for five days, for insubordination and disrespectful behavior. You admitted that you wished [that] you had not done what you did, and said it would not happen again. This is your final opportunity to ensure this type of behavior does not reoccur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">\u00ab* * * * \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">\u201c* * * [I]f you feel there are issues you have with a Team Leader or any management, please come and speak with me [Farber] about it; do not be insubordinate or disrespectful. If you do not feel you are receiving any resolution, you are welcome to go to the Human Resources department as well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Approximately four weeks later, on April 9, claimant wrote and delivered a letter/memorandum to Plath, a representative of employer\u2019s human resources department, who had previously invited claimant to discuss concerns with him. Claimant began that submission by stating, \u201cI wanted to communicate with you about my work environment.\u201d Claimant then recounted a work-related incident that, in his view, showed that Farber and other supervisors were seeking some pretext to discharge him. Claimant\u2019s submission to Plath concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">\u201cJust as I and many others can prove to you, [Farber] and his team will lie for each other, scheme, single out, threaten, try to intimidate and basically make work hell for you. Something needs to be done. You seem fair and just. Many employees will appreciate your work. Just wanted you to feel a day in the life of me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">Claimant appended a list of \u201cemployees that can verify [that] sometimes employees are treated poorly\u201d and a one-sentence statement from two employees who said that they had seen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Farber double-checking claimant\u2019s work after he had left for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Employer then discharged claimant for what it characterized as \u201cinsubordinate and disrespectful\u201d behavior. The Employment Department denied claimant\u2019s ensuing claim for unemployment benefits, deeming claimant\u2019s letter to Plath to be \u201cdisrespectful to his team leaders and the manager\u201d and to constitute disqualifying misconduct. An administrative law judge subsequently set aside that denial, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">\u201c[T]he persuasive evidence failed to show that claimant\u2019s behavior fits within the [applicable] law as disqualifying misconduct. Claimant\u2019s reaction to [the supervisor on March 12] was inappropriate; however, his discharge came one month later, immediately after claimant\u2019s April 9[ ] memo to Mr. Plath from human resources. Claimant had a history with Plath[,] and Plath encouraged claimant to come to him with issues. Claimant was merely complying with this offer. The language utilized by claimant in the memo was not directed at any supervisor, but was merely claimant\u2019s opinion expressed to a human resources representative. Disqualifying misconduct has not been shown.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Employer appealed, and the board reversed, reinstating the department\u2019s denial. With respect to misconduct, the board concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">\u201cClaimant\u2019s April 9, 2008 memo violated the employer\u2019s reasonable expectations. Claimant\u2019s department manager instructed claimant to take any concerns about team leaders and managers to the department manager and then to other sources if the manager did not resolve his concerns. Instead, claimant bypassed the manager and took his concerns directly to a human resources representative. In the memo he submitted to the human resources representative, claimant accused the department manager and his other supervisors of lying, scheming, threatening, and intimidating employees. Claimant knew or should have known that such comments were disrespectful. His conduct was at least a wantonly negligent violation of the employer\u2019s reasonable expectations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">The board further determined that claimant\u2019s \u201cdisrespectful\u201d conduct in writing and submitting the April 9 memo to Plath <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>was not an \u201cisolated instance of poor judgment,\u201d OAR 471-030-0038(3)(b), given \u201c[claimant\u2019s repeated displays of disrespectful conduct,\u201d including his previous complaints about supervisors\u2019 conduct and the March 2008 incident that led to his suspension. Finally, the board determined that claimant\u2019s conduct was not a good faith error, in that, although claimant may have believed that he was entitled to convey concerns about his manager to the human resources department, he \u201cdid not believe that he was entitled to make disrespectful statements about the manager and other supervisors\u201d in expressing such concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">On review, claimant contends, principally, that the board erred in deeming his submission of the April 9 memo to Plath to be disqualifying \u201cmisconduct\u201d within the meaning of OAR 471-030-0038(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He alternatively contends that, in all events, that conduct was, at worst, an isolated instance of poor judgment or represented a good faith error. OAR 471-030-0038(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Claimant\u2019s challenge is framed and phrased generally. Nevertheless, we understand him to posit that the board\u2019s operative determinations, particularly with respect to misconduct, were not supported by \u201csubstantial evidence in the record.\u201d ORS 183.482(8)(c). As we recently reiterated in <em>Castro v. Board of Parole, </em>232 Or App 75, 83, 220 P3d 772 (2009), that challenge, in turn, implicates an inquiry into whether the board has \u201cadequately explained] the logical connection between the evidence in the record and its [operative] <em>conclusion\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., \u201csubstantial reason.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) <em>See also Salosha, Inc. v. Lane County, </em>201 Or App 138, 143, 117 P3d 1047 (2005) (\u201cWhere a petitioner argues that an order is not supported by substantial evidence, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>court will also review the order for substantial reason to ensure that the order articulates the reasoning that leads from the facts found to the conclusions drawn.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">We conclude that the board\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial reason. The premise of the board\u2019s determination that claimant had engaged in disqualifying \u201cmisconduct\u201d is that claimant\u2019s submission of the April 9 memorandum to Plath constituted \u201cdisrespectful conduct\u201d violating the employer\u2019s reasonable expectations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The board did not explain how, or why, logically that conduct could reasonably be deemed to be \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aj\">In particular, as claimant emphasizes: (1) Claimant\u2019s submission of the April 9 memorandum complied with the process authorized and invited by the employee handbook, as well as Plath\u2019s specific invitation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) the board rendered no findings as to the accuracy of claimant\u2019s complaints about his manager\u2019s and supervisors\u2019 alleged misconduct towards him and other employees \u2014 that is, the board did not find that claimant\u2019s complaints were somehow unjustified. The board did not address the significance of those considerations, individually or in combination. That is, the board did not explain how, or why, an employee\u2019s submission of (at least arguably) truthful complaints about his or her supervisors\u2019 conduct to the employer\u2019s human resources department, in accordance with the employer\u2019s prescribed procedures, can, logically, be deemed to be \u201cdisrespectful\u201d conduct violating the employer\u2019s reasonable expectations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AM7\">In the absence of some acknowledgment and reasoned consideration of those concerns, the board\u2019s conclusion that claimant engaged in disqualifying misconduct \u201cis an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>announcement, not an explanation.\u201d <em>Castro, </em>232 Or App at 85. That defect precludes meaningful judicial review of the board\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cIt gives us nothing to judicially review.\u201d); <em>Salosha, Inc., </em>201 Or App at 146 (\u201cAn unreasoned order substantially affects a party\u2019s statutory right to meaningful judicial review[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-10\"> \u201cAnother option,\u201d according to the handbook, was \u201cto contact a member of [employer\u2019s] Corporate Compliance Committee directly or by mail.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b61-6\"> OAR 471-030-0038(3) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">\u201c(a) As used in ORS 657.176(2)(a) and (b) a willful or wantonly negligent violation of the standards of behavior which an employer has the right to expect of an employee is misconduct. An act or series of actions that amount to a willful or wantonly negligent disregard of an employer\u2019s interest is misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">\u201c(b) Isolated instances of poor judgment, good faith errors, unavoidable accidents, absences due to illness or other physical or mental disabilities, or mere inefficiency resulting from lack of job skills or experience are not misconduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b62-7\"> The board\u2019s decision was predicated solely on the purportedly \u201cdisrespectful\u201d character of claimant\u2019s conduct. The board did not refer to, or rely on, the employer\u2019s alternative characterization of claimant\u2019s conduct as \u201cinsubordinate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b62-8\"> The board made no finding that claimant gave the memorandum to anyone other than Plath or otherwise published its contents within the workplace.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b62-10\"> To be sure, some of the language that claimant <em>employed </em>\u2014 e.g., \u201clie,\u201d \u201cscheme,\u201d and \u201cmake work hell for you\u201d \u2014 might have been phrased more artfully or diplomatically. Nevertheless, and nuance notwithstanding, the core, unavoidably negative connotation would have been the same. That is, there is no \u201cnice\u201d way to say that someone has \u201clied\u201d or \u201cschemed,\u201d but such allegations, if warranted, are not innately \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
