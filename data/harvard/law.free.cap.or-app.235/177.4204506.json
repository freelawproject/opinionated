We stated, \u201cThe judgment that the court entered did not merge the second-degree assault conviction into the first-degree assault conviction, but rather imposed consecutive sentences on those convictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41. We withdraw that sentence and replace it with the following: \u201cThe judgment that the court entered did not merge the second-degree assault conviction into the first-degree assault conviction, but rather imposed concurrent sentences on those convictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Contrary to the state\u2019s argument, that typographical error did not affect our disposition.
