D. 1817, between the aforesaid William, by the name of William Morton of the one part, and the said Daniel, by the name of Daniel Rangier of the other part, (which said first part with the seal of the aforesaid Daniel sealed, the said Thomas into court here brings, the date whereof is the same day and year, and also brings here into court his letters of administration to him granted by the register of Union county, in due form of law) it was concluded and agreed by and between the said parties, in manner following, to wit, that for and in consideration, as well of a certain debt of 106 dollars, then owing and payable to the said Daniel by the said William, as of the sum of 1 dollar then paid by the said Daniel to the said William, and also with a view to such future advances as the said Daniel might deem necessary and convenient, the said William did grant, bargain, sell, assign and transfer to the said Daniel Rangier the whole share, interest, estate and inheritance of the said William Morton in the real estate of Sephath Morton deceased, consisting \"principally in a tract of land in Buffaloe, valued by an inquest about the year 1814, adjoining lands of Benjamin Shock and others, and the said William thereby invested with full power the said Daniel to do all acts which might be legal and necessary to obtain, prosecute and recover all shares and distributary parts and interests aforesaid, recoverable by the said William, then or thereafter, or by the said Daniel, as alienee of the said William. In consideration whereof, the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Daniel by the same articles of agreement,-did covenant and agree, that, he would fairly and fully account for and pay over to the said William, his executors or administrators, at any time, when lawfully required, the balance which may be in the said Daniel\u2019s hands, first deducting the amount then lawfully and reasonably due and payable to him by the said William, which might be lawfully retained or withheld by the said Daniel, which by the same articles of agreement, among other things, more fully appears. And t he said Thomas in fact saith, that the said Daniel hath not fairly and fully accounted for and paid over to the said William in his lifetime, nor to the said Thomas, his administrator, since the death of the said William, when lawfully required, the balance which was and is in the said Daniel\u2019s hands, beyond the amount then lawfully and reasonably due and payable to the said Daniel by the said William, which he ought to have done when thereto lawfully required, according to the form and effect of the said articles of agreement, and so the said Thomas saith that the aforesaid Daniel (although often required) his covenant aforesaid hath not kept, but hath broken, and hath hitherto refused and still doth refuse to keep the same ; to the damage of the said Thomas\u2019s administrator as aforesaid 600 dollars, and thereof he brings suit, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-6\">Issue was joined, and the cause was tried, upon the plea of covenants performed. The defendant contended that the plaintiff could not recover, because the defendant, in the language of the covenant, had not been lawfully required to account and pay before suit brought. But the court below (Lewis, president) was of a different opinion, and instructed the jury that the defendant could not avail himself of that defence upon the pleadings, and a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b266-7\"><em>Bellas, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhZ\">cited, 1 <em>Chit.

But though the want of an allegation of request was originally a defect, yet being for the benefit of the defendant, it might be waived by him; and it was in fact waived by his plea of covenants performed. The defendant\u2019s interpretation of his plea is, that it is an assertion of performance just so far as he was bound to perform, without demand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>made : in other words, that it was no performance at all. But it is an assertion of actual performance, and whether on demand or without it, is immaterial, as he put his defence exclusively on that point. The other assignment is entirely destitute of substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
