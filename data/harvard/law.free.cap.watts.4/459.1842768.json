The declaration set out that Alexander Campbell, before inquisition found, had entered into the covenant to pay, upon which the action was brought, &amp;c. The defendant pleaded specially that the covenant was of Alexander Campbell, and not of him the defendant. To which the plaintiff replied specially, setting forth the inquisition and proceedings, and that effects of Alexander Campbell to an amount sufficient to pay, &amp;c. came to the defendant\u2019s hands; to which the defendant demurred and the plaintiff joined in the demurrer. The court below gave judgment for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b459-8\"><em>II. D.

The inquisition devolves on them the same duties that an inquisition of lunacy devolves on his com, mittee, who are certainly not chargeable with his actions. So far is this principle carried, that such committee cannot sue, even inequity, without making him a party, It is impossible to sustain the present action,</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
