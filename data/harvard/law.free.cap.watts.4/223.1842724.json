Whether the action of trover will lie in this easel</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-12\">2. 'Whether it can be maintained by the plaintiffs 1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-13\">1. It is well settled, that title to land cannot be tried in the action of trover. This is a transitory action, and title to land, upon obvious grounds of policy, can only be decided in those actions which are local, or, in other words, confined to the county in which the land lies. But the matter in controversy is not the title to land; it is the right to the twelve tons of iron ore, dug and raised upon these eleven acres of land, part of the two hundred and eighty-two acres remaining to David Forre\u00e9 after he conveyed the twenty acres to William Bennet. It is not disputed that the title to these premises is in Jacob Heistand, Junior; and the verdict finds that he and Jacob Heistand, Senior, and David Forree under whom he claims, have been in the legal and actual possession thereof, from the 28th of October 1765, until the institution of the present suit. 3 <em>Serg. fy Rawle </em>509; 10 <em>Serg. ty Rawle </em>119.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-14\">This ore, thus dug and raised, was a chattel, and, as such, a legitimate subject of trover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-15\">Actions of trover have often been brought and sustained; not only for taking and converting ores and other minerals to the use of the defendant, after they were extracted from the soil by the plaintiff; but for digging, taking and carrying them away, all at t he same time, by the defendant, and converting them to his use. 3 <em>Serg. fy Rawle </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>509 ; Player <em>v. </em>Roberts, 1 <em>Jones </em>243, cited by the chief justice, and commented upon in 3 <em>Serg. fy Rawle.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-6\">There is little or no difficulty, then, in the first question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-7\">2. But the other question involves many considerations of great difficulty, which were argued by the counsel with more than their usual ability and learning. It is a satisfaction and relief to me, to know that any opinion of mine will only open the door to the supreme court; though, I will add, I have examined the subject with as much care as if I felt all the responsibility of an ultimate decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-8\">In trover, the plaintiff must have had, at the time of the cause of action accrued, either the actual possession, or the right to the immediate possession of the goods or chattels which are the subject of the action. He must also have a property in the chattel, either general or special; and the rule is, that the constructive possession of goods follows the property. 11 <em>Johns. </em>259; 3 <em>Serg. </em>&lt;\u00a3\u2022 <em>Rawle </em>513.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-9\">If, then, the plaintiffs had the right or title to this ore\u2014if it was <em>theirproperty, </em>they shall be deemed to have had possession, when it was taken and carried away by the defendants, and converted to their us\u00e9.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-10\">If, on the other hand, the right to this ore, or the property in it, belonged to the defendants, the present action cannot be maintained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-11\">It results, therefore, in this question : Was this ore the property of Simeon Guilford and Franklin Wright, or was it the property of the defendants <em>1</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-12\">In support of their claim, the plaintiffs have exhibited articles of agreement, dated the 27th of September 1830, between Jacob Heistand, Junior, and themselves, in which, for the consideration therein mentioned, the said Jacob Heistand granted and assigned to them \u201c the sole and exclusive right and privilege to dig, take and carry away all the iron ore of every kind, wherever to be found, upon a certain tract of land belonging to the said Jacob Heistand, containing between ten and eleven acres, situate and lying in West Hemp-field township, Lancaster county, adjoining lands of John Greider, Michael Bachman and others, with free ingress and egress to exercise and enjoy the said right and privilege; in consideration for which, they, the said S. Guilford and F. Wright, by the same articles bound themselves to pay, on the 1st day of April 1833, and annually thereafter, the sum of three hundred and fifty dollars; and also to pay one hundred dollars for each and every acre of land which should be destroyed for the use and enjoyment of the above conveyed privilege.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-13\">, Jacob Heistand, Junior, purchased the premises from Jacob Heistand and wife, who conveyed the same to him by their deed of the 8 th of April 1816.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-14\">These eleven acres, (or ten acres, forty-three perches) were part of a larger tract of two hundred and fifty acres, which were conveyed and assured to Jacob Heistand, Senior, by David Forree and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>wife, by their deed of the 2d November 1791, being part of a still larger tract of two hundred and eighty-two acres, then held by the said David Forree under and by virtue of a deyise in the last will and testament of his father John Forree, to whom the late proprietaries of Pennsylvania had granted a tract of four hundred and two acres and allowance, &amp;c. (of which this was a part), by their patent dated the 21st December 1749.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-4\">There is no dispute with respect to this deduction of title ; but the defendants, in support of their defence, have set up what they contend is a higher and better title to the ore in these eleven acres than that exhibited by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\">On the 6th of May 1769, David Forree and wife, by their deed of that date, conveyed to William Bennet, an iron master, twenty acres in fee, being a part of the tract held by the said David Forree under and by virtue of the devise from his father John Forree, deceased, as before mentioned; which tract contained three hundred and two acres. This deed, <em>inter alia, </em>recites that in consideration of 107 pounds, the said David Forree and his wife granted, bargained and sold, aliened, enfeoffed, released and confirmed unto William Bennet, his heirs and assigns, all the following described tract of land, part of the above described' tract of three hundred and two acres, beginning, &amp;c.

And then follows a covenant in these words: \u201cand the aforesaid David Forree, for himself, his heirs, executors and administrators, doth covenant, promise, grant and agree to and with the aforesaid William Bennet, his heirs and assigns, that he, the said William Bennet, his heirs and assigns, shall and may, from time to time and at all times hereafter, dig, take and carry away all iron ore to be found within the bounds of the said David Forree\u2019s tract of land, containing two hundred and eighty-two acres: provided he, the said William Bennet, his heirs or assigns, pay unto the said David Forree, his heirs or assigns, the sum of 6 pence, Pennsylvania currency, per ton, for every ton taken from the premises of two hundred and eighty-two acres, aforesaid.\u201d Against William Bennet (the grantee in this deed), James Smith, Esq., obtained \u00e1 judgment to the November term 1770, for 2000 pounds. <em>A fieri facias </em>was issued to February term 1771, to which the sheriff returned \u201clands and goods levied.\u201d On this a <em>venditioni exponas </em>issued to May term 1771, to which the return was \u201cno buyers and then-an <em>alias venditioni exponas </em>to August term 1771, No .26, with a general return of \u201cland and goods sold, insufficient,\u201d indorsed, together with a more particular return, in the following words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-6\">\u201cTo the justices within named\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>\u201cBy virtue of the within writ to me directed, I did, on the 28th day of June A.D. 1771, by way of public vendue, expose to sale the lands and tenements of the within defendant, by me taken in execution as within mentioned, and at the sale did sell a certain .island situate in the river Susquehanna, nearly opposite the mouth of Codorus creek with its appurtenances, unto David Grier, for the sum of 160 pounds, lawful money of Pennsylvania, and did sell the ore bank by me taken in execution, containing about twenty acres, with its appurtenances, unto George Eichelberger for the sum of 60 pounds lawful money of Pennsylvania, those being the highest sums bid, and they the said David Grier and George Eichelberger, being the best and highest bidders at the said sales for the same premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Frederick Stone, <em>Sheriff.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-7\"><em>The fieri facias, </em>by virtue of which the sheriff levied on these lands, has not been found;

Grubb, deducing his title from William Bennet, had a right to all the iron ore to be found on those two hundred and eighty-two acres, of which the eleven acres mentioned and described in the articles between Jacob Heist- and, Jun. and Guilford and Wright, were apart; thatForree\u2019s deed to William Bennet contained a grant to the latter, his heirs and assigns, of the privilege of digging, taking and carrying away all such ore, from time to time and at all times, with the single condition of paying 6 pence a ton to the grantor, his heirs or assigns; and that, by virtue of the judgment, executions, sales, sheriff\u2019s deed, deed of Thomas Neill to Henry B. Grubb, and the mesne conveyances, this privilege became vested in Henry B. Grubb, his heirs and assigns; that David Forree having conveyed away the right to all the iron ore in the said two hundred and eighty-two acres, Jacob Heistand, Jun., who, forty-seven years after, purchased eleven acres, part of those two hundred and eight.y-two acres, had no authority to grant the same privilege to Guilford and Wright the plaintiffs, with respect to the ore in these eleven acres; and that the sale to them passed nothing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-7\">That Henry B. Grubb\u2019s right, being a right to all the iron ore to be found on the premises, is necessarily exclusive, and that, consequently, as the plaintiffs, in digging and raising the twelve tons of ore mentioned in the verdict, acted in violation of such right, the defendants were justified in taking it away as the property of Henry B. Grubb\u2019s heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-8\">To the array of title on the part of the defendants, many objections were urged, which are now to be considered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-9\">1st.

It was alleged, under the first head, that the right granted to William Bennet to dig, take and carry away all the ore on the two hundred and eighty-two acres of David Forree, was without consideration, and was therefore a mere license revocable at the will of the grantor before any thing was done or expended in prosecution of the privilege; that William Bennet, or any other person for him, or claiming under him, never incurred any expenditure, or did any thing towards the finding and raising of ore on those two hundred and eighty-two acres or any part thereof; that being a personal license merely, it could not pass to his assigns, or be transmitted to his heirs; that it was virtually revoked, and, if not, ceased at his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-12\">That more than sixty years having elapsed since the deed of 1769, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>and previous to the purchase of Guilford and Wright, without any exercise of the privilege, it must be presumed that it was abandoned or released ; which presumption is sanctioned and confirmed by the acts of David Forree, in selling and conveying the greatest part of the two hundred and eighty-two acres without noticing in his deed the existence of the privilege.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-6\">That James Smith and the subsequent purchasers of the ore bank, as it was called, containing twenty acres, conveyed by David Forree in the deed of 1769, could only claim what was levied on and sold by the sheriff, as the property of William Bennet, to George Eichelberger; that this right-or privilege of William Bennet to dig and take the ore in the two hundred and eighty-two acres was neither levied on nor sold; and therefore did not pass by the sheriff\u2019s deed of the 10th of August 1771 ; and that this breach in the defendants\u2019 claim of title, is fatal to their defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-7\">A license is an authority to do a particular act or series of acts upon another\u2019s land, without possessing any interest therein. It is founded in personal confidence and favour, and is not assignable. It may be by parol, or by deed in writing, and whilst executory it is always revocable at the 'pleasure of him who gave it. Where A told B that he might pass and repass with his teams over the lands of A, who afterwards shut up the fence so that B could not pass, it was held to be a mere gratuitous license or promise, on which no action would lie. 3 <em>Kent\u2019s Comm. 452; </em>10 <em>Johns. \u25a0246.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-8\">Modern cases, says chancellor Kent, distinguish between an <em>easement </em>and a <em>license. </em>A claim for an easement must be founded upon grant by deed or writing, or upon prescription, which supposes one ; for it is a permanent interest in another\u2019s land, with a right at all times to enter and enjoy it. A better reason for the distinction, I apprehend, is, that an easement must be upon some consideration, but a license may be without any. 3 <em>Kent\u2019s Comm. 452.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-9\">If the right or privilege granted to William Bennet, were without consideration, it would unquestionably have fallen under the denomination of a license, and been subject to the rales applicable thereto. But there are two answers to that assertion: 1. The compensation of the 6 pence a ton for every ton raised and taken away from the two hundred and eighty-two acres is a consideration, though not (formally and technically) so expressed. <em>2. </em>The general consideration of 107 pounds applies to the grant of this right as well as to the twenty acres of land conveyed. All the benefits and advantages of a deed, as well those contained in whatever covenants may be inserted, as in the principal grant, shall be deemed to be in consideration of the sum expressed to be paid and technically called the consideration of the deed. Were this point involved in doubt, the rule that the deed shall be construed most strictly against the grantor, would avail in favour of the grantee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-10\">I am of opinion, then, that this right was something more than a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>license, the essential characteristic of which I take to be, that it is an authority given <em>without </em>consideration, to do any lawful act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-6\">It was contended for the defendants, that their right was a common ; but such a designation is, I conceive, irreconcilable with the exclusiveness of their claim. It belongs, however, to the same description of rights or incorporeal hereditaments, which are divided into two classes: profits and easements. <em>Angel\u00ed on Adv. Enjoym. </em>19.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-7\">Profits are rights to the produce of the soil, either above or below the surface, as herbage, wood, coals, ore, or other minerals. Easements are defined to be a service or convenience, which one neighbour hath with another by charter or prescription, without profit; as a way over his land, a sink or passage of water through it, and such like. The right of conducting water through one estate, for the use and convenience of an adjoining estate, is an incorporeal hereditament of the class of easements. The right of taking water out of another\u2019s well or pond, is a right of that class denominated profits. To this same class, belongs the right to dig and take the iron ore in David Forree\u2019s tract of two hundred and eighty-two acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-8\">The question next occurs, whether <em>nonuser </em>for sixty years, in connexion with the other facts, establishes a presumption of an abandonment or release of the right or privilege in controversy. There is a distinction between privileges founded on grant and those which are acquired by use. A right'acquired by use, may be lost by <em>nonuser ; </em>and an absolute discontinuance of the use for twenty years, affords a presumption of the extinguishment of the right, in favour of some adverse right. But the mere <em>nonuser </em>of an easement or a <em>\\ </em>profit, which is a right founded in grant, even for twenty years, will j! not necessarily raise a presumption of its extinguishment, unless I there has been, in the meantime, some act done by the owner of / the land charged therewith, inconsistent with or adverse to its exist- I ence, or some default or acquiescence in the claimant of the right; j in which case a release or extinguishment will be presumed. This ! distinction is illustrated by the chief justice, in the case of Nitzel <em>v.\u2018 </em>Pascal, 3 <em>Rawle </em>76. 3 <em>Kent\u2019s Comm. </em>448 ; <em>Ibid. </em>453, note.1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-9\">In Butz <em>v. </em>Ihrie, the grantor had reserved a right to himself, his heirs and assigns, to raise, swell and dam the water of a stream, from a dam to be built on his own land. Thirty-two years elapsed from the time the right was reserved, to the time of building the dam ; and the question was, whether the reservation was barred, or forfeited, or lost by the lapse of time. The case was heard on an appeal from the circuit court held by the chief justice. And Judge Tod, delivering the judgment of the supreme court, says: <em>\u201c </em>we are all of opinion that the lapse of time has not been such as to create any bar or forfeiture ; and that, under the circumstances of this case, the privilege reserved in the deed of 1793, was in full force in 1825, unaffected by any presumption. The omission to erect the dam can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>scarcely, in this case, be called a <em>nonuser. </em>Cerlainly it cannot be called <em>laches. </em>It would have been otherwise, had the deed shown that an immediate exercise of the privilege reserved, was contemplated by the parties. Here the right of building the dam appears to be expressly reserved, even to the heirs and assigns of the grantors in the deed. \u201c We concur in' the opinion of the chief justice, expressed to the jury, that the law of limitations may be applicable to a case of this kind ; but that the time cannot begin to run against such a privilege by reservation, until some default, negligence, or acquiescence is shown, or may be fairly presumed in the owner.\u201d 1 <em>Rawle </em>218.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-6\">Several points in this decision are observable. 1. The fact that the privilege was by reservation, appears to have been regarded as in some degree relieving it from the presumption which might otherwise have obtained. 2. Had the deed shown, that an immediate exercise of the right was contemplated, the time establishing, by its lapse, a presumption of extinguishment, would have begun from the date of the deed. 3. Notwithstanding this was a privilege reserved, and there was nothing in the deed to show it was the sense of the parties that it should be immediately exercised; yet, if there had been any default, negligence or acquiescence on the part of the owner, the time would have begun from such default, negligence or acquiescence; and a sufficient, length of time, that is <em>to </em>say, twenty years <em>nonuser, </em>would have established a presumption of abandonment, or a release. 4. That this negligence, &amp;c. might be shown, i. e. proved by direct, evidence of the fact, or presumed, i. e. inferred from the proof of circumstances tending to that conclusion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-7\">In Nitzel <em>v. </em>Pascal, 3 <em>Rawle </em>76, the supreme court, in the opinion delivered by the chief justice, says, \u201cit is certainly true, that a right of enjoyment may be lost in the same way it has been gained, and when acquired by an adverse possession for <em>twenty years, it may be </em>lost by <em>nonuser </em>for the same period. Where, however, it has been acquired by grant, it will not be lost by <em>nonuser, </em>in analogy to the statute of limitations, unless there were a denial of the title, or other act on the adverse part, to quicken the owner in the assertion of his right.\u201d The direct inference from the position here stated, is, that a right acquired by grant, might be lost by twenty years <em>nonuser, </em>if there were a denial of the title, or other act on the adverse part, to quicken the owner in his assertion of his right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-8\">Applying the principles recognized in these cases to the facts of the special verdict, we will endeavour to ascertain whether the doctrine of <em>nonuser </em>affects the claim set up by tbe defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-9\">Nothing has ever been done by the defendants\u2014by Henry B. Grubb or those under whom they claim, in or towards the exercise of the privilege, or assertion of the right granted to William Bennet, to dig and take away all the iron ore in the two hundred and eight-two acres of David Forree\u2019s land, until the removal of tbe twelve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>tons of ore, for which this suit was brought, i. e. for a period of more than sixty years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-6\">In 1791, more than forty years before that transaction, David Forree sold and conveyed two hundred and fifty acres of this land, without reservation or exception, to Jacob Heistand, in fee simple. The deed was recorded in 1792.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-7\">Although by this alienation David Forree parted with much the greater portion of the land in which the right to dig and take the iron ore had been granted to William Bennet and his assigns, and conveyed it to Jacob Heistand, without excepting such right or noticing it in any form; but, on the contrary, e_xpressly including all the, rights, liberties, privileges and advantages, and the issues and profits thereof: yet there was no complaint or assertion of the right, on the part of William Bennet, or any person or persons claiming to be his assigns.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-8\">The deed was recorded nearly forty years before the ore in question was taken by these defendants. William Bennet and his assigns, claiming these profits out of the land, must be deemed cognizant of the fact of this sale, and of the deed after it was thus placed on record; and yet they remained quiescent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-9\">Twenty-five years after this purchase, Jacob Heistand sold the eleven acres in which the plaintiffs dug and raised the twelve tons of ore which are the subject of the present action, to Jacob Heistand, Jun. The deed was dated in April 1816, but was not recorded until the 26th of October 1832. The grantor and grantee were severally in the actual possession of these premises, yet no claim or assertion of right was ever presented to or urged against them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-10\">I cannot say the deed from David Forree to Benriet shows that an immediate exercise of the right was in their contemplation. I think it does not. But, from the facts staled, it is fairly presumable that from the recording of Forree\u2019s deed to Heistand, there was negligence, nay, acquiescence, on the part of Bennet and his assigns ; for the fact of Forree\u2019s sale of two hundred and fifty acres of this land, in which the sole profits of digging and taking away all ihe iron ore had been granted to Bennet, and of his conveying them to Heistand absolutely, with all their rights, privileges and profits, was as complete a denial of Bennet\u2019s title as coul'd be devised, and as well calculated to quicken the owner in the assertion of his claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-11\">According to the principles recognized in the decisions to which I have adverted, I am of opinion, then, that there were thirty-nine years, i. e. from the time of the recording of the deed of David Forree and wife to Jacob Heistand, to the taking and carrying away of the twelve tons of iron ore, during which a <em>nonuser </em>has been established, sufficient, in point of evidence, to raise the presumption of ,a release of the right of William Bennet and his assigns. Another circumstance fortifying this presumption, is, that the sheriff who levied on the real and personal estate of William Bennet, upwards of sixty years ago, and sold the same without satisfying his creditors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>owing to the insufficiency of the defendant\u2019s property, did not men-' tion this right in his levy or in his sale. James Smith was the judgment and execution creditor. It was his province, as well as interest, to show all the defendant\u2019s property to the sheriff. He became the purchaser of the twenty acres called the Ore Bank, from the sheriff\u2019s vendor; yet the sheriff, in his levy and sale, did not specify this right to dig, take and carry away all the iron ore to be found on the remaining two hundred and eighty-two acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-6\">But that omission has a more direct relation to another point: namely, the allegation that the sheriff did not sell this right; and the sheriff\u2019s vendor not having purchased it, could not pass it to James Smith, &amp;c. That it is not specifically mentioned or described in the sheriff\u2019s levy, is undeniable: but it is contended by the defendants, that the levy and inquisition did nevertheless include it, under the general term of \u201c appurtenances ; \u201d that the sheriff\u2019s deed conveyed it by the clause in the grant, of all and singular the lights, easements and appurtenances to the same ore bank belonging or in any wise appertaining, and by the <em>habendum, </em>to have and to hold the said ore bank, with its appurtenances, hereditaments, and premises hereby granted and released, or mentioned so to be, with their rights, members and appurtenances, unto the said George Eichelberger, &amp;c.; and that this construction is strengthened by the recital and grant in the deed from Eichelberger to Smith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-7\">The only evidence extant, of the levy, is the recital in the sheriff\u2019s deed, by which it appears that the sheriff seized and took in execution, <em>inter alia, </em>one ore bank, containing about twenty acres, near Chiques\u2019s creek, in the township of Hempfield, in his bailiwick, the property of the said defendant. Here there is neither mention of, nor reference to, appurtenances. The levy was simply on the \u201c ore bank containing twenty acres.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-8\">The inquisition, indeed, found that the rents, issues and profits of the said island, with the improvements, and the said ore bank containing about twenty acres, with their appurtenances, were not of a clear yearly value, &amp;c.; and the grant was, in its concluding general. clause, of all and singular the lights, easements and appurtenances to the same ore bank belonging or in any wise appertaining; and the <em>habendum </em>was, to have and to hold the said ore bank, with its appurtenances, hereditaments and premises, with their rights, members and appurtenances, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-9\">Now it was contended on thei other side, and with great reason, as well as upon sound authority, that in case of variance between the levy and the subsequent proceedings, the levy must govern ; for all the\"power of the sheriff to dispose of real estate is founded upon his levy. He can neither inquire by an inquest, nor extend or sell any thing else. If appurtenances could, therefore, by a proper interpretation, include the right in question, the levy not having embraced them, they could not be the subject of the inquisition, nor of the sale or assurance to the purchaser. All, in these proceedings, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>yond <em>the levy, </em>was a nullity. The argument on this point, I think, is unanswerable, so far, at least, as regards those appurtenances which do not pass without being mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-6\">But it was moreover urged, that if the levy had been expressly on the ore bank and its appurtenances, and the sale by the sheriff and his deed had conformed to it, yet that the term appurtenances would not have carried this right to dig and take the ore in the two hundred and eighty-two acres, residue of the tract of three hundred and two acres. For, 1. It could not be legally appurtenant to the twenty acres sold and granted, because land, it was said, cannot be appurtenant to a messuage, or one messuage to another, or land to other land; that appurtenances signify something incident to another thing, as principal, as hamlets to a chief manor, common of pasture to a messuage, orchards and gardens to a house, &amp;c. And the thing appurtenant must agree with the more worthy or principal thing in nature and quality; as a common of estovers, &amp;c. toa house; a forest to a manor or castle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-7\"><em>2. </em>Again, the grant in Forree\u2019s deed to Bennet, of the privilege to dig and take the iron ore in the two hundred and eighty-two acres, was by a collateral covenant, not relating to nor concerning the conveyance of the twenty acres, but was of a thing wholly distinct from, and independent of the main grant, or conveyance of the deed. It was not expressed as being intended to be appurtenant to the twenty acres conveyed by <em>the </em>said deed; nor can it by any reasonable construction be inferred, as the intention of the parties, that it should be so held or considered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-8\">3. It is not pretended that William Bennet used or enjoyed this right as appurtenant to the twenty acres called the ore bank; and in his deed from D. Forree, the twenty acres were conveyed to him with the appurtenances, by all the usual terms, and in the parts of the deed, commonly and technically assigned to the complete assurance of land intended to be conveyed, before the right in question was mentioned in a distinct covenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-9\">4. Lastly, in a sheriff\u2019s deed the grant must be specific and clear; nothing will, for instance, pass by such deed under a general clause of all other the lands, &amp;c. of the defendants. 13 <em>Johns. </em>537.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-10\">Upon a consideration of this argument, I am of opinion that the right or privilege of digging and taking the iron ore in the two hundred and eighty-two acres, was not granted in that deed as appurtenant to the twenty acres ; that it was not used as appurtenant to the twenty acres by William Bennet\u2014for it was not used or exercised at all; that such right, though it might be appurtenant to a furnace, being agreeable to its nature and quality, as affording a proper and the principal material for the support of its operations, could not be considered as an appurtenance to an ore bank, any more than the right to cut timber in one forest can be appurtenant to a different forest; or the right to till one field can be appurtenant to another; a meadow to a pasture; or a pasture to a wood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>The right or privilege, then, not being in its nature legally appurtenant to the twenty acres sold and conveyed (o Bennet, and not having been granted to him as appurtenant thereto, nor enjoyed or exercised by him as such, it was not, and could not, be, at the time of the sheriff\u2019s levy or sale, one of the appurtenances of those twenty acres of land called the ore bank. Consequently, it did not pass by the grant, in that deed of the twenty acres, with the appurtenances, and could not have passed without a specific description, or at least designation of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-6\">It is indeed true, that by the grant of a messuage <em>cum terns p'ertinentiis, </em>land occupied continually with the house passes, though land is not properly appurtenant to a house ; yet it has been ruled, that, by t he grant of a house or land, <em>cum pertinentiis, </em>another house or land does not pass, unless it be found to be parcel. 4 <em>Com. Dig. </em>314 ; <em>Grant E. 9.; Plowd.

Co. <em>Litt. </em>307, <em>a., Cora.; Cro. El. </em>18.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-9\">It is hardly necessary to add, that if the right in question did not pass, by the sheriff\u2019s deed, to George Eicbelberger, no description, or recital, or grant, in his deed to James Smith, however comprehensive and specific, would supply the deficiency. In perusing this deed, it is not easy to resist, the conviction of an endeavour, in its preparation, to effect such a purpose. In the recital, the grant, in the deed to Bennet, of the twenty acres is so described as if the right to dig and take the iron ore, had been intended by that conveyance to be made appurtenant to the ore bank or twenty acres. Thus, after giving the metes and bounds, the recital pursues the description as follows: containing twenty acres, &amp;c. together also with the free liberty of the said William Bennet, his heirs and assigns, to dig, take and carry away, &amp;c. Whereas this liberty or right was the subject matter of a subsequent, and distinct covenant in Bennet\u2019s deed, following the grant and <em>habendum et tenendum, </em>in which the twenty-acres and the appurtenances were completely conveyed and assured (as it has been already mentioned) by all the apt and usual phrases. There is also in Smith\u2019s deed, in the recital therein of the sheriff\u2019s \u25a0sale, a statement which is not supported by the facts recited in the sheriff\u2019s deed : namely, that, the sheriff did expose to sale the ore bank, containing twenty acres of land with the appurtenances and privileges, and the same accordingly sold and struck off to George Eichelberger. Now it has been shown that the sheriff did not levy on the twenty acres and the appurtenances, and there is nothing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>sheriff\u2019s deed to show that he. exposed to sale, or struck off any thing by the name of privileges of the ore bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-5\">The recital in Smith\u2019s deed goes on to say, that the sheriff did sell and convey to George Eichelberger, the aforesaid ore bank containing twenty acres of land, and every part thereof, with the appurtenances, to George Eichelberger, his heirs and assigns, for ever, for the same estate as he the said William Bennet had of, in, or to the said ore bank, containing twenty acres, and every part thereof, with the appurtenances, at and immediately before the said judgment was had and recovered against him, as in and by the said deed poll, reference thereto being had, may more fully and at large appear. But it. will be seen, by the sheriff\u2019s deed thus referred to, that there is nothing in it of this peculiar designation of the estate conveyed, as being the same estate as he the said William Bennet, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-6\">The grant in Smith\u2019s deed from Eichelberger, contains this somewhat singular reference: grant, bargain and sell, release and confirm unto the said James Smith, his heirs and assigns, all that above (i. e. in the recital) described tract of twenty acres of land called the ore bank and premises, with the appurtenances, as the same is above (i. e. in the recital) set forth and described, bounded and limited as aforesaid, together with all and singular the improvements, ways, woods, waters, water-courses, lights and privileges, hereditaments and appurtenances whatsoever thereunto belonging, or in anywise appertaining, &amp;c. to have and to hold the aforesaid twenty acres of land and premises, hereby granted, mentioned, or intended so to be, with the appurtenances and <em>privileges, </em>unto the aforesaid James Smith, &amp;c. &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-7\">But notwithstanding this apparent effort to supply what was evidently deemed an insufficient conveyance by the sheriff, it is too plain to admit of a doubt, that Eichelberger could only sell what the sheriff had conveyed to him\u2014certainly not an iota morel</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-8\">2d. It was lastly objected to the title set up by the defendants, that the grant of the privilege in question was, at best, in the nature of a secret conveyance, and cannot affect the plaintiffs, who are <em>bona fide </em>purchasers without notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-9\">To this it was answered, that they had equitable if not actual notice, and therefore cannot shelter themselves under the pretext of a <em>bona fide </em>purchase. It is supposed that such notice was furnished, first, by the sale and conveyance of the twenty acres to William Bennet; and second, by the recording of the deeds to subsequent purchasers, of those twenty acres and the appurtenances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-10\">1. There is no proof of actual notice\u2014and even if the usual notoriety of a purchase may be considered as constructive notice to a subsequent purchaser, in consequence of the change of possession, and the acts of ownership which often accompany and succeed the transaction, (which I, by no means, admit) yet here, it is to be observed, it would not operate with respect to this right to dig and take the iron ore in the two hundred and eighty two acres, since no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>change of possession did take place, or was contemplated, even by the enjoyment of the right; and the right, in point of fact, was not exercised at all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-6\">2. With respect to the recording of the deeds : the deed from David Forree and wife to William Bennet, was not recorded ; so that, of the very .origin of the title, which is set up adversely to the plaintiff\u2019s and the Heistands, under whom they claim, they had not even the constructive notice which the recorder\u2019s office might have afforded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-7\">So of the proceedings on Smith\u2019s judgment'\u2014the levy and sale, and the sheriff\u2019s deed; we have seen there was, in these, no specific mention of this right, and nothing from which notice of its existence' could be inferred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-8\">The deed from George Eichelberger to James Smith, containing a very particular recital, (upon which I have already remarked) was never recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-9\">And it is remarkable, that the subsequent deeds of James Smith and wife to Thomas Neill, Thomas Neill to J.

The ten acres and forty-three perches from which the ore was taken, were part of a larger tract of two hundred and fifty acres, which was conveyed tcf'Jafeob Heistand, Sen. by David Forree and wife, by their deed of the 2d of November 1791, being part of a still larger tract of two hundred and eighty-two acres, then held by David Forree under the last will and testament of his father John Forree, who held, under a patent dated the 21st of December 1749, from the proprietors.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Jacob Heistand, Sen., being so seised, on the 8th of April 1816, conveyed eleven acres of the above described property to Jacob Heistand, Jun., who, on the 27th of September 1830, entered into articles of agreement with Guilford and Wright, wherein, for the consideration therein expressed, the said Jacob Heistand granted and assigned to them the sole and exclusive right and privilege to dig, take and carry away all the iron ore, of every kind whatever, to be found upon a certain tract of land belonging to the said Jacob Heistand, containing between ten and eleven acres, &amp;c., with ingress,, egress, &amp;c. By this agreement, so far as regards the right of using the land for the purposes therein stated, the plaintiffs have acquired all the interest of Jacob Heistand, with all the powers be might have had in relation to the same previous to the agreement. Now it is clear, that Jacob Heistand, as the owner of the fee simple, and his assignees, have the undoubted right Jo raise ore on the premises, without molestation or hindrance from any one; and more especially from him who stands in the relation of a wrong doer or trespasser. The title to land cannot be tried in an action of trover. 3 <em>Serg. </em>&lt;\u00a3\u2022 <em>Rawle </em>509 ; 10 <em>Serg. fy Rawle </em>119. But it is said that ore when dug and raised is a chattel; and that it is sufficient to defeat the plaintiffs\u2019 action, to show either that the title is in the defendants or in some third person. 11 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>529; 9 <em>Cowen </em>52; 1 <em>Wend. </em>466. It is not disputed, as a general principle, that in an action of trover a defendant may show title in a third person. But in the case at bar this principle does not apply, because Jacob Heistand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>was in the actual possession of the land until the 29th. of September 1830, when he sold and conveyed to the plaintiff, for a valuable consideration, the right, as above described, to enter and take all the iron ore in the ten acres and forty-three perches. The contract was executed by the parties; by the plaintiffs, in pursuance of the grant, entering on the land and expending their money and labour in digging and raising the ore. The defendants, finding the ore dug and at the pit\u2019s mouth, entered, took and converted the same to their own use. For this injury the action of trover is an appropriate remedin 3 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>509; Brown <em>v. </em>Caldwell, 10 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle </em>114.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">If, as is alleged, the subsequent grant to Guilford and Wright was a violation of the previous grant to William Bennet, the question may be tried in an action on the case ; or, perhaps, William Bennet and those who claim under him, have acquired by the contract such an interest in the soil as may enable them to sustain an ejectment for the recovery of the possession. Under, however, the circumstances of the case, William Bennet, never having been in possession and not having-done any thing in pursuance of the contract, does not become the owner of the ore when raised, which is a necessary ingredient in the positions of the defendants\u2019 counsel, that title in him is sufficient to defeat the action, although the defendants are wrong doers or trespassers.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">But the form of the action is of but little consequence, as we understand it to be the wish of the parties to have the right to the mine settled. It is not the intention of the court to express any opinion on (he rights of William Bennet or his heirs, as they are not parties to the special verdict; nor in the view we have taken of the cause is this necessary. We give no opinion on the point of <em>nonuser, </em>so much pressed by the counsel for the plaintiff, but shall take it for granted that Bennet\u2019s right was not impaired by time, and that it was a subsisting interest up to the sheriff\u2019s sale, and continued so until the commencement of this suit and trial of the cause. The case, so far as Grubb\u2019s heirs are concerned, was this: on the 6th of March 1769, David Forree and wife, by their deed of that date, conveyed to William Bennet, an iron master, twenty acres in fee, being partof the tract of land held by the said David Forree, by a devise from his father John Forree deceased, as before mentioned. This deed, <em>inter alia, </em>recites, that in consideration of 107 pounds, the said David Forree and wife granted, bargained, sold, &amp;c. to William Bennet, his heirs and assigns, all the following described tract of land, beginning, &amp;c., containing twenty acres and the allowance, to have and to hold the aforesaid tract of twenty acres of land and premises granted, mentioned or intended so to be, with the appurtenances, unto the aforesaid William Bennet, his heirs and assigns, &amp;c. Then follows the covenant or grant now under consideration, and which is particularly set forth in the special verdict, and which contains the consideration for which the grant was made, viz. 6 pence a ton for every ton taken from the premises of two hundred and eighty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>two acres. This deed was made in pursuance of a previous article of agreement made between these parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">James Smith, Esq. obtained judgment against William Bennet to the November term 1770, for 2000 pounds. Several executions were issued, and among others an <em>alias venditioni exponas, </em>to the August term 1771, on which the sheriff returned that he had taken in execution and sold a certain island, &amp;c. to David Grier, for 160 pounds, and also that he sold the ore bank taken in execution, containing twenty acres, with its appurtenances, to George Eichelberger, for the sum of 60 pounds, lawful money, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\"><em>The fieri facias, </em>by virtue of which the sheriff made his levy, is lost. But in the recital of the sheriff\u2019s deed to Eichelberger, it is said, among other things in the return, that he seised in execution one ore bank containing about twenty acres, &amp;c. But in the inquisition it was found, as appears by the same recital, that the rents, issues and profits of the island, &amp;c. and the said ore bank, containing about twenty acres, with the appurtenances, were not of a clear yearly value, &amp;c. In the deed, the sheriff grants, bargains, sells and delivers to George Eichelberger, his heirs and assigns, all that, the said ore bank, containing twenty acres, and the usual allowance, be the same more or less (it being the same ore bank which William Ben-net purchased from a certain David Forree), together with all and singular the houses, outhouses, edifices and buildings thereon erected and being ; and also all and singular the lights, easements and ap-/ purtenances to the same ore bank belonging or in anywise appertaining, and the reversions and remainders thereof; and also all the estate, right, title, interest,benefit, claim and demand whatsoever, of him the said William Bennet, both at law and in equity or otherwise, howsoever, of, in, to and out of the same premises and every part thereof; to have and to hold the said ore bank, with its appurtenances, hereditaments and premises hereby granted and released, or mentioned so to be, with their rights, members and appurtenances, unto the said George Eichelberger, his heirs and assigns, &amp;c. By several intermediate conveyances, the title of George Eichelberger, the sheriff\u2019s vendee, to the twenty acres and its appurtenances, became vested in Henry B. Grubb, and the defendants claim as his heirs and legal representatives. The defendants contend, that Henry B. Grubb, who derives title from William Bennet through the sheriff\u2019s vendee, has a right to all the iron ore to be found on the two hundred and eighty-two acres; that Forree\u2019s deed to William Bennet contains a grant to the latter, his heirs and assigns, of the privilege of digging, taking and carrying away all such iron ore, from time to time, and at all times, with the single condition of paying 6 pence a ton to the grantor, his Heirs and assigns; that by virtue of the judgment, executions, sale, sheriff\u2019s deed, and the several conveyances referred to in the special verdict, this privilege became vested in Henry B. Grubb, bis heirs and assigns; and that consequently, David Forree having conveyed away the right to all the iron ore in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>the said two hundred and eighty-two acres, Jacob Heistand, Jun., who afterwards purchased the eleven acres, part of the two hundred and eighty-two acres, had no authority to grant the same privilege to Guilford and Wright.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">It is unnecessary to examine the intermediate conveyances from Eichelberger to Grubb. Grubb has the same right that Eichelberger acquired at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and it is obvious, that whatever words may be used in these conveyances, they cannot enlarge the title vested in the sheriff\u2019s vendees. And this makes it requisite to ascertain the extent of this right. It is contended that the privilege of taking ore, as it existed under William Bennet, is passed to Eichelberger, by the sheriff, as an easement or appurtenance to the twenty acres. Before examining this question, I must remark, that in case of a variance between the levy and the subsequent proceedings, (which may have been the case here, although it does not distinctly appear) the levy must govern. Although the power of the sheriff to dispose of real estate is founded on the levy, he can neither inquire by inquest nor extend nor sell any thing else. But the court do not think proper to rest the cause on this point. I shall proceed to examine the question, whether the privilege or right in controversy is appendant or appurtenant to twenty acres; for if so, it must be admitted that the words in the sheriff\u2019s deed are sufficiently comprehensive to pass the interest. About the general principles of this branch of the law, there can be no difficulty. To make a thing appendant or appurtenant, it must agree in quality and nature to the thing whereunto it is appendant or appurtenant; as a thing corporeal cannot properly be appendant to a thing incorporeal, nor a thing incorporeal to a thing corporeal. But things incorporeal which lie in grant, as advowsons, commons and the like, may be appendant to things corporeal, as a manor, house or land; or things corporeal to things incorporeal, as lands to an office. But yet, as has been said, they must agree in nature and quality. <em>Co. Lilt. </em>121, <em>b. </em>And although lands cannot in general be appurtenant to land, yet the parties may, by express words of intention, or by their conduct, as using the one as parcel of the other, make the one appendant or appurtenant to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Thus, although, by the grant of a messuage <em>cum terris pertinentiis, </em>land occupied continually with the house passes, though land is not properly appurtenant to a house; yet it has been ruled, that by the grant of land <em>cum pertinentiis, </em>another house or land does <em>not </em>pass, <em>unless it be found to be parcel. </em>4 <em>Com.

Rep. </em>443 ; 3 <em>Rawle </em>271; 1 <em>Johns. Cha. </em>284.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">In the case at bar, the right was never exercised by William Ben-net, nor was the privilege of raising ore ever enjoyed by him or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>other person, as an appurtenance to the twenty acres; it cannot therefore, on that ground, be considered as parcel thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Nor can it pass as an incident to the twenty acres, as a thing appepdant or appurtenant may sometimes pass, without saying <em>cum </em>pertinentiis; <em>Co. Litt. </em>307; 5 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle </em>107; 3 <em>Rawle </em>271; for however convenient it might be to own both, yet the right to the one is by no means necessary to the enjoyment of the other. It is' said that it was the object of William Bennet to obtain a monopoly of the iron ore, for the supply of a furnace of which he was the owner at the mouth of the Codorus cieek. And if this be so, the object is attained by the ownership of both; and the argument would rather tend to show that the twenty acres and the right in question were appurtenances to the furnace. It is a practice by no means uncommon for the owners of iron works to purchase land in , fee simple, and wood-leave on lands adjoining. Now it never has I been thought that the privilege in the one case was appurtenant to the I right to the other, and that a conveyance of the one, either with or j without the word appurtenances, carried with it the right to the I other; although the conveyance of the iron works, when it had been I held as parcel, might, under particular circumstances, have that I effect. But although these are the general rules, yet these rules, like all others, are subject to exceptions, arising from the clear, manifest intention of the parties; and this makes it necessary to examine the contract of the 19th of September 1768, and the deed of the 6th of March 1769, from David Forree to William Bennet. This is the foundation of the defendants\u2019 title; and unless it is made an appurtenance by these instruments, the defendants have no title. It appears that at the time this contract was made, William Bennet was the owner of a furnace at the mouth of the Codorus creek. His jntention, thereibrel_jf,.as .to.,,.obtam_an^adequate, supply.of iron .ore.,, for the rise of liis wprks; and this objectTie attains in the usual way, by tb e agre \u00e9 men t o Fc on tract of the 19th of September 1768. The memorandum of the agreement, after particularly describing the twenty acres, the price agreed to be given for the same, proceeds to say: \u201cand the said David Forree hath <em>further </em>agreed to and with the said William Bennet, to give him and his heirs privilege to dig ore on his other land, for the payment of 6 pence for every ton, if he hath occasion.\u201d In pursuance of this agreement, David Forree made a deed to William Bennet, of the 6th of March 1763, In this deed he conveys to him, for the consideration of 147 pounds, in fee, a title to twenty acres and its appurtenances; and then follow these words: \u201cand the aforesaid David Forree, for himself, his heirs, executors and administrators, doth covenant, promise, grant and agree, to and with the said William Bennet, his heirs and assigns, that he the said William Bennet, his heirs and assigns, shall and may from time to time, and at all times hereafter, dig, take and carry away all iron ore to be found within the bounds of the said David Forree\u2019s tract of land, containing two hundred and eighty-two acres, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>provided, the said William Bennet, his heirs and assigns, pay to the said David Forree, his heirs and assigns, the <em>sum of </em>6 pence Pennsylvania currency per ton, for every ton taken from the premises of ttvo hundred and eighty-two acres aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The deed is a consummation of this contract, and it is, in some respects, more comprehensive than the article. It is a grant of twenty acres of land in fee simple, and also a grant, of an incorporeal hereditament, for a distinct and diffeient consideration, in the remaining part <em>of the tract of two </em>hundred and eighty-two acres. The right to raise ore is an incorporeal hereditament, granted for a valuable consideration, and is not, as has been contended, a license revocable at the will of the parties. The grantee, his heirs and assigns, have a right to enter, on a payment of the stipulated sum per ton, from time to time, and at all times hereafter. It is an easement, an incumbrance on the land; and, like a mortgage or judgment, the land passes into the hands of an alienee of the grantor, subject to the lien or incumbrance. There is a sufficient consideration for the contract, and I cannot agree with the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, that an alienee of the grantor can be in any better situation than the grantor. It is part of his title. But although these positions are conceded to the defendants\u2019 counsel, yet I am at a loss <em>to see any </em>clear intention to make the one appurtenant to the other. It would be a strained! presumption to infer this intention from the fact that they are included in the same deed, or from the warranty in the deed, which is onlyt necessary, and which, properly construed, only embraces the con- i veyance in fee simple of the twenty acres; nor can this be gathered 1 from the use of the word <em>appurtenances </em>in connexion with the I twenty acres, which is but the usual formulary in the conveyance of real estate. &lt;</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">From a mature consideration of the article of agreement and the deed, we are clearly of the opinion that the right and privilege to take iron ore in the two hundred and eigty-two acres, was a distinct and independent covenant, having no relation to the conveyance of the twenty acres. It certainly is not expressly said to be appurtenant to the twenty acres. Although there might be, under particular circumstances, something in the argument that it was appurtenant to the furnace, there is no reason for holding that it is appurtenant to the twenty acres. This intention cannot, by any natural construction, be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
