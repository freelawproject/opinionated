Watson for reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees under section 593(f) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 591-599, and it appearing to the Court for the reasons more fully set forth in the opinion filed contemporaneously herewith, that the motion is not well taken, it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b671-26\">ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that the petition of Samuel J.

Watson, a former deputy national security advisor to then-Vice President George Bush, requests reimbursement for $18,100.00 in attorneys\u2019 fees incurred as a result of the Iran/Contra investigation conducted by Inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>pendent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh. The Act authorizes this court to reimburse the \u201csubject\u201d of an Independent Counsel investigation against whom no indictment is brought for \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred ... during th[e] investigation which would not have been incurred but for the requirements of [the Act].\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1). Because Watson\u2019s attorney did not submit contemporaneous time records to support the application, we disallow Watson\u2019s petition in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">On December 19, 1986, this court appointed Independent Counsel Walsh \u201cto investigate ... alleged violations of federal criminal laws ... in connection -with the sale or shipment of military arms to Iran and the transfer or diversion of funds realized in connection with such sale or shipment.\u201d <em>In re North (Shultz Fee Application), </em>8 F.3d 847, 849 (D.C.Cir.1993) (per curiam). Col. Watson served as a deputy national security ad-visor to then-Vice President George Bush during the time that the events constituting the substantive basis of the Iran/Contra matter took place. By virtue of his position, Watson acted as a cooperating witness in the Independent Counsel investigation in 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">On August 3, 1990, the Independent Counsel asked Watson to communicate with him. Watson then retained Jacob Stein, of the Washington, D.C. firm Stein, Mitchell, and Mezines, as counsel. On September 28,1990, the Independent Counsel expressly advised Watson that he was a \u201csubject\u201d of that investigation. Watson then made a series of appearances before a federal grand jury. No indictment was brought against Watson.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Believing that Watson would have difficulty paying his legal bills in full, Stein devised a rather unique billing system. Stein did not maintain contemporaneous records of the time he incurred representing Watson. Instead, he allowed Watson to record the time that they spent together on the case. At the conclusion of the Iran/Contra investigation, Stein billed Watson for that time at a slightly discounted hourly rate. Watson, in turn, has petitioned this court for reimbursement of these fees under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">To recover attorneys\u2019 fees under the Act, Watson must establish that he incurred such fees while he was a \u201csubject\u201d of the Independent Counsel investigation, that no indictment was brought against him, that he would not have incurred fees \u201cbut for the [Act\u2019s] requirements,\u201d and that the fees were reasonable. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 598(f)(1). We need consider only the requirement of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">By necessity, assessing the reasonableness of attorneys\u2019 fees includes evaluating the reasonableness of attorney time expended. <em>See In re Meese, </em>907 F.2d 1192, 1201 (D.C.Cir.1990) (per curiam). In order to enable such an evaluation to take place, \u201c[attorneys who anticipate making a fee application must maintain contemporaneous, complete and standardized time records which accurately reflect the work done by each attorney.\u201d <em>In re Donovan, </em>877 F.2d 982, 994 (D.C.Cir.1989) (per curiam) (quoting <em>National Ass\u2019n of Concerned Veterans v. Secretary of Defense, </em>675 F.2d 1319, 1326 (D.C.Cir.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">Here, Watson\u2019s attorney has not produced, nor did he even maintain, any contemporaneous records reflecting the work he performed on his client\u2019s behalf. Instead, he relied on Watson\u2019s records of the time they spent together, which Watson constructed from his appointment calendar. The resulting lack of detail is palpable but not surprising. Watson\u2019s application is replete with vague references to the time and subject matter of his meetings with Stein, and even he concedes that the duration of each meeting is only an estimate. \u201c \u2018[C]asual after-the-fact estimates of time expended on a case are insufficient to support an award of attorneys\u2019 fees.\u2019 \u201d <em>Donovan, </em>877 F.2d at 994 (quoting <em>National Ass\u2019n of Concerned Veterans, </em>675 F.2d at 1326). We cannot begin to evaluate the reasonableness of attorney time expended. We therefore must deny the petition <em>in toto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">Watson observes that in previous cases this court has disallowed only a portion of attorneys\u2019 fees based on insufficient supporting detail. <em>See, e.g., Meese, </em>907 F.2d at 1204 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>(disallowing ten percent of fee petition based on inadequate documentation). The attorneys in <em>Meese </em>maintained and submitted contemporaneous records of the time they expended, even though some entries were inadequate. <em>See id. </em>Watson\u2019s attorney maintained no contemporaneous record at all. This failure is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Moreover, Watson appears not to owe his attorney the fees for which he seeks reimbursement. In a statement submitted to this court by Col. Watson and his attorney, Jacob A. Stein, Esq., they stated: \u201cIt is and was the understanding of Col. Watson and his counsel that Col. Watson would pay for legal services when his personal circumstances permit such payment.\u201d Apparently Col. Watson\u2019s \u201cpersonal circumstances\u201d presently do not permit payment of fees; therefore, he is not obligated to pay such fees. This arrangement does not satisfy the Act\u2019s requirement that fees be \u201cincurred\u201d by the applicant. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">We therefore hold that Watson cannot recover attorney fees under the Act. Stein\u2019s generosity toward his client is commendable, but it is not reimbursable. Accordingly, we deny Watson\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
