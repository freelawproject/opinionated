Wright\u2019s son was killed in an automobile accident that occurred when he and a friend left a voluntary summer school session at North Clayton High School in violation of school rules. At the time of his death, Daniel was fifteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-19\">The first issue Wright presents on appeal is whether the district court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on her claim that the defendants are liable under section 1983 for violating her son\u2019s substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by intentionally failing to enforce policies designed to protect the health, safety, and well-being of students. This court reviews grants of summary judgment <em>de novo. RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. United States, </em>955 F.2d 1457, 1459 (11th Cir.1992). We must determine whether after discovery, there remained a genuine triable issue of fact or whether the movant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Kee v. National Reserve Life Ins. Co., </em>918 F.2d 1538, 1540 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-20\">The district court held that the school had no constitutional duty to protect Daniel because he was not in its \u201ccustody\u201d and because his death was caused not by the school but by a private actor with no \u201cspecial relationship\u201d to the school. Wright argues that the school did owe Daniel a constitutional duty to prevent him from leaving school in an automobile during school hours because of a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between schools and school children.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>The substantive component of the Due Process Clause protects only those rights that are fundamental. <em>McKinney v. Pate, </em>20 F.3d 1550, 1556 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc). Substantive due process rights are created only by the Constitution, not by state laws. <em>Id. </em>Hence, tort law remains largely outside the scope of substantive due process jurisprudence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">\u201c[N]othing in the language of the Due Process Clause itself requires the State to protect the life, liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors. The Clause is phrased as a limitation on the State\u2019s power to act, not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security.\u201d <em>DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Soc. Servs., </em>489 U.S. 189, 195, 109 S.Ct. 998, 1003, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989). In <em>DeShaney, </em>the Supreme Court expressly rejected the argument that a constitutional duty of protection can arise from a state\u2019s \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with a particular individual where the state played no part in creating the danger posed to the individual. <em>Id. </em>at 197, 109 S.Ct. at 1004. However, the Court did concede that a duty of protection can arise where the state has placed an individual in danger by depriving him of the liberty to protect himself, such as through incarceration in prison or involuntary commitment in a mental institution. <em>Id. </em>at 198-99, 109 S.Ct. at 1004-05.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">[W]hen the State takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will, the Constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and general well-being. ... The affirmative duty to protect arises not from the State\u2019s knowledge of the individual\u2019s predicament or from its expressions of intent to help him, but from the limitation which it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf.... In the substantive due process analysis, it is the State\u2019s affirmative act of restraining the individual\u2019s freedom to act on his own behalf \u2014 through incarceration, institutionalization, or other similar restraint of personal liberty \u2014 which is the \u201cdeprivation of liberty\u201d triggering the protections of the Due Process Clause, not its failure to act to protect his liberty interests against harms inflicted by other means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 199-200, 109 S.Ct. at 1005-06 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Despite the Supreme Court\u2019s firm rejection of the special relationship argument in <em>DeShaney, </em>Wright argues that the school had a constitutional duty to protect Daniel by virtue of the special relationship between schools and school children. To date, every federal circuit court of appeal to address the question of whether compulsory school attendance laws create the necessary custodial relationship between school and student to give rise to a constitutional duty to protect students from harm by non-state actors has rejected the existence of any such duty. <em>See Dorothy J. v. Little Bock School Dist., </em>7 F.3d 729 (8th Cir.1993); <em>D.R. v. Middle Bucks Area Vocational Technical School, </em>972 F.2d 1364 (3d Cir.1992) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 1045, 122 L.Ed.2d 354 (1993); <em>Maldonado v. Josey, </em>975 F.2d 727 (10th Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 1266, 122 L.Ed.2d 662 (1993); and <em>J.O. v. Alton Community Unit School Dist. 11, </em>909 F.2d 267 (7th Cir.1990). According to these circuits, mere compulsory attendance laws do not result in the level of custody envisioned by the Supreme Court in <em>DeSha-ney. </em>These circuits reason that mandatory attendance at a public high school simply does not restrict one\u2019s liberty in the same sense that incarceration in prison or involuntary commitment in a mental institution does. In contrast, a school child and the child\u2019s parents retain the liberty to provide for the child\u2019s basic needs. Because Daniel\u2019s attendance at summer school was voluntary and not compulsory, we need not, and do not, decide whether mandatory school attendance laws impose a constitutional duty on schools to protect students from injury by third parties. However, we find that the reasons given by our sister circuits for the absence of such a duty when school attendance is mandatory are even more compelling when school attendance is voluntary. Therefore, we hold that Daniel\u2019s voluntary school attendance did not create a custodial relationship between himself and the school sufficient to give rise to a constitutional duty of protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Even if Daniel was in the school\u2019s custody as defined in <em>DeShaney, </em>the school did not violate his substantive due process rights. Daniel\u2019s tragic death did not in any way result from the school\u2019s restraint on his liberty to protect himself. In fact, his death resulted at best from the school\u2019s failure to restrain his personal liberty. Daniel\u2019s death resulted from his own choice to leave the school in violation of the school\u2019s policies. The school did not make him leave or prevent him from remaining safely at school. On the contrary, it took measures to keep students at school during school hours. The mere fact that the school\u2019s gratuitous efforts to keep Daniel at school failed does not constitute a violation of Daniel\u2019s substantive due process rights. In addition, even if Daniel was initially in the school\u2019s custody, he had unquestionably departed from that custody at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Even absent the type of custody discussed in <em>DeShaney, </em>however, it is still possible under very narrow circumstances that a duty of protection may arise by virtue of a special relationship. This circuit has held that \u201cgovernment officials may be held liable for the deprivation by a third party of a private citizen\u2019s due process rights when a special relationship is found to exist between the victim and the third party or between the victim and the government officials.\u201d <em>Cornelius v. Town of Highland Lake, </em>880 F.2d 348, 352-53 (11th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>494 U.S. 1066, 110 S.Ct. 1784, 108 L.Ed.2d 785 (1990).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cWhen the duty which arises by virtue of the special relationship is coupled with some degree of culpable conduct on the defendant\u2019s part, \u00a7 1983 liability attaches.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353. It is the special relationship that establishes the required nexus between the plaintiffs alleged due process violation and the government officials\u2019 conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 353 &amp; n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">On the facts of this case, there is no such special relationship between the school and Daniel. First, as discussed in <em>DeShaney, </em>489 U.S. at 197, 109 S.Ct. at 1004, and <em>Cornelius, 880 </em>F.2d at 356, there can be no nexus or special relationship between Daniel and the school where the school did not create the dangerous situation or render Daniel more vulnerable to it. The school did not cause Daniel to suffer an automobile accident. Rather, it merely failed to save Daniel from an automobile accident, a danger faced by all of us in our daily lives. Second, it is implicit in our holding that voluntary school attendance does not give rise to a constitutional duty of protection that the mere consensual relationship of school to school children, without more, does not constitute a \u201cspecial relationship.\u201d <em>See Dorothy J., </em>7 F.3d at 734 (holding that compulsory attendance laws create neither a custodial nor a special relationship). The voluntary school to school children relationship simply does not give the school the requisite degree of control over the school children to give rise to a duty of protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">In sum, the school did not violate Daniel\u2019s substantive due process rights and, accordingly, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants on this claim is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">The second issue raised by Wright is whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants on Wright\u2019s claim that the defendants violated Daniel\u2019s procedural due process rights. Wright\u2019s arguments on this issue are totally without merit and warrant no further discussion. The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the procedural due process claim is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A88\">Finally, Wright appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants on her claim that the latter violated Wright\u2019s substantive due process rights by depriving her of a liberty interest in her parent-child relationship. Given that this claim is based on the same operative facts as Daniel\u2019s substantive due process claim and that we have already concluded that Daniel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>substantive due process rights were not violated, it necessarily follows that the substantive due process rights of Daniel\u2019s mother were not violated either.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">In conclusion, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-6\">. We note that there is some doubt whether our holding in <em>Cornelius </em>has survived the Supreme Court's recent holding in <em>Collins v. City of Harker Heights, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 1070-71, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992), that a voluntary employment relationship, standing alone, does not impose a constitutional duty on governmental employers to provide a reasonably safe work environment. Because we hold that the present case is distinguishable from <em>Cornelius, </em>we do not purport to decide today the continuing validity of that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
