We affirm the decision of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">Theodore Shanbaum is a beneficiary of the Lee Optical and Associated Companies Pension Plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d), a qualified pension plan under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d). Shanbaum retired in 1978 and began receiving pension benefits. In 1991, the Plan was terminated and PBGC was appointed trustee of the Plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 24, 1991 the Plan\u2019s prior trustee notified Shanbaum that his pension would be reduced to the Title IV guaranteed amount. Shanbaum began receiving an estimated monthly pension benefit of approximately $734.00 from the PBGC, pending an initial determination of his guaranteed benefit. Shanbaum has not yet received his initial benefit determination from PBGC.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-18\">On October 17,1992, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) levied upon Shanbaum\u2019s pension benefits in order to collect his unpaid income taxes for tax years 1974 through 1982, excluding 1979. The levy was served on State Street Bank of Massachusetts, PBGC\u2019s paying agent. Since the levy, Shanbaum has not received any of his monthly pension benefits because they are being paid to the IRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-19\">Shanbaum filed suit against the United States seeking damages and declaratory relief on the grounds that the IRS levy violated ERISA. Shanbaum also filed a claim against PBGC alleging that PBGC paid him less than the full amount of his guaranteed pension benefit under the Plan and that PBGC improperly honored the IRS notice of levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-20\">PBGC moved to dismiss Shanbaum\u2019s complaint, and the district court granted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>motion on the grounds that Shanbaum had not exhausted his administrative remedies regarding the amount of his guaranteed benefit. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2606.7 (\u201c[A] person aggrieved by an initial determination of the PBGC ... has not exhausted his or her administrative remedies until he or she has filed a request for reconsideration ... or an appeal ... and a decision granting or denying the relief requested has been issued.\u201d). Shanbaum has not appealed this issue. Issues not raised by the appellant are normally not considered on appeal, and, in any event, the district court\u2019s ruling on this issue was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In its order dismissing Shanbaum\u2019s cause against PBGC, the lower court did not address the merits of Shanbaum\u2019s claim that PBGC breached its fiduciary duty to protect Plan assets from levy by the IRS. However, since this Court reviews de novo a dismissal of a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, <em>Bradley v. Barnes, </em>989 F.2d 802, 804 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Fernandez-Montes v. Allied Pilots Ass\u2019n, </em>987 F.2d 278, 284 (5th Cir.1993), we may consider whether Shanbaum\u2019s claim also supports the lower court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The Government moved to dismiss, or alternatively for summary judgment, contending that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the Government had not waived sovereign immunity for the action. Additionally, the Government asserted that the facts alleged by the taxpayer did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Shanbaum also filed a motion for summary judgment claiming that the United States had waived sovereign immunity pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1340 and 1346, and section 7426 of the Internal Revenue Code. The district court found no waiver of sovereign immunity and granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">We initially turn to Shanbaum\u2019s claim against the United States. The district court was correct in holding that Shanbaum is barred from bringing suit because the Government has not waived sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">The United States may not be sued except to the extent it has consented to such by statute. <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 399, 96 S.Ct. 948, 953-54, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976); <em>Smith v. Booth, </em>823 F.2d 94, 96 (5th Cir.1987). A waiver of sovereign immunity cannot be implied, but must be unequivocally expressed. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>445 U.S. 535, 538, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 1351-52, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Shanbaum\u2019s reliance on 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132 is misplaced. Although this section gives plan participants the right to bring civil actions to redress violations of ERISA, this section does not provide a waiver of sovereign immunity which would permit the suit to be brought against the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Similarly, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 is a general jurisdiction statute and does not provide a general waiver of sovereign immunity. <em>Voluntary Purchasing Groups, Inc. v. Reilly, </em>889 F.2d 1380, 1385 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">Shanbaum\u2019s assertion that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 provides a waiver of sovereign immunity is also without merit. Section 1346 is a general jurisdiction statute that does not constitute a separate waiver of sovereign immunity. <em>Standard Acceptance Co. v. United States, </em>342 F.Supp. 45, 47 (N.D.Ill.1972). Section 1346 operates in conjunction with 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422 to provide a waiver of sovereign immunity in tax refund suits only when the taxpayer has fully paid the tax and filed an administrative claim for a refund. Neither of these jurisdictional prerequisites to a refund suit has been met in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">Finally, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426 does not support Shanbaum\u2019s contention that the government waived sovereign immunity. Section 7426 expressly provides that only a person other than the taxpayer (the person against whom is assessed the tax out of which the levy arose) who has an interest in or lien on the property at issue may bring a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>civil action for wrongful levy of the property. Shanbaum argues that he is only a nominal plaintiff bringing suit on behalf of the Plan, and he characterizes the property at issue as the Plan\u2019s assets rather than his pension benefits. His position is without merit. The IRS did not levy on Plan assets; the levy was served on PBGC\u2019s paying agent to collect the taxpayer\u2019s monthly pension benefits as they become due. Shanbaum, the taxpayer, instituted this suit specifically requesting to recover the loss of the benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Even if Shanbaum could overcome the jurisdictional issue, he would still not prevail against the Government on the merits because his underlying claim is based solely on the erroneous contention that the IRS levy violated ERISA. In order for a pension plan to be qualified under ERISA, it must state that \u201cbenefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(1). Shanbaum\u2019s pension plan complied with this requirement. On the basis of this non-alienation provision, Shanbaum attempts to argue that his pension benefits are exempt from levy by the IRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Section 6321 of the Internal Revenue Code creates a lien for unpaid taxes in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to the property of the taxpayer. Under section 6331, the IRS is authorized to levy upon all property and rights to property belonging to the taxpayer in order to collect his assessed income tax liabilities. <em>See generally United States v. National Bank of Commerce, </em>472 U.S. 713, 105 S.Ct. 2919, 86 L.Ed.2d 565 (1985). Section 6334, which specifically exempts certain property from levy, does not exempt pension plan benefits from collection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, section 6334(c) provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">Notwithstanding any other law of the United States (including section 207 of the Social Security Act), no property or rights to property shall be exempt from levy other than the property specifically made exempt by subsection (a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">ERISA also provides that it shall not be \u201cconstrued to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or supersede any law of the United States ... or any rule or regulation issued under any such law.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(d). Reading the unambiguous language of Internal Revenue Code section 6334(e) with the mandate contained in section 1144(d) of ERISA, Shanbaum\u2019s argument that the IRS levy authority yields to the later enacted non-alienation provision is without merit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">The lower court\u2019s dismissal of Shanbaum\u2019s suit against PBGC may also be upheld on the basis that PBGC did not breach any fiduciary duty to Shanbaum or to the Plan. Shan-baum contends that PBGC breached its fiduciary duty by not contesting the \u201cwrongful and illegal levy.\u201d This contention fails because, as shown above, the IRS levy on Shanbaum\u2019s pension benefits was not wrongful or illegal. <em>See Quinn v. IRS, </em>84-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) \u00b6 9337, 1984 WL 25 (E.D.La. 1984) (holding trustees of employee welfare plan have no standing under \u00a7 7426 to attack IRS levies against benefits to employee-participants under the plan and any person who complies with a levy is discharged from liability to the delinquent taxpayer).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">Since Shanbaum\u2019s suit against the United States is barred under the doctrine of sover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>eign immunity and since the IRS levy was neither wrongful nor illegal, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Shanbaum\u2019s actions against the United States and PBGC.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-13\">. PBGC is a wholly-owned United States government corporation established under ERISA to administer the mandatory pension plan termination insurance program in Title IV. Under the insurance program, PBGC guarantees the payment to participants of certain pension benefits described in and limited by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322 in the event a covered pension plan terminates with insufficient assets to pay for those benefits. If a covered pension plan terminates without sufficient funds to pay benefits, PBGC generally becomes trustee of the plan under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\">. The only waiver of sovereign immunity found in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132 is found in \u00a7 1132(k), allowing specific actions against the Secretary of Labor of which this action clearly is not one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b247-6\">. Section 6334(a)(6) exempts certain pension rights, but the pension benefits at issue in this case are not among them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\">. Indeed, the applicable Treasury Regulation provides that pension benefits are not protected from federal tax levies. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.402(a)-13(b)(2)(ii) (plan provisions satisfying the requirements of the general rule against assignment and alienation of benefits do not preclude enforcement of a federal tax levy made pursuant to section 6331). Other courts have come to the same conclusion. <em>See In re Raihl, </em>152 B.R. 615, 618 (9th Cir. BAP 1993); <em>Ameritrust Co. v. Derakhshan, </em>830 F.Supp. 406, 410 (N.D.Ohio 1993); <em>Hyde v. United States, </em>93-2 U.S. Tax Cas.
