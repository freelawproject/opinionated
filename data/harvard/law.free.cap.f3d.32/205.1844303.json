(\u201cOrtiz\u201d) seeks review of the district court\u2019s determination of the priority of payment to defendants from the interpleaded funds (the \u201cFund\u201d). Although Ortiz itself continues to disavow any stake in the Fund, it urges that it was injured financially by the priority determined by the district court for distributing shares in the Fund to Ortiz\u2019s creditors. Ortiz insists that, as a result of the sequence of distribution decreed by the court, Ortiz will be exposed to greater liability if it should ever file for bankruptcy or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>have to indemnify its officers for any payments that they might be required to make personally to cover the company\u2019s unpaid federal tax obligations. We conclude that, as such injuries are merely conjectural and hypothetical, they are insufficient to establish constitutional standing. We therefore dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">This case concerns the sequence or priority of payments to various creditors of Ortiz from $189,850.69,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which Plaintiff-Counter Defendant Rohm &amp; Hass Texas, Inc. (\u201cRohm\u201d) deposited into the registry of the district court when Rohm convoked the instant interpleader action. The Fund represents money concededly owed by Rohm to Ortiz, one of Rohm\u2019s contractors, for labor and materials supplied to a maintenance and repair project at a Rohm facility in Deer Park, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">After Rohm filed this suit, three of Ortiz\u2019s creditors made competing claims to the Fund: (1) the IRS, claiming that Ortiz owed a tax debt of $245,673.61; (2) Thorpe Products Co. (\u201cThorpe\u201d), a materialman claiming that Ortiz owed it $98,290.09 for supplies used in performing the Rohm construction contract; and (3) MetroBank, N.A. (\u201cMetro-Bank\u201d), a creditor with a perfected security interest in $80,861.30 of Ortiz\u2019s collateral and accounts receivable. Ortiz claimed no stake in the Fund, but argued that the claim of the IRS was superior in rank to that of Thorpe. The district court disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">Ruling on cross motions for summary judgment, the district court ranked the IRS\u2019 claim last among the competing creditors. As the Fund was insufficient to satisfy all superior claims (plus attorney\u2019s fees),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the IRS took nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">After judgment was entered, both the IRS and Ortiz filed notices of appeal; but subsequently the IRS successfully moved to dismiss its appeal and no longer asserts a claim against the Fund. Still asserting no claim to the Fund, Ortiz continues to argue that the IRS\u2019 claim should be superior in rank to Thorpe\u2019s. MetroBank and Thorpe have moved to dismiss Ortiz\u2019s appeal for lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">A. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">\u201cIn ruling on a motion to dismiss for want of standing, both the trial and reviewing courts must accept as true all material allegations of the complaint, and must construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that, even when viewed in this most favorable light, Ortiz\u2019s asserted injuries are insufficient to give it standing to appeal the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-16\">B. Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b271-17\">Article III standing implicates the federal judiciary\u2019s power to adjudicate disputes; it can be neither waived<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> nor as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>sumed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Merely because a party appears in the district court proceedings does not mean that the party automatically has standing to appeal the judgment rendered by that court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Whether a party has standing to appeal \u201cinvolves both constitutional limitations on federal-court jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5v\">In its constitutional dimension, standing imports justiciability: whether the plaintiff has made out a \u2018case or controversy\u2019 between himself and the defendant within the meaning of Article III.... The Article III judicial power exists only to redress or otherwise to protect against injury to the complaining party.... A federal court\u2019s jurisdiction therefore can be invoked only when the plaintiff himself has suffered \u2018some threatened or actual injury from the putatively illegal action.\u2019<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">Accordingly, a party generally may not appeal a district court\u2019s order to champion the rights of another,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and even \u201c[a]n indirect financial stake in another party\u2019s claims is insufficient to create standing on appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, \u201c[t]he injury or threat of injury must be both \u2018real and immediate\u2019 not \u2018conjectural\u2019 or \u2018hypothetical,\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the putative appellant shoulders the burden of alleging facts sufficient to demonstrate that it is a proper party to appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>C. Ortiz\u2019s Alleged INJURIES</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Conceding that it claims no interest in the Fund, Ortiz maintains that it nevertheless has standing to appeal the district court order because the priority of distribution of the Fund among Ortiz\u2019s creditors might affect Ortiz\u2019s liability should the company eventually (1) file for bankruptcy, or (2) have to indemnify its officers if they should ever be required personally to pay on the company\u2019s tax liability.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In particular, Ortiz explains that it is aggrieved by the district court judgment\u2019s assigning the priority in which its creditors are to be paid from the Fund, as Ortiz\u2019s debt to one creditor, Thorpe, is fully dischargeable in bankruptcy,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> while its debt to another, the IRS, is not.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, Ortiz raises the inchoate possibility that the IRS could one day look to Ortiz\u2019s officers for payment of the tax debt.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> And, according to Ortiz, under Texas law the company is <em>required </em>to indemnify its officers for personal liability for the company\u2019s taxes to the extent the officers incur such liability while executing their duties. Ortiz insists therefore that ultimately the company might have to shoulder responsibility by way of indemnification for any taxes collected from company officers by the IRS. It follows, Ortiz concludes, that the district court judgment injured Ortiz financially by assigning the IRS the lowest priority among claimants to the Fund, thereby injuring Ortiz sufficiently to confer standing to appeal. We consider each alleged injury in turn to determine whether either is sufficient to satisfy Article III standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">1. <em>Liability in Bankruptcy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">At the outset, it is important to analyze the precise nature of the injury of which Ortiz complains. Ortiz does not state that it has filed, will file, or even anticipates filing for bankruptcy. Ortiz merely asserts that, as a result of the district court judgment\u2019s ranking the IRS last among Fund claimants, the company <em>might </em>be exposed to greater liability <em>if </em>it ever should elect to declare bankruptcy or be placed in bankruptcy involuntarily. We are convinced, however, that Article III pretermits consideration of such a conjectural and hypothetical injury on appeal \u2014 a conclusion we reach based in large part on analogous decisions by other federal courts of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">In the first instance, it is not even clear whether, after disavowing a stake in the Fund, Ortiz could allege any injury sufficient to give it standing to appeal the sequence or priority for distributing the money to other defendants with recognized claims to shares of the Fund. In <em>Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. </em>Eason,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the Fourth Circuit held that a <em>plaintiff </em>-interpleader who claimed no stake in a fund interpleaded into bankruptcy court lacked standing to appeal the bankruptcy court\u2019s distribution of the fund. In <em>Nationwide, </em>the money was deposited into the registry of a bankruptcy court for the benefit of unpaid creditors of a grain dealer that had filed for bankruptcy. After thus depositing the funds, the plaintiff-inter-pleader asked to be dismissed from the action, but apparently never was. When six months elapsed without any defendant responding to the action, the court entered a default judgment against all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">Subsequently, when the trustee of the bankrupt estate moved to intervene in the interpleader action, alleging that the funds were part of the estate, the plaintiff-inter-pleader asked that the funds be returned to it instead. The bankruptcy court denied the plaintiff-interpleader\u2019s request that the funds be returned, and the plaintiff-interpleader appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">The Fourth Circuit held that the plaintiff-interpleader lacked standing to appeal the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>distribution of the fund because it had previously disavowed any stake in the money. The court noted that \u201c[a]ny challenge to the disposition ultimately made by the bankruptcy court must be by parties with the requisite stake in the outcome.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Here we need not go so far, however, because, even if we assume arguendo that Ortiz might be able to allege an indirect interest in the Fund sufficient to give it standing to appeal, it has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">As Ortiz disavows a direct stake in the Fund, any interest that it asserts necessarily must be indirect. Indeed, injuries far more direct than those here alleged by Ortiz have been found to be too remote to satisfy standing for the purposes of Article III. For example, in <em>Libby, McNeill, &amp; Libby v. City National </em>Bank,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the Ninth Circuit held that a defendant-appellant, City National Bank (\u201cCNB\u201d), lacked standing to appeal a district court\u2019s judgments against a plaintiff-inter-pleader, Libby, McNeill, &amp; Libby (\u201cLibby\u201d), even though those judgments reduced the amount of money that CNB recovered from the interpleader fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Pursuant to a lending agreement, CNB had obtained a security interest in the accounts receivable of Shanghai Instant Foods, Inc. (\u201cShanghai\u201d), a company that produced packaged frozen meals for Libby. The contract between Shanghai and Libby provided that Shanghai would produce meals according to Libby\u2019s specifications and obtain ingredients and materials from suppliers either recommended or approved by Libby.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Subsequent to entering into this contract, some suppliers notified Libby that Shanghai had stopped paying for its deliveries, and shortly thereafter, Shanghai filed for bankruptcy. While the bankruptcy proceedings were pending, Libby commenced an inter-pleader action in district court, depositing into the court\u2019s registry the net sum it owed Shanghai and naming as defendants the trustee in bankruptcy, various unpaid suppliers, and CNB.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">CNB was the only defendant to allege an interest in the fund, but some unpaid suppliers counterclaimed, alleging that Libby was liable to them in contract for deliveries provided to Shanghai. The district court found for the suppliers on their counterclaims, but permitted Libby to offset the amount of these judgments against Libby\u2019s obligation to Shanghai. As a result, the amount of money in the interpleader fund was reduced by the sum of these offsets. Libby did not appeal these adverse judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">As the sole beneficiary of the interpleaded fund, CNB sought to appeal, inter alia, the suppliers\u2019 judgments against Libby. The Ninth Circuit, however, held that CNB lacked standing to appeal these adverse judgments, even though the amount of CNB\u2019s recovery from the fund was reduced by the amount of these judgments. The court expressly recognized that \u201cthis is not the simple case where the outcome of the appeal can have absolutely no effect on the interests of the appellant,\u201d but noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>CNB nevertheless had \u201cno <em>direct interest </em>in the counterclaims of [other defendants].\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Recognizing that an appellant\u2019s interest \u201cmust be immediate and pecuniary and not a remote consequence of the judgment,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the court held that CNB lacked an appealable interest in the judgments against Libby. In the instant case, Ortiz\u2019s asserted injury\u2014 greater potential liability should it ever file for bankruptcy \u2014 is far more attenuated than the injury claimed by CNB in <em>Libby.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">2. <em>Indemnification of Ortiz\u2019s Officers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Ortiz\u2019s other alleged injury is similarly speculative and remote. Ortiz claims injury as a consequence of the court\u2019s rankings because the company\u2019s federal tax debt was not reduced by the amount in the Fund, given the court\u2019s assignment of the lowest priority to the IRS. Ortiz does not dispute the existence or amount of its debt to the IRS. Rather, Ortiz merely complains that, should the IRS ever look past the company to its officers for satisfaction of this tax debt, then these officers will be hable for a larger amount; and, as Ortiz posits that Texas law requires it to indemnify its officers under such circumstances, the company will ultimately have to pay more in indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">First, Ortiz misstates Texas law: Corporations are not <em>required </em>to indemnify officers from such liability \u2014 they are merely <em>permitted </em>to do so.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As Ortiz has not alleged that it took the steps necessary to indemnify its officers, the record is devoid of facts showing that the company would be legally responsible to indemnify its officers for any ultimate liability they incur for the corporation\u2019s tax debts.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">Second, as with its allegations of liability in bankruptcy, even if we assume arguendo that Ortiz would owe indemnity to its officers, its argument is completely speculative. Ortiz presents no evidence that the IRS has looked, anticipates looking, or even could look to the corporation\u2019s officers to satisfy Ortiz\u2019s tax debt.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In short, Ortiz has failed utterly to demonstrate that any action by the IRS against company officers is a real or immediate likelihood or how such an action would adversely affect the company in the least. Finally, we must note that Ortiz\u2019s concern regarding indemnification rings hollow when even this remote possibility of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>demnification could not arise unless the company should fail to pay its own tax debt in the first place.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">As we find that D efendant-App ellant Ortiz has failed to allege an injury sufficiently real and immediate to satisfy the requirements for standing under Article III, this appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-8\">. As of July 23, 1993, the day judgment was entered, the Fund contained $193,603.70, which included principal plus interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-9\">. On August 26, 1993, the court ordered the Fund to be distributed as follows: Thorpe's ma-terialman\u2019s lien, $20,755.86 and $7,843.75 in attorney\u2019s fees; MetroBank\u2019s security interest, $80,861.30, $1,300.00 in interest, and $7,756.52 in attorney's fees; and the remainder of the fund, $75,086.27, was paid in partial satisfaction of Thorpe's trust fund claim of $77,534.23. As the distribution accounted for interest accrued only as of July 23, 1993, Thorpe and MetroBank were ordered to share the interest earned after that date in the ratio of 54/46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b271-19\">. <em>Worth v.
