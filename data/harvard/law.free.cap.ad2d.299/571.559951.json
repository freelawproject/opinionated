After reviewing the presentence investigation report, County Court refused to honor the plea agreement. Defendant nevertheless declined the opportunity to withdraw his plea, and the court thereafter sentenced him to lVs to 4 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>We reject defendant\u2019s contention that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive. A sentence that is within the permissible statutory range will not be disturbed unless the sentencing court abused its discretion or extraordinary circumstances exist warranting a modification <em>(see People v Spencer, </em>272 AD2d 682, <em>lv denied </em>95 NY2d 858; <em>People v Dolphy, </em>257 AD2d 681, <em>lv denied </em>93 NY2d 872). Here, the presentence investigation report chronicles defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history, which dates back to 1978. Although defendant received the maximum sentence permissible by statute <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 70.00), we find neither a clear abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances warranting a modification of the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\">Cardona, P.J., Crew III, Peters, Carpinello and Kane, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
