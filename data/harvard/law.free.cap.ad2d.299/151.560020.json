Under the Penal Law, Supreme Court was limited to imposing a term of imprisonment, which combined with probation, would not total more than five years <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 60.01 [2] [d]; \u00a7 65.00 [3] [a] [i]; <em>People v </em>Ladd, 224 AD2d 881, 883, <em>affd </em>89 NY2d 893; <em>People v Montgomery, </em>115 AD2d 102, 103).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The trial court\u2019s imposition of a one-year sentence for the alleged violation of probation was void because the declaration of delinquency was filed after the imposed term of probation had expired. Therefore, the plea and sentence for the parole violation should be vacated and the declaration of delinquency dismissed.
