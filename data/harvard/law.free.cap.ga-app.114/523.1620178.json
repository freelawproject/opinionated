The defendant, along with other motorists, was stopped and a trooper asked to see his license. The defendant first professed that he had left his billfold at home when another trooper recognized the defendant as having had his license revoked and arrested him. The defendant was then asked how much liquor he had and was told that the trooper would have to search his automobile. To this the defendant stated: \u201cThere\u2019s no use searching. I got almost three cases of red liquor. You can go ahead and search.\u201d The trooper then opened the trunk of the automobile where the liquor was located. The defendant, in his unsworn statement, confirmed the above facts with the following explanation. When asked if he had any liquor he remained silent, and when told of the proposed search he replied: \u201cThere\u2019s the car is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aomt\">The original arrest did not constitute an illegal arrest. See Ga. L. 1937, p. 322; Ga. L. 1951, p. 598 <em>(Code Ann. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 92A-9906, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>92A-9907). <em>Tanner v. State, </em>114 Ga. App. 35 (150 SE2d 189). Therefore, the search was not in connection with an illegal arrest but was rather after a legal arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u201cWhere permission is voluntarily granted by one under legal arrest to search the premises on which the arrest is made, the search is legal and evidence obtained as a result of such search is admissible, although in connection with another crime than that for which the defendant was originally arrested. Harris v. U.S., 331 U.S. 145 (67 SC 1098, 91 LE 1399).\u201d <em>Barron v. State, </em>109 Ga. App. 786 (2) (137 SE2d 690). The testimony of the State as well as the defendant\u2019s unsworn statement showed permission to search the automobile was given. The statement of the defendant: \u201cThere\u2019s the car is,\u201d could only mean go ahead and search the car. Accordingly, the enumerations of error based upon illegal search and seizure and illegal arrest are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Enumeration of error number 6 complains that the trial court erred in admitting testimony that the defendant did not have a valid driver\u2019s license at the time he stopped for the \u201clicense check.\u201d The defendant in his unsworn statement admitted that he did not have a license when stopped by the patrol. Therefore, the admission of such evidence, if error, was not harmful error. See <em>Shelley v. State, </em>108 Ga. App. 6 (2) (132 SE2d 228), and citations.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Under Rule 17 (c) (2) of this court, enumerations of error not supported in the brief by citations of authority or argument shall be deemed to have been abandoned. The seventh enumeration of error is not mentioned in the appellant\u2019s brief and must be considered as having been abandoned. See <em>Wall v. Rhodes, </em>112 Ga. App. 572 (145 SE2d 756).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The eighth enumeration of error complains that an exhibit for the State was permitted to go to the jury room with the jury. In support of this enumeration of error it is contended that such exhibit was identified but never introduced in evidence. While the record discloses that such exhibit was identified by the court reporter it does not appear that exhibit was ever exhibited to the jury or that it was permitted to go to the jury room with the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>If this was known at the time the jury retired, objection should have been made which would be shown in the record, and if not discovered until after verdict, a motion for new trial raising such question is a necessary prerequisite to a consideration of such alleged error by this court. See Ga. L. 1966, pp. 493, 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The remaining enumerations of error complain of the court\u2019s charge. Under the decision in <em>Georgia Power Co. v. Maddox, </em>113 Ga. App. 642 (149 SE2d 393), a general objection to the court\u2019s charge was insufficient to present for review the questions raised by the enumerations of error. Such procedure is made applicable to criminal cases by the Act of 1966, supra (Ga. L. 1966, pp. 493, 498).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AiJE\">\n<em>Hall and Deen, JJ., concur.</em>\n</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
