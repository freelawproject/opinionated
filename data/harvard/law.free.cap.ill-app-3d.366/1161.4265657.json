Harris, appeals (1) his sentence following remand and (2) the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his pro se postconviction petition. We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand with directions.</p> <p id=\"b1180-6\" pgmap=\"1180\">I. BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b1180-7\" pgmap=\"1180\">On June 16, 1999, a jury found defendant guilty of two counts of criminal sexual assault (720 ILCS 5/12 \u2014 13(a)(1) (West 1998)) and one count of unlawful restraint (720 ILCS 5/10 \u2014 3(a) (West 1998)). Criminal sexual assault is a Class 1 felony, punishable by 4 to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. 730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20141(a)(4) (West 1998). Unlawful restraint is a Class 4 felony, punishable by one to three years\u2019 imprisonment. 730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20141(a)(7) (West 1998). In August 1999, Judge Thomas Difanis held a sentencing hearing, at which he heard the parties\u2019 arguments as neither the State nor defendant presented any evidence. The court sentenced defendant to the maximum term on each count with the sentences to run concurrently. The court chose not to impose what it believed was discretionary consecutive sentences, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t believe consecutive sentences would be necessary and/or appropriate in this case.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b1180-8\" pgmap=\"1180\">On appeal, this court concluded one of the criminal-sexual-assault convictions must be vacated under the one-act, one-crime rule and remanded for that purpose. People v. Harris, No. 4 \u2014 99\u20140806, slip order at 20 (September 21, 2001) (unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23). We also determined that consecutive sentences were mandated by the Unified Code of Corrections (Unified Code) (730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20144(a), (b) (West 1998)). Harris, slip order at 19. Accordingly, we found (1) the original sentences were void because of the improper concurrent terms and (2) a new sentencing hearing was warranted, at which the trial court had the discretion to determine the length of the individual sentences but did not have the discretion to make them concurrent. Harris, slip order at 19-20. In the order\u2019s conclusion, we only vacated the unlawful-restraint sentence but did remand \u201cfor further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.\u201d Harris, slip order at 20.</p> <p id=\"b1180-9\" pgmap=\"1180(34) 1181(60)\">In a March 7, 2002, docket entry, the trial court noted that pursuant to this court\u2019s mandate, it vacated defendant\u2019s conviction on count II (criminal sexual assault) and stated defendant\u2019s 3-year sentence for unlawful restraint was to run consecutive to his 15-year sentence on count I (criminal sexual assault). The court entered an amended sentencing judgment reflecting the changes. In an April 3, 2002, letter to the court, defendant complained he was not present when the new sentencing decision was made. In response, the court appointed defendant counsel and set a hearing date.</p> <p id=\"b1181-4\" pgmap=\"1181\">In July 2002, defendant filed a pro se postconviction petition, asserting he was denied effective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. Specifically, he argued trial counsel was ineffective for (1) failing to properly respond when defendant notified him of a juror sleeping, (2) failing to challenge two jurors who had a family member or a loved one who had been sexually assaulted, and (3) failing to inform defendant he could have asked for a continuance until his \u201cregular\u201d judge could hear the case. Defendant contended his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise on appeal issues of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, namely, trial counsel\u2019s failure to challenge potentially biased jurors and failure to call Damion Monroe as a witness. On August 15, 2002, the trial court summarily dismissed defendant\u2019s postconviction petition as frivolous and patently without merit.</p> <p id=\"b1181-5\" pgmap=\"1181\">On August 5, 2002, Judge Difanis conducted the sentencing hearing wherein the trial court noted defendant\u2019s presence and explained the appellate court had remanded the cause for resentencing on the unlawful-restraint conviction because it was a mandatory consecutive sentence. Neither defendant nor his attorney spoke at the hearing, and neither party presented any evidence. The court admonished defendant in accordance with Supreme Court Rule 605(a) (210 Ill. 2d R. 605(a)).</p> <p id=\"b1181-6\" pgmap=\"1181\">In defendant\u2019s August 9, 2002, motion to reconsider his sentence, he argued (1) the trial court failed to properly consider the statutory and other (a) mitigating factors and (b) aggravating factors, and (2) the court\u2019s original intention was to sentence defendant to a total of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment and thus he should receive no more than 12 years\u2019 imprisonment on the criminal-sexual-assault conviction.</p> <p id=\"b1181-7\" pgmap=\"1181\">In December 2002, the trial court held a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to reconsider his sentence. At the hearing, defendant argued the trial court had the authority to resentence him on the criminal-sexual-assault conviction and it should decrease the sentence to conform with its original intent. After hearing the parties\u2019 arguments, the court denied defendant\u2019s motion. This appeal followed.</p> <p id=\"b1181-8\" pgmap=\"1181\">II. ANALYSIS</p> <p id=\"b1181-9\" pgmap=\"1181\">A. Sentencing Hearing on Remand</p> <p id=\"b1181-10\" pgmap=\"1181(10) 1182(56)\">Defendant raises two separate issues as to the sentencing hearing conducted by the trial court after this court\u2019s remand. First, he asserts the court\u2019s sentencing hearing was insufficient in general since he was not given an opportunity to argue for lesser sentences. Second, he alleges the court did not resentence him on the two convictions but, rather, simply ordered the original sentences to run consecutively.</p> <p id=\"b1182-4\" pgmap=\"1182\">1. Sufficiency of the Hearing</p> <p id=\"b1182-5\" pgmap=\"1182\"> We find defendant has forfeited this issue by failing to raise it in his motion to reconsider his sentence. See People v. Reed, 177 Ill. 2d 389, 393, 686 N.E.2d 584, 586 (1997); see also 210 Ill. 2d R. 605(a)(3)(C) (\u201cany issue or claim of error regarding the sentence imposed or any aspect of the sentencing hearing not raised in the written motion [to reconsider the sentence] shall be deemed waived\u201d). Defendant\u2019s motion to reconsider did not allege the August 2002 hearing was insufficient because he was deprived of the opportunity to make arguments.</p> <p id=\"b1182-6\" pgmap=\"1182\">While defendant has forfeited this issue and no further inquiry is warranted, we nevertheless note the trial court\u2019s sentencing hearing on remand was sufficient. Defendant and his counsel were present at the hearing and never indicated they had any evidence or arguments to present to the trial judge, who was the same judge that presided at the original sentencing hearing.</p> <p id=\"b1182-7\" pgmap=\"1182\">2. Resentencing</p> <p id=\"b1182-8\" pgmap=\"1182\"> In our prior order, we concluded defendant\u2019s remaining sentences were void because they had to run consecutively and remanded the cause for a new sentencing hearing. See Harris, slip order at 19-20. Therefore, at the sentencing hearing on remand, the trial court should have resentenced defendant on both the unlawful-restraint conviction and the remaining criminal-sexual-assault conviction and made the sentences consecutive. Defendant contends the trial court did not resentence him on the two convictions but, rather, simply ordered the original sentences to run consecutively.</p> <p id=\"b1182-9\" pgmap=\"1182\">Regarding the unlawful-restraint conviction, the record clearly indicates the trial court resentenced defendant to three years\u2019 imprisonment. At the sentencing hearing, the court noted the cause had been \u201cremanded for resentencing on the unlawful restraint\u201d and indicated it was imposing a sentence of three years\u2019 imprisonment on that conviction. At the hearing on the motion to reconsider, the court stated it \u201cfelt that a [three-]year sentence on the unlawful restraint was appropriate.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b1182-10\" pgmap=\"1182(19) 1183(81)\">With regard to the criminal-sexual-assault conviction, the record suggests the trial court did not resentence defendant on that conviction. At the August 2002 sentencing hearing, when the court stated the cause was \u201cremanded for resentencing on the unlawful restraint,\u201d it did not mention the criminal-sexual-assault conviction. The court later explained \u201cwhat we are doing is actually resentencing him on the unlawful restraint.\u201d Again, the court did not mention the criminal-sexual-assault conviction. At the motion-to-reconsider hearing, the court noted the motion was timely as to \u201c[t]he three[-]year sentence that was imposed consecutively *** after the [ajppellate [c]ourt decision.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b1183-4\" pgmap=\"1183\">We understand the trial court\u2019s failure to resentence defendant on the criminal-sexual-assault conviction. In the analysis section of our prior order, we found the remaining sentences were void and informed the trial court it \u201chas discretion to determine the length of the individual sentences, but does not have the discretion to make them concurrent.\u201d Harris, slip order at 20. However, in our conclusion, we only expressly vacated the unlawful-restraint sentence but did not mention the remaining criminal-sexual-assault sentence. See Harris, slip order at 20. While the conclusion did state the cause was remanded \u201cfor further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein\u201d (Harris, slip order at 20), our failure to expressly vacate the criminal-sexual-assault sentence as we had done with the unlawful-restraint sentence was confusing.</p> <p id=\"b1183-5\" pgmap=\"1183\">Thus, we will now expressly vacate both the unlawful-restraint and criminal-sexual-assault sentences and remand the cause for a new sentencing hearing. We again remind the trial court it \u201chas discretion to determine the length of the individual sentences, but does not have the discretion to make them concurrent.\u201d Harris, slip order at 20.</p> <p id=\"b1183-6\" pgmap=\"1183(179) 1184(44)\">Additionally, we note our disagreement with Justice Cook\u2019s special concurrence, in which he finds that on remand, the trial court may not increase defendant\u2019s total sentence from 15 to 18 years. Although consecutive, defendant\u2019s two sentences must be viewed individually in determining whether a sentence has been increased in violation of section 5 \u2014 5\u20144 of the Unified Code (730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 5\u20144 (West 1998)). As our supreme court has stated, \u201c[e]ach conviction results in a discrete sentence that must be treated individually.\u201d People v. Carney, 196 Ill. 2d 518, 530, 752 N.E.2d 1137, 1144 (2001). Indeed, the supreme court \u201chas long held that consecutive sentences constitute separate sentences for each crime of which a defendant has been convicted.\u201d Carney, 196 Ill. 2d at 529, 752 N.E.2d at 1143. \u201cOur jurisprudence, therefore, makes it clear that consecutive sentences do not constitute a single sentence and cannot be combined as though they were one sentence for one offense.\u201d Carney, 196 Ill. 2d at 530, 752 N.E.2d at 1144. Thus, regardless of the aggregate, the trial court\u2019s new sentences will not violate section 5 \u2014 5\u20144 as long as they do not exceed their original, individual sentences, i.e., 15 years\u2019 imprisonment for criminal sexual assault and 3 years\u2019 imprisonment for unlawful restraint. Accordingly, an aggregate sentence of 18 years may be proper.</p> <p id=\"b1184-4\" pgmap=\"1184\">Our conclusion is consistent with the precedent of our sister First District Appellate Court. In People v. Sanders, 356 Ill. App. 3d 998, 827 N.E.2d 17 (2005), the court was faced with the precise issue presented here. There, after two remands, the trial court imposed three consecutive 10-year sentences. Sanders, 356 Ill. App. 3d at 1002, 827 N.E.2d at 20. Defendant argued the sentences imposed violated section 5 \u2014 5\u20144 of the Unified Code (730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 5\u20144 (West 2002)) because he had previously been sentenced (on the first remand) to three concurrent 25-year terms. Defendant argued the trial court\u2019s sentence required him to serve five years longer than the sentence imposed upon his first resentencing. Sanders, 356 Ill. App. 3d at 1003, 827 N.E.2d at 20-21. The court concluded as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b1184-5\" pgmap=\"1184\">\u201cHere, defendant\u2019s individual sentence for each specific conviction was not increased. Upon his first resentencing, defendant was sentenced to 25 years for each individual conviction. Upon his second resentencing, he was given 10 years for each individual conviction. Clearly, 10 is not greater than 25. The fact that defendant may now be in prison for 30 years (rather than 25 ***) is of no consequence *** since the three sentences cannot be added together to form one sentence.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b1184-6\" pgmap=\"1184\">Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not increase defendant\u2019s sentences upon his second resentencing.\u201d Sanders, 356 Ill. App. 3d at 1005, 827 N.E.2d at 22-23.</blockquote> <p id=\"b1184-7\" pgmap=\"1184\">We further note this court has previously cited Sanders with approval. See People v. Moore, 359 Ill. App. 3d 1090, 1092, 835 N.E.2d 980, 982 (2005).</p> <p id=\"b1184-8\" pgmap=\"1184\">B. Postconviction Petition</p> <p id=\"b1184-9\" pgmap=\"1184\"> Defendant also alleges the trial court erred by dismissing his postconviction petition at the initial stage.</p> <p id=\"b1184-10\" pgmap=\"1184(110) 1185(123)\">The Post-Conviction Hearing Act (Postconviction Act) (725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 1 through 122 \u2014 8 (West 2002)) provides a defendant with a collateral means to challenge his or her conviction or sentence for violations of federal or state constitutional rights. People v. Jones, 211 Ill. 2d 140, 143, 809 N.E.2d 1233, 1236 (2004). Once the defendant files a petition under the Postconviction Act, the trial court must first, independently and without considering any argument by the State, decide whether the defendant\u2019s petition is \u201cfrivolous or is patently without merit.\u201d 725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 2.1(a)(2) (West 2002). To survive dismissal at this initial stage, the postconviction petition \u201cneed only present the gist of a constitutional claim,\u201d which is \u201ca low threshold\u201d that requires the petition to contain only a limited amount of detail. People v. Gaultney, 174 Ill. 2d 410, 418, 675 N.E.2d 102, 106 (1996). Moreover, a defendant\u2019s failure to either (1) attach \u201cthe necessary \u2018affidavits, records, or other evidence\u2019 \u201d supporting the petitions allegations or (2) explain their absence will itself justify the petition\u2019s summary dismissal. People v. Collins, 202 Ill. 2d 59, 66, 782 N.E.2d 195, 198 (2002), quoting 725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 2 (West 2000). This court reviews de novo the trial court\u2019s dismissal of a postconviction petition without an evidentiary hearing. People v. Simms, 192 Ill. 2d 348, 360, 736 N.E.2d 1092, 1105-06 (2000).</p> <p id=\"b1185-4\" pgmap=\"1185\">Defendant alleges the trial court erred by summarily dismissing his postconviction petition because (1) his trial counsel was ineffective for (a) failing to remove two jurors that were biased because they had family members who had been sexually assaulted and (b) not promptly bringing to the court\u2019s attention a sleeping juror, and (2) his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to order a transcript of voir dire for which to base an ineffective-assistance-of-trial claim regarding the \u201cbiased\u201d jurors.</p> <p id=\"b1185-5\" pgmap=\"1185\">This court reviews ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims under the standard set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). People v. Evans, 186 Ill. 2d 83, 93, 708 N.E.2d 1158, 1163 (1999). To obtain reversal under Strickland, a defendant must prove (1) his counsel\u2019s performance failed to meet an objective standard of competence and (2) counsel\u2019s deficient performance resulted in prejudice to the defendant. Evans, 186 Ill. 2d at 93, 708 N.E.2d at 1163-64. As to the first prong, the defendant must overcome a strong presumption the counsel\u2019s challenged actions were the product of sound trial strategy. People v. Metcalfe, 202 Ill. 2d 544, 561, 782 N.E.2d 263, 274 (2002).</p> <p id=\"b1185-6\" pgmap=\"1185\">Here, the trial court properly dismissed defendant\u2019s postconviction petition at the first stage. First, defendant failed to comply with section 122 \u2014 2 of the Postconviction Act\u2019s requirement that a defendant attach \u201caffidavits, records, or other evidence\u201d in support of the petition\u2019s allegations or offer an explanation for the absence of such documentation. 725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 2 (West 2002). That failure itself justifies the summary dismissal of defendant\u2019s postconviction petition. Collins, 202 Ill. 2d at 66, 782 N.E.2d at 198.</p> <p id=\"b1185-7\" pgmap=\"1185(45) 1186(99)\">Second, the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel allegations that defendant raises are matters of trial strategy, which will not support an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim unless counsel failed to conduct any meaningful adversarial testing (People v. Patterson, 217 Ill. 2d 407, 441, 841 N.E.2d 889, 909 (2005)). In his direct appeal, defendant himself suggested the time in which to raise the issue of a sleeping juror was a matter of trial strategy. See People v. Johnson, 334 Ill. App. 3d 666, 680, 778 N.E.2d 772, 784 (2002) (noting a defendant forfeits his or her right to complain of an error where to do so is inconsistent with the position taken by the defendant in an earlier court proceeding). As to defense counsel\u2019s acceptance of the two jurors, a counsel\u2019s conduct during jury voir dire also involves matters of trial strategy. Metcalfe, 202 Ill. 2d at 562, 782 N.E.2d at 274.</p> <p id=\"b1186-4\" pgmap=\"1186\">Third, defendant has not alleged prejudice as to all three allegations. Since we have found defendant was not denied effective assistance of trial counsel, defendant cannot prove he was prejudiced by appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel allegations. As to the sleeping juror, the trial court noted for the record it had observed the \u201csleeping juror,\u201d and had found him to appear \u201cas attentive as most of the other jurors.\u201d Regarding the other two jurors, defendant alleged no facts that showed the jurors were in fact biased.</p> <p id=\"b1186-5\" pgmap=\"1186\">III. CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b1186-6\" pgmap=\"1186\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of defendant\u2019s postconviction petition, vacate defendant\u2019s unlawful-restraint and criminal-sexual-assault sentences, and remand for a new sentencing hearing consistent with this opinion.</p> <p id=\"b1186-7\" pgmap=\"1186\">Affirmed in part and vacated in part; cause remanded with directions.</p> <p id=\"b1186-8\" pgmap=\"1186\">MYERSCOUGH, J, concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\"> <author id=\"b1186-9\" pgmap=\"1186\">JUSTICE COOK,</author> <p id=\"Av2\" pgmap=\"1186\">specially concurring:</p> <p id=\"b1186-10\" pgmap=\"1186\">I concur in the decision to vacate and remand for a new sentencing hearing. I suggest, however, that the trial court, in the circumstances of this case, may not increase defendant\u2019s total sentence from 15 to 18 years.</p> <p id=\"b1186-11\" pgmap=\"1186(119) 1187(65)\">A reviewing court does not have the power to increase the punishment imposed by the trial court. See 134 Ill. 2d R. 615(b). A trial court may reduce a sentence within 30 days after the sentence is imposed, but the court may not increase a sentence once it is imposed. 730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20141(c) (West 2002). Where a conviction has been set aside on direct appeal, the court shall not impose a new sentence that is more severe than the prior sentence. 730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 5\u20144 (West 2002). Section 5 \u2014 5\u20144 sets out requirements of due process. See North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 725, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656, 669, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 2080 (1969); People v. Kilpatrick, 167 Ill. 2d 439, 447, 657 N.E.2d 1005, 1008 (1995) (improper chilling effect on appeal). A harsher sentence imposed after a successful appeal or motion to reconsider is only proper if it is based on additional bad conduct performed by the defendant after the original sentencing. People v. Moore, 177 Ill. 2d 421, 433, 686 N.E.2d 587, 594 (1997).</p> <p id=\"b1187-4\" pgmap=\"1187\">However, where concurrent sentences are imposed in violation of section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(a), requiring consecutive sentences, those sentences are void. People v. Arna, 168 Ill. 2d 107, 112-13, 658 N.E.2d 445, 448 (1995). The sentences to be imposed on those counts on remand, therefore, will not be greater than, less than, or equal to defendant\u2019s original sentences. People v. Garcia, 179 Ill. 2d 55, 73, 688 N.E.2d 57, 65 (1997). The due-process prophylactic rule of Pearce has been limited in its application to circumstances in which there is a reasonable likelihood that an increase in sentence is the product of actual judicial vindictiveness. However, \u201cthe correction of a void sentence under Arna fails to present circumstances in which there is a reasonable likelihood that a sentence imposed on remand will be the product of judicial vindictiveness against a defendant.\u201d Garcia, 179 Ill. 2d at 75, 688 N.E.2d at 66.</p> <p id=\"b1187-5\" pgmap=\"1187\">Garcia did not consider the sentences that were actually imposed after remand. Garcia was concerned only with the limited steps that must be taken to correct a void sentence under Arna. An increase in the total sentence is appropriate if necessary to comply with Arna, but it is not clear why a trial court would increase the total sentence if it were not necessary to do so. We have affirmed several decisions, noting that the total sentence was not increased. See, e.g., People v. Moore, 359 Ill. App. 3d 1090, 1093-94, 835 N.E.2d 980, 983 (2005) (\u201cAs defendant\u2019s individual terms were reduced and the aggregate remained unchanged, the trial court\u2019s resentence complied with section 5 \u2014 5\u2014 4(a) [(730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 5\u20144(a) (West 2002))] of the Unified Code and did not constitute an improper increase of his sentence\u201d). In the present case, defendant\u2019s total sentence was increased after remand, from 15 years to 18 years.</p> <p id=\"b1187-6\" pgmap=\"1187\">The statute mandating consecutive sentences is concerned with the total sentence a defendant will receive. The purpose of mandatory consecutive sentences is to insure that the defendant receives, in total, at least the minimum sentence on each count. Here, for example, the trial court could not have sentenced defendant to a total imprisonment of less than five years. The mandatory-consecutive-sentences statute is not a device for haphazardly increasing sentences on appeal that the trial court originally deemed appropriate.</p> <p id=\"b1187-7\" pgmap=\"1187(12) 1188(135)\">The majority cites People v. Carney, 196 Ill. 2d 518, 752 N.E.2d 1137 (2001) (holding that court\u2019s finding of \u201csevere bodily injury\u201d and imposition of mandatory consecutive sentences did not violate Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435, 120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000)). However, that case did not involve any issue of increased sentence on remand and did not discuss the judicial-vindictiveness concern addressed in section 5 \u2014 5\u20144. The majority also cites People v. Sanders, 356 Ill. App. 3d 998, 827 N.E.2d 17 (2005), but in that case, the defendant\u2019s original total sentence was 45 years, which was not exceeded on either of the subsequent remands. Cases holding that an increase in an individual sentence violates section 5 \u2014 5\u20144 are not authority for the proposition that an increase in the total sentence can never violate section 5 \u2014 5\u20144.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
