We grant Bri-ley\u2019s motions for leave to file an addendum to his informal brief, for an extension of time to file a reply brief, and to add a supplement to his reply. We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-18\">With regard to Briley\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, while we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Briley, </em>No. 1:12-cr-00482-LO-1 (E.D.Va. filed July 22, 2015; entered July 23, 2015 and Sept. 14, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-19\">Turning to the denial of \u00a7 2255 relief, the order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2012). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2012). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable, and that the motion states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-20\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Briley has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny Briley\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and for summary judgment, deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss this portion of the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
