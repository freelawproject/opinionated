R.Civ.P, 60(b) motion for relief from the court\u2019s prior judgment <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> in light of <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certif\u00edcate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2012). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2012). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable, and that the motion states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-17\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Rogers has not made the requisite showing. The district court lacked jurisdiction to deny Rogers\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion on the merits because the claim he raised challenged the validity of his career offender sentence, and thus the motion should have been construed as a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545.U.S. 524, 531-32, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005) (explaining how to differentiate a true Rule 60(b) motion from an unauthorized second or successive habeas corpus petition); <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 207 (4th Cir.2003) (same). In the absence of prefiling authorization from this court, the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3) (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-18\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We also deny Rogers\u2019 motion to amend his informal brief to add a new challenge to his sentence that was not previously presented to the district court. Rogers remains free, however, to pursue the legal issues identified in his Rule 60(b) motion, and motion to amend his informal brief, in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 (2012). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-19\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b201-14\"> The Rule 60(b) motion was filed in Rogers\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2012) postconviction proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
