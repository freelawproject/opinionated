At trial, a Government witness, Jarrell, in response to a question about how she knew Gray had already filed his claim, referred to his ex-wife\u2019s questioning how Gray had money to make purchases, because she testified Gray \u201cwasn\u2019t helping take care of [his] children or everything else except letting them come over and stay\u201d. Gray\u2019s counsel immediately moved for a mistrial, contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that Jarrell\u2019s statement was prejudicial character evidence. The court denied the motion; Gray challenges that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-22\">Our court reviews the denial of a motion for mistrial, based upon introduction of improper evidence, for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., United States v. Lucas, </em>516 F.3d 316, 345 (5th Cir.2008). A new trial is appropriate \u201conly when ... it appears that there is a significant possibility that the prejudicial evidence had a substantial impact on the jury verdict\u201d. <em>United States v. Valles, </em>484 F.3d 745, 756 (5th Cir.2007). The court did not abuse its discretion in denying Gray\u2019s motion. Based on the record and the context of Jarrell\u2019s statement, her reference to Gray\u2019s taking care of his children was an \u201cisolated remark[ ], that w[as] not dwelled upon by the parties\u201d, and was not otherwise discussed by counsel or any other witness. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Paul, </em>142 F.3d 836, 844 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Zamora, </em>661 F.3d 200, 212 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-23\">In short, any such error was harmless. Although the court did not give a specific curative instruction concerning Jarrell\u2019s remark, it instructed the jury that Gray was not on trial for any other act, conduct, or offense not alleged in the indictment. <em>See Paul, </em>142 F.3d at 844. Moreover, there is no significant possibility that Jarrell\u2019s remark had a substantial impact on the jury verdict, in the light of other overwhelming evidence of Gray\u2019s guilt presented at trial. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b251-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
