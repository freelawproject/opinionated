He argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable, and also challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to allow counsel to define \u201creasonable doubt\u201d in closing argument. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">We review a sentence for reasonableness \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. McCoy, </em>804 F.3d 349, 351 (4th Cir.2015) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). This review entails appellate consideration of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">Parsons claims that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court imposed a sentence based on unreliable testimony from a witness Parsons argues is not credible. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing for clear error, and accord its credibility determinations great deference. <em>United States v. Layton, </em>564 F.3d 330, 334 (4th Cir.2009). The district court heard testimony from the witness, Parsons\u2019 counsel cross-examined him, and other evidence supported his testimony. The district court fully explained its decision to credit the witness, and we defer to the court\u2019s credibility determination. Parsons fails to show that the witness\u2019 testimony did not have \u201csome minimal level of reliability,\u201d as due process requires. <em>See United States v. Powell, </em>650 F.3d 388, 393 (4th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">Parsons next claims that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the court relied on a description of conduct that refers \u201calmost exclusively\u201d to Casey Parsons, his wife and codefendant. While this court holds that a sentencing court must not give excessive weight to any one sentencing factor, <em>United States v. Howard, </em>773 F.3d 519, 531 (4th Cir.2014), the district court\u2019s sentence suffered from no such failing. The court, though citing the challenged factor, provided in addition a thorough and compelling explanation that relied on other sentencing factors and justifies the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">Parsons also argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the court varied so greatly from the Sentencing Guidelines, and because his sentence is nearly the same as his more culpable code-fendant. We conclude, however, that based on the totality of the circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in varying substantially upward and that Parsons\u2019 sentence is not disproportionate when compared with that of his codefendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">Finally, Parsons urges us to reexamine our precedent prohibiting counsel from defining \u201creasonable doubt\u201d to the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>during closing argument. We have consistently disapproved of such attempts to define \u201creasonable doubt\u201d for a jury, concluding that the words \u201chave the meaning generally understood for them and that further efforts to restate their meaning with different words tend either to alter or to obfuscate that meaning.\u201d <em>United States v. Oriakhi, </em>57 F.3d 1290, 1300 (4th Cir.1995). Because this panel has no authority to overturn this precedent, <em>see United States v. Williams, </em>808 F.3d 253, 261 (4th Cir.2015), this claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
