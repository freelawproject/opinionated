On appeal, he challenges his Sentencing Guidelines range enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon, under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (2014). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Section 2Dl.l(b)(l) provides for a two-level enhancement \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed\u201d in connection with the drug offense. USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The commentary to \u00a7 2D1.1 explains that the weapons enhancement should be applied \u201cif the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.ll(A)). The district court\u2019s decision to apply the enhancement is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>128 F.3d 850, 852 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">The Government need not establish a perfect connection between the possession of the firearm and the commission of the drug offense before the enhancement may be made. That is because \u201cenhancement under Section 2Dl.l(b)(l) does not require proof of precisely concurrent acts, for example, gun in hand while in the act of storing drugs, drugs in hand while in the act of retrieving a gun.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>128 F.3d at 852 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, \u201cpossession of the weapon during the commission of the offense is all that is needed to invoke the enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Apple, </em>962 F.2d 335, 338 (4th Cir.1992); <em>accord United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.2001) (\u201cIn order to prove that a weapon was present, the Government need show only that the weapon was possessed during the relevant illegal drug activity.\u201d). Evidence of firearms in proximity to illegal drugs can support a conclusion that the firearms were possessed during the commission of the drug offense. <em>See Harris, </em>128 F.3d at 852 (noting that \u201cthe proximity of guns to illicit narcotics can support a district court\u2019s enhancement of a defendant\u2019s sentence under Section 2Dl.l(b)(l)\u201d). The defendant has the burden of showing that a connection between his possession of a firearm and his drug offense is \u201cclearly improbable.\u201d <em>United States v. Slade, </em>631 F.3d 185, 189 (4th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">While Foust raises several arguments as to why the enhancement was improper, we find that these arguments are either unsupported or would not make it clearly improbable that the firearm was connected with Foust\u2019s drug dealing. Foust was found in a locked bedroom, in possession of a gun, ammunition, drug paraphernalia, and methamphetamine. He did not produce any evidence that he was unaware of the presence of the gun or that it was used for hunting or sport. Because Foust had only a weak case to support his \u201cclearly improbable\u201d theory and he possessed a firearm in close proximity to drugs and drug paraphernalia, the district court did not clearly err in applying the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Accordingly, we affirm Foust\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
