We review the BIA\u2019s decision and the IJ\u2019s decision to the extent the BIA relied on it. <em>See Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 437 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Mathita conceded removability for overstaying a visa in 2005. The IJ declined to grant relief on her linked claims for adjustment of status and waiver of inadmissibility because the applications were incomplete. Mathita has abandoned any appeal of this ruling by failing to raise the issues in her petition for review. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">The IJ deemed Mathita to have abandoned her claims for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture because she did not present them within the deadline set by the IJ. Mathita argues that those claims were constructively presented in an attachment to her application for a waiver of inadmissibility, and that the IJ should have granted a \u201cshort recess\u201d to allow her to litigate those claims. She does not show that the IJ abused his discretion by declining to grant a continuance so that she could present those claims. <em>See Masih v. Mukasey, </em>536 F.3d 370, 373 (5th Cir.2008). Moreover, the IJ was permitted to \u201cset and extend time limits for the filing of applications and,\u201d when applications are not filed within those time limits, the opportunity to file them \u201cshall be deemed waived.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.31(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-14\">In addition, Mathita contends that the IJ failed to \u201cadequately\u201d adjudicate her application for cancellation of removal. During a hearing, the IJ stated without objection or argument that cancellation was precluded by Mathita\u2019s criminal convictions for theft and fraud. Such convictions typically disqualify, an alien from discretionary cancellation of removal. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l); <em>cf. Nino v. Holder, </em>690 F.3d 691, 694-95 (5th Cir.2012) (holding that a state fraud conviction precluded cancellation); <em>Hyder v. Keisler, </em>506 F.3d 388, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007) (holding that a federal social-security fraud conviction precluded cancellation). Mathita makes no effort to show what might have been accomplished by further adjudication beyond the IJ\u2019s uncontested ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"Aot\">In any event, Mathita\u2019s claims ultimately fail because they are wholly conclusional and unsupported by any legal analysis or authority. <em>See Chambers v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 445, 448 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
