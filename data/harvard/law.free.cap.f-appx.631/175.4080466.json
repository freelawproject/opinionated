We conclude that the record evidence does not compel a ruling contrary to any of the administrative factual findings, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2012), and that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>Gomis, 571 F.3d at 359. We further find no abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s denial of Ben Hassine\u2019s motion to remand or in the immigration judge\u2019s denial of his motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-24\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>In re: Ben Hassine </em>(B.I.A. Mar. 4, 2015). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-25\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b197-19\"> Ben Hassine does not challenge the denial of his asylum claim as untimely, and in any event, we lack jurisdiction to review this finding. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2012); <em>Gomis v. Holder, </em>571 F.3d 353, 358-59 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
