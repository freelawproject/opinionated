The court construed the Rule 60(b) motion as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. We have reviewed the record and conclude that Wheeler\u2019s motion was not a true Rule 60(b) motion, but in substance a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. McRae, </em>793 F.3d 392, 399-400 (4th Cir.2015); <em>see also Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 531-33, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005) (explaining how to differentiate a true Rule 60(b) motion from an unauthorized successive habeas motion). Wheeler is therefore not required to obtain a certif\u00ed-cate of appealability to appeal the district court\u2019s order. <em>See McRae, </em>793 F.3d at 400. As noted by the district court, in the absence of prefiling authorization from this court, it lacked jurisdiction to hear Wheeler\u2019s successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3) (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Additionally, we construe Wheeler\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief as an application to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003). In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a prisoner must assert claims based on either:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">(1) newly discovered evidence that would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">(2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). Wheeler\u2019s claims do not satisfy either of these criteria. Therefore, we deny authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
