This Court granted Mr. Peterson a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) as to whether he was entitled to equitable tolling. After review, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-21\">Mr. Peterson was convicted in 2000 of one count of capital sexual battery and sentenced to a term of life imprisonment. The Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal affirmed Mr. Peterson\u2019s conviction and sentence on March 22, 2002. He had ninety days, or until June 20, 2002, to petition the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. When he failed to do so, his judgment of conviction became final on that date, which also started the clock on Mr. Peterson\u2019s one-year statute of limitations for a federal habeas petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-22\">Mr. Peterson\u2019s counsel did not file a state postconviction motion until October 13, 2003, 117 days after the federal limitations period expired. The Florida trial court held a hearing on .Mr. Peterson\u2019s postconviction motion and denied it on the merits on September 9, 2004. Counsel for Mr. Peterson failed to timely appeal, and on July 24, 2006, Mr. Peterson filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for a belated appeal. <em>See </em>Fla. R.App. P. 9.141(c). The Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal granted the petition and allowed Mr. Peterson an appeal, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>ultimately it affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of his postconviction motion. The mandate for that decision issued on January 28, 2008. Mr. Peterson filed his <em>pro se </em>federal habeas petition the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> concluded that Mr. Peterson\u2019s federal habeas petition was untimely. <em>See Webster v. Moore, </em>199 F.3d 1256, 1259 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cA state-court petition ... that is filed following the expiration of the limitations period cannot toll that period because there is no period remaining to be tolled.\u201d). Further, although the district court concluded that Mr. Peterson was diligent in pursuing his rights, it found that counsel\u2019s negligence in faffing to file a timely federal habeas petition was not an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable tolling of the limitations period. Mr. Peterson appealed, and this Court granted him a COA on the issue of equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The district court did not err in concluding that Mr. Peterson diligently pursued his rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Holland v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 631, 653, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010) (stating that \u201creasonable diligence,\u201d not \u201cmaximum feasible diligence,\u201d is required to justify equitable tolling). Mr. Peterson retained counsel in 2001 during the direct appeal process and instructed counsel \u201cto proceed with [his] case to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d Doc. 30 at 6-7.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the direct appeal process ended, counsel again was retained to file Mr. Peterson\u2019s postconviction motion. From that time, Mr. Peterson alleged, he \u201ccontinually asked what would happen if he lost this [postconviction] motion ... and if this was the last step he could take.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. \u201cCounsel continually told [him] that all was well, that if this motion did not prevail, there was always the Federal courts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">But all was not well. By the time counsel had filed Mr. Peterson\u2019s state postcon-viction motion, his federal statute of limitations was blown. And counsel\u2019s mistakes continued. When Mr. Peterson\u2019s state .postconviction motion was denied in September 2004, he told counsel \u201cto take the necessary steps to go further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Counsel did not. Mr. Peterson was unaware that no appeal had been filed in his case until nearly two years later. When he found out, he wrote to counsel and asked why his postconviction motion had not been appealed. Counsel replied in July and August 2006 that he was going to proceed on Mr. Peterson\u2019s behalf by filing a federal habeas petition. Again, counsel failed to do so. Instead, Mr. Peterson went on alone, filing a petition for a belated appeal in September 2006. That petition was granted and, when the merits of the appeal ultimately were denied, Mr. Peterson filed a federal habeas petition the very next day. Mr. Peterson thus dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>played reasonable diligence throughout his mishandled -postconviction proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Based on Mr. Peterson\u2019s allegations, counsel\u2019s conduct amounted to gross negligence. And, after August 2006, it may have even amounted to abandonment, as Mr. Peterson contends. Unfortunately, Mr. Peterson\u2019s federal habeas statute of limitations had long expired by the time counsel arguably abandoned him. The' only period of time relevant to our equitable tolling analysis is from June 20, 2002 until June 20, 2003, while the statute of limitations clock was still running and there was time left to be tolled. During this period, counsel\u2019s negligence, \u201chowever gross or egregious, does not qualify as an \u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019 for purposes of equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Cadet v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>742 F.3d 473, 481 (11th Cir.2014). Mr. Peterson has also failed to allege or show \u201cbad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, [or any] mental impairment\u201d by his counsel which may in certain extraordinary circumstances \u201cform the basis of an equitable tolling argument.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Att\u2019y Gen. Fla., </em>795 F.3d 1286, 1293-94 (11th Cir.2015) (discussing <em>Holland, Maples v. Thomas, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 912, 181 L.Ed.2d 807 (2012), and <em>Cadet). </em>Accordingly, we must agree with the district court that Mr. Peterson is not entitled to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations on his federal habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-8\">.We refer here to the district court's second decision on the timeliness of Mr. Peterson\u2019s petition. After the district court\u2019s first order deeming the petition untimely, this Court declined to issue a COA, but the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and remanded to this Court for further consideration in light of <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 631, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010). <em>Peterson v. McNeil, </em>562 U.S. 956, 131 S.Ct. 456, 178 L.Ed.2d 282 (2010).
