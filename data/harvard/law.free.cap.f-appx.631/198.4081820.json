Mack\u2019s attorney initially filed her brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), averring that there were no nonfrivolous issues for appeal but asking this court to review the reasonableness of Mack\u2019s sentence. Although informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Mack declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">After conducting our <em>Anders </em>review of the record, we identified the following non-frivolous issue: what impact, if any, <em>United States v. McLeod, </em>808 F.3d 972 (4th Cir.2015), has on the computation of Mack\u2019s sentencing range.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We directed the parties to file merits briefs addressing this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In her merits brief, counsel for Mack argues that, under <em>McLeod, </em>Mack\u2019s prior South Carolina third-degree burglary convictions no longer qualify, categorically, as predicate violent felonies under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Counsel asks us to vacate Mack\u2019s sentence and remand this case to the district court for resentencing in light of <em>McLeod, </em>The Government agrees and likewise asserts that Mack is entitled to relief under <em>McLeod. </em>As discussed below, we affirm Mack\u2019s conviction but vacate his sentence and remand this ease to the district court for resentencing in light of <em>McLeod.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">First, although not raised as an issue in the <em>Anders </em>brief, we have reviewed the transcript of Mack\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing and conclude that the district court complied with the requirements of Rule 11 in accepting Mack\u2019s guilty plea. Moreover, Mack did not raise any Rule 11 objections in the district court, and any omissions from the Rule 11 colloquy do not amount to plain error. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002) (holding that an otherwise unraised claim of Rule 11 error is reviewed for plain error); <em>see also United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004) (ruling that, to establish that a district court\u2019s noncompliance with Rule 11 affected substantial rights, a defendant bears the burden of showing \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Finally, our review of <em>McLeod </em>and the other pertinent authorities confirms the parties\u2019 position that Mack should be re-sentenced in light of <em>McLeod. </em>Accordingly, we vacate Mack\u2019s sentence and remand this case to the district court for resen-tencing on this basis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\"> In <em>McLeod, </em>this court held that South Carolina's second-degree burglary statute, <em>see </em>S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-11-312(B) (2003), read in conjunction with the statutory section that defines the word \"building\u201d as any structure, vehicle, watercraft, or aircraft where any person lodges or lives, where people assemble for a variety of purposes, or where goods are stored, <em>see </em>S.C.Code Ann; \u00a7 16-11-310(1) (2003), \u201cprovid[ed] elements alternative to generic burglary,\u201d and thus that the district court could use the modified categorical approach to determine McLeod's \"crime of conviction.\u201d <em>McLeod, </em>at 976. We vacated McLeod\u2019s sentence and remanded his case for resentencing because the documents available for review under the modified categorical approach did not conclusively resolve whether McLeod was convicted of generic burglary. <em>Id. </em>at 977-78, 976.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
