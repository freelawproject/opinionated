Freeman\u2019s conviction was based on Freeman\u2019s failure to disclose a bank account that he held jointly with his mother (\u201cjoint account\u201d). Freeman also appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of Freeman\u2019s motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-20\">Freeman first challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss his indictment (returned on 3 August 2011) as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>barred by the five-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court determined that the limitations period began running on 7 August 2006, when the bankruptcy court entered a written order dismissing Freeman\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding. Freeman asserts, instead, that the limitations period began running on 14 July 2006, when Freeman filed his \u201cnotice of voluntary dismissal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment, but \u201creview <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1322 (11th Cir.2010) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Because Freeman\u2019s offense is a \u201ccontinuing offense,\u201d the limitations period begins to run only when the debtor is finally discharged or when a discharge is denied. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3284. In cases where a discharge is no longer possible, however, the limitations period begins to run on the date on which the discharge became impossible. <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>136 F.3d 1451, 1454-55 (11th Cir.1998). The limitations period may begin running, for instance, upon voluntary dismissal of the bankruptcy proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1455.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The issue in this case is determining the effective date of Freeman\u2019s voluntary dismissal and, thus,, the date the limitations period began running. The pertinent bankruptcy statutes and rules contemplate a two-step process for voluntary dismissals: the debtor\u2019s request for dismissal followed by the court\u2019s actual dismissal of the bankruptcy proceedings. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1307(b) (emphasis added) (\u201c[o]n <em>request of the debtor </em>at any time ... the court shall dismiss a case under this chapter.\u201d); Fed. R. of Bankr.Proc. 1017(f)(2) (emphasis added) (providing that voluntary dismissals under section 1307(b) \u201cshall be on <em>motion </em>filed and served\u201d in accordance with Rule 9013, governing the filing of motions or <em>\u201crequest </em>[s] for an order.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">In the light of this statutory language, Freeman\u2019s notice of voluntary dismissal constituted only a request for dismissal, not a self-executing dismissal itself.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The effective date of Freeman\u2019s voluntary dismissal \u2014 and thus, the date the limitations period began running \u2014 was the date on which the bankruptcy court entered its written order of dismissal on the docket.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because Freeman\u2019s indictment was filed within five years of that date, the district court denied properly Freeman\u2019s motion to. dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">Freeman next challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>of acquittal. Freeman contends that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to establish either that the joint account constituted property of Freeman\u2019s estate or that Freeman had the requisite fraudulent intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal based on sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cconsidering the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, and drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Capers, </em>708 F.3d 1286, 1296 (11th Cir.2013). \u201cWe will not reverse unless no reasonable trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1333 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">To prove concealment of assets in a bankruptcy proceeding, the government must establish that defendant \u201cknowingly and fraudulently concealed] from a custodian, trustee, marshal, or other officer of the court charged with the control or custody of property ... any property belonging to the estate of a debtor.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(1). A bankruptcy debtor\u2019s estate includes \u201call legal or equitable interest of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case\u201d and \u201c[a]ny interest in property that the estate acquires after the commencement of the case.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 541(a)(1), (a)(7). Whether property constitutes property of the debtor\u2019s estate is a question of fact for the jury. <em>United States v. Dennis, </em>237 F.3d 1295, 1300 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, sufficient evidence exists from which a reasonable juror could conclude that Freeman was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. At trial, the government presented evidence that, the day before filing for bankruptcy, Freeman \u2014 who was a forensic certified public accountant \u2014 sold a tract of land that he and his mother owned. The proceeds of the sale were deposited into the joint account; and Freeman reported to the IRS that he received personally gross proceeds of $275,000 as a result of the sale. The government also presented evidence that, while Freeman\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding was pending, Freeman wrote several large checks from and withdrew money out of the joint account to pay for his own personal and business expenses. At no point did Freeman disclose the existence of the joint account to his bankruptcy trustee or to his creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Freeman testified in his own defense at trial. In pertinent part, Freeman testified that the joint account belonged to his mother, that his name was on the account only because of his mother\u2019s poor health, and that he withdrew funds from the account only with his mother\u2019s express consent. Freeman also testified that he had no intent to conceal assets. On cross-examination, the government presented deposition testimony from Freeman\u2019s mother indicating that she had no memory of the joint account and no knowledge about whether the money in the account belonged to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">The jury was entitled to disbelieve Freeman\u2019s testimony and to use his testimony as substantive evidence of guilt. <em>See United States v. Williamson, </em>339 F.3d 1295, 1301 n. 14 (11th Cir.2003). \u201c[W]e are bound by the jury\u2019s credibility determinations, and by its rejection of the inferences raised by the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Peters, </em>403 F.3d 1263, 1268 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">In the light of the evidence presented at trial, a juror could conclude reasonably that the joint account was part of Freeman\u2019s bankruptcy estate and that Freeman concealed knowingly the account\u2019s existence from the bankruptcy trustee and from his creditors. We will not reverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>the jury\u2019s verdict; we affirm the denial of Freeman\u2019s motion for judgment of acquits tal. <em>See Farley, </em>607 F.3d at 1333.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Freeman also contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence of a brain tumor. Freeman was first diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2014, and the tumor was removed successfully a few days later. In support of his motion, Freeman produced a report from a psychologist \u2014 prepared after removal of Freeman\u2019s tumor in 2014 \u2014 which Freeman contends demonstrates that his tumor affected his judgment and behavior at the time of his offense in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">We review the denial of a motion for new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Campa, </em>459 F.3d 1121, 1151 (11th Cir.2006) (en banc). \u201cMotions for new trial based on newly discovered evidence are highly disfavored in the Eleventh Circuit and should be granted only with great caution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To succeed on his motion for new trial, Freeman must show, among other things, that (1) \u201cthe evidence is material to issues before the court,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe evidence is such that a new trial would probably produce a different result.\u201d <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The district court abused no discretion in denying Freeman a new trial. Freeman failed to produce evidence demonstrating either that his tumor existed in 2005, when he committed his offense, or that the tumor affected his ability, in 2005, to form intent to commit bankruptcy fraud. <em>Cf. United States v. Cameron, </em>907 F.2d 1051, 1067 (11th Cir.1990) (psychiatric evidence offered to negate specific intent is admissible only \u201cwhen such evidence focuses on the defendant\u2019s specific state of mind at the time of the charged offense.\u201d). The psychologist\u2019s report opined only that Freeman\u2019s \u201ctumor likely impacted his judgment, behavior and memory and other forms of functional cognition over the course of the past several years,\u201d and contained no express or implied opinion about Freeman\u2019s condition in 2005. As a result, Freeman has failed to show that the newly discovered evidence is either material to the issues before the court or likely to produce a different result at trial. The district court denied properly Freeman\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">We also agree with the district court\u2019s alternative ruling that the psychologist\u2019s report would be inadmissible as expert opinion testimony. The doctor\u2019s conclusions about Freeman\u2019s condition before removal of the tumor are based entirely on Freeman\u2019s subjective self-reports and on reports from Freeman\u2019s friends and family. Because the doctor\u2019s opinions lack a scientific basis, they are insufficiently reliable to be admissible at trial. For background, see Fed.R.Evid. 702; <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\">. The parties agree that Freeman's offense is subject to a five-year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b808-8\">. Freeman's reliance on <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>136 F.3d 1451 (11th Cir.1998), is misplaced. In <em>Gilbert, </em>this Court said only that the statute of limitations may begin running upon voluntary dismissal of bankruptcy proceedings, but said nothing about whether a debtor\u2019s notice of voluntary dismissal itself triggers the running of the limitations period. <em>See Gilbert, </em>136 F.3d at 1454-55.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b808-9\">. In his reply brief, Freeman argues for the first time that the limitations period began running when the bankruptcy court dismissed orally his case at a hearing on Freeman\u2019s motion to dismiss. Arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief are deemed abandoned. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008). Moreover, the bankruptcy court\u2019s order of dismissal became effective only when judgment was entered on the docket on 7 August 2006. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 7058 (applying Fed.R.Civ.P. 58 to adversary proceedings); Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(c)(1) (judgment is entered \"when the judgment is entered in the civil docket.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
