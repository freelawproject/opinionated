He seeks to challenge the denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in which he sought a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 782 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-21\">When, as in this ease, a district court certifies that an appeal is not taken in good faith, the appellant may either pay the filing fee or challenge the court\u2019s certification decision. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If we uphold the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith, the appellant must pay the filing fee or, alternatively, we may dismiss the appeal sua sponte under 5th Circuit Rule 42.2 if it is frivolous. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-22\">We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). Amendments 782 and 788 retroactively lowered the base offense levels in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) by two levels and have the effect of lowering Ramirez\u2019s total offense level to 33. When combined with his Criminal History Category of I, the amended guidelines range of imprisonment is 135 to 168 months. Ramirez was sentenced to 130 months, below the minimum of the amended guidelines range. The district court could not further reduce his term of imprisonment because he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>receive a downward departure pursuant to a government motion to reflect his substantial assistance to authorities. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A), (B), comment. (MCA)).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ramirez\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672. Because the appeal lacks arguable merit and is therefore frivolous, Ramirez\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under' the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
