Mann, </em>709 F.3d 301, 304 (4th Cir.2013). \u201cWe are obliged to accord substantial deference to a district court\u2019s interpretation of its own judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). A district court abuses its discretion, however, \u201cwhen it ... relies on erroneous factual or legal premises, or commits an error of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Briley, </em>770 F.3d 267, 276 (4th Cir.2014) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1844, 191 L.Ed.2d 724 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-24\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the term of imprisonment \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced ... based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Thus, \u201c[eligibility for consideration under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is triggered only by an amendment listed in subsection (d) that lowers the applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, p.s., cmt. n. 1(A) (2014). \u201cIn determining whether, and to, what extent, a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment ... is warranted, the court [must] determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable ... if the [relevant] amendment ] ... had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.\u201d USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l), p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-25\">Initially, we conclude that the court correctly determined that Daniels is eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 782, which lowered the base offense-levels applicable to drug trafficking of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>fenses. <em>See </em>USSG App. C Amend. 782. Daniels\u2019 Guidelines range after the application of Amendment 782 is 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court, however, calculated an amended Guidelines range of 120 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment and reduced Daniels\u2019 sentence to 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The court originally sentenced Daniels after the effective date of the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA). Accordingly, the statutory minimum sentence for Daniels\u2019 drug offense is 5 years\u2019 imprisonment, not 10. <em>Compare </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) (2012), <em>with </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2006); <em>see Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2335-36, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012) (holding that FSA applies to defendants sentenced after effective date of August 3, 2010). The court, therefore, erred in determining that the bottom of Daniels\u2019 amended Guidelines range was 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, rather than 108 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand so that the court may reconsider the extent of Daniels\u2019 sentence reduction under the properly calculated amended Guidelines range. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b189-19\"> Although the district court granted Daniels\u2019 \u00a7 3582 motion, the reduction granted by the court was less than the reduction sought by Daniels.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
