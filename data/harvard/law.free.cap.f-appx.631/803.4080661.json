James argues the district court erred by providing supplemental jury instructions that were misleading, refusing to offer jury instructions he requested, and sentencing him as an \u201carmed career felon.\u201d He also asserts his conviction under \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional. We hold the district court did not err on any of the above grounds and James has failed to show his conviction under \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b826-20\">On February 8, 2014, James and four other individuals were pulled over by the police. Upon approaching the vehicle, the police officer saw James reaching toward the floor. While searching the vehicle, the officer found a gun in the area where James was reaching. James told the officer the gun belonged to him. Subsequently, the police discovered the gun was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-21\">James was indicted on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1) of the ACCA. The prosecution and James stipulated that James was a convicted felon, the gun found by police was a firearm as defined by the ACCA, and the gun was manufactured outside of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Given a felon can be convicted under \u00a7 922(g)(1) if he has constructive possession of a firearm, the district court provided a jury instruction on constructive possession during James\u2019s trial. Neither party objected to the instruction. Thereafter, the jury requested the court explain \u201c \u2018intent\u2019 in the definition of \u2018constructive possession.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In response, the court gave a supplemental instruction elaborating on the definition of constructive possession. The instruction included relevant language from <em>United States v. Derose, </em>74 F.3d 1177 (11th Cir.1996), <em>as modified </em>(Mar. 15,1996). The instruction also stated that \u201cintention\u201d within the context of constructive possession requires more than \u201cmere awareness\u201d of a firearm\u2019s location. James requested that the court define \u201cintent\u201d for the jury using Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. The court refused the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Ultimately, the jury convicted James of being a felon in possession of a firearm. At the time, James had several prior felony convictions, including state convictions for robbery; sale, purchase, or delivery of a controlled substance in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13; attempted armed robbery; aggravated battery; resisting an officer with violence; and possessing cocaine with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13. Based on the court\u2019s finding that James is an \u201carmed career felon\u201d under the ACCA, the court sentenced him to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">A. <em>The District Court Did Not Abuse its Discretion in Providing the Supplemental Jury Instruction for Constructive Possession.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">James first claims the district court misled the jury when it responded to their request for a supplemental instruction. Specifically, James asserts the court\u2019s supplemental instruction suggested to the jury that constructive possession of a firearm only requires knowledge of the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">\u201c[W]e review a [district] court\u2019s response to a jury question for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1279 (11th Cir.2004). The district court has considerable discretion in answering a jury question, so long as the answer does not misstate the law or confuse the jury. <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>590 F.3d 1238, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2009). When reviewing a supplemental instruction, we must consider the entire jury charge, including \u201cthe indictment, evidence presented[,] and argument of counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1248 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cError in jury instructions does not constitute grounds for reversal unless there is a reasonable likelihood that it affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>392 F.3d at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">The district court\u2019s supplemental instruction did not misstate the law regarding constructive possession. \u201cConstructive possession of a firearm exists when [the] defendant does not have actual possession but instead knowingly has the power or right, and intention to exercise dominion and control over the firearm.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>661 F.3d 568, 576 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam). Constructive possession is also defined as having \u201cknowledge of the [firearm] coupled with the ability to maintain control over it or reduce it to [one\u2019s] physical possession.\u201d <em>Derose, </em>74 F.3d at 1185 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court\u2019s supplemental instruction included the same language used in <em>Derose </em>and made clear that \u201cinten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>tion\u201d requires more than mere knowledge of the firearm. Moreover, even assuming the instruction was misleading, it did not affect James\u2019s substantial rights. James\u2019s admission to the police that he owned the firearm provided adequate grounds for his conviction. <em>See United States v. Gunn, </em>369 F.3d 1229, 1235 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (\u201c\u00c1 defendant has constructive possession if he exercises ownership, dominion, or control over the firearm.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">As such, the district court did not commit an abuse of discretion in providing the supplemental instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">B. <em>The District Court Did Not Abuse its Discretion in Refusing to Provide James\u2019s Requested Jury Instructions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">James next asserts the district court erred in refusing his request to provide the jury with a definition of \u201cintent.\u201d We review a district court\u2019s refusal to give an offered instruction for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>525 F.3d 1033, 1046 (11th Cir.2008). We will only reverse such a refusal if (1) \u201cthe proffered instruction was substantially correct,\u201d (2) \u201cthe requested instruction was not addressed in charges actually given,\u201d and (3) \u201cfailure to give the instruction seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to present an effective defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1046 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">In providing the jury relevant language from <em>Derose </em>and informing them that \u201cintention\u201d requires more than mere awareness of a firearm, the district court gave the jury appropriate additional guidance on constructive possession. Accordingly, the court\u2019s charges addressed the requested instruction, and the court\u2019s refusal to provide the instruction did not \u201cseriously impair\u201d James\u2019s ability to present his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">C. <em>The District Court Did Not Err in Sentencing James as an \u201cArmed Career Felon.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"AVY\">James also argues the district court erred in determining his sentence because it incorrectly concluded that he is an \u201carmed career felon\u201d under the ACCA. A defendant who violates \u00a7 922(g)(1) and \u201chas three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense ... shall be imprisoned not less than fifteen years.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cWe review de novo whether a prior conviction is a \u2018violent felony\u2019 or a \u2018serious drug offense\u2019 within the meaning of the ACCA.\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>430 F.3d 1150, 1153 (11th Cir.2005). James\u2019s conviction for resisting arrest with violence qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d and his two drug-related convictions are \u201cserious drug offenses.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-14\">First, a crime punishable by more than one year is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d if it \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)\u00a9. We have held that a Florida conviction for resisting arrest with violence meets this standard. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>799 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2015) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Romo-Villalobos, </em>674 F.3d 1246, 1251 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam). Thus, James\u2019s resisting arrest with violence conviction is a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-15\">Second, we have also held that a defendant who has been convicted under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13 has committed a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262, 1266-68 (11th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 2827, 192 L.Ed.2d 864 (2015). Since James has two prior convictions under Fla, Stat. \u00a7 893.13, he has two \u201cserious drug offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">Accordingly, James has three prior convictions that meet the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), and the district court properly sentenced him as an \u201carmed career felon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">D. <em>James Has Failed to Show His Conviction Under \u00a7 922(g)(1) Is Unconstitutional.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">James claims his conviction under \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional, asserting the statute violates the Commerce Clause, both facially and as applied. However, we have repeatedly held \u00a7 922(g)(1) is not a facially unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019 power under the Commerce Clause. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, 1273-74 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam). Additionally, we have determined that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is not unconstitutionally applied to a defendant when, as here, the firearm in question traveled in interstate commerce. <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 390 (11th Cir.1996); see <em>also United States v. Dupree, </em>258 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that brandishing a firearm manufactured in another state suffices to establish the required \u201cminimal nexus to interstate commerce\u201d required by the Commerce Clause). Hence, James\u2019s constitutional claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b827-9\">. The court's original instruction referenced \u2018\u2018intention,\" not \"intent,\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b828-8\">. Defendants meeting the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) are referred to as \u201carmed career felons.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b828-16\">. Given \u201carmed career felon\u201d is defined as a defendant who has three qualifying prior convictions, we need not address James\u2019s other felonies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
