At Walker\u2019s sentencing, the district court applied a sentencing enhancement under United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2K2.1, finding that Walker had two prior felony convictions for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined in \u00a7 4B1.2(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, Walker argues that one of the two convictions relied upon by the district court in applying \u00a7 2K2.1\u2014 second-degree burglary of a dwelling under Florida Statute \u00a7 810.02(l)(b)(l), (3)\u2014 is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-17\">Section \u00a7 4B1.2(a) defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in two ways. A felony offense is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the guidelines if the offense (1) \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>physical force against the person of another\u201d; or (2) \u201cis burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). The bulk of the sentencing hearing in this case focused on whether Walker\u2019s conviction for burglary of a dwelling qualified as a crime of violence under the second definition in \u00a7 4B1.2(a). The district court concluded that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">In his initial brief on appeal, Walker challenges the district court\u2019s crime-of-violence determination on various grounds. He argues that his prior conviction for burglary of a dwelling under Florida law is not a crime of violence under either the \u201cenumerated crimes\u201d clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) \u2014 \u201cis burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives\u201d \u2014 or the \u201cresidual clause\u201d of that subsection \u2014 \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d Furthermore, he contends, if his prior conviction falls under the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) then the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague because it fails to provide, fair notice of its reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Much has changed since Walker was sentenced in July 2014. In June 2015, the Supreme Court held that the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) is unconstitutionally vague and violates due process. <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 2563, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). Like the Sentencing Guidelines, the federal criminal code, through the ACCA, provides for enhanced sentences for certain offenders who have a certain number of qualifying prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA is nearly identical to the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the guidelines, including its incorporation of a residual clause encompassing crimes that \u201cinvolve[] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2); see <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1350 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008) (noting that the only difference in the definitions is that the ACCA uses the term \u201cburglary\u201d in the enumerated crimes clause, whereas the guidelines use \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d). The Supreme Court in <em>Johnson, </em>after reviewing the Court\u2019s own failed attempts to establish a meaningful standard for applying the residual clause, as well as the clause\u2019s inconsistent application throughout the federal circuit courts, held that \u201c[ijnvoking so shapeless a provision to condemn someone to prison for 15 years to life does not comport with the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of due process.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2560.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">After <em>Johnson </em>was issued, we asked the parties to address the decision\u2019s effect on this appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Walker contends, and the government agrees, that <em>Johnson's </em>holding \u2014 that the residual clause in the ACCA is unconstitutionally vague \u2014 also applies to the identically worded residual clause in \u00a7 4Bl,2(a)(2) of the guidelines.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But the government also contends that Walker\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a crime of violence under the \u201cenumerated crimes\u201d clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\">But the more things change, the more they stay the same. We recently held in <em>United States v. Matchett, </em>802 F.3d 1185, 1193-94 (11th Cir.2015), that the residual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) of the guidelines is not unconstitutionally vague because advisory sentencing guidelines cannot be unconstitutionally vague. <em>Id. </em>at 1193-96. We reasoned that <em>Johnson </em>was limited by its own terms to criminal statutes, like the ACCA, that define elements of a crime or fix punishments \u2014 neither of which the advisory guidelines do. <em>Id. </em>at 1193-94. The vagueness doctrine, we explained, rests on a lack of notice, but the Sentencing Guidelines, because they are merely advisory, cannot give rise to an expectation protected by due process. <em>See id. </em>at 1194-95. Therefore, <em>Matchett </em>precludes the success of Walker\u2019s argument based on <em>Johnson </em>that the residual clause in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) of the guidelines is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">As for Walker\u2019s challenge to whether his prior conviction for burglary of a dwelling, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02(l)(b), (3), qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), <em>Matchett </em>likewise controls. We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines and may affirm for any reason supported by the record, even if not relied on by the district court. <em>United States v. Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d 971, 975 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">In <em>Matchett, </em>we addressed whether a prior conviction for burglary of an unoccupied dwelling under Florida Statute \u00a7 810.02(l)(b), (3)(b), qualified as a crime of violence under the guidelines. In analyzing the conviction, we first found that this offense was not a \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d under the enumerated crimes clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a) \u2014 rejecting the government\u2019s position here \u2014 because the Florida offense includes burglary of \u201cthe curtilage\u201d of the dwelling, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.011(2), which takes the offense outside of the federal definition of \u201cgeneric burglary.\u201d <em>Matchett, </em>802 F.3d at 1196-97. In addition, the government had not presented evidence show-</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">ing that the jury found the defendant guilty of all the elements of generic burglary. <em>Id. </em>For the same reasons, Walker\u2019s conviction for burglary of a dwelling under Florida law is not a \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d under the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Nevertheless, we went on to conclude in <em>Matchett </em>that burglary of an unoccupied dwelling under Florida law was \u201ca crime of violence under the residual clause of the career-offender guideline because it \u2018involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)). We concluded that a \u201cburglar\u2019s presence in the curtilage of the structure presents a serious potential risk that violence will ensue and someone will be injured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>466 F.3d 1271, 1275 (11th Cir.2006)). Thus, Walker\u2019s contention that burglary of the curtilage of a structure does not fall within the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) is now foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Consequently, under <em>Matchett, </em>the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) of the guidelines is not unconstitutionally vague, and the district court did not err in finding that Walker\u2019s Florida conviction for burglary of a dwelling qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the residual clause. We affirm Walker\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-10\">. Section \u00a7 2K2.1 assigns a base offense level of 24 if the defendant has at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, as defined by \u00a7 4B 1.2(a),.

As he concedes, this argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v.
