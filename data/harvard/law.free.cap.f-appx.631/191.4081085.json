Johnson argues that the district court erred by finding him guilty of second-degree, assault and battery, a Grade B violation, rather than third-degree assault and battery, a Grade C violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s ultimate decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release for abuse of discretion,\u201d and its \u201cfactual findings underlying a revocation for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Padgett, </em>788 F.3d 370, 373 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 494, 193 L.Ed.2d 360 (2015). To revoke supervised release, a district court need only find a violation of a condition of supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2012); <em>United States v. Copley, </em>978 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir.1992). \u2018\u201c[I]f the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,\u2019 we will not reverse the district court\u2019s finding simply because ... we would have decided the fact differently.\u201d <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>396 F.3d 538, 542 (4th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">In order to find that Johnson committed second-degree assault and battery rather than thud-degree assault and battery, the district court was required to find that \u201cmoderate bodily injury to another person resulted] or ... could have resulted\u201d from the battery. S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 16 \u2014 3\u2014 600(D)(1)(a) (2014). At the time of the offense, the statute defined \u201cmoderate bodily injury\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-12\">physical injury requiring treatment to an organ system of the body other than the skin, muscles, and connective tissues of the body, except when there is penetration of the skin, muscles, and connective tissues that require surgical repair of a complex nature or when treatment of the injuries requires the use of regional or general anesthesia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-13\">\u00a7 16-3-600(A)(2). Having reviewed the record, we find that the district court\u2019s conclusion that such injury could have resulted from Johnson\u2019s actions is plausible. Although the object that Johnson admitted using in the assault was not unusually dangerous, the district court found the force and duration of the assault severe enough to create a real danger of moderate bodily injury, and the record contains sufficient evidence to support this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-14\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We deny as moot Johnson\u2019s motion to expedite. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
