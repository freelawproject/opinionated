By seeking to proceed IFP, Blair is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Blair says the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion on account of his criminal history. He asserts that his criminal-history category overrepresented his history because his category was VI even though most of his convictions were misdemeanors committed when he was young. Citing <em>United States v. Boe, </em>117 F.3d 830 (5th Cir.1997), Blair maintains that the court abused its discretion by implicitly deciding that his criminal history was not of great importance when it sentenced him at the bottom of the guideline range at his initial sentencing and later explicitly ruled that his criminal history was the reason why he should not receive a sentence reduction. Blair contends that the court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors when denying his motion, and he avers that the court created an unwarranted disparity by granting reductions to other defendants with high criminal-history categories. Blair asserts that he should have received a reduction for his positive conduct while incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">The district court\u2019s implicit ruling that Blair was eligible for a reduction and its finding that the original sentence was within his new guideline range were correct. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(4); U.S.S.G., ch. 5, pt. A. The court had before it Blair\u2019s arguments in favor of a reduction; the original and reduced guideline ranges; the information on behavior in prison; and the information from the original sentencing, including his criminal history and the details of his offense. The court denied the motion as a matter of discretion, specifically citing Blair\u2019s criminal history and implicitly invoking the \u00a7 3553(a) factors of protection of the public and the history of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-16\">Although the court did not explicitly discuss the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the arguments were presented to it, and \u201calthough it did not discuss them, we can assume that it considered them.\u201d <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The court was not required to give a detailed explanation to deny Blair\u2019s motion. <em>See id. </em>at 674. Blah- was not entitled to a sentence reduction just because he was eligible for one. <em>See id. </em>at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-17\">Blair has not shown that the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995). His reliance on <em>Boe </em>is misplaced: That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>case is distinguishable because it was based on an old version of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b) that is no longer in effect and on the district court\u2019s failure there to explain adequately what the district court had determined to be an upward departure under the guidelines, factors that are not relevant here. <em>See Boe, </em>117 F.3d at 831-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Blair\u2019s appeal does not present a non-frivolous issue. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the motion to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b286-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
