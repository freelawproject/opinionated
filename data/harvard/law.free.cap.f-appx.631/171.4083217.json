On appeal, Jenkins\u2019 counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether Jenkins\u2019 guilty plea is valid and whether Jenkins\u2019 sentence is reasonable.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Jenkins has filed a supplemental pro se brief, asserting that the district court erred in applying various sentencing. enhancements. Finding no meritorious grounds for appeal, w\u00e9 affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-23\">Because Jenkins did not move to withdraw his guilty plea in the district court, we review the validity of his plea for plain error. <em>United States v. Aplicano-Oyuela, </em>792 F.3d 416, 422 (4th Cir.2015). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>record reveals that the district court substantially complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Jenkins\u2019 plea. The court\u2019s minor omissions do not affect Jenkins\u2019 substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Dav</em>ila, \u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2139, 2147, 186 L.Ed.2d 139 (2013). Moreover, the district court ensured that Jenkins\u2019 plea was knowing, voluntary, and supported by an adequate factual basis. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">We also conclude that Jenkins\u2019 sentence is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. The record reveals no clear error by the district court in applying a two-level enhancement for leadership, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(c) (U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n 2013), and a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3C1.1. <em>See United States v. Andrews, </em>808 F.3d 964, 967-69 (4th Cir.2015) (stating standard of review of \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement); <em>United States v. Steffen, </em>741 F.3d 411, 414 (4th Cir.2013) (stating standard of review of \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement). Nor did the district court plainly err in applying a four-level enhancement for the number of victims in the conspiracy, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(B) (2013). Thus, the district court properly calculated the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range, and the court appropriately explained the sentence in the context of the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012) factors. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Moreover, Jenkins\u2019 within-Guidelines sentence is presumptively substantively reasonable, <em>United States v. Louthian, </em>756 F.3d 295, 306 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 421, 190 L.Ed.2d 293 (2014), and he fails to rebut that presumption on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious grounds for appeal. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform Jenkins, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Jenkins requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Jenkins. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b193-15\"> Jenkins\u2019 attorney also questions the validity of the appeal waiver in the plea agreement. Because the Government does not seek to enforce the waiver, and we will not enforce the waiver sua sponte, we have reviewed the case in accordance with Anders. <em>United States v. Poindexter, </em>492 F.3d 263, 271 (4th Cir.2007); <em>see United States v. Jones, </em>667 F.3d 477, 486 (4th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
