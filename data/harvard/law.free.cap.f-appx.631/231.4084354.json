Flores now seeks leave to proceed in for-ma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of these motions. By seeking leave to proceed IFP, Flores is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Flores first contends that the district court abused its discretion because it in-1 correctly determined his total offense level and the guidelines range after application of the two-level reduction of Amendment 782. The district court originally sen-teneed Flores at a total offense level of 36, which included a one-level downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0. The district court determined that the new total offense level for purposes of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was 35, with a guidelines range of 168 to 210 months. Flores argues that his new total offense level should be 34, with a guidelines range of 151 to 188 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 instructs that a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction only if the amendment \u201clowers the applicable guideline range (i.e., the guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category ... before consideration of any departure provision ... or variance).\u201d \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). \u201cThe Guidelines commentary is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>733 F.3d 161,162-63 (5th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In view of the plain language of the relevant commentary, in determining Flores\u2019s eligibility for a sentence reduction the district court properly calculated the new guidelines range without considering the one-level departure it had applied at the original sentencing. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Flores also contends that the district court abused its discretion by considering only the negative aspects of his post-sentencing conduct, specifically, his three behavioral sanctions, and ignoring his rehabilitative efforts. Here, however, in denying Flores\u2019s motion, the district court had before it Flores\u2019s arguments in favor of a sentenc\u00e9 reduction; the original and reduced guidelines ranges; a synopsis of Flores\u2019s post-sentencing conduct, both good and bad; and information concerning Flores\u2019s original sentencing. The district court determined that Flores was eligible for a sentence reduction, but denied the requested relief as a matter of discretion, citing \u00a7 3553(a) and specifically referring to Flores\u2019s disciplinary sanctions. Although the district' court did not specifically mention Flores\u2019s rehabilitative efforts, a motion referring to such efforts, along with relevant documentation, was presented to the district court, and \u201calthough it did not discuss them, we can assume that it considered them.\u201d <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court was not required to give a detailed explanation of its decision to deny Flores\u2019s motion, nor was it obligated to grant a sentence reduction simply because Flores was eligible. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673-74. In view of the foregoing, Flores cannot show that the district court abused its discretion by denying \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>595 F.3d 1322, 1323 (5th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>2010) (affirming denial of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based upon prison disciplinary record).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Flores\u2019s appeal does not present any nonfrivolous issues, and he has not shown that it is taken in good faith. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his request for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the- appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 245; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
