On appeal, Scott contends that the district court erred in admitting evidence of other acts of misconduct pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-22\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Byers, </em>649 F.3d 197, 213 (4th Cir.2011). \u201cEvidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.\u201d Fed. R.Evid. 404(b)(1). However, such evidence is admissible to prove \u201cmotive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)(2); <em>see United States v. Queen, </em>132 F.3d 991, 994 (4th Cir.1997). \u201cRule 404(b) is viewed as an inclusive rule, admitting all evidence of other crimes or acts except that which tends to prove <em>only </em>criminal disposition.\u201d <em>United States v. Siegel, </em>536 F.3d 306, 317 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo be admissible under Rule 404(b), evidence must be (1) relevant to an issue other than character; (2) necessary; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>and (3) reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The evidence\u2019s prejudicial effect also must not substantially outweigh its probative value. <em>Byers, </em>649 F.3d at 206; <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">In this case, the critical issue at trial was not whether the alleged offenses had occurred, but whether Scott was the individual who had committed them. To prove identity, the Government sought to present evidence relating to Scott\u2019s prior state convictions for extortion, conspiracy, and larceny. The pattern of conduct alleged at Scott\u2019s trial was, in all material respects, strikingly similar to the conduct that underlay his state convictions. Consequently, the prior-act evidence was highly probative of identity and thus admissible under Rule 404(b). <em>See Queen, </em>132 F.3d at 996-97. Moreover, the district court\u2019s careful limiting instructions to the jury mitigated any possibility of unfair prejudice. We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence under Rule 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
