On appeal, the petitioners argue that: (1) this petition is not untimely if it is filed within sixty days after the entry of the suspension order; and (2) in the alternative, the petitioners were denied fair notice of the ten-day deadline to file their petition. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">We uphold an agency\u2019s actions, findings, and conclusions unless they are found to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). Under this standard, \u201cwe must defer to the wisdom of the agency provided their decision is reasoned and rational.\u201d <em>Swaters v. Osmus, </em>568 F.3d 1315, 1322 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>McHenry v. Bond, </em>668 F.2d 1185, 1190 (11th Cir.1982)). An agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations is controlling unless \u201cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <em>Auer v. Robbins, </em>519 U.S. 452, 461, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">The relevant facts are these. On September 25, 2014, the Commission issued a Suspension Order pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78 <em>l </em>(k)(l), which suspended trading in the common stock shares of Global Green, Inc., due to concerns regarding \u201cthe adequacy and accuracy of press releases concerning the company\u2019s operations.\u201d <em>All Grade Mining, Inc., </em>79 Fed.Reg. 58399-01 (SEC Sept. 29, 2014). By the Order\u2019s terms, the trading suspension terminated on October 8, 2014. Global Green, parent company National Health Institute Laboratories, LLC, and Mehran Ghazvini, an officer and director for both Global Green and National Health Institute Laboratories, filed with the Commission on October 23, 2014, a Sworn Petition for Termination of Suspension of Trading Securities. Because the petition was not submitted during the ten days that the trading suspension was in effect, the Commission dismissed the petition as untimely. The dismissal was based on the Commission\u2019s own interpretation of Rule 550, which it read to require that a petition to terminate a suspension must be filed before the suspension elapses.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">The Commission has authority under the Securities Exchange Act \u201csummarily to suspend trading in any security (other than an exempted security) for a period not exceeding 10 business days.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78 <em>l </em>(E)(1)(A). . Rule of Practice 550 permits any person adversely affected by such a suspension to \u201cfile a sworn petition with the Secretary requesting that the suspension be terminated. The petition shall set forth the reasons why the petitioner believes the suspension of trading should not continue and state with particularity the facts upon which the petitioner relies.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.550(a). The Exchange Act also provides for judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals. \u201cA person aggrieved by a final order of the Commission entered pursuant to this chapter may obtain review ... by filing in ... court, within sixty days after the entry of the order, a written petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>requesting that the order be modified or set aside in whole or in part.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78y(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Petitioners argue that because the Rule of Practice does not provide a deadline by which petitions must be filed, adversely affected parties should be permitted the same sixty days to seek agency review of a suspension order as they are provided to seek judicial review of that order. Such an approach, however, would be inconsistent with the Rule\u2019s text and purpose. The Rule provides that petitions should explain why \u201cthe suspension of trading should not continue,\u201d and request that the suspension \u201cbe terminated.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.550(a). Such language plainly contemplates that petitions will be filed during the ten days that the suspension order is in effect. As the Commission recently explained, \u201cOnce a temporary suspension order has expired, which typically happens after ten days, thex-e is no suspension to be \u2018terminated\u2019 or discontinued; the door to relief under Rule 550 is shut.\u201d <em>Accredited Bus. Consolidators, </em>Exchange Act Release No. 73420, 2014 WL 5386875, *1 (Oct. 23, 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">This implicit ten-day deadline is consistent with the principle that administrative remedies must generally be exhausted before judicial review is available. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78y(c)(l) (\u201cNo objection to an order or rule of the Commission, for which review is sought under this section, may be considered by the court unless it was urged before the Commission or there was reasonable ground for failure to do so.\u201d). The Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Rule recognizes that the ten-day deadline for submitting a petition advances important interests of efficiency and finality, and ensures a complete administrative record will be developed prior to review by the Court of Appeals. This interpretation \u201csensibly conforms to the purpose and wording of the regulations,\u201d <em>Sierra Club v. Johnson, </em>436 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Legal Envtl, Assistance Found., Inc. v. EPA, </em>276 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2001)), and thus is entitled to our deference. <em>See Auer, </em>519 U.S. at 461, 117 S.Ct. 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">We also find no merit in Petitioners\u2019 claim that they were denied fair notice of the ten-day deadline to file their petition. The fair notice doctrine prevents \u201cdeference from validating the application of a regulation that fails to give fair warning of the conduct it prohibits or requires.\u201d <em>Gates &amp; Fox Co. v. OSHRC, </em>790 F.2d 154, 156 (D.C.Cir.1986). However, this doctrine is applied only in a \u201cvery limited set of cases.\u201d <em>Suburban Air Freight, Inc. v. Transp. Sec. Admin., </em>716 F.3d 679, 684 (D.C.Cir.2013). For example, the doctrine has been applied where the agency\u2019s interpretation was \u201cso far from a reasonable person\u2019s understanding of the regulations\u201d that regulated parties could not have been fairly informed of the agency\u2019s perspective, <em>Gen. Elec. Co. v. EPA </em>53 F.3d 1324, 1330 (D.C.Cir.1995); where an agency changed course with respect to its interpretation of a governing statute, <em>FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2307, 2317-18, 183 L.Ed.2d 234 (2012); and where the Commission imposed civil penalties \u201cpursuant to a substantial change in its enforcement policy,\u201d <em>Upton v. SEC, </em>75 F.3d 92, 98 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">Here, we cannot say that the Commission\u2019s interpretation that a petition to \u201cterminate\u201d a suspension must be filed while the suspension remains in effect is inconsistent with a reasonable person\u2019s expectations, and there is no suggestion that the Commission\u2019s interpretation or enforcement policy has shifted over time. This record does not present the rare case where due process requires we vacate an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>enforcement action despite an agency\u2019s proper interpretation of its own rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
