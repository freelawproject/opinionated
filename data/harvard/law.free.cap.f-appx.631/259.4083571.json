Moses has moved for leave to withdraw and has filed briefs in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Moses has filed responses. The record is .not sufficiently developed to allow us to make a fair evaluation of Moses\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel; we therefore decline to consider the claims without prejudice to collateral review. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 123, 190 L.Ed.2d 94 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"ADM\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s briefs and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Moses\u2019s responses. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See, </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Moses\u2019s motion for the appointment of new counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b281-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
