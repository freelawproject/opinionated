We have reviewed the administrative record and Owusu\u2019s claims, and find them to be without merit. We accordingly find no abuse of discretion in the denial of reconsideration, <em>see Narine v. Holder, </em>559 F.3d 246, 249 (4th Cir.2009), and deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Owusu </em>(B.I.A. Apr. 20, 2015). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-19\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
