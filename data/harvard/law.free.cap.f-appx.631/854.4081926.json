On appeal, Iacullo argues that the district court failed to calculate his amended guideline range and did not consider the statutory sentencing fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>tors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Iacullo was indicted in 1995 by a federal grand jury for his role in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. He pled not guilty and proceeded to trial, and a jury found him guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and of attempted possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. Under the 1995 Sentencing Guidelines, Ia-cullo was assigned a base offense level of 38 and a criminal history category of I. This established a guideline range of 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">In addition to describing the crimes of conviction, which arose out of a conspiracy to transport approximately 400 kilograms of cocaine from Florida to New York, the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) states that Iacullo had been involved in other drug-trafficking activity. For example, the PSR states that Iacullo had been involved on at least three occasions in February and May of 1992 in \u201cother successful transactions of cocaine\u201d involving \u201c[sjeveral hundreds of kilograms of cocaine ... in each transaction.\u201d PSR \u00b6 24. Iacullo did not object to this paragraph in the PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">. The district court adopted the factual findings and guideline computation of the PSR and sentenced Iacullo to a total term of 293 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court found that a sentence at the high end of the guideline range was appropriate \u201cgiven Mr. Iacullo\u2019s prior significant involvement in drug trafficking activities.\u201d The court also noted that it would have imposed a longer sentence based on Iacullo\u2019s trial testimony had his guideline range been higher.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">In 2014, the Sentencing Commission issued Amendment 782, which reduced the offense level for certain drug-trafficking offenses, including Iacullo\u2019s, by two levels. U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 782. In October of that year, Iacullo, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a motion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 782 and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. He asserted that Amendment 782 reduced his base offense level from 38 to 36. Im support of his request for an amended sentence of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment, he cited his extensive post-offense rehabilitation, supported by attached documentation, including his completion of over 600 hours of various life-skills coursework while incarcerated. The government did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">The district court denied Iacullo\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in a single-page order. After stating that it had \u201ccarefully reviewed\u201d the motion and \u201cthe entire court file,\u201d the court explained its reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-12\">According to Paragraph 24 of the Revised Presentence Investigation Report (PSR), to which Defendant Dino Iacullo did not object, Defendant was allegedly involved in other successful transactions involving cocaine. Several hundred kilograms of cocaine were involved in each transaction that took place on at least three occasions, during the months of February and May, 1992.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-13\">Based on the Defendant\u2019s prior drug activity, the Court, exercising its discretion, will deny the Defendant\u2019s request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-14\">Iacullo moved for reconsideration of the court\u2019s order, explaining that he had been indicted separately for the conduct in paragraph 24 and sentenced to a concurrent term of 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. He again emphasized that he had strived to better himself during the time he had been in prison and that he had provided assistance to the government with its drug investigations. The district court denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>the motion for reconsideration without explanation. Iacullo now brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1241-42 (11th Cir.2010). A district court abuses its discretion by failing to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures when making a determination under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id, </em>We hold <em>pro se </em>pleadings to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, liberally construe them. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">A district court may reduce a term of imprisonment if a defendant\u2019s sentence is \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must <em>engage in a </em>two-part analysis. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-92, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">First, the court must recalculate the applicable guideline range by substituting only the amended guideline for the one originally used. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). The primary purpose of this step is to determine a defendant\u2019s eligibility for a sentence reduction. A reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized unless the amended guideline has \u201cthe effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.(A) (\u201cEligibility for consideration under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is triggered only by [a retroactive amendment] that lowers the applicable guideline range \u2014 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">Second, if a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction, the district court must decide whether to exercise its discretion to reduce the defendant\u2019s original sentence. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. In evaluating whether and to what extent a sentence reduction is warranted, the court \u201cmust consider the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as well as public safety considerations, and may consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(B). The district court is not required to articulate the applicability of each \u00a7 3553(a) factor as long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account. <em>Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">Here, at the first step, we find that the court erred in failing to \u201crecalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines.\u201d <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780. Had the court done so, it would have substituted the amended guideline for the one originally used, which would have reduced Iacullo\u2019s base offense level from 38 to 36, resulting in an amended guideline range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. Thus, Iacullo was eligible for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>Nonetheless, the error is harmless. The district court\u2019s order reflects that the court understood Iacullo was eligible for a sentence reduction, so it proceeded directly to the second step of deciding \u201cwhether, in its discretion, it will elect to impose the newly calculated sentence under the amended guidelines or retain the original sentence.\u201d <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. At the second step, the court \u201cexercise[ed] its discretion\u201d to retain Iacullo\u2019s original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Iacullo\u2019s \u00a7 3583(c)(2) motion. The court is not required to reduce the sentence of an eligible defendant under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1257 (\u201c[The court\u2019s] decision whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence, and to what extent, remains discretionary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">And, while the court\u2019s order does not go into detail, the record demonstrates that the court adequately considered pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See id. </em>at 1256. The court stated that it had \u201ccarefully reviewed\u201d Iacullo\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, which discussed his eligibility for relief and his post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, and then denied the motion based on his \u201cprior drug activity,\u201d as reflected in the PSR. Iacullo\u2019s rehabilitative efforts and his prior drug activity are both relevant to \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). In addition, the same district judge presided over both the original sentencing and the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, which indicates that the court was aware of the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it denied Iacullo\u2019s \u00bfnotion, and the court\u2019s justification for the sentence remained the same. <em>See United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir.1997) (citing, in support of its conclusion that the record as a whole showed that the court considered the pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the fact that \u201cthe same district court judge who sentenced Defendant originally was the one who declined to resent\u00e9nce him\u201d). In addition, while the court was permitted to consider Iacullo\u2019s post-sentencing rehabilitative conduct, it was not required to do so. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.l(B)(iii) (stating that \u201cthe court <em>may consider </em>post-sentencing conduct of the defendant that occurred after imposition\u201d of the sentence in determining whether and to what extent a reduction is warranted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">We emphasize that \u201cthe abuse of discretion standard allows a range of choice for the district court, so long as that choice does not constitute a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Drury, </em>396 F.3d 1303, 1315 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted). Absent a clear error of judgment or mistake of law, we must defer to the district court\u2019s determination even if we would have decided the issue differently had it been our call. <em>See id. </em>Here, we cannot say that the court committed a clear error of judgment in denying Iacul-lo\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">The denial of Iacullo\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction based on \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 782 is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-9\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors include the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the applicable guideline range, and the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, and to protect the public. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(2), (4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b879-7\">. To the extent that Iacullo argues that the district judge should have recused, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455, he has not presented a valid reason to doubt the judge\u2019s impartiality. <em>See United States v. Torkington, </em>874 F.2d 1441, 1446 (11th Cir.1989). Because we affirm the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>trict court's order, we need not decide whether the case should be reassigned on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
