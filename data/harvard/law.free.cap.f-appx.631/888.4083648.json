She sued the Board, Regents University, and Emory for violating several federal and state laws. All three defendants moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The district court granted the motions, concluding that some of Abreu-Velez\u2019s claims were time-barred and that she had failed to plead certain factual predicates necessary to establish the others. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">Abreu-Velez worked as a research assistant and coordinator at the Medical College. Her job involved assisting with clinical trials. She believed some of those trials violated various federal and state laws and she reported her belief to her supervisors. In 2004, shortly after she reported her concerns to her supervisors, she was fired. Abreu-Velez couldn\u2019t find work elsewhere in the Medical College, but eventually got a job at Emory. She held that job until 2005, when she was fired for allegedly making a racist remark to a colleague. Abreu-Velez continued to publicize and report her concerns about the clinical trials, complaining to the FBI and the United States Attorney\u2019s Office. She says her continued complaints prompted members of the Board and officials at Regents University and Emory to orchestrate numerous \u201cattacks against [her] person and property,\u201d ranging from interfering with her green card renewal application, to initiating baseless inquiries about her medical license, to vandalism and assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">Abreu-Velez filed this lawsuit in 2013, alleging that the defendants violated federal and Georgia law by combining to \u201cattack\u201d her in retaliation for speaking out about the clinical trials. Count I of the complaint, brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985(3), alleges that the defendants conspired to and did violate her First Amendment rights. Count II alleges that their retaliatory conduct violated the Georgia Whistleblower Act (GWA), O.C.G.A. \u00a7 45-1-4. And Count III alleges that their retaliatory conduct violated the federal False Claims Act of 1986(FCA), 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>On the defendants\u2019 motions, the district court dismissed Abreu-Velez\u2019s complaint. It concluded that her GWA and FCA claims were time-barred and that her First Amendment claims \u201clack[ed] a plausible allegation that the adverse actions were causally related to her protected conduct.\u201d Abreu-Velez\u2019s GWA and FCA claims are time-barred. The GWA allows \u201c[a] public employee who has been the object of retaliation\u201d to institute a civil action, but only \u201cwithin one year after discovering the retaliation or within three years after the retaliation, whichever is earlier.\u201d O.G.C.A. \u00a7 45-l-4(e)(l). For purposes of the GWA, \u201cretaliation\u201d is limited to \u201cadverse employment action[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 45-l-4(a)(5). Similarly, the FCA entitles an employee to relief if she is retaliated against \u201cin the terms and conditions of employment\u201d for preventing the filing of a false claim, but only if she files her retaliation claim within three years of the date on which her employer retaliated against her. 31 U.S.C.- \u00a7 3730(h)(1), (3). Abreu-Velez brought this lawsuit in late 2013, even though the only adverse employment actions she alleges took place in 2004 (when she was fired from the Medical College) and 2005 (when she was fired from Emory). Her GWA and FCA claims are thus well outside the applicable statutory limitations periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Abreu-Velez\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim fails because she hasn\u2019t pleaded facts sufficient to establish a nexus between the \u201cattacks\u201d of which she complains and the speech she claims prompted those \u201cattacks.\u201d To survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff pursuing a First Amendment retaliation claim must allege facts establishing \u201ca causal relationship between the retaliatory action and the protected speech.\u201d <em>Smith v. Mosley, </em>532 F.3d 1270, 1276 (11th Cir.2008). Abreu-Velez\u2019s complaint is devoid of factual allegations that could establish such a causal nexus. For example, she alleges that her new car was vandalized in 2012 and that the office where she works was vandalized in 2013, but does not articulate any concrete factual basis for believing that these acts of vandalism were perpetrated by the defendants or caused by her complaints about the clinical trials. Likewise, she pleads \u201cintrusions onto her residential property ... by [ ] strangers,\u201d but doesn\u2019t allege any basis for believing that those strangers were affiliated with the defendants. Such speculative and conclusory allegations won\u2019t survive a motion to dismiss. <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">The closest her complaint comes to making out a plausible First Amendment retaliation claim is with its allegations that the former dean of Emory\u2019s medical school caused members of Emory\u2019s human resources department to \u201cinterfer[e] with the processing of [Abreu-Velez\u2019s green card renewal] application.\u201d But this allegation is based on nothing more than the allegation that some documents went missing from Abreu-Velez\u2019s application. The complaint does not provide any factual basis for inferring, as Abreu-Velez believes, that the documents were taken as opposed to mislaid, or why she thinks it was Emory employees\u2014as opposed to someone else\u2014 who took them or arranged to have them taken. Without facts to substantiate them, her allegations about her green card renewal application are nothing more than a series of naked assertions, and naked assertions can\u2019t withstand a motion to dismiss. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">That leaves only Abreu-Velez\u2019s claim under \u00a7 1985(3), which the district court didn\u2019t address in its opinion dismissing the complaint. Dismissal of the \u00a7 1985(3) claim was proper because \u00a7 1985(3)\u2014part of the Ku Klux Klan Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>of 1871 \u2014 simply does not cover the kinds of wrongs Abreu-Velez alleges. To state a claim under \u00a7 1985(3), a plaintiff must plead, among other things, that her injuries stem from some \u201cclass-based invidiously discriminatory animus.\u201d <em>Lucero v. Operation Rescue, </em>954 F.2d 624, 628 (11th Cir.1992). The complaint alleges that the defendants harmed Abreu-Velez because of her membership in the \u201cclass\u201d of whistleblowers. Whistleblowers, however, are not the kind of \u201cclass\u201d that \u00a7 1985(3) protects. <em>See Childree v. UAP/GA CHEM, Inc., </em>92 F.3d 1140, 1147 (11th Cir.1996). The district court was correct to dismiss Abreu-Velez\u2019s \u00a7 1985(3) claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
