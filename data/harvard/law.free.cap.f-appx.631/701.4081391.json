(\u201cND Properties\u201d), which owned the building in which the restaurant operated. After 3455 failed to make monthly payments under the terms of the lease, 3455 and ND Properties entered into a consent agreement that compelled 3455 to make outstanding payments and terminate possession of the space. The parties disputed 3455\u2019s obligations following its dispossession, and 3455 filed a motion for declaratory judgment to clarify its rights and responsibilities. The district court granted ND Properties\u2019s motions for judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment and awarded damages in excess of $770,000. After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b725-15\">In June 1998, 3455 entered into a fifteen-year lease (the \u201cLease\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with Cousins Loret Venture, LLC (\u201cCousins\u201d) to rent space for a restaurant (the \u201cpremises\u201d) in a building in the Buckhead area of Atlanta (the \u201cPinnacle building\u201d). Relevant to this appeal, the Lease contained the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-16\">\u00b6 5.1 <em>Payment of Rent. </em>Tenant hereby agrees to pay all Base Rental and due and payable under this Lease commencing on the Rent Commencement Date and continuing thereafter throughout the Lease Term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-17\">\u00b6 11 <em>Late Charges. </em>Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as a late charge in the event any ... sum to be paid hereunder is not paid when due, interest on the amount past due at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (i) the then Prime Rate in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>effect from time to time plus two percentage points; (ii) eighteen percent (18%) per annum; or (iii) the highest rate permitted by law, from due date until paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-4\">\u00b6 18.2 <em>Remedies. </em>Upon the occurrence of any of the aforesaid Events of Default, Landlord shall have the option to pursue any one or more of the following remedies without any further notice or demand whatsoever:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">\u00b6 18.2.1 Landlord may terminate this Lease, in which event Tenant shall immediately surrender the Demised Premises to Landord....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">\u00b6 18.2.2 Landlord may terminate Tenant\u2019s right of possession (but not this Lease) and enter upon and take possession of the Demised Premises ... without thereby releasing Tenant from any liability hereunder, without terminating this Lease ... and, if Landlord so elects, make such commercially reasonable alterations, rede-corations and repairs as, in Landlord\u2019s judgment, may be necessary to relet the Demised Premises, and Landlord may, but shall be under no obligation to do so, relet the Demised Premises ... and Tenant shall be liable for Landlord\u2019s reasonable expenses in redecorating and restoring the Demised Premises and all reasonable costs incident to such re-letting,...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">\u00b6 30 <em>Surrender of Premises. </em>Upon the expiration or other termination of this Lease, Tenant shall quit and surrender to Landlord the Demised Premises, broom clean in the same condition as at the date of Substantial Completion ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-9\">except for reasonable wear and tear..., Subject to Article 58 hereof, Tenant shall remove all personalty and equipment not attached to the Demised Premises which it has placed upon the Demised Premises, and Tenant shall restore the Demised Premises to the condition immediately preceding the time of placement thereof. If Tenant shall fail or refuse to remove all of Tenant\u2019s effects, personalty and equipment from the Demised Premises upon the expiration or termination of this Lease for any cause whatsoever or upon the Tenant being dispossessed by process of law or otherwise, such effects, personalty and equipment shall be deemed conclusively to be abandoned and may be appropriated, sold, stored, destroyed or otherwise disposed of by Landlord without written notice to Tenant or any other party and without obligation to account for them.... The covenants and conditions of this Article 30 shall survive any expiration or termination of this Lease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\">\u00b6 58 <em>Security Agreement. </em>Landlord shall at all times have, and Tenant does hereby grant to Landlord, a valid first lien and security interest in and to (i) all of the trade fixtures, furniture, furnishings, equipment, and personal property of Tenant____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">In 2004, Cousins sold the Pinnacle building and assigned its rights and obligations to ND Properties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In April 2009, ND Properties granted the Georgia Department of Transportation (\u201cGDOT\u201d) a right-of-way and easement to the grounds for road improvements and a sidewalk. Thereafter, GDOT began construction on the area outside 3455\u2019s restaurant, closing traffic lanes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>and limiting access to the driveway of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">During this same time frame, the restaurant\u2019s business decreased due in part to the recession, and 3455 failed to pay rent oh multiple occasions. As a result, ND Properties filed several dispossessory actions between 2009 and 2011. In July 2011, ND Properties initiated an action to dispossess 3455 based on the latter\u2019s failure to timely pay rent due on the first of the month (which constituted defaulting on the Lease). To resolve this action, 3455 and ND Properties entered into a consent agreement (the \u201cConsent Agreement\u201d) in which 3455 agreed to; (1) make rent, parking and utilities payments through November 2011 by the end of August 2011; (2) vacate the premises by November 30, 2011; (3) not remove any personal property; and (4) \u201ctimely perform[] all of its obligations under [the] Lease Agreement dated June 11, 1998.\u201d The Consent Agreement further stated that ND Properties\u2019s taking possession of the premises would not constitute \u201can acceptance\u201d of 3455\u2019s surrender of the premises under the Lease terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">3455 made the payments as required under the Consent Agreement and vacated the premises on November 30, 2011. It did not, however, make any payments beyond that date. ND Properties sent two demand letters seeking payment under the Lease for the remainder of the Lease term and requiring 3455 to clean and repair the premises. 3455 then filed an action for declaratory judgment in Gwinnett County Superior Court to determine whether (1) 3455 was responsible for rent payment under the Lease after it vacated the premises; (2) ND Properties\u2019s retention of personal property was permissible and should be used to satisfy any claims; (3) the Lease terminated upon the partial taking of the premises by GDOT; and (4) 3455 had any duty to clean and repair the premises.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">ND Properties removed the action to federal court and moved for judgment on the pleadings as to whether the dispossession terminated 3455\u2019s obligation to pay rent through the remainder of the Lease term. In an order dated February 12, 2013, the district court granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that the Lease contained an explicit and detailed provision allowing post-eviction rent and that this provision was enforceable under Georgia law.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">ND Properties subsequently amended its answer to assert a counterclaim for amounts due and owing under the Lease. Following discovery, ND Properties moved for summary judgment on 3455\u2019s remaining claims and on its counterclaim. ND Properties sought to recover $772,788.34 in unpaid rent, parking fees, utilities charges, and costs incurred in re-letting the premises; it also sought to recover $77,303.83 in attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00b6 18.2.3 of the Lease and Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 13-1-11.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">In opposing summary judgment, 3455 argued that ND Properties (1) was required to sell the personal property 3455 left behind when it vacated the premises and credit 3455\u2019s account with the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>ceeds; (2) breached its covenant of quiet enjoyment and duty of good faith when it agreed to the GDOT taking and failed to notify 3455; (3) was not entitled to parking fees and utilities for the period after 3455 vacated the premises because the Consent Agreement did not allow for such additional payment; (4) was entitled to only those costs that were reasonable for re-letting the space, but not the costs of extensive renovations; and (5) had not proven the amount of interest it requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">In an August 5, 2014 order, the district court granted summary judgment to ND Properties, finding that the Lease did not terminate upon the grant to GDOT because (a) there was no evidence any part of the premises was taken;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (b) there was no evidence the alleged taking impacted 3455\u2019s use of the premises; and (c) even if there was a taking of the premises, 3455 never notified ND Properties of its intent to terminate, as required under the terms of the Lease. The district court further found that ND Properties had the right to do whatever it wished with the personal property on the premises under the terms of the Lease and the Consent Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">With respect to ND Properties\u2019s counterclaim, the district court found that the Lease unambiguously allowed ND Properties to collect rent after 3455 vacated the premises through the end of the Lease term, and that under the terms of the Consent Agreement, ND Properties could collect parking and utilities charges for the time period after 3455 vacated the premises. Addressing the costs of re-letting the space, the district court found that the Lease provision allowing ND Properties to recoup this cost was enforceable. The district court noted that ND Properties only sought about ten percent of the total amount expended to release the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">Finally, the district court found that ND Properties presented sufficient evidence (namely declarations from Linda Beau-champ, a property manager responsible for the Pinnacle building) for the applicable interest rate and the total amount of accrued' interest to be properly calculated. The Lease set the interest rate at the prime rate plus 2%, and Beauchamp used the applicable prime rate of 3.25%, plus 2%, and calculated the interest for the relevant time period. Accordingly, the district court granted ND Properties\u2019s motion for summary judgment and awarded damages totaling $755,048.84. This amount consisted of $464,074.49 in rent, $28,750.09 in interest, $16,500.22 in parking fees, $22,839.76 in utilities, and $222,884.28 in costs associated with re-letting the space. The district court deferred a decision on ND Properties\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees in its counterclaim and required additional evidence of the amount owed pursuant to \u00b6 18.2.3 of the Lease and Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 13-1-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">Subsequently, ND Properties filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $75,572.38. In an October 10, 2014 order, the district court granted this motion, but awarded ND Properties $39,606.84 in attorney\u2019s fees based on Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 13-1-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-12\">.This is 3455\u2019s appeal as to the two orders granting judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment. 3455 does not appeal the attorney\u2019s fees order.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-13\">II.

Harris, </em>756 F.3d 1351, 1357 (11th Cir.2014). Under Georgia law,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">[t]he construction of contracts involves three steps. At least initially, construction is a matter of law for the court. First, the trial court must decide whether the language is clear and unambiguous. If it is, the court simply enforces the contract according to its clear terms; the contract alone is looked to for its meaning. Next, if the contract is ambiguous in some respect, the court must apply the rules of contract construction to resolve the ambiguity. Finally, if the ambiguity remains after applying the rules of construction, the issue of what the ambiguous language means and what the parties intended must be resolved by a jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-8\"><em>City of Baldwin v. Woodard &amp; Curran, Inc., </em>293 Ga. 19, 743 S.E.2d 381, 389 (Ga.Ct.App.2013) (alteration in original) (citation omitted). \u201cThe existence or nonexistence of an ambiguity is a question of law for the court. If the court determines that an ambiguity exists, however, a jury question does not automatically arise, but rather the court must first attempt to resolve the ambiguity....\u201d <em>Simpson v. Infinity Select Ins. Co., </em>269 Ga.App. 679, 605 S.E.2d 39, 42 (2004) (internal citation omitted). \u201c[Ljanguage is unambiguous if it is capable of only one reasonable interpretation.\u201d <em>Hammer Corp. v.

Hutton, </em>172 Ga.App. 836, 324 S.E.2d 744, 745 (1984) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">On appeal, 3455 challenges the district court\u2019s rulings granting ND Properties (1) judgment on the pleadings; (2) summary judgment on 3455\u2019s claim relating to personal property left on the premises; and (3) summary judgment on its counterclaim. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">A. Judgment on the Pleadings</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">3455 first argues that the district court erred in granting judgment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>pleadings because it failed to consider (a) whether the Lease provision allowing post-eviction rental payments violated public policy and (b) whether ND Properties\u2019s actions showed that it had accepted 3455\u2019s surrender of the premises, thereby terminating the Lease. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The Lease provided that \u201cTenant hereby agrees to pay all Base Rental and due and payable under this Lease ... continuing thereafter throughout the Lease Term.\u201d Lease 115.1. It further provided that \u201cLandlord may terminate Tenant\u2019s right of possession (but not this Lease) and enter upon and take possession of the Demised Premises ... without thereby releasing Tenant from any liability hereunder [and] without terminating this Lease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 18.2.2. Moreover, the Consent Agreement itself stated that 3455 would \u201ctimely perform! ] all of its obligations under [the] Lease Agreement \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">These provisions expressly and unambiguously demonstrate that the parties agreed ND Properties could collect post-eviction rent. Such terms are enforceable under Georgia law. <em>See Int\u2019l Biochemical Indus., Inc. v. Jamestown Mgmt. Corp., </em>262 Ga.App. 770, 586 S.E.2d 442, 445 (2003) (\u201cAlthough the general rule is that when a landlord evicts a tenant and takes possession of the premises, the lease is terminated and the right to claim rent which accrues after eviction is extinguished, the parties to a lease may contract to hold the lessee liable for post-eviction rent \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Although 3455 argues to the contrary, the record shows that the district court did consider 3455\u2019s argument that its payment of post-eviction rent violated public policy. In addition, 3455\u2019s public policy argument misses the mark. 3455 contends that the Lease violated public policy by leaving it to ND Properties\u2019s sole discretion whether to re-let the premises. <em>See </em>Lease 18.2.2. (upon taking possession of the premises, \u201cLandlord may, but shall be under no obligation to do so, relet the Demised Premises\u201d). 3455 cites cases involving acceleration clauses (permitting the advance collection of future rent) which were deemed unreasonable and oppressive. <em>See Nobles v. Jiffy Mkt. Food Store Corp., </em>260 Ga.App. 18, 579 S.E.2d 63, 65-66 (2003). However, <em>Nobles </em>is not on-point because the Lease here contained no such acceleration clause. Further, under the Consent Agreement, 3455 agreed to comply with the terms of the Lease, which included the monthly payment of future rent as it came due. This is not an acceleration case.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Acknowledging that no acceleration clause exists in the Lease, 3455 notes that, under Georgia law, a landlord must mitigate its damages following a tenant\u2019s surrender of leased property by re-renting it. <em>See Allen v. Harkness Stone Co., </em>271 Ga.App. 397, 609 S.E.2d 647, 650 (2005) (noting that, upon a tenant\u2019s surrender and the landlord\u2019s acceptance of the surrender, the landlord is \u201crequired to make reasonable efforts to re-lease the premises and mitigate his damages\u201d). 3455 complains that the Lease it signed did not have an express clause requiring ND Properties to mitigate, and thus the Lease is invalid as to post-eviction rent. However, 3455 cites no support for finding provisions of the Lease or Consent Agreement invalid for failing to impose an express duty to mitigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">In any event, the record shows that ND Properties did re-let the premises and credited 3455 for the amount it received in the new lease, thereby mitigating its damages. 3455 fails to show that ND Properties\u2019s collection of post-eviction rent violated public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>To the extent that 3455 argues that ND Properties accepted a surrender of the premises or otherwise acted in a manner showing acceptance of surrender, we disagree. The Consent Agreement specifically provided that \u201cneither ... Landlord\u2019s consent to this order, nor Landlord\u2019s taking possession of the leased premises shall constitute an acceptance by Landlord of Tenant\u2019s surrender of the leased premises.\u201d Moreover, seeking to enforce a \u201cbroom clean\u201d condition, which 3455 contends was a requirement only under \u00b6 30 of the Lease (governing \u201cSurrender of Premises\u201d), was not conduct showing an acceptance of surrender. Again, in the Consent Agreement, the parties expressly agreed that ND Properties\u2019s taking possession was not an acceptance of 3455\u2019s surrender. Accordingly, there was no error in the district court\u2019s grant of judgment on the pleadings as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">B. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">3455 next argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because ND Properties failed to act in a commercially reasonable manner in (a) improperly retaining possession of 3455\u2019s personal property and (b) failing to promptly auction all the personal property and apply the proceeds towards 3455\u2019s outstanding debt pursuant to \u00b6 58 of the Lease. The district court found that the property 3455 left behind was not governed by \u00b6 58 of the Lease because 3455 had been dispossessed of the premises under the Consent Agreement, and thus \u00b6 30 of the Lease, which gave ND Properties control over \u201cabandoned\u201d personalty and equipment on the premises, governed. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Under \u00b6 6 of the Consent Agreement, 3455 was to vacate the premises and leave behind all personal property. Paragraph 58 of the Lease gave ND Properties a security interest in 3455\u2019s personal property on the premises as collateral for any outstanding debt. This paragraph further provided that \u201cupon the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder, Landlord shall have the remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code of Georgia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">Paragraph 30 of the Lease provided that \u201cIf Tenant shall fail or refuse to remove ... personalty and equipment ... upon the Tenant being dispossessed by process of law or otherwise, such effects ... shall be deemed conclusively to be abandoned and may be appropriated, sold, stored, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of by Landlord without ... obligation to account for them____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the two Lease provisions above create an ambiguity in the Lease, we turn to general rules of contract interpretation to resolve it. <em>City of Baldwin, </em>743 S.E.2d at 389. Under general rules of contract interpretation, a specific provision prevails over a broader one. <em>Tower Projects, LLC v. Marquis Tower, Inc., </em>267 Ga.App. 164, 598 S.E.2d 883, 885 (2004) (concluding that a more specific provision prevailed over a general provision). And we will \u201cavoid any construction that renders portions of the contract language meaningless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">Here, \u00b630 applies more specifically to the status of personalty in the case of dispossession, whereas \u00b658 speaks more generally about an interest in the personalty as collateral as a means to cover debt in the event of default. The paragraph covering Events of Default provides that ND Properties may, as a remedy for default, dispossess 3455 of the premises but not terminate the Lease. This is precisely the avenue that ND Properties selected, thus triggering the specific provision of \u00b630 over the more general provision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>\u00b6 58. To construe the contract otherwise would render portions of \u00b630 meaningless.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">To the extent that 3455 argues it did not \u201cabandon\u201d its personalty and equipment because it was required to leave property behind under the terms of the Consent Agreement, this argument fails. Paragraph 30 of the Lease stated that personalty and equipment that 3455 \u201cfail[ed] or refuse[d] to remove\u201d from the premises upon being dispossessed \u201cby process of law or otherwise\u201d was to be deemed abandoned. The Lease\u2019s definition of abandoned property is enforceable. See <em>Kurc v. Herren, </em>196 Ga.App. 331, 396 S.E.2d 62, 63 (1990) (treating property left after termination of lease as abandoned not because it was left on the premises but rather because it was \u201cabandoned\u201d as that term was defined in the lease). In the Consent Agreement, the parties agreed that 3455 would leave the premises and leave personal property behind. 3455 thus contracted to a situation falling within a plain reading of \u00b6 30. 3455 cannot now challenge that to which it already agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Parties are free to contract on any terms as they see fit, absent illegality or public policy concerns, and courts will not interfere with the parties\u2019 decision. <em>See id. </em>Having contracted to leave the property on the premises, 3455 cannot now claim it was forced to do so; and in failing to remove its property from the premises, it abandoned the premises within the meaning of \u00b6 30. Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">C. Counterclaim</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">Finally, 3455 argues that the district court erred by finding in favor of ND Properties on its counterclaim for damages because the district court reached the amounts awarded based on the declarations of Linda Beauchamp. On appeal, 3455 contends that the declarations were inadequate because they contained hearsay, lacked proper foundation, and were not supported by any business records or competent testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">A review of the record shows that 3455 made the hearsay argument before the district court only as to attorney\u2019s fees<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and not as to the unpaid rent, utilities, parking fees and cost to re-let. Our case law is clear; arguments raised for the first time on appeal are generally not considered. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004). Although there are five circumstances in which we may choose to hear an argument raised for the first time on appeal, <em>see id. </em>at 1332, we find none of those circumstances applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">To the extent that 3455 preserved a challenge to Beauchamp\u2019s declarations on the grounds that they lacked proper foundation and were not based on personal knowledge, we conclude the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>properly considered the evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In her declarations, Beauchamp explained that she worked as a Senior Property Manager for the companies responsible for managing the Pinnacle building and that her testimony was based on personal knowledge. She explained the calculations for the costs of re-letting the premises and detailed the amounts 3455 owed in interest, parking, and utilities. She further explained the basis for arriving at the applicable interest rate. 3455 has not shown how Beauchamp\u2019s testimony lacked a proper foundation or was not based on her personal knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">IY. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s orders dated February 12, 2013 and August 5,2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-11\">. The Lease was amended to extend the term through October 31, 2014.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b726-8\">. One of 3455's declarants states that Cousins continued to manage the building after selling to ND Properties, while one of ND Properties\u2019s witnesses simply states that Cousins assigned \"all of its rights and interest in the Lease\u201d to ND Properties. We find no material discrepancy in this testimony pertinent to our analysis,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b727-7\">. ND Properties abandoned its claim for costs of cleaning and repair in its reply to 3455\u2019s response to the summary judgment motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b727-8\">. Under \u00b6 18.2.3 of the Lease, 3455 \"agree[d] to reimburse Landlord on demand for any expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees which Landlord may incur in thus effecting compliance with Tenant\u2019s obligations under this Lease.\u201d Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 13-111 provides that \"obligations to pay attorney\u2019s fees upon any note or other evidence of indebtedness\u201d are enforceable, and sets forth how such fees should be calculated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b728-6\">. The Lease defined the \u2018\u2018Demised Premises\u201d as \"[t]hat certain rentable floor area on the 1st floor of the Building ... plus approximately 2,000 square feet of usable floor area on the concourse level of the Building____\u201d Lease \u00b6 1.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b732-6\">. For this same reason, 3455\u2019s argument that \u00b6 30 references \u00b6 58 fails. Although \u00b6 30 states \u201c[s]ubject to [\u00b6] 58 hereof, Tenant shall remove all personalty and equipment not attached to the Demised Premises,\u201d that \u00b6 30 provision further explains that failure to remove such items \"upon the expiration or termination of this Lease for any cause whatsoever or upon the Tenant being dispossessed\u201d results in the personalty and equipment being considered abandoned. Thus, although \u00b6 30 refers to \u00b6 58, the use of the disjunctive \"or\u201d to cover cases of dispossession confirms that \u00b6 30 is intended to cover dispossession, whereas \u00b6 58 applies to a security interest in the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b732-14\">. As to ND Properties's request for attorney\u2019s fees, 3455 did make a brief hearsay argument in the district court, but 3455 on appeal has not challenged the award of $39,606.84 in attorney's fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b733-17\">. We review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion, and even where error has been shown, we will reverse only if that error was prejudicial. <em>See Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Co., Inc., </em>513 F.3d 1261, 1276 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
