He contends that his indictment violated the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161, because he was arrested by state officials and held in state custody for three months before he was indicted by the federal government. After a review of the record and the par\u2022ties\u2019 briefs we affirm Mr. Bocanegra\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">In November of 2012, Customs and Border Patrol officers discovered marijuana hidden within the compartments of furniture shipped from Mexico to Mr. Bocane-gra\u2019s commercial furniture business. The officers notified the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, which stated it might be interested in prosecuting the case. On November 15, 2012, an undercover federal officer delivered the furniture containing marijuana to the commercial space leased by Mr. Boca-negra. Mr. Bocanegra received and unloaded part of the furniture and then asked the undercover driver to deliver the remaining pieces to a warehouse leased by Mr. Bocanegra. A surveillance team of federal agents waited outside the warehouse until Mr. Bocanegra arrived the next day. He and several other men spent hours in the warehouse and then drove away in Mr. Bocanegra\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">That same day, November 16, 2012, local officers and Georgia state agents, at the direction of federal agents, arrested Mr. Bocanegra and took him into state custody. Federal agents conducted a search of the warehouse, where they found several pieces of furniture with false backs to conceal hollow compartments. The federal agents uncovered approximately 1,200 kilograms of marijuana after taking apart the furniture. The federal agents subsequently explained that they involved state and local authorities in the event that the federal government did not prosecute Mr. Bocanegra. Both state and federal authorities interrogated Mr. Bocanegra.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">The federal agents contacted the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office again about prosecuting the case, but an Assistant U.S. Attorney informed the agents that the Office would not be prosecuting the case, as the amount of marijuana found fell below their internal threshold for prosecution. Gwinnett County officers then took Mr. Bocanegra to the Gwinnett County Detention Center, and the state charged Mr. Bocanegra. The federal agents, however, continued to lobby the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office to take the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">On January 4, 2013, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office informed state prosecutors that they might take the case. On February 5, 2013, a federal grand jury indicted Mr. Bocane-gra, and that same day the state dismissed all pending charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">Before trial, Mr. Bocanegra filed a motion to dismiss the indictment under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161, as more than 30 days had elapsed between his initial arrest and the indictment. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied Mr. Bocanegra\u2019s motion, finding that the government did not use the \u201cstate criminal charges as a \u2018ruse\u2019 nor as a cloak for its delay in prosecution of federal charges.\u201d Mr. Bocanegra, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>court found, was not held by state authorities \u201csolely to answer federal charges or as an administrative device to excuse delays in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s charging process.\u201d The district court, therefore, concluded that there was no violation of the Speedy Trial Act and Mr. Bocanegra proceeded to trial. A jury found Mr. Bo-canegra guilty of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">On appeal, Mr. Bocanegra argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment because the government violated the Speedy Trial Act. He argues that the government did not indict him until 81 days after he was arrested. Although he acknowledges he was in state custody following his initial arrest, Mr. Bocanegra asserts that his state custody was \u201cconstructive federal custody.\u201d The district court, Mr. Bocanegra contends, erred in finding no violation of the Speedy Trial Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss under the Speedy Trial Act <em>de novo </em>and the district court\u2019s factual findings on excludable time for clear error. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>376 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2004). The Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(b), \u201crequires the government to file an indictment or information against a defendant within thirty days from the date on which he was arrested or served with a summons.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathurin, </em>690 F.3d 1236, 1239 (11th Cir.2012). \u201cIf the thirty-day time limit is not met, the Act entitles the defendant to dismissal of the charges contained in the initial complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The issue here is not the date of the indictment, but rather the date of Mr. Bocanegra\u2019s arrest. Mr. Bocanegra contends he was arrested for purposes of the Speedy Trial Act on November 16, 2012, while the government contends that the Act was never triggered because Mr. Bocanegra was not arrested on federal charges until after he was indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Mr. Bocanegra was arrested at the direction of federal agents on November 16, 2012, and subsequently placed into state custody, as the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office initially declined to prosecute him. In order for an arrest to trigger the Act, however, that arrest must be on federal charges. <em>See United States v. Kubiak, </em>704 F.2d 1545, 1548 (11th Cir.1983) (citing <em>United States v. Shahryar, </em>719 F.2d 1522, 1524-25 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201cFor the time limit of the Act to commence a person must be held for the purpose of answering to a federal charge.\u201d)). <em>See also United States v. Skanes, </em>17 F.3d 1352, 1353 (11th Cir.1994) (noting that although the defendant was arrested on the same charges by state authorities and held in state custody, \u201cit was not until [the defendant] was taken into federal custody ... that the time constraints of the Speedy Trial Act were triggered\u201d); <em>United States v. Bell, </em>833 F.2d 272, 277 (11th Cir.1987) (finding that although federal authorities were highly involved in the defendant\u2019s initial arrest, \u201cit was only after the federal indictment ... that the clock under the Speedy Trial Act began running\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Mr. Bocanegra argues that because the agents that led the investigation and arrested him were federal officials, his arrest was in effect a federal arrest. This circuit\u2019s precedent, however, is contrary to Mr. Bocanegra\u2019s argument given the factual findings of the district court. \u201c[I]f one is held by state officers on a state charge and subsequently turned over to federal authorities for federal prosecution, the starting date for purposes of the Act is the date that the defendant is delivered into federal custody.\u201d <em>Shahryar, </em>719 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>1525 (holding that the date of the federal indictment, not the date of the state arrest, was the triggering date for the Speedy-Trial Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">That a defendant\u2019s arrest is effected by federal officers does not mean the arrest was federal in nature if the defendant was \u201cnever taken before a federal magistrate\u201d nor had \u201cfederal charges ever lodged against [him] in a complaint.\u201d <em>Kubiak, </em>704 F.2d at 1548. The application of the Act does not, as Mr. Boeanegra contends, \u201cdepend[ ] only upon which type of agency\u2014 federal or otherwise \u2014 first places his hands upon and detains a defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">In <em>Kubiak, </em>much like in Mr. Bocanegra\u2019s case, \u201cfederal law enforcement authorities declined prosecution in favor of the state law enforcement agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1548, n. 3. We found that the' defendants there \u201cwere not held to answer in federal court until they were indicted,\u201d despite being initially arrested by federal officers, who also contacted federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to see who would prosecute the defendants. <em>Id. </em>State authorities initially agreed to prosecute, but then became concerned that they lacked jurisdiction over the defendants, and ap-pxmimately four months later, the defendants were federally indicted. The defendants argued the indictment violated the Speedy Trial Act, because more than 30 days had passed between their initial arrest and the indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 1548. We held, however, that the defendants\u2019 initial arrest by the coast guard did not trigger the Speedy Trial Act, because the defendants \u201cwere not held to answer in federal court until they were indicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1548, n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Mr. Boeanegra nevertheless argues that the arrest was a federal arrest, because even though he was in state custody, it was constructive federal custody. In <em>United States v. Russo, </em>796 F.2d 1443, 1450-51 (11th Cir.1986), the defendant, Mr. Pine, made a similar argument, asserting that the federal government\u2019s involvement in the investigation leading to his arrest triggered the 30-day clock in the Speedy Trial Act, even though he was taken into state custody pending state criminal charges. Mr. Pine argued that \u201che was being held by state authorities to answer federal charges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1451. We found that because Mr. Pine \u201cwas at no time in custody to answer federal charges or under federal arrest until ... state charges were dismissed ..., there was no violation of the Speedy Trial Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We come to the same conclusion here. Mr. Boeanegra was not in constructive federal custody simply because the team investigating his criminal conduct and directing the initial arrest were federal officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Mr. Boeanegra finally argues that we should, nevertheless, construe his initial arrest as a federal arrest on federal charges because the state detention was a \u201cmere ruse\u201d to detain him for future federal charges. We have explained, in the context of INS detentions incident to deportation, that though such \u201cdetentions are civil in nature and do not trigger the Speedy - Trial Act, ... a contrary result may be warranted when deportations are used by the government as \u2018mere ruses to detain a defendant for later criminal prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Drummond, </em>240 F.3d 1333, 1336 (11th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Noel, </em>231 F.3d 833, 836 (11th Cir.2000)). In these cases, the burden is on the defendant \u201cto establish that the primary or exclusive purpose of the civil detention was to hold him for future [federal] prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1336 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">We have not recognized a \u201cmere rase\u201d exception in the context of a state\u2019s detention of an individual on pending state criminal chax-ges. Such an extension might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>implicate sovereignty concerns, as \u201can arrest or indictment by one sovereign would not cause the speedy trial guarantees to become engaged as to possible subsequent indictments by another sovereign.\u201d <em>United States v. MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. 1, 10 n. 11, 102 S.Ct. 1497, 71 L.Ed.2d 696 (1982). <em>See also Shahryar, </em>719 F.2d at 1525 (\u201cCommon sense, as well as deeply rooted concepts of federalism, dictate that the Speedy Act rules relate only to federal and not to state custody. To hold otherwise would require our rejection of the doctrine of dual sovereignty....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">In any event, even if the \u201cmere ruse\u201d exception applied to state detentions, Mr. Bocanegra cannot establish here that his detention at Gwinnett County was a \u201cmere ruse\u201d to hold him for future federal criminal charges. The district court found that there was no ruse, and the record supports that finding. State charges were brought against Mr. Bocanegra, and federal agents did not contact state prosecutors. The \u25a0 record suggests the state officers and prosecutors were moving forward to bring a case against Mr. Bocanegra, until those charges were dismissed in February of 2013, when the federal government brought federal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">The district court did not err in denying Mr. Bocanegra\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment under the Speedy Trial Act. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
