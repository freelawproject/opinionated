He contends that his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence only for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error,\u201d such as improperly calculating the guidelines range, basing the sentence on clearly erroneous facts, or inadequately explaining the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>We then examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">At sentencing the district court determined that Rodriguez Rivera\u2019s base offense level was six and criminal history category was IV. After deducting two levels for acceptance of responsibility, the court correctly calculated his guidelines range as two to eight months. The court decided, however, that the guidelines range did not adequately account for Rodriguez Rivera\u2019s criminal history, which included at least five other offenses involving the impersonation of lawyers and government officials to swindle victims out of their money. It concluded that an upward variance was appropriate in light of Rodriguez Rivera\u2019s recidivism and a number of the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the need to promote respect for the law, to deter future criminal conduct, and to protect the public. The court sentenced Rodriguez Rivera to 30 months \u2014 a sentence above his guidelines range but below the three year statutory maximum penalty for his conviction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">That sentence is not procedurally or substantively unreasonable. The district court correctly calculated Rodriguez Rivera\u2019s guidelines range and explained in detail why it decided to vary from that range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. When the district court varies from the guidelines, its justification \u201cmust be sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1187 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). A sentence outside the guidelines range is not presumptively unreasonable, however, and we must \u201cgive due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rodriguez Rivera\u2019s repeated recidivism was a compelling justification for an upward variance, particularly when considered alongside the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1240-41 (11th Cir.2009) (finding an upward variance based on the defendant\u2019s recidivism to be reasonable); <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 745 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cBoth the Guidelines calculations and the sentencing factors of section 3553(a) require a judge to consider characteristics of the defendant and the offense that make it more or less likely that the defendant will reoffend.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">Ultimately, Rodriguez Rivera bears the burden of establishing that the district court sentenced him unreasonably in light of the record and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010). He has not carried that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-7\">. Rodriguez Rivera contends that the district court procedurally erred when it failed to follow the procedure set out by the sentencing guidelines for departures based on the inadequacy of a defendant\u2019s criminal history score. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(4)(A). But the district court did not depart from the guidelines; it varied upward based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d 1291, 1316 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
