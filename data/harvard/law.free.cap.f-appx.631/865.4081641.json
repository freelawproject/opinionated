At sentencing, the District Court determined that, under the Sentencing Guidelines, Jenney\u2019s total offense level was 38 and his criminal-history category II, which yielded a sentence range of 262-327 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court then sustained Jenney\u2019s objection to the criminal history category II on the ground that category II overstated the seriousness of his criminal history and departed downward under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 to criminal history category I. This lowered the sentence range to 235-293 months. Using that range, the court sentenced Jenney to concurrent sentences: 235 months on Counts 3 and 4 and 120 months on Count 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">\u2022 In January 2015, Jenney moved the District Court for a reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines, arguing that the amendment reduced his total offense level to 36 and that based on that level and criminal history category I, his sentence range would be reduced to 188-235 months. The court rejected Jenney\u2019s argument that it should calculate his amended guideline sentence range based on a category I criminal history, but reduced his sentences on Counts 3 and 4 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">Jenny appeals the reduced sentences on those two counts, arguing that the court erred in using a criminal history category II, instead of a criminal history category I, in calculating his amended sentence range. We reject his argument and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 782 provides for a two-level reduction in the base offense level for most drug offenses. U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 782. Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The policy statements provide that the court cannot reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cto a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range\u201d unless the defendant received a departure for substantial assistance. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) &amp; (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 provides that eligibility under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is triggered only if the amendment lowers the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d, that is, \u201cthe guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to \u00a7 lBl.l(a), which is determined before consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). The commentary further states that if the defendant received a term of imprisonment \u201coutside the guideline range at the time of sentencing, the limitation prohibiting\u201d the court from reducing the sentence below the amended guideline range still applies. <em>Id. \u00a7 </em>1B1.10, comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Section 4A1.3 provides for departures based on the inadequacy of criminal history. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.3. A defendant may receive a downward departure if \u201creliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially over-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history category or the likelihood the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.3(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">In 2011, the Sentencing Commission amended the commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 to address a circuit split over which departures are considered part of the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d referred to in \u00a7 1B1.10. U.S.S.G. App. C, amend. 759 (Reasons for Amendment). Some circuits held that some departures, such as departures under \u00a7 4A1.3 for' inadequacy of criminal history, were part of the applicable guideline range, while others held that no departures should be considered part of the applicable guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>The Sentencing Commission amended Application Note 1 to \u00a7 1B1.10 to clarify that the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d is the range before any departure provision or variance. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we have stated that, as a result of the amendment, a \u00a7 4A1.3 departure is not included in the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Hargrove, </em>732 F.3d 1253, 1254 n. 1 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">The District Court did not err in using a criminal history category II to calculate Jenney\u2019s amended guideline sentence range. Jenney\u2019s original sentence range had a criminal history category of II, from which the court departed downward pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3. However, a \u00a7 4A1.3 departure is not included in the applicable sentence range. for the purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Hargrove, </em>732 F.3d at 1254 n. 1; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. App. C, amend. 759 (Reasons for Amendment). Pursuant to \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2), the court cannot reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence to a term less than the amended guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A). Thus, even though Jenney received a criminal history departure in his original sentence, he cannot receive the departure here because any further reduction beyond 210 months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>would result in a sentence below Jenney\u2019s amended sentence range of 210-262 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
