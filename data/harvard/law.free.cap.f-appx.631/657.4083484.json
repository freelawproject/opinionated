(\u201cAirTran\u201d) under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and the preemption provision of the Airline Deregulation Act (\u201cADA\u201d). After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">I.BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">On June 1, 2013, Lu boarded AirTran flight 604 to travel from New York to Atlanta. After boarding the plane, Lu noticed a liquid leaking from the air vent above her first class seat. The \u201cconstant leak\u201d landed on Lu\u2019s face, arm, and pants. A flight attendant (\u201cFlight Attendant One\u201d) provided Lu with paper towels, but refused to take further action to address the leaking vent. Lu claims that she had to repeatedly wipe off the vents to stop the flow of liquid.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Prior to departing from the gate, Lu was scolded by another flight attendant (\u201cFlight Attendant Two\u201d) for having her phone on. Lu attempted to explain that her phone was in airplane mode and asked that the flight attendant speak politely to her. According to Lu, Flight Attendant Two became outraged and threatened to \u201cthrow [Lu] off the plane.\u201d Flight Attendant One asked Lu to turn her phone off, which Lu claims she did immediately and in front of Flight Attendant One. Lu alleges that Flight Attendant Two continued to verbally abuse her and threaten to throw her off the plane. Next, a security officer entered the plane, announced that the plane would not take off until Lu was removed, and escorted Lu off the plane. She was not offered any explanation for her removal, nor was she provided a copy of AirTran\u2019s policy for excluding passengers when she requested one from an Air-Tran counter employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Lu initiated this action two days later, contending that she suffered humiliation, embarrassment, fright, and violation by being subjected to verbal abuse, an unknown leaking liquid, and her removal from the plane despite having turned off her cell phone. The district court determined that Lu\u2019s claims for negligence, slander, breach of implied covenant of good faith, and negligent hiring, training and supervision were preempted under the ADA, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41713, and dismissed Lu\u2019s remaining state law claims relating to the air vent under Rule 12(b)(6). This appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">II.STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Wiersum v. U.S. Bank, N.A., </em>785 F.3d 483, 485 (11th Cir.2015). To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must allege sufficient \u201cfacts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Alt. Corp. v. Twcmbly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). We review a district court\u2019s determination that federal law preempts state law de novo. <em>Stansell v. Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colom., </em>771 F.3d 713, 725 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">III.DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b681-15\">1. Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b681-16\">The Airline Deregulation Act (\u201cADA\u201d) was enacted in 1978 as an amendment to the Federal Aviation Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) to en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>courage competition in the aviation industry through deregulation. <em>Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>504 U.S. 374, 378, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 2034, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992). \u201cTo ensure that the States would not undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own, the ADA included a preemption provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The provision states: \u201c[A] State ... may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of an aii* carrier that may provide air transportation under this subpart.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41713(b)(1) (2012). Accordingly, laws that \u201crelate to\u201d Air Tran\u2019s \u201cprice, route, or service\u201d are expressly preempted under the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The Supreme Court has defined \u201crelated to\u201d under the ADA broadly, using the same standard for interpretation as ERISA. <em>Morales, </em>504 U.S. at 383-84, 112 S.Ct. at 2037 (\u201cSince the relevant language of the ADA is identical [to ERISA], we think it appropriate to adopt the same standard here____\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Eleventh Circuit adopted the Fifth Circuit\u2019s broad interpretation of \u201cservice\u201d under the ADA in <em>Branche v. Airtran Airways, Inc.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS2\">\u201cServices\u201d generally represent a bargained-for or anticipated provision of labor from one party to another.... Elements of the air carrier service bargain include items such as ticketing, boarding procedures, provision of food and drink, and baggage handling, in addition to the transportation itself. These matters are all appurtenant and necessarily included with the contract of carriage between the passenger or shipper and the airline. It is these [contractual] features of air transportation that we believe Congress intended to de-regulate as \u201cservices\u201d and broadly to protect from state regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">342 F.3d 1248, 1256-57 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Hodges v. Delta Airlines, Inc., </em>44 F.3d 334, 336 (5th Cir.1995) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">The district court\u2019s preemption analysis categorized Lu\u2019s Complaint into three main allegations: (1) rudeness, verbal abuse, and mistreatment by AirTran staff; (2) removal from the airplane despite turning off her cell phone; and (3) unknown liquid leaking onto the plaintiff from an air vent.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">i. AirTran Staff Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">The district court correctly concluded that Lu\u2019s claims concerning Air-Tran staffs rudeness following the confrontation regarding her cell phone are preempted under the ADA. Each alleged instance of mistreatment was related to AirTran\u2019s services, the courteousness and professionalism of its staff while executing boarding procedures. <em>See Koutsouradis v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>427 F.3d 1339, 1344 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cBaggage handling, passenger handling and courteousness relate to the heart of services that an airline provides. These services are inherent when you board an airplane.\u201d); <em>Branche, </em>342 F.3d at 1257 (including \u201cboarding procedures\u201d in its definition of services). Therefore, we agree with the district court that these claims are preempted under the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">ii. Lu\u2019s removal from the plane</p>\n<p id=\"b682-14\">a. Tort claims</p>\n<p id=\"b682-15\">Lu argues that her removal from Air-Tran flight 604 failed to meet the standards for \u201cpermissive refusal\u201d under 49 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 44902(b), which absolves air carriers of liability for refusal to transport to a passenger if \u201cthe carrier decides [the passenger] is, or might be, inimical to safety.\u201d <em>Cerqueira v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>520 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir.2008) (noting that the air carrier\u2019s refusal \u201cdiscretion is very broad\u201d). The Eleventh Circuit has not discussed the application of \u00a7 44902(b) in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Section 44902(b) \u201cdoes not provide for judicial review of decisions to refuse transportation by the pilot in command.\u201d <em>Cerqueira, </em>520 F.3d at 13. However, several circuits have reviewed wrongful refusal claims implicating \u00a7 44902(b) under anti-discrimination statutes, such as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. <em>Id. </em>at 13. The First, Second, and Ninth Circuits\u2019 standard of liability for refusal to transport requires that the decision to refuse be \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>See Cerqueira, </em>520 F.3d at 14 (citing <em>Cordero v. Cia Mexicana De Aviacion, S.A., </em>681 F.2d 669 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Williams v. Trans World Airlines, </em>509 F.2d 942, 948 (2d Cir.1975)). There is no duty on the part of the captain to investigate recommendations by flight attendants for removal of a passenger, and the captain is entitled to take representations of flight attendants at face value. <em>See Cordero, </em>681 F.2d at 672; <em>Christel v. AMR Corp., </em>222 F.Supp.2d 335 (E.D.N.Y.2002) (decision to eject a passenger from the plane for, among other things, repeated failure to shut down a portable electronic device not arbitrary or capricious \u201c[e]ven if the battle of the egos escalated to [the flight attendant] making exaggerated or even false representations to the Captain\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">In the instant case, the district court expressed doubts as to the plausibility of plaintiffs claims under \u00a7 44902(b), but, finding Lu\u2019s tort claims for wrongful removal preempted under the ADA,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not reach a decision as to whether or not Lu\u2019s Complaint stated a claim under \u00a7 44902(b). We conclude from the record that Lu failed to state a claim for wrongful removal under \u00a7 44902(b). Because \u00a7 44902(b) confers an affirmative privilege to the airline, the plaintiff has the burden to show that \u00a7 44902(b) does not apply. <em>Cerqueira, </em>520 F.3d at 13-14. Lu did not allege any discriminatory animus for her removal from the flight. Lu only insisted that her actions were not \u201cinimical to safety\u201d and cited the \u201carbitrary and capricious preferences\u201d of the flight attendants in an attempt to meet her burden under \u00a7 44902(b). Such eonclusory statements and bare assertions that Lu\u2019s behavior was not inimical to safety \u2014 despite her admitted failure to comply with safety regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>tions<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\u2014do not plausibly support a claim that her removal from the flight was arbitrary or capricious. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Lu\u2019s tort claims for her removal from the aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">b. Lu\u2019s Claim for implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The district court correctly dismissed Lu\u2019s contract claims as preempted under the ADA. In <em>Wolens, </em>the Supreme Court excepted breach of contract claims from the preemption provision of the ADA only where the action was confined to the terms of the parties\u2019 voluntary undertakings, \u201cwith no enlargement or enhancement based on state laws or policies external to the agreement.\u201d <em>Wolens v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>513 U.S. 219, 223, 115 S.Ct. 817, 826, 130 L.Ed.2d 715 (1995); <em>see generally Northwest, Inc. v. Ginsberg, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1422, 1427-31, 188 L.Ed.2d 538 (2014) (the ADA preempts a state-law claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if it seeks to enlarge the contractual obligations that the parties voluntarily adopt). Here, because Lu\u2019s contract claim relates to her removal from the plane under \u00a7 44902(b), it necessarily requires inquiry into federal law and regulations external to her carriage contract with AirTran. <em>See Smith v. Comair, Inc., </em>134 F.3d 254, 258 (4th Cir.1998) (holding a contract claim for refusal to transport preempted where refusal decision was based on passenger\u2019s failure to comply with FAA regulations implicated federal law, external to the parties\u2019 agreement). Accordingly, we conclude that Lu\u2019s contract claims are preempted under the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">iii. Leaking Air Vent</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\"><em>Branche </em>confirmed that personal injury claims \u201cresulting from the operation or maintenance of the aircraft\u201d are not preempted under the ADA. 342 F.3d at 1258. Lu\u2019s state law claims concerning the leaking air vent are a result of the operation of maintenance of the aircraft. Therefore, the district court correctly concluded that Lu\u2019s tort claims concerning the leaking air vent were not preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">2. Remaining State Law Claims</p>\n<p id=\"ASv\">The district court dismissed the remainder of Lu\u2019s state law claims under Rule 12(b)(6). We review each determination below.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-14\">i. Negligent infliction of emotional distress</p>\n<p id=\"b684-15\">The district court correctly concluded that Lu failed to plead the necessary elements for negligent infliction of emotion distress under Georgia, or New York law,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> specifically, a physical injury or any unreasonable endangerment presented by the leaking air vent. <em>See Hill v. Ford Motor Co., </em>975 F.Supp.2d 1351, 1359 (N.D.Ga.2013) (\u201cUnder Georgia\u2019s \u2018impact rule,\u2019 a plaintiff must prove three elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>for a negligent infliction claim: (1) a physical impact on the plaintiff, (2) that the impact causes physical injury to the plaintiff, and (3) that the physical injury to the plaintiff causes his or her emotional distress.\u201d); <em>Mortise v. United States, </em>102 F.3d 693, 696 (2d Cir.1996) (\u201cUnder [New York law\u2019s] \u201cdirect duty\u201d theory a plaintiff has a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress if she suffers an emotional injury from defendant\u2019s breach of a duty which unreasonably endangered her own physical safety.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">ii. Negligent Hiring, Training, and Supervision</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Under both New York and Georgia law, claims for negligent hiring, training, and supervision require a showing that the employer was or should have been aware of the employee\u2019s tendencies that caused the injury prior to its occurrence. <em>See Ehrens v. Lutheran Church, </em>385 F.3d 232, 235 (2d Cir.2004) (applying New York law); <em>Edwards v. Wisconsin Pharmacal Co., LLC, </em>987 F.Supp.2d 1340, 1347 (N.D.Ga.2013). Lu\u2019s Complaint failed to plead facts regarding AirTran employees\u2019 relevant tendencies, alleging only that AirTran \u201cknew or should have known that policies were needed for employees to appropriately handle issues such as leaking air vents and passengers with cell phones.\u201d Therefore, dismissal was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">iii. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Liability for intentional infliction of emotional distress requires conduct \u201cso outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency ... and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\u201d <em>Howell v. New York Post Co., </em>81 N.Y.2d 115, 596 N.Y.S.2d 350, 612 N.E.2d 699, 702 (1993) (citations omitted); <em>see Smith-Tyler v. Bank of Am., N.A., </em>992 F.Supp.2d 1277, 1282 (N.D.Ga.2014). Lu\u2019s allegations that she was made to suffer constant leaking liquid in her first class seat fall well short of this standard, and the district court correctly dismissed this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">iv.Slander</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">As previously discussed, the comments made by Flight Attendant Two during boarding relate to AirTran\u2019s services and are preempted under the ADA. Because we conclude Lu\u2019s slander claim involving Lu\u2019s removal and the security officer\u2019s related statements are not preempted, they will be briefly, addressed. \u201cA plaintiff must plead four elements to state a claim of defamation: (1) a false and defamatory statement concerning the plaintiff; (2) publication by the defendant of such a statement to a third party; (3) fault on the part of the defendant; and (4) injury to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Tucker v. Wyckoff Heights Med. Ctr., </em>52 F.Supp.3d 583, 597 (S.D.N.Y.2014); <em>Monge v. Madison Cnty. Record, Inc., </em>802 F.Supp.2d 1327, 1333 (N.D.Ga.2011). Statements that are \u201csubstantially true are not defamatory.\u201d <em>Tucker, </em>52 F.Supp.3d at 597; <em>see Monge, </em>802 F.Supp.2d at 1333. Lu failed to allege that the security officer\u2019s statements were false, only claiming that they were \u201cinsulting.\u201d Accordingly, Lu failed to state a claim for slander.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing Lu\u2019s Second Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-8\">. Motions to amend Lu\u2019s complaint to cure pleading defects in regard to the subject matter jurisdiction of this Court and to file out of t\u00fane were granted on July 24, 2015 and August 5, 2015, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b682-6\">. The Supreme Court declined, however, to define the \"service\u201d under the ADA. <em>See Nw. Airlines, Inc. v. Duncan, </em>531 U.S. 1058, 121 S.Ct. 650, 650, 148 L.Ed.2d 571 (2000) (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting from denial of cer-tiorari to address the circuit split regarding the scope of the term \"services\u201d under the ADA preemption provision),</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b683-6\">. We do not agree with this part of the district court\u2019s analysis, but we affirm the district court\u2019s decision on other grounds. <em>See Watkins v. City of Montgomery, Ala., </em>775 F.3d 1280, 1289 (11th Cir.2014) (\"[W]e may affirm a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion for any reason supported by the record.\u201d). The Eleventh Circuit has not addressed whether removal from an aircraft is a \u201cservice\" under the preemption provision of the ADA. Insofar as Lu\u2019s tort claims address her removal from the aircraft, we conclude that the record does not support the district court\u2019s finding that removal is related to \u201ctransportation itself\u201d or boarding procedures under the ADA. The boarding and transportation services contemplated by the ADA address the economic decisions and bargained-for contractual features \"over which air carriers compete.\u201d <em>Branche v. Airtran Airways, Inc., </em>342 F.3d 1248, 1258 (11th Cir.2003). As it is improbable that customers discern between the procedures for removal for failure to comply with FAA regulations, we find the district court\u2019s analogy too attenuated to support preemption under the ADA. The record does, however, support dismissal for failure to state a claim for wrongful removal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b684-8\">. 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 91.21 prohibits the use of portable electronic devices, including cell phones, on a commercial aircraft that the operator has determined will cause interference with the communication system of the aircraft on which it is to be used.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b684-9\">. The district court, sitting in Georgia, correctly noted that Georgia choice of law rules\u2014lex loci delicti and lex loci contrac-tus\u2014should apply in this case. The events at issue took place in New York, and the ticket supporting Lu\u2019s contract claims was purchased in Georgia. -However, the parties cited both New York and Georgia law in their briefs, and the district court applied both states\u2019 laws in its analysis. As the issue of choice of law is not raised on appeal and is not dispositive to its outcome, we affirm without addressing choice of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
