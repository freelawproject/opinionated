(\u201cMERS\u201d), Lehman Brothers Bank FSB, and Florida Title Company for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to comply with Rule 8.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellants asserted the following causes of action: wrongful foreclosure, violation of civil rights, unjust enrichment, fraud, actions to quiet title, declaratory and injunctive relief, slander of title, intentional infliction of emotional distress, civil conspiracy, abuse of process, \u201cdiscouragement [sic] of legal fees,\u201d illegal eviction, deprivation of rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and violations of RESPA, TILA, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. All of these claims were either inextricably intertwined with a prior state court foreclosure judgment or were barred by <em>res judicata. </em>Therefore, the district court did not err by dismissing the appellants\u2019 claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to the <em>Rooker-</em>Feldman<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> doctrine and <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">We assume the parties are familiar with the litigation history of this case. Thus, we summarize the facts and proceedings only insofar as necessary to provide context for our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-14\">Mr. Marin defaulted on his mortgage loan for a condominium by failing to make his January 1, 2007 payment and has not made a payment on the loan for more than eight years. After this default, Aurora brought a mortgage foreclosure action in Florida state court. The state court entered a final judgment of foreclosure in favor of Aurora on August 11, 2009. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-15\">The appellants filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint in federal court in November of 2013, asserting seventeen causes of action arising from their eviction from and foreclosure on their condominium. They sought title to the condominium and $5,000,000 in damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Aurora and MERS filed a motion to dismiss the claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, principles of <em>res judica-ta, </em>and the appellants\u2019 failure to meet the pleading requirements of Rule 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-16\">The district court granted the motion to dismiss. The court noted that the federal action was filed with the intent to attack the state court\u2019s August 2009 foreclosure judgment and was therefore barred by both the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine and by <em>res judicata. </em>Additionally, the court concluded that the complaint failed to meet minimum pleading standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b799-18\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Chaparro v. Carnival Corp., </em>693 F.3d 1333, 1335 (11th Cir.2012). We also review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s application of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine and <em>res judicata. Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach, Fla. </em>713 F.3d 1066, 1069-70 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, federal district courts lack jurisdiction to review a state court\u2019s final judgment. <em>Lozman, </em>713 F.3d at 1072. The doctrine does not apply if a party did not have a \u201creasonable opportunity to raise his federal claim in state proceedings.\u201d <em>Casole v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009) (citing <em>Powell v. Powell, </em>80 F.3d 464, 467 (11th Cir.1996)). Here, however, the appellants had a reasonable opportunity to bring their federal claims in state court. The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine therefore applies, and the appellants\u2019 complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">In terms of <em>res judicata, </em>under Florida law, \u201ca judgment on the merits bars a subsequent action between the same parties on the same cause of action,\u201d and prohibits not only relitigation of claims previously raised, but also the litigation of claims that could have been raised. <em>State v. McBride, </em>848 So.2d 287, 290 (Fla.2003). In order for the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>to apply, there must be \u201c(1) identity of the thing sued for; (2) identity of the cause of action; (3) identity of the parties; and (4) identity of the quality of the persons for or against whom the claim is made.\u201d <em>McDonald v. Hillsborough Cnty. School Bd., </em>821 F.2d 1563, 1565 (11th Cir.1987) (applying Florida law). Identity of the cause of action is present when the \u201cfacts are essential to the maintenance of [the] federal action are identical to those facts which were essential to the maintenance of the prior state action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The third element is met if the parties are either identical to or in privity with the parties to the original suit. <em>Id. </em>at 1565-66. The fourth element requires that the \u201cparties in the state action had the incentive to adequately litigate the claims in the same character or capacity as would the parties in the federal action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1566.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Because all four elements required to establish <em>res judicata </em>are present in this case, the district court properly dismissed the complaint on this ground. The district court suit was for the same thing as the foreclosure suit, namely, title to the condominium. <em>See McDonald, </em>821 F.2d at 1565. The \u201cfacts essential to the maintenance of [the] federal action [were] identical to those facts which were essential to the maintenance of the prior state action,\u201d and, thus, the causes of action were identical. <em>See id. </em>Next, Aurora and Mr. Marin were both parties in the federal and state court suits, MERS was in privity with Aurora by virtue of its assignment of the mortgage, and Mr. Marin was in privity with all the other appellants by virtue of their various tenancy arrangements with him. <em>See id. </em>at 1565-66. Finally, the parties all had the desire to hold title to the condominium, thereby motivating them to fully litigate the claims in the same character or capacity in' each case, and making <em>res judicata </em>applicable to the state court foreclosure judgment. <em>See id. </em>at 1566.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the appellants\u2019 complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine and on the basis of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-9\">. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b799-10\">.
