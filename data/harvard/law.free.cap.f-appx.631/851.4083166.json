The first five words of Rule 12(c) make clear that the answer is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">The facts of this case, as drawn from the complaint, are straightforward. Richard Brown\u2019s six-year-old daughter, Lillian, attends school in the Gwinnett County School District. Lillian suffers from extreme food allergies. Her allergies are so bad that her parents don\u2019t want her eating the school meals prepared by the District. Instead, each day, they prepare a homemade, allergen-free lunch for her to eat at school.' The homemade meal gets cold before lunchtime, meaning it\u2019s unappetizing and potentially unsafe by the time Lillian has a chance to eat it. To address that problem, Richard asked the District to heat Lillian\u2019s meals before lunchtime\u2014 even volunteering to buy the District a microwave for that purpose. The District refused. After negotiations with the District went nowhere, Richard filed a complaint in federal district court alleging that the District\u2019s conduct violated his daughter\u2019s rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-15\">Instead of filing an answer, the District twice moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), first for failing to state a claim, then on the ground that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the case. The court denied both motions, but expressly invited the District to move for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c). The District promptly filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which the court granted. The Browns timely appealed that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-16\">The district court erred in granting the District\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings because, when the District made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>the motion, the pleadings weren\u2019t yet closed. By the plain language of Rule 12(c), a party may not move for judgment on the pleadings until \u201c[a]fter the pleadings are closed.\u201d The pleadings are closed only when a complaint and answer have been filed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 7(a). The District hadn\u2019t filed an answer when it moved for judgment on the pleadings, so the pleadings weren\u2019t closed at that time. Because a party may not move for judgment on the pleadings until the pleadings are closed, the district court should have denied the District\u2019s Rule 12(c) motion as procedurally premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">The District contends that, even if the motion was premature under Rule 12(c), the district court \u201chas inherent authority to manage its own docket \u2018so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.\u2019 \u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 4 (quoting <em>Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 32, 43, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 2132, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991).) Maybe so, but the district court\u2019s inherent authority does not authorize it to disregard express limitations or conditions contained in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. As the Supreme Court has explained, those rules are \u201cas binding as any statute duly enacted by Congress, and federal courts have no more discretion to disregard [a Rule\u2019s] mandate than they do to disregard constitutional or statutory provisions.\u201d <em>Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, </em>487 U.S. 250, 255, 108 S.Ct. 2369, 2373-74, 101 L.Ed.2d 228 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">But, argues the District, if a complaint is deficient on its face, why force a defendant to file an answer before the district court may dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(c)? The short answer is because that\u2019s what Rule 12(c) unambiguously requires. The slightly less-short answer is that the District\u2019s reading of Rule 12(c) would render Rule 12(b)(6) superfluous, and superfluity is \u201cdisfavored by our eanons of statutory (or here rule) interpretation.\u201d <em>Republic of Ecuador v. Hinchee, </em>741 F.3d 1185, 1191 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">We recently explained the rationale underlying Rule 12(c)\u2019s timing requirement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-10\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) ... provides \u201ca means of disposing of cases when ... a judgment on the merits can be achieved by focusing on the content of the <em>competing </em>pleadings.... \u201d 5C Charles A. Wright <em>&amp; </em>Arthur Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1367 (3d ed.2004) (emphasis added). When only a single pleading has been filed, \u201ccompeting pleadings\u201d do not exist, so a motion for judgment on the pleadings is not appropriate. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 211 n. 10 (compiling case law demonstrating that judgment on the pleadings is proper after the defendant has answered).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-12\">Rule 12(c) incorporates this principle by permitting motions for judgment on the pleadings only after the pleadings have \u201cclosed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-13\"><em>Perez v. Wells Fargo N.A., </em>774 F.3d 1329, 1336 (11th Cir.2014). Other federal courts of appeals to consider the issue have adopted essentially the . same position for essentially the same reason. <em>See, e.g., Doe v. United States, </em>419 F.3d 1058, 1061-62 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Healthcare Ass\u2019n of New York State, Inc. v. Pataki, </em>471 F.3d 87, 94 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-14\">Having concluded that the district court erred, as a procedural matter, in granting the District\u2019s Rule 12(c) motion, we need not address the Browns\u2019 other arguments. The district court\u2019s judgment is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-7\">.
