For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-27\">A district court is authorized to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence of imprisonment under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission\u201d through a retroactively applicable Guidelines amendment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>(2006). As the court determined' at sentencing, Griffiths\u2019 Guidelines range was 120 months\u2019 imprisonment because the Guidelines range established by his total offense level and criminal history category was lower than the statutory mandatory minimum applicable to his offense. . See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), 851 (2012); USSG \u00a7 5Gl.l(b); USSG ch. 5, pt. A (sentencing table). Amendment 782 did not lower Griffiths\u2019 mandatory minimum sentence, and his Guidelines range remains 120 months. <em>See United States v. Black, </em>737 F.3d 280, 286-87 (4th Cir.2013). Because Griffiths is ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s denial of Griffiths\u2019 motion. <em>See United States Stewart, </em>595 F.3d 197, 200 (4th Cir.2010) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
