We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis and affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Paul n de Holczer, </em>No. 3:15-cv-02178-CMC, 2015 WL 4545974 (D.S.C. July 28, 2015 <em>&amp; </em>Sept. 2, 2015). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b220-16\"> We conclude we have jurisdiction over this appeal. <em>See Goode </em>v. <em>Cent.
