Rivers is currently serving a 180-month sentence for a cocaine trafficking conspiracy and seeks a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 782 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-22\">At his original sentence hearing, the district court varied Rivers\u2019s sentence downward from the guideline range of 210 to 262 months, which was based on a cocaine quantity of 43.81 kilograms. The court instead imposed a sentence of 180-months imprisonment upon consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. While acknowledging the seriousness of Rivers\u2019s offense, the court noted that he did not have an extensive criminal history and recognized the need to avoid an unwarranted sentencing disparity with one of Rivers\u2019s codefendants. The court weighed these considerations against the \u201cneed to impose a long incarcerative sentence for a crime of this kind\u201d to reflect the offense\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>seriousness, promote respect for the law, afford just punishment, adequately deter future criminal conduct, and protect the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Rivers filed this \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion after the adoption of Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court denied his motion. In doing so, the court noted it had \u201cconsidered [Rivers\u2019s] motion, and tak[en] into account the policy statement set forth at USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), to the extent that they [were] applicable.\u201d The court further stated that \u201c[although [Rivers] is eligible for a reduction, the Court, after considering all of the \u00a7 3553 factors, is exercising its discretion and chooses not to reduce [his] sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Rivers argues on appeal that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. He contends that he deserves a sentence reduction under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors based on his offense conduct, personal characteristics, and post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts. He also argues that the court\u2019s \u201cmere reference\u201d to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors insufficiently considered the statutory criteria and was error as a matter \u00f3f law. Finally, he asserts that the court erred by not explicitly stating his amended guideline range in its order before deciding his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) claim, as he claims is required by <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). A district court\u2019s authority to modify an imprisonment sentence is narrowly limited by statute. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2010). But a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where the defendant was sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">A district court must perform a two-step analysis when deciding whether to grant a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780. First, the court must substitute the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range to determine what sentence it would have imposed, holding constant all other guideline findings from the original sentence hearing. <em>Id. </em>Second, the court must decide, in its discretion, whether and to what extent to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781. In exercising that discretion, the court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id.; </em>USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.l(B)(i). The court must also consider public safety and may choose to consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>er the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam); USSG \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n.l(B)(ii)-(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">While the district court is required to perform this two-step analysis, the ultimate decision about whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence lies within the court\u2019s discretion. <em>Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1257. We will vacate and remand \u201cif it is not possible to determine from the record whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1219 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). A district court need not \u201carticulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997). We will deem a district court\u2019s order sufficient where the court demonstrates that it reviewed the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the government\u2019s response, and the record, and those documents in turn discussed the specific elements necessary to the \u00a7 3553(a) inquiry. <em>See id. </em>at 1322-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Rivers\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The court correctly determined that Rivers was \u201celigible for a [sentence] reduction\u201d under Amendment 782, as required under the first step of the sentence-reduction analysis. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780. Though the .court did not explicitly state his amended sentencing range resulting from Amendment 782, the revised range of 168-210 months was contained in the government\u2019s response to Rivers\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, which the court considered in making its sentence decision. <em>See Eggersdorf </em>126 F.3d at 1322-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The district court also made clear that it had \u201cconsider[ed] all of the \u00a7 3553 factors\u201d as required by the second step of the sentence-reduction inquiry. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. Both parties thoroughly briefed the specific elements necessary to the court\u2019s \u00a7 3553(a) inquiry, and the court demonstrated that it considered these arguments before exercising its discretion to not reduce Rivers\u2019s sentence. <em>See Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d at 1322-23. Upon review of the entire record and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-7\">.
