We have reviewed petitioners\u2019 claims and the administrative record and find no abuse of discretion. <em>See Lendo v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 439, 441 (4th Cir.2007). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Kubicka </em>(B.I.A. Apr. 23, 2015). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
