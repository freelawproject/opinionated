The district court determined that the petition did not fall within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), as would be required to consider its merits. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b746-14\">In August 2001, Appellant pled guilty and was convicted of (1) conspiracy to distribute more than 50 grams of methamphetamine and more than 500 grams of a substance containing methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846 and (2) possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). He was sentenced to life on the conspiracy charge and to 120 months on the firearm charge, to be served concurrently. The life sentence was imposed pursuant to an enhancement under \u00a7 841, based on Appellant\u2019s prior Ohio felony convictions for (1) trafficking marijuana and aggravated trafficking and (2) drug abuse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant filed a direct appeal of his conviction and sentence, but subsequently moved to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>In 2002, Appellant filed a petition for relief from his conviction and sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In support of his \u00a7 2255 petition, Appellant argued that his plea was not voluntary and that trial counsel had been ineffective in failing to help him obtain a sentencing reduction based on substantial assistance. The district court denied the petition, and this Court dismissed Appellant\u2019s appeal of the denial for lack of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Appellant filed this \u00a7 2241 petition approximately twelve years later, in 2014. As grounds for the petition, Appellant argued that (1) his Ohio drug abuse conviction was not a proper predicate for the sentencing enhancement he received under \u00a7 841 and (2) trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object when the sentencing court aggregated methamphetamine sales from four separate occasions to trigger a \u00a7 841 violation. The magistrate judge issued an R <em>&amp; </em>R recommending that Appellant\u2019s \u00a7 2241 motion be dismissed because it was, in reality, a successive \u00a7 2255 petition that was not authorized by the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). The district court supplemented and adopted the R &amp; R, and dismissed Appellant\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">\u201cWhether a prisoner may bring a ... \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) is a. question of law we review de novo.\u201d <em>Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337 (11th Cir.2013). The \u201capplicability of the savings clause is a threshold jurisdictional issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We cannot reach the merits of Appellant\u2019s petition unless the district court had jurisdiction to entertain it. <em>Id. </em>(holding that \u00a7 2255(e) imposes a jurisdictional limit on \u00a7 2241 petitions).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">B. <em>Availability of Habeas Relief under \u00a7\u00a7 22M and 2255</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Appellant seeks an order vacating his life sentence on the ground that it is.\u201cillegal.\u201d Appellant\u2019s habeas claim is thus expressly covered by and ordinarily would have to be asserted under \u00a7 2255(a), which authorizes a motion to \u201cvacate, set aside or correct\u201d a sentence that a federal prisoner claims is unconstitutional or illegal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). <em>See also Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2013) (noting that a federal prisoner ordinarily may only collaterally attack his final conviction and sentence through a \u00a7 2255 habeas petition); <em>Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1352 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cA prisoner in custody pursuant to a federal court judgment may proceed under \u00a7 2241 only when he raises claims outside the scope of \u00a7 2255(a)\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">As noted, Appellant has previously filed an unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 petition. The district court may only consider a second or successive \u00a7 2255 petition by Appellant if the petition has been certified by this Court to contain: (1) newly discovered evidence sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found Appellant guilty, or (2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). We have not certified this case as appropriate for review under either prong of \u00a7 2255(h). Relief under \u00a7 2255(a) is thus unavailable here. <em>See Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1311 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc) (\u201cThe statutory bar against second or successive motions is one of the most important AEDPA safeguards for finality of judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">Appellant argues that habeas relief is nevertheless available to him via a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>\u00a7 2241 petition that falls within the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255(e). The savings clause permits a prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 petition where the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [the prisoner\u2019s] detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>see also Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1256. As applied to sentencing claims such as Appellant\u2019s, this Court has interpreted the \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d language to permit a \u00a7 2241 petition when: (1) throughout sentencing, direct appeal, and the first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, Circuit precedent specifically addressed and squarely foreclosed the claim raised in the \u00a7 2241 petition, (2) subsequent to the first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, a Supreme Court decision overturned the Circuit precedent that had squarely foreclosed the claim, (3) the new rule announced by the Supreme Court applies retroactively on collateral review, (4) as a result of the new rule being retroactive, the petitioner\u2019s current sentence exceeds the statutory maximum authorized by Congress, and (5) the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) reaches the petitioner\u2019s claim. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Appellant\u2019s claim does not meet any of the requirements set forth above. Appellant does-not point to any Circuit precedent that prevented him from raising the claims he now asserts in his initial \u00a7 2255 petition. Nor does he cite any \u201cnew\u201d Supreme Court rule, much less a retroactively applicable rule, that even arguably supports his claims. The only recent decision cited by Appellant, <em>Burgess v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 124, 129, 128 S.Ct. 1572, 170 L.Ed.2d 478 (2008), undermines his claims because it establishes that Appellant\u2019s Ohio drug abuse conviction, which was punishable by up to three years imprisonment, was in fact a qualifying predicate under \u00a7 841. <em>See Burgess, </em>553 U.S. at 129-132, 128 S.Ct. 1572 (interpreting the term \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as used in \u00a7 841 to include offenses punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, regardless of how those offenses are categorized under State law). All of the other Supreme Court cases cited by Appellant were issued prior, to his conviction in 2001.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the absence of any new, retroactively applicable Supreme Court authority in support of his claims, there is no basis for permitting Appellant to pursue habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 and the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">For the reasons discussed above, the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Appellant\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\">. Section 841 (b)( 1 )(A)(viii) imposes a mandatory minimum life sentence when a person is convicted of a drug distribution offense involving 50 grams or more of methamphetamine \"after two or more prior convictions for a felony drug offense.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii), For purposes of this statute, a \u201cfelony drag offense\" is defined as \"an offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State ... that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to\u201d various illegal drugs. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b748-5\">.
