On appeal, Broxson argues that: (1) the district court clearly erred in ascribing to her a base offense level of 36 based on a factual finding that she had attempted to purchase at least 1.5 kilograms but less than 4.5 kilograms of methamphetamine, or \u201cice\u201d; and (2) the court clearly erred in failing to provide a minor-role downward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-13\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of drug-quantity attribution for clear error. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>935 F.2d 201, 205 (11th Cir.1991). We also review a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 934 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-14\">First, we are unpersuaded by Broxson\u2019s claim that the district court clearly erred in calculating the drug quantity for purposes of her sentence. We afford \u201cgreat deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations of drug-quantity witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Barsoum, </em>763 F.3d 1321, 1333 (11th Cir.2014) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1883, 191 L.Ed.2d 753 (2015). In sentencing, the district court\u2019s calculation of drug quantity \u201cmay be based on fair, accurate, and conservative estimates, but not on mere speculation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-17\">Here, Broxson has failed to demonstrate that it was clearly erroneous for the district court to attribute prior drug transactions to her. Broxson\u2019s argument relies largely on the discrepancies in the testimony of her co-conspirator, John Matthew Love \u2014 discrepancies that largely concern whether Love had sold Broxson drugs once or twice prior to the attempted transaction that led to her arrest. However, the evidence supports Love\u2019s testimony as reliable, including evidence of phone calls between her and Love, th\u00e9 letter and photograph she sent to him, and the testimony of a Drug Enforcement Agent. In any event, whether Love previously sold Broxson drugs once or twice is irrelevant, since the amount allegedly sold at either of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>those two prior sales \u2014 when combined with the undisputed kilogram Broxson attempted to purchase at the time of her arrest \u2014 totals at least 1.5 kilograms, the minimum quantity for a base offense level of 36, which is the level the district court calculated for her. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">We also find no merit to Broxson\u2019s claim that the district court clearly erred in determining her role in the offense. The district court has \u201cconsiderable discretion in making this fact-intensive determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277-78 (11th Cir.2002). The defendant bears the burden of establishing his qualification for a minor role reduction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Alvarez-Cona, </em>447 F.3d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Under the Guidelines, a defendant may receive a reduction for having a limited role in the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. The defendant may receive a four-level reduction if she was a minimal participant, a two-level reduction if she was a minor participant, or a three-level reduction if she was somewhere between a minimal and minor participant. <em>Id. </em>A minimal participant is one who was \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of the group.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.4). Minor participants are those who are less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.5). Section 3B1.2 \u201cprovides a range of adjustments for a defendant who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">In determining whether a mitigating-role adjustment applies, the district court should consider two principles: \u201cfirst, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which she has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, her role as compared to that of other participants in her relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. Under the first principle, \u201cthe district court must measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct\u201d that was attributed to her in calculating her base offense level, as \u201csome defendants may be held accountable for conduct that is much broader than their specific acts,\u201d such as in a conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>at 940-41. More to the point, \u201cwhere the relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to her actual conduct, she cannot prove that she is entitled to a minor role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader criminal scheme in which she was a minor participant but for which she was not held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">As for the second principle, the Guidelines \u201cclearly contemplate some assessment of relative culpability,\u201d but the district court may \u201clook to other participants only to the extent that they are identifiable or discernable from the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. Then, the district court \u201cmay consider only those participants who were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant. The conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Still, the fact that a defendant\u2019s role is less than other participants\u2019 roles in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive because it is possible that none of them are minor or minimal participants. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Here, the district court did not clearly err in declining to.apply a minor-role reduction to Broxson\u2019s conduct. Although Broxson again argues that Love\u2019s testimony regarding additional purchases was unreliable, it was well within the district court\u2019s discretion in this fact-intensive inquiry to determine the credibility of Love\u2019s statements. <em>See Boyd, </em>291 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>1277-78; <em>Barsoum, </em>763 F.3d at 1333. Examining the first prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>test, Broxson was held accountable at sentencing only for the conduct attributable to her \u2014 namely, her role in conspiring to possess and distribute between 1.5 and 4.5 kilograms of methamphetamine. Therefore, Broxson\u2019s actual and relevant conduct were the same, and she did not play a minor role in that conduct. Examining the second prong, Broxson initiated contact with the seller, negotiated price, arranged details of the transactions, and traveled to the seller\u2019s apartment to make the purchase. On this record, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in finding that Broxson was not a minor participant in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
