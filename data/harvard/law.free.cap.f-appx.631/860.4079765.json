On appeal, Blanc argues that his guidelines were miscalculated because the district court improperly concluded that he was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision to classify a defendant as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). A prior panel\u2019s holding is binding precedent on all subsequent panels unless or until it is overruled while we are sitting en banc,.or until the precedent is overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>635 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-15\">A defendant is a career offender if, among other things, he has at least two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). This case involves prior convictions for a \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHSq\">means an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-16\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.2(b). Florida law punishes the sale, manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, of cocaine as a second-degree felony, punishable for a prison term of up to 15 years. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 893.13(1), 775.082(3)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-17\">We have previously decided that a prior conviction under \u00a7 893.13(1) is a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). <em>United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262, 1267-68 (11th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 2827, 192 L.Ed.2d 864 (2015). In <em>Smith, </em>we rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>the argument that a predicate offense, as defined in \u00a7 4B1.2(b), requires mens rea, noting that neither Congress nor the Sentencing Commission had called for a mens rea requirement in the prior offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Here, the district court did not err in concluding that Blanc\u2019s prior convictions qualified as \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(b) and that, therefore, he qualified as a career offender. <em>See id. </em>at 2165-68. Despite Blanc\u2019s current objections, we\u2019ve squarely held that a mens rea element is not required under \u00a7 4B 1.2(b) to conclude that a prior conviction is a predicate offense. <em>See id. </em>at 1267-68. Nor have we incorrectly defined a \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d since the 1988 definition in \u00a7 4B1.2(b) was significantly distinct from the more recent definition used in calculating Blanc\u2019s guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 1267-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">We are also unpersuaded by Blanc\u2019s reliance on <em>McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 2298, 192 L.Ed.2d 260 (2015), and <em>Elonis v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2001, 192 L.Ed.2d 1 (2015). In <em>McFadden, </em>the Supreme Court construed the language of the Controlled Substance Analogue statutes themselves. <em>See id. </em>at 2304-05. Similarly, while the Supreme Court opined in <em>Elonis </em>that omission of mens rea from a criminal statute does not eliminate a mens rea requirement, <em>Elonis </em>dealt with a different category of criminal offenses and concerned the elements of proof necessary for a <em>conviction. See id. </em>at 2008-12. Notably, neither <em>McFadden </em>nor <em>Elonis </em>involved -the construction of the sentencing guidelines in relation to predicate offenses where the prior conviction explicitly did not require a mens rea element. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. Thus, neither this Court nor the Supreme Court has overturned <em>Smith, </em>and we affirm Blanc\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
