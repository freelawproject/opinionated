For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">After Mr. Gilmore pled guilty to two counts of bank robbery by force or violence, the probation office prepared a pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d). The PSI assigned Mr. Gilmore an offense level of 32 because it designated him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. That enhancement applies if the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time he committed the instant offense of conviction; the instant offense is either a violent felony or a felony controlled substance offense; and the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions either of a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The PSI stated that Mr. Gilmore was twenty-seven when he committed the robberies (which were crimes of violence), and that he had at least two prior predicate felony offenses. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The PSI listed four predicate offenses: a 2005 conviction for possession with intent to sell cannabis within 1000 feet of a place of worship; a <em>2009 </em>conviction for possession with intent to sell cannabis within 1000 feet of a school; a 2010 conviction for sale of cannabis within 1000 feet of a place of worship; and a 2012 conviction for recidivist battery. After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Mr. Gilmore\u2019s total offense level was 29. His criminal history category was VI, which yielded a guidelines range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">Mr. Gilmore objected to the PSI\u2019s use of his battery conviction as a predicate offense, acknowledging that binding circuit precedent established that battery was a violent felony under the career offender enhancement\u2019s residual clause but preserving the argument for appeal. He also objected to the use of his drug convictions as predicate offenses because they did not necessarily involve an exchange of money, analogizing to cases holding that remuneration is required for an offense to qualify as \u201ctrafficking\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the guidelines provision governing unlawful reentry enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">The district court overruled Mr. Gilmore\u2019s objections, noting that \u201cthere\u2019s ample convictions here to put him in the career offender category.\u201d Doc. 53 at 9.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court nonetheless varied downward from the guidelines range and sentenced Mr. Gilmore to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">This is Mr. Gilmore\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-13\">We review the district court\u2019s determination that Mr. Gilmore qualified as a career offender <em>de novo. United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). For any challenge he raises for the first time on appeal, however, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Ramirez-Flores, </em>743 F.3d 816, 821 (11th Cir.2014), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.C.t 948, 190 L.Ed.2d 843 (2015). We may reverse on that ground only if we find (1) error (2) that is plain and (3) affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and then only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 822. We review <em>de novo </em>issues of statutory interpretation, looking first to the plain language of the statute at issue. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>States v. Segarra, </em>582 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">To qualify as a career offender, a defendant must have at least two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)(3). As used in section 4B1.1, \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-8\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.2(b). The Florida statute under which Mr. Gilmore was convicted in 2005, 2009, and 2010 provides that \u201ca person may not sell, manufacture, or deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, a controlled substance.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a). The possession with intent to sell or the sale of a controlled substance in violation of this statute within 1000 feet of a school or church is a felony punishable by up to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 893.13(l)(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">Mr. Gilmore contends that, because his prior convictions under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) did not necessarily require remuneration, the convictions cannot properly be classified as controlled substance offenses under the career offender enhancement. He contends that our holding in <em>Young v. United States, </em>936 F.2d 533 (11th Cir.1991), established that a state crime qualifies as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under section 4B1.2(b) only if it is substantially similar to a federal drug trafficking crime which, he urges, requires an exchange of money for drugs. <em>See Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 1686-87, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013) (holding that a conviction under Georgia\u2019s statute criminalizing possession with intent to distribute marijuana, which does not require remuneration, does not constitute \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), 1227(a)(2) (A) (iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">But, the plain language of the \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d definition in the guidelines when Mr. Gilmore was sentenced, which includes \u201cpossession of a controlled substance ... with intent to ... distributee] or dispense,\u201d illustrates that remuneration is not required. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B 1.2(b). Mr. Gilmore\u2019s contention otherwise is based on this Court\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines definition before it was amended in 2013. We discussed this change in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262 (11th Cir.2014), in which we rejected the applicability of <em>Young </em>to the guidelines as amended. In <em>Smith, </em>we concluded that the appellant\u2019s \u201creliance on <em>Young </em>is misplaced because the definition of \u2018controlled substance offense\u2019 that we interpreted in <em>Young </em>is distinct from the definition at issue in this appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1268. \u201cWhen we decided <em>Young, </em>\u2018controlled substance offense\u2019 was defined as an enumerated list of federal drug trafficking crimes and \u2018similar offenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(2) (1988)). \u201cBut the definition of \u2018controlled substance offense,\u2019 in this appeal, does not reference drug trafficking or a class of \u2018similar offenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b) (2013)). Mr. Gilmore was sentenced under the amended definition of \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d Thus, Mr. Gilmore\u2019s reliance on <em>Young </em>similarly is misplaced. The district court did not err in overruling Mr. Gilmore\u2019s objection on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">For the first time on appeal, Mr. Gilmore additionally argues that his convictions under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>be classified as predicate controlled substances offenses for purposes of the career offender enhancement because that statute contains no mens rea requirement, whereas the enhancement does. As Mr. Gilmore acknowledges, however, we also rejected this challenge in <em>Smith. See </em>775 F.3d at 1268 (\u201cSection 893.13(1) of the Florida Statutes is ... a \u2018controlled substance offense,\u2019 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). Neither [that] definition [nor the related, \u2018serious drug offense\u2019 definition in the Armed Career Criminal Act] requires that a predicate state offense includes an element of <em>mens rea </em>with respect to the illicit nature of the controlled substance.\u201d). We are bound to follow <em>Smith </em>unless and until it is overruled by the Supreme Court or this Court sitting en banc. <em>See United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008). Accordingly, there was no error, plain or otherwise, in the imposition of the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Mr. Gilmore had three prior convictions under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a), each of which qualified as a predicate offense for the career offender enhancement. The enhancement requires only two prior convictions; thus, the district court properly applied it to Mr. Gilmore\u2019s guidelines range. And, because we conclude that Mr. Gilmore had the requisite predicate offenses to qualify as a career offender, we need not discuss any impact that <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), may have on the status of Mr. Gilmore\u2019s battery conviction as a qualifying offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-8\">. \"Doc.\u201d refers to the docket entry in the district court record in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
