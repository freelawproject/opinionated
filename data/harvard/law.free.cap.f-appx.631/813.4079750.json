The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) concluded that Hunt\u2019s alcohol abuse was a contributing factor material to the ALJ\u2019s disability determination and, thus, that Hunt was not disabled under the Social Security Act (\u201cSSA\u201d). Hunt also appeals the denial of his motion for a remand under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is limited to whether substantial evidence supports the decision and whether the correct legal standards were applied. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cIf the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, this Court must affirm, even if the proof preponderates against it.\u201d <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005). Under this limited standard of review, we may not make fact-findings, re-weigh evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). The claimant bears the burden of proving his disability and must produce evidence supporting his claim. <em>See Ellison v. Barnhart, </em>355 F.3d 1272, 1276 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">The ALJ uses a five-step process to determine whether the claimant has met his burden of proving that he is disabled. <em>See Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1237-39 (11th Cir.2004). Frist, the ALJ determines whether the claimant is engaged in \u201csubstantial gainful activity.\u201d If not, the ALJ decides whether the claimant\u2019s impairment is \u201csevere\u201d and, if so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>whether the claimant\u2019s impairment meets or equals a specified impairment in the Listing of Impairments. If the claimant has a severe impairment that does not meet or equal a listed impairment, the ALJ assesses a claimant\u2019s \u201cresidual functional capacity\u201d (\u201cRFC\u201d), which measures whether a claimant can perform past relevant work despite the impairment. If the claimant is unable to perform past relevant work, the ALJ determines whether, in the light of the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience, the claimant can perform other work in the national economy. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the claimant cannot make the adjustment to other work,\u201d the claimant is deemed disabled. <em>Id. </em>at 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">If medical evidence exists of a disabled claimant\u2019s alcohol abuse, the ALJ must then determine whether the claimant\u2019s alcohol abuse was a material contributing factor to the disability determination. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1535, 416.935(b)(1). The \u201ckey factor\u201d in this analysis is whether the claimant would still be found disabled if he stopped using alcohol. <em>Id. </em>If the ALJ determines that the answer to this inquiry is \u201cno,\u201d the claimant is not considered disabled under the SSA. <em>Id.; </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(C). The claimant bears the burden of proving that he would still be disabled even if he stopped using alcohol. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1275-76 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">In Hunt\u2019s case, the ALJ applied the initial five-step evaluation process and determined that Hunt had engaged in no substantial gainful activity since his application date. The ALJ also determined that Hunt had severe impairments<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but that none of Hunt\u2019s impairments met or equaled a Listed Impairment, including the listed impairment for mental retardation (\u201cListing 12.05(C)\u201d). The ALJ then concluded that Hunt was unable to perform his past relevant work or to perform other work in the national economy and, thus, was disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">Given the medical evidence of Hunt\u2019s alcohol abuse, however, the ALJ then inquired into whether Hunt\u2019s alcohol abuse was a contributing material factor in the disability determination. Given Hunt\u2019s age, education, work experience, and RFC, the ALJ determined that \u2014 if Hunt stopped using alcohol \u2014 he could perform several jobs in the national economy. As a result, the ALJ concluded that Hunt\u2019s alcohol abuse was a material contributing factor to the disability determination and that Hunt was therefore not disabled under the SSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">On appeal, Hunt argues that the ALJ erred in concluding that his limitations did not meet or equal Listing 12.05(C).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For a claimant to establish a disability under Listing 12.05(C), he must show (1) that he has \u201csignificantly subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning\u201d and (2) that he has \u201c[a] valid verbal, performance, or full scale IQ of 60 through 70 and a physical or other mental impairment. imposing an additional and significant work-related limitation of function.\u201d <em>See </em>20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 12.00A, 12.05; <em>cf. Crayton v. Callahan, </em>120 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Hunt failed to satisfy the criteria for presumptive disability under Listing 12.05(C). Substantial evidence supports a finding that Hunt suffered no significant d\u00e9ficits \u2014 as required under the first part of Listing 12.05(C) \u2014 in adaptive functioning. Hunt performed a wide range of activities of daily living (\u201cADLs\u201d), including personal grooming, dressing, preparing simple meals, driving, shopping, paying bills, counting change, reading, watching television, and spending time with others. And, to the extent Hunt alleged difficulty in performing ADLs, he alleged difficulty based on physical pain, not on his cognitive limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Hunt\u2019s work history is also inconsistent with a finding of mental retardation under Listing 12.05(C). The record shows that Hunt held consistently a job for 27 years, and nothing evidences that Hunt required or received special accommodations from his employers. The ALJ committed no error in considering Hunt\u2019s work history in evaluating the conclusive nature of his low IQ score. <em>See Lowery v. Sullivan, </em>979 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1992) (an IQ score is not conclusive of intellectual disability \u201cwhere the I.Q. score is inconsistent with other evidence in the record on the claimant\u2019s daily activities and behavior\u201d); <em>Popp v. Heckler, </em>779 F.2d 1497, 1500 (11th Cir.1986) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The ALJ\u2019s determination- is also supported by the medical opinions of two non-examining psychologists, Drs. Fleece and Gross. Hunt argues, however, that the ALJ erred by giving greater weight to the opinions of Drs. Fleece and Gross than to the opinion of an examining psychologist, Dr. Nichols.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Based on a one-time evaluation, Dr. Nichols- concluded that Hunt had a full scale IQ score of 51 and that Hunt functions in the mild range of mental retardation. -In contrast, Dr. Fleece, a state agency psychologist, concluded \u2014 based on Hunt\u2019s long work history and on his reported ADLs \u2014 that Hunt had low borderline cognitive functioning. Dr, Fleece commented that the low IQ test score was implausible given Hunt\u2019s work history, ADLs and given that Dr. Nichols determined (in spite of Hunt\u2019s low IQ score) that Hunt was only \u201cmoderately compromised\u201d by his cognitive deficits. Dr. Fleece also opined that Hunt\u2019s intellectual capacity may have been diminished by his ongoing alcohol abuse.. Dr. Gross, a psychologist reviewer with the Social Security Administration, agreed with Dr. Fleece\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">In determining how much weight to give a medical' opinion, the ALJ considers, among other things, (1) whether the doctor has examined the claimant; (2) the degree to which a doctor\u2019s opinion is supported by an explanation and by medical evidence; and (3) how consistent the doctor\u2019s \u201copinion is with the record as a whole.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(e), 416.927(e). Although the opinion of an examining doctor is generally entitled to greater weight than that of a non-examining 'doctor, the ALJ may reject any doctor\u2019s opinion if the evidence supports a contrary conclusion. <em>Sryock v. Heckler, </em>764 F.2d 834, 835 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to give greater weight to the opinions of Drs. Fleece and Gross than to the opinion of Dr. Nichols. Dr. Fleece\u2019s opinion was explained fully, was supported by medical evidence, and was consistent with the record as a whole. Meanwhile, Dr. Nichols\u2019s assessment of Hunt\u2019s cognitive functioning was inconsistent with Hunt\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>medical history and with evidence in the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Viewing the record as a whole, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Hunt proved no disability under Listing 12.05(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The district court committed no error in denying Hunt\u2019s motion to remand for the agency to consider evidence of Hunt\u2019s school records. Pursuant to the sixth sentence of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), the district court may remand a case to the agency for additional fact-finding \u201cwhere new, material evidence is adduced that was <em>for good cause </em>not presented before the agency.\u201d <em>Shalala v. Schaefer, </em>509 U.S. 292, 113 S.Ct. 2625, 2629 n. 2, 125 L.Ed.2d 239 (1993) (emphasis added); see <em>also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Hunt has failed to show sufficient good cause for his delay in attempting to locate his school records (available since 1981) or for his (or his lawyer\u2019s) delay in submitting the school records to the Appeals Counsel. In addition, the school records (which contained Hunt\u2019s IQ test scores when he was 14 years\u2019 old) would not likely change the outcome of Hunt\u2019s case and, thus, are not \u201cmaterial\u201d evidence warranting a remand. <em>See Hyde v. Bowen, </em>823 F.2d 456, 459 (11th Cir.1987) (new evidence is \u201cmaterial\u201d if it is \u201crelevant and probative so that there is a reasonable possibility that it would change the administrative result.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-7\">. The ALJ identified as \"severe\u201d the following impairments: degenerative joint disease of the hips; mild to moderate spondylosis of the lumbar spine; alcohol dependence; alcohol-induced psychosis; and low borderline intellectual functioning secondary to ongoing alcohol abuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b837-13\">. On appeal, Hunt challenges only the ALJ\u2019s determination that he failed to meet the criteria under Listing 12.05(C). Hunt raises no challenge to the ALJ\u2019s determination that Hunt satisfied no listed impairment under sections 1.02, 1.04, 12.02, or 12.09: those arguments are abandoned. <em>See N. Am. Med. Corp. v. Axiom Worldwide, Inc., </em>522 F.3d 1211, 1217 n. 4 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b839-11\">. Moreover, because Dr. Nichols examined Hunt only once, she was no treating physician; and her opinion is unentitled to defer-enc\u00e9. <em>See McSwain v. Bowen, </em>814 F.2d 617, 619 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
