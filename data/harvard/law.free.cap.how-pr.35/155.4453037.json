An agreement in writing to refer.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">There is.no formal agreement signed by the parties, but the order signed by the surrogate recites the presentation of the claim, .and that the parties have agreed on a reference. The attorneys of the parties sign a writing at the foot of the order that they, the parties, consent to the order. Laying out of view the presumption that a formal agreement was preferred, I think the order and consent, taken together, are an an agreement in writing -to refer.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">If the attorney for the administratrix had made an offer in wiiting t\u00f3 refer, and the attorney had signed and delivered to her a written acceptance of the offer, it would not be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>tended but that the two papers would constitute a valid agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Suppose the surrogate had written, the parties have agreed to refer the claim in dispute to these men as referees, naming them, and the attorneys had written beneath it, \u201cwe hereby agree to the above reference,\u201d can it be doubted but that the two papers, taken together, would have been an agreement under the statute ?</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">This is exactly what has been done. The pape^'writteu: by the surrogate takes the form of an order, instead' of a mere statement that the parties had agreed to refer.; v c, 5</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">2d. The persons agreed on as referees must b\u00e9 approved by the surrogate. \u00a3_. \u2022 <em>\\ </em>\u25a0; \u00bf</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">There can be no question but that the surrogate approved the men selected. \u2022 No more conclusive evidence of approval*^ could be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">3d. The agreement and approval must be filed. They were filed, and the fact of filing is noted on the paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">4th. A rule referring the claim to the persons indicated must be entered by the clerk of the supreme court.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">The agreement takes the form of an order\u2019. It was filed with one of the clerks of the supreme court; and the order must be entered in that court, as there is no other court having jurisdiction to make the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">Entitling the order in surrogate\u2019s court could not impair the regularity of the order. The county clerk was not the clerk of the surrogate\u2019s court; he could not enter it, therefore, in that court, and the entry could have effect only in the supreme court, whose clerk he was and in which court it could be regularly entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">But assuming that it never was entered by the clerk, it can be done <em>nunc pro </em>tunc, and should be so entered to prevent a failure of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">But if it must be assumed that the papers are not in conformity to the statute, I am nevertheless satisfied that the referees acquired jurisdiction to hear, try and determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>matters in controversy between the parties, and that their report is legal and binding on the parties until it is set aside by the court in some proceeding properly instituted for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The supreme court has jurisdiction over the claims which were submitted to the referees; - in other words, it has jurisdiction of the subject matter. By the voluntary consent and appearance of the parties, jurisdiction of their persons was obtained; and when jurisdiction over both is acquired, the. proceedings thereafter are valid, however irregular they may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Section 270 of the Code provides that all or any of the issues in an action may be referred upon the written consent of the parties. Under the old practice, the reference of the issues in an action not referable, or to a greater or less number than the statute prescribed, was a discontinuance of the action, and'the reference became an arbitration merely.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">It will be seen that a consent <em>in writing </em>is necessary to refer issues in all cases in which the court may not compel a reference, and hene\u00e9 a written consent is just as necessary to a valid reference under the Code, as to a valid reference under the statute relating to the reference of claims against executors and administrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">It was held in <em>Leaycraft </em>agt. <em>Fowler </em>(17 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>259) that the consent to refer under section 270 of the Code may be written by the parties, or their attorneys, or by the clerk entering their consent in his minutes, or by the referees in their minutes, consent being given thereto. And the parties might waive any entry other than that made by the referees on their minutes. In that case, after appearing before the two referees to whom the issues had been referred, a third was added, and the only entry was by the referees in their minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">The same was held in <em>Keator </em>agt. <em>Ulster Plank Road Co. </em>(7 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>41). In that case there was no writing, the agreement to refer was in open court; and it was held the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>requirement of the statute as to consent in writing could be and was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">As to the power to waive the requirement, see <em>Baker </em>agt. <em>Bramen </em>(6 <em>Hill, </em>47); <em>Lee </em>agt. <em>Tillotson </em>(34 <em>Wend. </em>337) ; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Murry </em>(5 <em>Hill, </em>468); <em>Embury </em>agt. <em>Conner </em>(3 <em>Coms. </em>511).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In <em>Harris </em>agt. <em>Bradshaw </em>(18 <em>J. R. </em>26) a rule of reference was entered by consent in an action of assumpsit, but the trial did not require the examination of a long account. The cause was tried, a report made and sued upon as an award. The court held the reference regular. The court say the consent of the parties to a reference concluded them from objecting that the action was not referable. It being assumpsit, it may have involved long accounts. The reference was an admission that the case was within the statute, and the court would not listen to an objection to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Proceedings upon a reference, is a waiver of all objections because of irregularities. <em>(Garcie </em>agt. <em>Sheldon, </em>3 <em>Barb. </em>232). In <em>Bonner </em>agt. <em>McPhail </em>(31 <em>Barb. </em>106) the action was slander for words spoken in reference to the evidence of a plaintiff in an action tried before a referee. No order of reference had been entered, and was not until some two months after trial, when one was entered <em>nunc pro tunc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">It was held by the general term in .the second district, that the referee had no power to administer oaths. <em>But </em>that the omission to obtain the order of reference before the referee proceeded to hear the cause, was an irregularity which the parties might waive or correct so as to give effect to the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">In <em>Comstock </em>agt. <em>Olmstead </em>(6 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>77) Judge Gbidley decided that when a claim was presented against an estate and rejected, and an agreement to refer entered into, but it was never filed nor rule entered, that the court did not come possessed of the cause, and he cites in support of the position <em>Robert </em>agt. <em>Ditmas </em>(7 <em>Wend. </em>525) in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\u25a0 Savage, Ch. J. says there must be an agreement in writing filed as the foundation o\u2019f the rule to refer, there must be a report and the report must be confirmed. It will be seen, by reference to the opinion of the chief justice that he was not speaking, nor was he called to speak, as to whether compliance with each of these requirements was essential to give validity to the report. He spoke of them as he would of the service of process, joining issue and serving notice of trial as necessary to a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">But while the general rule is that each step is necessary, yet it does not follow but that some of them may be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">I can perceive no more necessity for an agreement in writing and rule of reference in the class of cases under consideration than under section 270 of - the Code, already referred to. If they may be dispensed with in the one case, so may they in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The appearance before the. referees, the trial of the claim presented and report thereon, are all that are necessary to justify the entry of a judgment. All the .preliminary steps may be supplied <em>nunc pro time. </em>(1 <em>Wend. </em>314.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">I think the order should be reversed and the appeal, &amp;c., restored. \u25a0 -</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
