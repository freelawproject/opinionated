The rule is uniform, that the court will not grant a new trial where the evi dence is conflicting, or where it is seen that the facts proved are deemed by the jury conclusive of the case.

The papers from the marine court were properly excluded, because the general term, in this cause, had virtually directed it to be done, and because a defendant cannot give evidence of any fact not specifically and specially set up in his answer. Each item of defense must be specifically pleaded. The general issue (or general denial) is abolished. Production of the note upon the trial was sufficient evidence of title and ownership, until the contrary was shown by the appellant; and this question, too, was passed upon by the jury, <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 149; <em>Wheeler </em>agt. <em>Ruckman, </em>1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number><em>Robt </em>408, <em>G. </em>T; <em>James </em>agt. <em>Chalmers, 2 Seld. </em>209; <em>Bailey </em>agt.

The attachment in the case of <em>Drury </em>agt. <em>Bussell </em>was void, and the jury have decided that it came too late to affect the title of the plaintiff to the note. The action having been commenced by the service of a summons by publication against a non-resident debtor, the attachment could be of no avail until after the last day of publication mentioned in the order. All the papers in that action, too, were properly excluded at the last trial. <em>{Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 99,137, 237; 3 <em>B. S. 5th </em>ed,p. 84, \u00a7 38.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-6\">\u201c It is true, service could be made in such a case by publication; but a warrant' of attachment would be of little avail in such a case, as it could only be enforced after the last day of publication, which completed such service. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 137; <em>Knox </em>agt. <em>Mason, </em>MSS. <em>June </em>15, 1865, <em>Superior Court, G. </em>T. <em>and cases cited; Fisher </em>agt. <em>Curtis, </em>2 <em>Sandf. </em>660; <em>Kerr </em>agt. <em>Mount, </em>28 <em>N.

The provisions of the Revised Statutes in relation to attachments against non-resident debtors harmonize with the Code. The lien by virtue of an attachment attaches from the time of the actual seizure of the property attached. This note was never levied upon. The summons in <em>Drwry </em>agt. <em>Bussell </em>had not been served when the attachment was pretended to be served, to wit., the next day after the attachment was issued. Russell resided in Virginia and Drury in New York. This, too, was fatal. An attachment is one of the provisional remedies of the Code, and the statute must be strictly followed. The rule is the same as it is in relation to serving an injunction. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 99, 137, 237, 471, <em>title 7, </em>\u00a7 178, <em>&amp;c.; Fraser </em>agt. <em>Greenhill, </em>3 <em>Code R. </em>172; <em>Hurlbut </em>agt. <em>Hope Ins.

A promissory note is a chose in action, and cannot be levied upon (unless it is seized and carried away), because it is capable of manual delivery. The indorsement of the note operated as an assignment, and therefore the note should have been seized, or else a certificate demanded; but nothing of the kind was attempted. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7$ 231, 232, 234, 235, 463, 464; <em>Loftus </em>agt. <em>Clark, </em>1 <em>Hill </em>310, <em>G. </em>T.; <em>Ransom </em>agt. <em>Miner, </em>3 <em>Sandf. </em>692, <em>G. </em>T.; <em>Marsh </em>agt. <em>Backus, </em>16 <em>Barb. </em>483, <em>G. </em>T.; <em>Insurance Co. </em>agt. <em>Railroad Co, </em>41 <em>Barb. </em>9, <em>G. </em>T.; <em>Wilson </em>agt. <em>Little </em>2 <em>Comst. on p. </em>447; <em>The Dry Dock Bank </em>agt. <em>Life Ins.

Their, omission is fatal, and the question can be raised at any time by any one sought to be affected by the attachment. The affidavits upon which the attachment was granted, the undertaking and affidavits of justification, and notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>of the attachment, in <em>Drury </em>agt. <em>Russell,-ms </em>entirely omitted from the appeal book, and therefore the papers cannot be noticed by the court on appeal. The appeal book does not show the grounds upon which the attachment was issued. <em>(Code </em>\u00a7\u00a7 232, 236, 194, 471; 3 <em>R.

The note passed to the plaintiff by indorsement, delivery and sale, more than twenty days before the attachment was issued, and therefore, even if it was valid\u00bb it could not affect 'the plaintiff\u2019s title to the note. This fact, too, was passed upon by the jury. (3 <em>R. S. 5th ed. p. </em>84, \u00a7 38; <em>Farmers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Bank agt. Wad</em>sworth, 2 <em>A.

The plaintiff being the owner of the note, and Bussell (the payee) having n* property in this state when the attachment was issued, the judgment in <em>Drury </em>agt. <em>Russell </em>is void, and also the assignment from Bussell to the plaintiff were properly excluded by the court, because the plaintiff makes title at a date prior to either of them. This, too, was passed upon by the jury. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7. 132; <em>Force </em>agt. <em>Gower, </em>23 <em>How. </em>194, <em>G. T.; Fiske </em>agt. <em>Anderson, </em>12 <em>Abb. </em>8, <em>G.

The dismissal of the complaint by Judge Woodbupf (June 13, 1856), and the judgment for costs entered thereon, was no bar to a recovery here. His honor who presided at the last trial charged the jury correctly in this and all other respects. No error was committed in ruling out the judgment roll and case, and other papers, in <em>Wheeler </em>agt. <em>Lake </em>&amp; <em>Ruckman, </em>or any other matter of defense. If his honor had ruled otherwise, he would have committed the same errors which were committed at the fourth trial, and for which errors in his ruling a new trial was granted (December 5, 1863) to the present respondent. No error was committed by his honor in charging the jury as he did, or in declining to charge them as requested by counsel for the appellant; and the cause having been tried the - last time in accordance with the instructions and decisions sent down from the general term, the judg. ment entered upon the verdict must now be affirmed, with costs.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkH\">The counsel for the defendant moved, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>on the trial of the issues of fact in this action, to dismiss the complaint, upon the ground that the former action in this court, mentioned in the answer, was a bar to this action, which the court refused, and an exception was taken by him to such refusal. He also requested the presiding judge to charge the jury that the plaintiff bought this note for prosecution, being a practicing attorney, and therefore could not recover upon it, which the judge refused and the counsel excepted. The presiding judge charged the jury that neither the judgment in the former action between the same parties, in this court, nor that in the action in the marine court, brought in the name of Russell, were bars to this action; to which instructions the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted. These are all the exceptions in the case upon the merits. The judgment in the former action in this court was no bar, because the complaint in it was merely dismissed, and the issues were never tried or a verdict of the jury given. <em>(Dexter agt. Clarke, 22 How. </em>389; <em>Seaman agt. Ward, 1 Hilt. </em>52; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Vilas, 3 Abb. N. S. </em>252; <em>Coit </em>agt. <em>Beard, </em>33 <em>Barb. </em>357; <em>Coit </em>agt. <em>Bland, </em>22 <em>How. </em>2; <em>S. C. 12 Abb. </em>462.) The judgment in the marine court was also no bar, because it was a dismissal of the complaint for want of parties, and not on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The reversal seems to have had no other effect than to give the plaintiff in it costs, as it was never tried again, <em>(Anon. </em>9 <em>Wend. </em>503.) This judgment was also not set up in the answer as any defense; nor was any such defense set up therein as to the purchase by the plaintiff\" of such note for prosecution, although it had been in the former action in this court; so that no such defense was admissible on the trial! Besides, there was not enough evidence in the- case to sustain a charge of a purchase for such purpose, if it had been set up as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The written agreement of the 3d of February, 1854, did not constitute a purchase of the note in question ; the parol agreement of the 4th made it only partly one, and the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>tiff was already employed to sue upon it. The assignment in December, 1854, was executed after the termination of the action in the marine court, and its objects and occasion fully explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The following questions were excluded on the trial; to whose exclusion the counsel for the defendant excepted:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">1st. \u201cDid you draw the complaint in this easel\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">This was put to the plaintiff, in reference to the action in the marine court, brought in the name of Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">2d. \u201cDid you not also on that trial claim that Robert P, Russell was the owner of the note?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">This also referred to the trial in the marine court.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">3d. \u201cHad you ever commenced any other suit for Robert P. Russell, prior to this note being left with you?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">Hone of the information sought by these questions was material. In fact, the first was answered by the plaintiff, testifying subsequently, that his brother drew <em>the complaint </em>inquired about, and he did not. In reference to the second, he stated that he employed counsel on such trial. Hor do I see that his claiming on the trial that Russoll was the owner of the note, was more important than his acting as attorney in the suit in which he claimed it. That question was disposed of by this court when this case was before it formerly. (1 <em>Robt. R. </em>408.) The fact of commencing or not commencing some other suit for Russell, before the note was left by him with the plaintiff, was wholly irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">The following question was put to the plaintiff, and its admission excepted to:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">Q. \u201cDid you ever at any time, in substance, make any claim to this note, other than that you became the owner on the 4th of February, 1854?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">But the exception became useless, because it was never answered, the plaintiff merely saying, in reply to which no objection was made, that he didn\u2019t \u201cthink he ev\u00e9r testified to that;\u201d and so it appears by the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">The defendant\u2019s counsel offered a copy of th\u00e9 case, pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>pared on the appeal from the judgment on a former trial of this action, claimed to be in the handwriting of the plaintiff, which the case before us states, showed an entire different statement by him from that made on the present trial. The fact that the case was in his handwriting can make no difference. as to the admissibility of the evidence. The case itself is no evidence of what took place on the trial. <em>(Neilson </em>agt. <em>Columbian Ins. Co. 1 Johns. R. 301.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">These are all the exceptions insisted on upon the argument. The jury passed upon the question of the transfer to the plaintiff on the 3d or 4th of February, 1854 (prior to the attachment in the <em>Drury </em>case), because it was expressly submitted to' them, and they were directed to find for the defendant, if the note was not then transferredj and this fully defeated any claim under the Drury attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">There being no error in the charge or refusal, to charge, or the admission or exclusion of \u25a0 testimony, the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">I concur.\u2014S. Jones.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
