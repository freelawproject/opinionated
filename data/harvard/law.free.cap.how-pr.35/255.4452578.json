Their power was below ' the limits embraced in that map.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b259-9\">The act of 1813 expressly limited their powers to that part of the city not laid out by virtue of the act of 1807. They had no authority to lay out or open any streets or public places but such as were provided for on the said map.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b259-10\">The authority conferred by the legislature upon the commissioners of the Central Park, to make application to lay out a road or public drive between the northerly line of Fifty-ninth street and the southerly line of One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street, did not in any way interfere with the authority previously bestowed upon the common council.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b259-11\">The legislature might have laid out this drive mentioned in the act, and having the power, they might authorize others to do it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b259-12\">A mere error of judgment Of the commissioners in the valuation of property taken for such purpose is not the subject of review on a motion to confirm their report, unless the sum allowed was grossly inadequate and unequal as compared with other valuations, or unless some wrong principle was adopted as to the amount allowed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b259-13\">This act of 1865 does not authorize the taking of any land by the commissioners not required for the drive or road, which the act provides shall be of an unform width, and is described in the notice required to be given by the commissioners as follows : \u201c Said road or public drive is of a general width of one hundred and fifty-feet, \u00e1s s\u00fcown on a certain map,\u201d &amp;c.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b259-14\"><em>Meld, </em>therefore, that the commissioners had no jurisdiction to take gores of land outside of said road or drive, and so far as such gores are included in thet'e proceedings, they are erroneously taken.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b260-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>\n<em>First Judicial District, June, 1868.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-5\"><em>Hon. </em>George G.

Draper, 15 <em>N. Y. R. </em>532; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Raymond, Court of Appeals, March Term.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-12\"><em>Second. </em>Even assuming that the legislature had the constitutional power to confer upon the commissioners of the Central Park the authority given to said commissioners by the act of 1865, the objector contends that the said commissioners had no right, <em>in this </em>proceeding, to take the property belonging to him, whiclnis shown upon the diagram annexed to the objections filed by him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-13\"><em>{a.) </em>It will be perceived, by reference to the first section of the act of 1865, that the powers of the commissioners of the Central Park, as to laying out \u201c <em>public squares and </em>places,\u201d are limited to that part of the city of New York which is north<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>ward of the southerly line of One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street. Below One Hun dred and Fifty-fifth street, they have power, under th\u00e1t act, to lay out a road or drive, not a public square or place. How, the triangular piece of property belonging to the objector in no just sense can he said to be a part of the road or drive laid out by the commissioners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-5\">It will be a public place, but not a road or drive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-6\">Although, then, the commissioners may have since acquired the right to acquire lands for public places, this proceeding being based on the act of 1865, and taken <em>for the opening of the road mentioned in that act, </em>the powers of the commissioners must be determined by that act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-7\">If it should be said that under the act of 1865, the commissioners have a discretionary power to determine the location, width, courses, windings and grades of such road, &amp;c., the answer is, that it must clearly appear that there has been something like a reasonable exercise of that power; and that, under the pretence of laying out a road or drive, the laying out of squares and public places cannot he accomplished. The two powers are distinct and separate. <em>(Laws </em>of 1865, 1136; <em>Sharp </em>agt. Spier, 4 <em>Hill, </em>76: <em>Sharp </em>agt. <em>Johnson, </em>4 <em>Hill, </em>92.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-8\"><em>Third. </em>Under the provisions of the first section of the act entitled <em>11 </em>an act to prevent fraud in the opening and laying out of streets and avenues in the city of Hew York,\u201d passed April 24,1862, the commissioners of estimate and assessment are required to complete their proceednigs within four months from the time of their appointment, unless further time is allowed ior that purpose by the supreme court. <em>(Laws </em>of 1862, 967; <em>Laws of </em>1865, 1138.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-9\"><em>JTowrth. </em>The award made by the commissioners of estimate and assessment for the property of this objector is grossly inadequate, and far below the actual value of the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-10\"><em>(a.) </em>The affidavits presented on the part of the objector make it quite apparent that the sum of $24,000, the amount finally allowed by the commissioners for the property in question, does not approximate to the value of such property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-11\">These affidavits are seven in number, and are made by men who have had the amplest experience in sales of real estate in and about the vicinity of the property in question, and, in fact, all over Hew York.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-12\">1st. Mr. Loomis, who is, and who for the last fifteen years past has been, an agent and broker engaged in the business of negotiating the sale and purehase of real estate, both in the vicinity of this property and elsewhere in the city, places the value of the same at $60,000, or $36,000 more than has been allowed by the commissioners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-13\">2d. Mr. Kendall, who has been engaged for twenty years past in the business of negotiating the sale and purchase of real estate in every part and section of the city, and who is well acquainted with the property of the objector, values it at $50,000.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-14\">3d. Mr. John McClave, a very well known real estate man, values the property at $50,000.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-15\">4th. Mr. James M. Miller, for thirty-six years past an auctioneer of real estate in this city, a man of the greatest possible experience in such matters, who is well acquainted with the property, values it at $50,000.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-16\">5th. Mr. William H. Raynor, who has been a real estate broker in this city for twenty-five years, values the property at $45,000.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-17\">6th. Mr. Daniel F. Tiemann, a resident of the city for upwards of sixty years, and who is very familiar with the value of real estate in the upper part of the Island of Hew York, values the property at $45,000.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-18\">7th. Mr. William E. Stewart, a resident of the city for upwards of thirty years, values the property at $45,000.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>8th. There is also the objector\u2019s own affidavit attached to the objections, that the property is worth at least $60,000; but. as he is interested, under the rule applicable in these cases, his affidavit cannot probably be taken into consideration as regards value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-5\"><em>Mfth. </em>The commissioners have, however, awarded to the objector $21,000 <em>less than the lowest valuation specified in any of the above affidavits.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-6\">The objector submits that with such affidavit's before the court*, he brings his case within the rule allowing the court to send back a report when ii is strongly against the weight of evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-7\">It is not of course known to the objector, nor can it be until this case is actually argued, whether any, and if so, what, or how many affidavits will be presented by the commissioners to sustain their report; but he confidently submits that whether such affidavits are few or numerous, the experience, character and reputation of the men who have made affidavits in support of bis objections, justifies him in asking the court to weigh well those affidavits, and not to sustain the commissioners in awarding him a sum which is but little more than one-half of the lowest amount specified in those affidavits as the value of his land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-8\"><em>Sixth. </em>But the commissioners have erred in the principle upon which they have acted in arriving at the value of the objector\u2019s land; and on that ground he asks that the report may be sent back to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-9\">Their error consists in this: They have not taken into account the fact that the land of the objector is all front, and have allowed to him no more per square foot than they have awarded for other lands having only one or two fronts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-10\">For the piece of land on the north-westerly corner of Broadway and Seventy-second street, containing only 2,100 square feet, and with only a front on Seventy-second street and Broadway* they have allowed $14,049, or at the rate of $6.70 per square foot, while for the property of the objector they have allowed but $24,000, or less than $6 per square foot.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-11\">For the piece of land on the south-westerly corner of Seventy-second street and Broadway, containing 1,840 square feet, the commissioners have allowed $12,649, or at the rate of $6.90 per square foot.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-12\">For the piece of land on the north-east corner of Seventy-first street and Tenth avenue, containing 1,930 square feet, the commissioners have allowed $14,087, or at the rate of $7.30 per square foot.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-13\">For the piece of land on the south-east corner of Sixtieth street and Broadway, containing 1,600 square feet, the commissioners have allowed $20,000, or at the rate of $12.50 per square foot.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-14\">For the piece of land on the south-west corner of Sixtieth street and Broadway, containing 2,3000 square feet, $33,000, or at the rate of $14.35 per square foot.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-15\">To the objector, whose piece of land conrains 4,150 square feet and fronts on Broadway, the Tenth avenue, and Seventy-third street, and runs to a point facing Seventy-second street, with three full fronts (and it may be said, including the point near Seventy-second street, with four fronts), the commissioners have actually awarded less per foot than to the owners of the property above specified.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-16\">There certainly can be no principle upon which this discrimination is made against the objector.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-17\">For any error in the principle of valuations it is well settled that the report of the commissioners will be recommitted to them, <em>(Matter of Furman </em>Street, 17 <em>Wend. </em>650.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-18\"><em>Seventh. </em>The commissioners, in making their award to the objector, have evidently overlooked the fact that the entire property of the objector is taken for the proposed improvement, and that <em>no </em>residue is left to him to be benefitted by the improvement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The owners of the parcels above referred to, who have received greater proportionate awards than the objector, have a residuum remaining which is much enhanced in value. Yet no allowance has been made for this fact by the commissioners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-5\"><em>Eighth. </em>Again, the taking away of the objector\u2019s property has proportionately increased the value of the adjacent lots oh the Tenth avenue, and it is submitted that a portion of that increase should be credited to the objector in making his award.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-6\"><em>Ninth. </em>The objector, in conclusion, does not deny the well settled principle that the determination of the commissioners is entitled to great weight upon a mere question of value; but he confidently insists that, where the difference between the valuation of the commissioners and of the witnesses for the owner is so great, he is entitled to the benefit of every doubt which the court may have as to the justice of the award. He does insist that it is clear that in this case there has been an error in principle committed by the commissioners in making the award to him; and he therefore asks that the report made be remitted to the commissioners, for the purpose of revision and correction.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-7\">Ira Shafer, <em>for objectors Campion, Ciarle </em>and <em>Grove,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACs\">relied upon the constitutional points presented by the counsel for Witthaus, and objected to the awards, made by the commissioners as inadequate.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-8\">Mr. O\u2019GrORMAK\", in reply to the contestants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-9\">I. As to the objections of Rudolph. A. Witthaus:</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-10\">(a.) It is objected that the act of April 24, 1865 <em>(ch. </em>565 <em>Laws </em>1865), under which these proceedings have been brought, violates section 2, article 10, of the constitution of this state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-11\">This question was raised and determined in <em>The Matter of the Central </em>Park, reported 16 <em>Abb. Pr. R. </em>56.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-12\">In that case and the case at bar the objection was the same, urged by the same counsel, and overruled by Judge Ingraham, who now occupies a seat at the general term. <em>(See points of counsel and opinion of court, </em>16 <em>Abb. </em>56.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-13\">II. The duties devolving on the commissioners of the Central Park, under chapter 565, laws 1865, never did devolve on the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of New York, under the laws of 9th April, 1813, and were not imposed on them at the time of the adoption of the constitution of 1846.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-14\">The 177th section of that act, cited by counsel for Witthaus, empowers th$ mayor, &amp;c., to open streets which <em>had been laid out </em>by the commissioners appointed under the act of 1807, and also to <em>lay out </em>and open any street or public place in any part of the city <em>not </em>laid out in streets, &amp;c., under said act'of 1807.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-15\">But there is no part of the city above Fourth street which was not laid out in streets, etc., by said commissioners under said act; and, therefore, as to all that region, including the locality affected by the proceedings which are now before the court, the mayor, etc., bad acquired no powers and assumed no duties by virtue of the act of01813, save that of applying to the supreme court for the appointment of commissioners to open streets already laid out. But as to <em>laying out </em>a new street or public place in the said district, they had no power whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-16\">Whenever, therefore, it has seemed expedient to <em>lay out or open a new street </em>in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>part of the city, it has become necessary to apply to the legislature for power to do so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-5\">This course was adopted in the case of Madison avenue, which, not having been laid out by the commissioners under the act of 1807, was laid out and opened by virtue of act of the legislature. <em>(Chapter </em>466 <em>Laws of </em>1860.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-6\">The same coarse was adopted as to the extension of Fifty fourth, Fifty-fifth and Fifty-sixth streets. <em>(Chapter </em>73 <em>Laws of </em>1857.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-7\">1. Also in the proceedings under the act of 1853, to take the park itself. <em>{Laws of </em>1853, <em>p. </em>1167.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-8\">2. In the proceedings confirmed by the court in taking the land from One Hundred and Sixth to One Hundred and Tenth street for the extension of the park.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-9\">3. In the widening of Seventh avenue, under the act of 1864. <em>(Laws </em>of 1864, <em>p. </em>637.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-10\">4.

(See <em>chap. </em>361 <em>Laws of </em>1836.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-12\">The road or public drive now in controversy is between Fifty-ninth street and One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Hundred and Fifty-fifth street, and wholly within that part of the city which <em>was </em>most regularly and thoroughly laid out into streets and avenues by the commissioners appointed by and acting under the act of April 3d, 1807.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-5\">The legislature has in frequent cases authorized and directed certain persons to lay out streets, roads, avenues, squares and public places in the city of Hew York, and declared that they should have exclusive power to do so, and that the plans and surveys made by them should be final and conclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-6\">The act of April 3d, 1807, which was passed at the request of the mayor, aldermen and commonalty, appointed Simeon De Witt and others to lay out all the city north of say Fourth street, of the city of Hew York, and provided \u00bfhat the plans so made \u201cshould he final and conclusive against the mayor,\u201d &amp;c. (See <em>Minutes of Common </em>Council, <em>Feb. </em>16th, 1807.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-7\">Chapter 103 of laws of 1809 appointed Simeon i)e Witt and others to lay out Canal street, in the city of Hew York, and declared their plan should be final and conclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-8\">Chapter 201 of laws of 1860 appointed James C. Willett and others commissioners to lay out that part of the city north of One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street, and to make alterations below One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street, and gave them exclusive power to do so, and declared that their plans should be final and conclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-9\">By act of 1865, chapter 565 act of 1866, chapter 367; act of 1867, chapter 697; the commissioners of the Central Park have been empowered and directed to lay out streets, avenues, roads, public squares and places, in all the part of the city north of Fifty-ninth street and west of Eighth avenue, and also within a space three hundred and fifty feet in width surrounding the Central Park, as well as to lay out the avenue St. Hicholas, and extend and widen Manhattan street; and all these acts declare that the maps, plans and surveys made shall be final and conclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-10\">- The legislature has Often authorized hoards or persons to acquire title to lands required for public purposes, in the name and on the behalf of the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of Hew York.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-11\">The following are some of the cases in which this has been done:</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-12\">Chapter 103, laws of 1899, appointed Simeon De Witt and others to take the lands required to make Canal street.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-13\">Chapter 256 of laws of 1834 authorized the water commissioners for the city of Hew York to acquire title to land required for the Croton aqueduct; and chapter 328 of 1837 conferred similar powers on them in relation to alterations in the route of the Croton turnpike.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-14\">The Croton aqueduct board, by chapter 383 <em>of laws of </em>1849, chapter <em>501 of </em>laws of 1853, chapter 449 of laws of 1870, chapter 265 of laws of 1865, were authorized, for and in behalf and in the name of the mayor, &amp;c., to take possession of and use, and acquire title to, land, real estate and property required for laying mains, constructing reservoirs, gate houses, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-15\">The hoard of commissioners of the Central Park, by chapter 101 of laws of 1859, chapter 564 of laws of 1865, chapter 565 of laws of 1865, chapter 367 of laws of 1866, chapter 757 of laws of 1866, chapter 697 of laws of 1867, are authorized, empowered and directed, for and in the behalf and in the name of the mayor, aldermen, &amp;c., to take proceedings to acquire title to the lands required for the extension of the Central Park, the lands required for the streets, roads, public squares and places laid out by them under several laws; also for the widening and opening of Sixth avenue, the avenue St. Hicholas and Manhattan street, as also all streets and avenues laid out under act of April 3d, 1807, north of Fifty-ninth street.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-16\">More than twenty miles of streets have been laid out under the act in question, and still more under other similar acts. Inextricable confusion will be created in relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>to purchases and sales of real estate, made by individuals on the lines of such streets during the past two years, if the proceedings had in full faith of the validity of the laws are not sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-5\">These miles of streets are not, it will be recollected, laid out through farm lands, hut through city lots, whose value is estimated by the square foot rather than by the acre. Are these layings out to such an immense extent to he disturbed, and the numberless small ownerships fronting on them to be depreciated in value, and deprived of access, <em>in order that one objector may get a sum for his lands greater them that awarded him by intelligent disinterested sworn valuators t</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-6\">III. The court will remember that the streets of the city of Xew York are not the property of the corporation, as such, but, after the land for them is acquired, they are held in trust for the whole people of the state. <em>(See People </em>agt. <em>Kerr.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-7\">The legislature has from time immemorial delegated the power to acquire property by <em>eminent domain </em>to corporations, <em>e. g., </em>railroad corporations, turnpike companies; to <em>quad </em>corporations, <em>e. g., </em>boards of supervisors; to <em>officers by title of office, e. g. </em>the corporation counsel, by act of 1853, and the Croton board and the Central Park by \"various acts before cited; and to individuals, as in the case of Canal street.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-8\">This power is exercised, not in the interest of the corporation alone, but of the whole people of the state, in trust for whom the property, when acquired, will be held.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-9\">The motion is made to confirm the report in the name of the mayor, aldermen and commonalty, by their law officer, the counsel to the corporation, who is especially directed by law to do so, and no objection is presented by the mayor, aldermen and commonalty. *</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-10\">IV. There is no distinction between the powers of the Central Park commissioners, as to <em>streets </em>and <em>public </em>places, under the act of 1865 <em>(ch. </em>565, <em>p. </em>1136). Section 1 in terms covers \u201c streets, roads and public places and the court having determined, in 16 Abbott, that the power given to the commissioners to open the Central Park was constitutional, the decision applies with equal force to \u201croads and streets.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-11\">V. The court will take judicial notice that all the city north of Fourth street, within the limits affected by this proceeding, was laid out in streets and avenues by the commissioners appointed under the act of 1807; otherwise affidavits to that effect can be supplied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-12\">VI. The objection that the wedge of land owned by the objector Witthaus cannot be necessary for \u201c a road or drive,\u201d but if taken in this proceeding would form a \u201cpublic place,\u201d is without force.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-13\">Under section 1 of the act of 1865, the commissioners of the Central Park are empowered \u201cto determine the location, width# courses, &amp;c., of said road, and may widen Bloomingdale road,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-14\">They have exercised that power in this case, and the road so widened includes the lots of the objector.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-15\">It is to be presumed that in so doing they have exercised a reasonable discretion, the opinion of the objector to the contrary notwithstanding. There is nothing in the act requiring the road to be of a uniform width; it may be of varying width.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-16\">VII. As to the objection that the commissioners should have completed their report in four months from the time of their appointment, the answer is simple.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-17\"><em>Mrst. </em>This proceeding is under a special act of tho legislature of 1865, providing a new and independent scheme for laying ont streets,-and is not governed by the provisions of the former act of 1862, which is quoted to sustain this objection. The act of 1862'refers only to the altering or opening of streets or avenues <em>them </em>existing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-18\"><em>Second. </em>Even if it were otherwise, it is in the discretion of the court to allow further time, aud they can do so now, if they think proper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>VIII. A suggestion from the court deserves attention. The notice and petition in this matter refer to map filed in' the park commissioners\u2019 office, and accessible to all, also filed in the register\u2019s office and office of the secretary of state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-5\">The petition refers to the same map, and a copy of the map is annexed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-6\">Tiiis reference sufficiently designates the space, title to which was to be acquired in the proceeding..and no one interested could be misled thereby.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-7\">IX. It is submitted to the court that the time for making objections <em>to </em>the authority of the commissioners* of assessment, etc., in this matter, has gone by.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-8\">The counsel to the corporation, ou behalf of the mayor, etc., and in obedience to the law of 1865, made application to the supreme court for the appointment of commissioners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-9\">Ample notice to all parties owning property to be affected by this matter was given, by publication thereof in certain newspapers, according to law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-10\">No objection was made on the part of Mr. Witthaus to that application, and the commissioners herein were thereupon appointed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-11\">In the performance of their duties they adjudicated upon the claims of Mr. Witthaus.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-12\">These claims were presented by him to them, without any objection on his part as to their authority to pass upon the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-13\">He now, by his counsel, appears before the general term, which holds in these matters the position of an appellate court, and presents to it a plea to the authority of the inferior tribunal before which he has voluntarily and without any objection discussed his claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-14\">This course is in violation of all principles of sound logic. \u201c <em>Consensus tollit </em>erro<em>rem.\u201d [Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-15\">X. The commissioners of estimate and assessment were appointed to examine and decide such questions, to hear evidence, view the land, and ascertain all the facts and opinions which could throw a light on the subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-16\">They have done so and decided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-17\">Again, on receipt of the written objections of Witthaus, they further discussed the matter, and raised his award as far as they deemed it expedient to do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-18\">This court, sitting at general term, cannot possibly reverse their decision without a thorough examination of all the grounds on which it was formed, without, in fact, doing all, healing all, seeing all, that the commissioners have done, heard and seen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-19\">The affidavits of the objector and his friends do not agree with one another.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-20\">One values the property at sixty thousand dollars; another forty-five thousand dollars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-21\">All these values are merely speculative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-22\">The affidavits produced by the commissioners are more likely to be disinterested and reliable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-23\">But the whole subject is out of the reach of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-24\">No error of law has been committed by the commissioners, and the court cannot review their decision on a mere question of fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-25\">XI. But even were it proper for the court to reverse the action of the commissioners in making the awards complained of, it can be satisfactorily shown that the objections to the awards are unreasonable and unjust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-26\">. As to the objections four, five and six, that the award to the objector Witthaus is inadequate, and a violation of the principle which should have governed the commissioners, counsel submits the following remarks and statements:</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-27\">The trae way to regard the award so as to judge whether all the elements of value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>of the land taken have been considered, is to compare the award for it with the award for land similar in other respects in the same neighborhood.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-5\">The award for objector\u2019s land No. 45, contents, 4,350 sup. feet;

The second part of the section confers the power to <em>lay out, form and open any </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>street or </em>streets, or public place or places, in any part of the city, <em>not laid out </em>by the commissioners of streets and roads, &amp;c., and to make the necessary applications for acquiring the lands therefor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"208\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-5\"><em>O. </em>In the next place we say, that the powers above referred to are local powers, and have, ever since the organization of the government of this state, been recognized as such.</p>\n<p data-order=\"209\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-6\">We are thus brought down to the question, whether the act of 1865 is in conflict with the section of the constitution set forth in our previous points.</p>\n<p data-order=\"210\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-7\">In examining this question, we cannot do better than to quote from the recent opinion, delivered by Judge GtROVEE, of the court of appeals, in rendering the decision of that court, in the case of <em>The People </em>agt. <em>Raymond </em>deciding that the act of 1867, chapter 410, authorizing the appointment of commissioners of taxes and assessments by the governor and senate, was in conflict with the provisions of the section of constitution above referred <em>to. </em>He says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"211\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-8\">\u201c To determine whether the act in question is constitutional, so far as the power of appointment is thereby vested in the governor, with the consent of the senate, <em>it is necessary to determine whether the office in substance existed at the time of the adoption of the present constitution; </em>and if found not so existing, then the further question whether city, town and county offices subsequently created, may be filled in any mode prescribed by the legislature. To determine the first question, it is .necessary to ascertain the functions and duties of the office in question. Thus upon examination of the act in question (the act of 1859, p. 678, the acts of 1857 and 1850). and the previous legislation, these will be found to consist of power to appoint deputies, clerks, etc.; who, together with the officers in question, by performing the various duties of their respective offices, are to make an assessment of all the property liable to taxation in the city for municipal and state purposes. To correct the rolls of such assessments, and to equalize the same,' and to preserve such rolls in an office to be kept by them, and deliver the same to those whose duty it is to levy the taxes upon such rolls, authorised upon the property of the city. <em>It is necessary </em>also. <em>to inquire whether the like functions were performed by any officers prior to the existing constitution. </em>This, all know, must have been so, as taxation upon property is not wholly of modern origin, but has existed at intervals for state purposes, and at all times for municipal purposes, since the existence of the state; and there must necessarily have been at all times some mode by which a valuation of the property, liable to taxation, was made by public authority, as a basis upon which taxes were apportioned among its owners. An examination of the statutes in force at <em>the </em>adoption of the constitution, will show that such valuation was then made by assessors, chosen by <em>the </em>electors of the respective wards of the city, two in each ward. That these ward assessors were required to assess all the taxable property in their respective wards; and when this was completed, they were all required to meet together as a board, and when so met, to compare, equalize and correct all the assessment rolls of the city; and when completed, the assessors were to deliver the same to those whose duty it was to apportion the taxes required to be collected upon the basis of such valuation. <em>Thus it appears that precisely the same essential functions </em>were performed in making, equalizing, correcting and delivering the assessment rolls by the ward assessors at the time of the adoption of the constitution, that were contemplated to be performed by the commissioners of taxes and assessments by the act in question; <em>that, although the names of the officers and their mode of appointment have been </em>changed, <em>the result to be accomplished by the one is identical with that of the other. But it is argued on the part of the appellant that additional powers have been conferred and additional duties imposed upon the commissioners. </em>This is true. They are to keep an office during the entire year, in which the rolls are to be kept for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number><em>inspection; </em>they are to procure and preserve maps of the lots in the city; to keep a record of the building permits; to them power is given to insert in the rolls of prop \u2022 erty which has been omitted, and to do some other acts, none of which were required of the assessors, and which they were not authorized to do. <em>But an examination of these new duties and powers will show that they are all such as are calculated to facilv\u00edate and the better enable them to perform the same essential duty performed by the assessors\u2014that is, of perfecting a valuation of the property as a basis of taxation. Such additional facilities in the perfoii'mance of the same </em>duties, <em>surely cannot malee them new officers in the. sense of the constitution. If they can tints be made neiv, the section of the </em>constitution, <em>above </em>quoted, <em>may readily be made a mere nullity. </em>I am far from conceding that it would be competent for the legislature to take from the city all control over the assessment of the property of the city for purposes of taxtion, and vest this,power in the central authority, by conferring powers upon officers or boards, upon which they conferred it over other subjects, and imposing duties upon them entirely foreign to those of making the assessment. <em>The plain intention of the section of the constitution in question was to preserve to localities the control of the official functions of which they were then possessed; </em>and this control was carefully preserved, consistent with the power of the legislature to make needful changes, by restricting the power of appointment of other officers to perform the same functions to the people, or some authority of the locality. <em>Any other construction would render the section in question, when applied to the cities of the </em>state, <em>substantially nugatory. </em>It is not enough that the name of the officer is changed or the powers enlarged, to authorize the legislature to confer upon the governor the appointment of officers to discharge the duties performed <em>by </em>city officers at the adoption of the constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"212\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-5\">By the first section of the act of 1865, it is provided that:</p>\n<p data-order=\"213\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-6\">\u201c The commissioners of the Central Park'shall have and possess exclusive power to lay out streets, roads, public squares and places, within that part of the city of New York to the northward of the southerly line of One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street, of such width, extent and direction upon such grades as to them, shall seem most conducive* to public good; and it shall be the duty of the said commissioners, as soon after the passage of this act as may be, to lay out a road or public drive running from the northerly portion of the Sixth or Seventh avenue in a generally northerly or northwesterly direction, upon the easterly or Harlem river side of the city, as far north as the said commissioners may determine; thence in a general westerly direction to or near the Hudson river, and thence in a general southerly or southeasterly-direction along the westerly or Hudson river u side of the city, until such road or public drive shall enter the Central Park at or near the junction of the Bloomingdale road, Eighth avenue and Fifty-ninth street; such road to follow the course of the Bloomingdale road, below One Hundred and Sixth street, whenever the commissioners shall deem such course advantageous.

As we have stated in our first point (subdivision C), the commissioners of 1807 only laid out the city to One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street. (See <em>Report of Commissioners, Davies, p. </em>438; See <em>map of Commissioners, </em>1807.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"250\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-6\">The counsel is in error in supposing that the whole of the city was laid out above Fourth street.</p>\n<p data-order=\"251\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-7\">As far, then, as the power to lay out streets, &amp;c., above One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street, is concerned, the act of 1865 is in conflict with the constitution of 1846; and as the act of 1865 consists of one general scheme or plan, one part of whieh is void, the whole must fall.</p>\n<p data-order=\"252\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-8\"><em>Eighth. </em>As to the powers of the mayor, &amp;c., under the act of 1813/and under the Montgomerie charter; it seems unnecessary to add anything to what w'e have stated in our first point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"253\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-9\"><em>Minth. </em>As to the points upon the question of value, we refer to the printed points submitted by us on the argument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"254\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-10\"><em>Tenth. </em>As to the point made in the second point of the counsel, that inextricable confusion and serious damage would result from declaring the act of 1865, and the other acts which are referred to, to be unconstitutional, the plain and conclusive answer is, that it is much better to ascertain now, when the proceedings of the \u2022commissioners of the Central Park have, as it were, just commenced, whether those proceedings are legal or illegal, than to wait until the contemplated improvements have been made and the assessments therefor are laid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"255\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-11\">The confusion and damage which would result now are unimportant and insignificant, when compared with the damage that must ensue at a later period, if those acts are then determined to be in conflict with the constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"256\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-12\">These questions will have to be met in the proceedings to set aside the assessments imposed under the authority and powers delegated to the commissioneis.</p>\n<p data-order=\"257\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-13\">Again, the practical effect of the acts referred to by the learned counsel, enlarging the powers of the commissioners of the Central Park, is to abolish the mayor, aider-men and commonalty of the city, so far as the streets are concerned, between Fifty-ninth street and the northern limit of the island, and to substitute the park commissioners in their place. This is a change of the gravest and most serious character, not to be upheld, unless clearly within the powers of the legislature, and clearly in accordance with the constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"258\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-14\">If there is any vitality in the Montgomerie charter, any force in the* solemn confirmations of that charter which have from time to time been made by the state, all the powers now sought to be intrusted to the park commissioners have.been lodged in the corporate authorities for nearly two centuries, and it would be far more reprehensible to sustain legislation which nullifies that charter than to declare such legislation to he null and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"259\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-15\"><em>Eleventh. </em>As the points of the counsel have been served upon us at a time which renders it impossible to print a more extended reply, we now submit this case to the court upon the points above taken, and upon those presented by us at the argument, confidently believing that it will receive the full and thorough consideration which its importance demands.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"260\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b278-16\"><em>By the </em>court, Ingraham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ade\">The objection taken to these proceedings, on the ground that the act is unconstitutional,</p>\n<p id=\"Ah7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>cannot be sustained. The power, it is alleged, to make the application, which by the act is vested in the commissioners of the Central Park, should have been given.to the common council, and the objectors claim the act on that account to be unconstitutional. The common council never had authority, since 1807, to lay out any streets or public places in that part of the city which was embraced in the map of the commissioners filed under the act of 1807. Them power was below the limits embraced in that map, and the authority conferred upon the commissioners did not in any way interfere with the authority .previously bestowed on the common council. The act of 1813 expressly limited their powers to that part of the city not laid out by virtue of the act of 1807. They had no authority to lay out or open any but such as were provided for on the said map. The authority conferred on the commissioners is not that of any local officer, nor does it authorize them to discharge the duties of any office, but it provides for a discharge of a mere ministerial act, viz., presenting to the court a petition for the opening of a street. So far. as the objection is taken here, we are to treat it as a mere authority for such a purpose to make an application to the court for the opening, and that power may, I think, be conferred on the commissioners. This objection was made to the proceedings in the matter of the Central Park extension. (16 <em>Abb. p. </em>56.) I see no reason to change the views thus expressed by me against the validity of the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">I do not intend to be understood as holding that all the powers conferred on the commissioners by this statute are valid. The right to grade streets in this city has always been exercised by the common council, as well as other powers conferred by that act on the commissioners, and it may well be doubted whether the legislature can take from the common council this power and confer it on state officers. It is not, however, necessary on this application to decide this point, and I make the suggestion merely to avoid the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>supposition that it is intended in this decision to validate all the powers granted by that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The legislature might have laid out this drive in the act, and having that power, they might authorize others to do it. In fact, no such road or drive could be laid out without the authority of the legislature; and whenever it has been necessary to open any new street or avenue not laid down on the map, such legislation has been deemed necessary, and' the limits of the street or avenue have been fixed.by the statute. There are several cases where such acts have been passed, without any action of the common council, such as Madison avenue, part of Second avenue, and others, where proceedings have been taken by other parties than the common council. The limitation of four months within which the commissioners are required to complete their report, contained in the act of 1862, does not apply to this proceeding. It applies to streets and avenues in the city north of Fourteenth street, and must be confined to streets and avenues then laid out as such, and is not to be applied to such a work as that contemplated by this statute. It is evidently impracticable properly to complete such a work within that limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Objections are made in several cases to the amounts allowed by the commissioners for the property* taken, and the court is asked to review the decisions of the commissioners in this respect. It has been long since settled, and has uniformly been acted upon by this court, that a mere error of judgment in the valuation of property taken was not the subject of review on a motion to confirm the report, unless the sum allowed was grossly inadequate and unequal as compared with other valuations, or unless some wrong principle was adopted as to. the amount allowed. There are good reasons why such a rule should be enforced. The commissioners have the opportunity of examining the property, of seeing its location and condition, its adaptation to use, and of inquiry as to.value, not in the power of the,court, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the result of such examinations and inquiries cannot be brought before the court. There may have been difference of opinion between the owners and the commissioners as to these values, but we see nothing in this difference justifying , Us to interfere. There is no error in law in any mode of valuation which has been adopted, and we see no ground on which,'according to all former decisions, we could interfere with the valuations as made by the commissioners, in the case of any of the parties objecting.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The remaining objection is to the taking of gores outside of the line of the road as laid out, if the same is to be of one continuous width. The statute describes it as a road or public drive running from the northerly portion of the Sixth or Seventh avenues, &amp;c., and to enter the Central Park at or . near the junction of the Bloomingdale road, Eighth avenue and Fifty-ninth street, and to follow the course of the Bloomingdale road below One Hundred and Sixth street, when the commissioners should' deem such course advantageous. It then provides that they shall determine the location, width, courses, windings, &amp;c., of said road.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">. It is very clear that this act does not authorize the taking of any land not required for the drive or road, and the latter-provision seems to prescribe 'an uniform width to the road very inconsistent with the lines as adopted on the map filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The act\u2018of 1839, page <em>182, </em>directs how the commissioners shall be appointed, viz., by \u00e1 notice specifying the time and place of the application and the nature and extent of the intended improvement. This provision is made necessary by the act of 1865, in regard to this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Under this provision, I think it is necessary that the whole extent of the intention of the opening should be stated in the notice. The owners are to be informed by it what property is to be taken. A reference to a map on file in some public \u2022 office is not a compliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">It is said that the owners have in some cases appeared before the commissioners and claimed allowances for their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>lands, and therefore cannot now object. But that cannot give jurisdiction, if it is not acquired in the mode prescribed by law. Suppose they had proceeded, in addition to the road, to take land for a square outside of the drive, and the owners submitted their claims, it could not be upheld that the commissioners thereby acquired jurisdiction to take the' same. They must be confined to the land which the notice describes as required for the improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Considering the intent of the statute to make a road of an uniform width, and the notice as given of such a road, without referring to the gores outside of the road, I do not see the necessary authority for taking land outside of the lines of the road as laid out by them. But this is not all. The notice not only does not include these gores, but virtually excludes them, by the following: \u201c Said road or public drive is of a general width of one hundred and fifty feet, as shown on a certain map,\u201d &amp;c. Parties owning lands outside of the road so described could not be notified that it'was intended to <em>go </em>outside of these lines and take large parcels of land at different places on the route* The commissioners had no jurisdiction to take these gores, and, so far as they are included in these proceedings, they are erroneously taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The report should be sent back to the commissioners, with directions to omit the valuation of the land. outside of the road, as described in the notice; to deduct the amount awarded therefor from their assessment, in such manner as they shall deem just; and to assess the same for benefit, if such lands are benefitted by the improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Barnard and Sutherland, Justices, concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
