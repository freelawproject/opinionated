Co. v. Baer, </em>90 Md. 97, 44 A. 992; <em>Montgomery Bus Lines v. Diehl, </em>158 Md. 233, 240, 148 A. 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">According to1 the evidence, Dr. Erank Eldred, an uncle of the plaintiff by marriage1, was called to attend the plaintiff. He said he examined her \u201cand found her bruised on her left side from her arms to her ankle and suffering abdominal pain and slight discharge of blood from her vagina and of course * * * thought it was a threatened miscarriage1.\u201d He was obliged to leave, and the- third day turned the case over to Dr. G. &gt;Oarville McCormick, who attended Mrs. Sieber for three or four days. On the 17th she was taken to the University Hospital, Baltimore, where she was in charge of Dr. Cecil W. Vest, and remained there six days. She returned to the hospital on October 16th, and the following day was. operated on by Dr. Vest, who testified: \u201cThe condition which I found was an abdominal pregnancy. The natural pregnancy is a pregnancy that occurs in the uterus. It sometimes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>occurs in either of the Fallopian tubes. An abdominal pregnancy is outside the tubes-, before you get- t-o the Fallopian tubes. \u2018;f * * In this case I found the fetus outside the tubes.\u201d The pregnancy was in tlie\u00a1 third month. After the operation and removal of the fetus, the plaintiff remained in the hospital about forty days. After returning home from the hospital, siie was treated until in February, 1930, by Dr. Eldred. The plaintiff testified that she still suffers pain. Some days she can be up and around and get along pretty good; cannot stand without wearing* an abdominal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Dr. Thomas K. Galvin, called on behalf of the defendant, testified that it is not always necessary to operate in cases of extra-uterine pregnancy, but that it usually is.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">A damage prayer in the usual form, including permanent injury, was the only one submitted by the plaintiff. The defendant specially excepted on the ground that there was no legally sufficient evidence that the plaintiff had sustained any permanent injury, and this exception was overruled. The defendant\u2019s third and fourth prayers were to the same effect as the special exception to the plaintiff\u2019s prayer, so that all the prayers and the special exception may be considered together.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">There is no evidence in the record that- the accident had .anything to do- with the miscarriage or abortion, and none to show that an abortion would not have been necessary even if the accident- had not occurred. There is no evidence from which the jury might have inferred that the injuries complained of, excluding the miscarriage or abortion, would have had any permanent effect. It might be significant that the plaintiff has complained of pain, suffering, and disability from the time of the accident, and that a reasonable inference might, be drawn from those facts to attach, liability to the defendant as the cause <em>(Neeld Construction Co. v. Mason, </em>157 Md. 571, 574, 146 A. 748; <em>Baltimore &amp; Liberty Turnpike Co. v. Cassell, </em>66 Md. 419, 431, 7 A. 805; <em>Baltimore v. Terio, </em>147 Md. 330, 336, 128 A. 353), but, when an injury for which damages is claimed (in this case an operation for \u2022extra-uterine pregnancy) follows in point- of time the accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>for which, suit is brought, and the subsequent development usually has its peculiar and independent cause, then the original accident as the exciting cause of the ultimate effect must be affirmatively shown, and in this case that was not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The rule as stated by Judge Alvey in <em>Corner v. Mackintosh, </em>48 Md. 374, 389, although a suit for trespass <em>d. b. a. </em>is equally applicable here, and that is: \u201cThat the natural results of a wrongful act are understood to include all the damage to the plaintiff of which such act was the efficient cause, though in point of time the damage- did not occur until some time after the act done. To such an extent is this principle carried, for the purpose o-f accomplishing justice, and securing to parties full compensation for wrongs suffered, 'that the proof of actual damages may extend to all facts which occur and grow out of the original injury, even down to the- day of the verdict; the exception to this rule excluding only such facts as not only happened since the institution of the action, but which furnish of themselves sufficient ground for a distinct suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">It has been decided in this state that, when disease or infection is set in motion or aggravated by injury, or the accident may be followed by disease or injury as its cause, damages may be recovered for such unexpected results, but in every instance proof of such facts is required and nothing-assumed. <em>Kauffman Construction Co. v. Griffith, </em>154 Md. 55, 60, 139 A. 548; <em>Dickson Construction Co. v. Beasley, </em>146 Md. 568, 575, 126 A. 907; <em>Neeld Construction Co. v. Mason, </em>157 Md. 571, 574, 146 A. 748; <em>State v. Wash., B. &amp; A. R. Co., </em>130 Md. 603, 613, 101 A. 546. \u201cIn matters of proof we <em>axe </em>not justified in inferring from mere possibilities the existence of facts. There must be proof of the essential facts to fix liability upon a party charged with the commission of a wrongful act.\u201d <em>Balto. &amp; O. R. Co. v. State, use of Savington, </em>71 Md. 590, 599, 18 A. 969, 971. The proof of the effect of the accident on the extra-uterine pregnancy is a matter to be testified to by one skilled in medicine or surgery (22 <em>C. J. </em>543-545), and it is because of the absence of any such evidence that the appellant contends there was no legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>sufficient evidence of permanent injury. Ko witness, testified that the miscarriage or abortion was the effect of which the accident was the cause, and that all the pain, suffering, and disability of the plaintiff resulted from the accident. As stated by Judge McSherry in <em>Benedick v. Potts, </em>88 Md. 54, 40 A. 1067, 1068. \u201cThe negligence alleged, and the injury sued for, must bear the relation of cause and effect. The concurrence of both, and the nexus between them, must exist, to constitute a cause of action.\u201d See <em>Neeld Construction Co. v. Mason, </em>157 Md. 571, 575, 146 A. 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">For the want, therefore, of admission of evidence connecting the accident with the miscarriage, the plaintiff\u2019s prayer for compensation for permanent injuries should have been refused <em>(Annapolis Gas Co. v. Frederick, </em>112 Md. 449, 457, 77 A. 53), and the defendant\u2019s special exception to it granted, and for the. same reason the defendant\u2019s third and fourth prayers should also have been granted. The same questions were presented on the motion to strike out the testimony offered, -which depended on the proof of connection between the accident and the \u201cmiscarriage,\u201d and it also should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The remaining exception in the record was to the question put to Dr. Vest as to whether he could state with reasonable certainty that such an automobile accident as was testified to was a competent producing cause of the condition which he found, to which he answered \u201cyes.\u201d Later on this evidence was stricken out, so that it was no longer in the case, and this ruling leaves no exception for an expression of opinion by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, with costs, and case remanded for neiu trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
