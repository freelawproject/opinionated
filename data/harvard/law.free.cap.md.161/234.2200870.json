Brem this order, an appeal was taken by the applicant, as to the property held taxable, to the State Tax Commission of Maryland, which reversed the order of the Appeal Tax Court. The City of Baltimore then appealed to the Baltimore City Court, which sustained the action of the State Tax Commission, holding that the Union Ship<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>building Company should be \u201cclassed as a manufacturer\u201d and entitled to1 the exemption on the property scheduled, except certain machinery and equipment scheduled at a value of $23,419.39, which the parties agreed was assessable, and it is from the order of the City. Court that this appeal is taken by the City of Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The Union Shipbuilding Company had been for many years engaged at Fairfield, Curtis Bay, in the City of Baltimore, on a large scale in the business of shipbuilding. After the World War, that line of business disappeared, leaving the company with a large plant on its hands. Since 1921, it has been engaged in the purchase and dismantling of steel vessels, and the transformation or cutting of the metal parts of such vessels into sizes suitable for use in the manufacture of steel and other metallic products. Practically all of the vessels so cut to pieces are bought from the government of the United States mider agreements whereby they must be dismantled and every usable part rendered unfit for use as installed on the vessel so purchased. According to the statement of one of the company\u2019s witnesses read in evidence: \u201cUpon arrival at our plant the vessels are placed alongside piers and stripped of all wood and miscellaneous equipment, after which they are cut into sections approximately twenty-four feet long by five feet wide, by use of acetylene torches, and the sections are then removed by locomotive cranes, placed in railroad cars, and transferred to shears, where they are cut into sections five feet long by eighteen inches wide, the prescribed open hearth large box size. Material so cut is then loaded by overhead magnetic cranes into cars and shipped to steel mill furnaces, where, in connection with a certain percentage of pig iron, it is converted into steel ingots, which in turn are rolled into various shapes.\u201d The conversion is not done by the company, but by its customers. \u201cNon-ferrous material (brass, copper and bronze) is removed from vessels, transferred to shears, where it is cut into small pieces for melting into' ingots.\u201d \u201cThe Union Shipbuilding Company is now engaged in the production of approximately 12,000 tons of heavy melting steel per month, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>and. it is employing from 600 to 650 men continuously, with a pay roll averaging $75,000 per month, and also about $40,000 per month for operating supplies.\u201d The electric current hill runs about $3,000 per month. All this represents what the appellant contends amounts to <em>no more than </em>a junk yard run on a large scale, while the appellees contend that it is a manufacturing plant, the machinery, tools, and raw material of which are \u201cused entirely or chiefly in connection with manufacturing,\u201d and therefore entitled to exemption from assessment and taxation. Acts 1918, eh. 82, sec. 10. The city asserts that the test is in the product of the plant or operations, and that unless what it produces is a, marketable commodity, ready for use, it cannot be considered a manufacturing plant within the meaning of the statute, while the company contends that the question is to he determined from the character of the operation and the means employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In <em>Carlin v. Western Assurance Co., </em>57 Md. 515, 526, in discussing the meaning of the word \u201cmanufacture,\u201d this, court said: \u201cIts meaning has expanded as workmanship and art have advanced; so that now nearly all artificial products, of human industry, nearly all such materials as have acquired changed conditions or new and specific combinations, whether from the direct action of the human hand, from chemical' processes devised and directed by human skill, or by the employment of machinery, which, after all, is but a higher form; of the simple implements with which the human hand fashioned its creations in ruder ages, are now commonly designated as \u2018manufactured.\u2019 \u201d See also <em>Carroll County v. Shriver, </em>146 Md. 412, 126 A. 71. \u201cManufacture\u201d is defined in the New Century Dictionary as \u201cthe making of goods or wares by manual labor or by machinery, especially on a. large scale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">As stated in the opinion by Judge Pattisou, in <em>Carroll County v. Shriver, </em>146 Md. 412, 417, 126 A. 71, 72, \u201cIt is difficult to say in the abstract what is and what is not a manufacturing industry. What might bo a manufacturing industry -when defined or construed in connection with a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>exempting tools, machines, engines, etc., from taxation, might not he so held when considered in connection with a statute having a different object or purpose.\u201d As said in 26 <em>Gyc. </em>524, \u201cThere is of course a multitude of cases in which particular industries and products have been held respectively to be or not to be manufacture but it would be useless to cite these cases under the names of the industries or products there the subject of decision; * * * since the fact that a given thing or industry has been held to be manufacture under one set of circumstances is no assurance that it will be so held under another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The plant of the shipbuilding company has all the earmarks of a manufacturing establishment. In its operations it employs several hundred men and uses a vast amount of machinery; and, while it does not produce a finished article ready for use, it reduces the hulls of steel vessels into a product of commercial use and value, namely, No. 1 heavy melting steel, regularly quoted in the \u201cIron Age\u201d a recognized trade paper. <em>Eastern Rolling Mill v. Michlovitz, </em>157 Md. 51, 145 A. 378; <em>Id., </em>158 Md. 486, 148 A. 836. It is because the shipbuilding company\u2019s operations stop here that the city contends the company does not come within the provisions of the statute. If, after cutting the vessels into usable shapes and sizes, it had gone on with the remelting of the steel and its fabrication into finished articles of merchandise ready for use, the city concedes that all the machinery and property employed in the entire process would be entitled -.to exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The point made by the city is that the company does not make or manufacture anything; it merely takes a large piece of steel and cuts it into small pieces. This is all true, but it loses sight of the scale and character of the operation and the means employed. It is one of the stages, and a very important one, in the conversion of a large mass of steel into a variety of useful steel products, and whether the whole transaction is done by one mill or two mills does not affect the application of the statute to one or both. The statute is an invitation to manufacturing industries to go to Balti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>more, with the advantage of the exemption from taxation on the one hand and the great public benefit to be derived, on tbe other, from the addition of the payroll which comes from the employment of a large number of workmen. It is a situation which calls for the same kind of good faith which the law requires of two individuals contracting with each other. <em>Carroll County v. Shriver, </em>146 Md. 412, 126 A. 71; <em>Broadbent v. Baltimore, 134 </em>Md. 90, 93, 106 A. 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">In affirming the judgment of the city court, we simply hold that the Union Shipbuilding Company, as its plant and its operations are described in the record, is what it appears to be, a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d witbin the meaning of the Acts of 1918, oh. 82, sec. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
