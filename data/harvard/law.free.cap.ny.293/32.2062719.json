The owner of a vessel who desires to limit his legal liability to the value of the vessel must do so within six months after a claim has been filed. <em>(Standard Wholesale P. &amp; A. Works </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>107 F. 2d 373; <em>The Irving, </em>28 F. Supp. 585; <em>The Grasselli Chemical Co. No. 4, </em>20 F. Supp. 394.) II. The right to limit liability whether by petition or pleading in the answer must be perfected by a shipowner within six months after the plaintiff has filed her claim. Congress did not intend to make it possible for the shipowner by subterfuge to extend his time in which to limit liability. A shipowner cannot amend his answer to interpose the defense of limitation of liability after the expiration of six months from the filing of the claim. <em>(The Irving, </em>33 F. Supp. 59; <em>Standard Wholesale P. &amp; A. Works </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>107 F. 2d, 373; <em>Conners Marine Co. </em>v. <em>U. S.

The jury having rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and having found under the trial court\u2019s charge that the appellant\u2019s vessel was unseaworthy, the jury\u2019s determination was <em>res judicata </em>to any new proceedings in the matter. The trial court was without authority to pass on the issues of limitation in the absence of the jury. <em>(Southern Pacific Railr\u2019d </em>v. <em>United States, </em>168 U.

Upon consideration of the Federal statutes (U. S. Rev. Stat., \u00a7\u00a7 4283, 4284, 4285; U. S. Code, tit. 46, \u00a7\u00a7 183, 184 and 185, as amd. by Act of June 5, 1936, ch. 521 [49 U. S. Stat. 1479 <em>et seq.']), </em>we agree with the interpretation in <em>The Chickie </em>(141 F. 2d 80), and, accordingly, under section 606 of the Civil Practice Act (as amd. by L. 1942, ch. 297), the judgment is reversed and the case is remitted to the Appellate Division, without costs, for determination upon the questions of fact, including discretion, raised in that court by the defendant-appellant\u2019s motion to amend the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed, without costs, and the case remitted to the Appellate Division for determination upon the questions of fact, including discretion, raised in that court by the defendant-appellant\u2019s motion to amend the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Lehman, Ch.
