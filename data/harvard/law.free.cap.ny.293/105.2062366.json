The charge of manipulation of the defendant\u2019s corporate accounts to defeat the plaintiff is wholly unfounded.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Lewis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlV\">In 1905 the defendant made available to certain classes of its permanent employees a plan for pensioned retirement. That plan was subject to specific limitations, including the following: \u201c 17. No pension or gratuity shall be paid except out of the <em>profits </em>of the Company and no pension or gratuity or claim thereto <em>shall b\u00bf a charge upon or against or payable out of any of the capital assets of the </em>Company(Italics supplied.) Our present problem involves chiefly the interpretation of the word <em>\u201c </em>profits \u201d as used in the provision quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">In accord with the provisions of the 1905 pension plan the plaintiff received regularly from the defendant a monthly pension from the date of his retirement in 1932 until April 30, 1941. On May 1, 1941, pension payments were terminated by the defendant upon the asserted ground that no profits had been realized from the Company\u2019s operations for the preceding year 1940. Instead a substantial capital deficit had resulted. In a written communication delivered to the plaintiff prior to May 1, 1941, the defendant had called to his attention the provisions of paragraph \u201c 17 \u201d of the pension plan and had advised him that \u2014 <em>\u201c </em>no payments are due to be made with respect to pensions under the terms of the 1905 Plan \u201d for the month of May, 1941. At the trial in Municipal Court of the City of . New York a jury awarded a verdict in favor of the defendant. The judgment entered upon that verdict was reviewed and affirmed by the Appellate Term, first department, after which the judgment entered upon the order- of the latter court was affirmed at the Appellate Division, two Justices dissenting. The case comes- to us by permission of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Two issues were submitted to' the jury \u2014 (1) whether on May.'.l, 1941, when the defendant declined to-pay to plaintiff a monthly pension, there were <em>pro-fits </em>from which the payment claimed by the plaintiff to-be-due on -that date should have been paid; (2) whether the item appearing on the defendant\u2019s books under the caption \u201c Reserve for Pensions and -Benefits \u2019\u2019 represented a segregated fund from which! the pension was payable. Those issues were in essence questions of law for decision by the court. We think, however, that any error in such submission was inconsequential because, in our opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>the jury\u2019s finding in favor of the defendant upon each of the two questions submitted should in any event have been directed by the court as matter of law. <em>\u201c </em>The construction of a plain contract is for the court. The intention of the parties is found in the language used to express such intention. <em>(Hartigan </em>v. <em>Casualty Co., </em>227 N. Y. 175.) If the court 'finds as matter of law that the contract is unambiguous, evidence of the intention and acts of the parties plays no part in the decision of the case. Plain and unambiguous words, undisputed facts, leave no question of construction except for the court. The conduct of the parties may fix a meaning to words of doubtful import. It may not change the terms of the contract.\u201d <em>(Brainard </em>v. <em>N. Y. C. R. R. Co., </em>242 N. Y. 125, 133.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">We regard as untenable the plaintiff\u2019s position that the word <em>\u201c </em>profits \u201d as used in the limitation set forth in paragraph <em>\u201c </em>17 \u201d of the plan refers to net proceeds from defendant\u2019s operations arrived at by deducting current expenses from receipts of the enterprise during a given period, without including as an item of expense an allowance to cover depreciation of operating facilities which were capital assets. Such interpretation of the word \u201c profits \u201d, we think, is not only opposed to sound business practice but it disregards the contextual limitation which is set forth in the same paragraph \u201c 17 \u201d of the plan \u2014 \u201c* * * no pension * * * shall be a charge upon or against or payable out of any of the capital assets of the Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\u201c Capital assets \u201d as that phrase is used in the provision last quoted above include cables and those other facilities by means of which the defendant\u2019s business is conducted and which represent an expenditure of invested capital made at some time in the company\u2019s history. The usable value of depreciable facilities owned by the defendant and essential to its operations, suffers normally a constant depreciation from use and obsolescence, with a corresponding loss of invested capital. That normal process of depreciation works a constant devaluation of the defendant\u2019s \u201c capital assets \u201d which, if permitted to continue without restoration would ultimately exhaust the defendant\u2019s power to function. Meantime, if the books of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>defendant do not take into account the constant depreciation of the defendant\u2019s operating facilities \u2014 some of which have been in use for many years \u2014 those depreciated assets, as a matter of corporate bookkeeping, would be valued as new. If the defendant is to continue to perform the functions for which it was organized a reserve representing an honest estimate of depreciation of capital assets must be set up. Upon that subject this court has had occasion to say \u2014 \u201c No corporation would be regarded as well conducted which did not make some provision for the necessity of ultimately replacing the property thus suffering deterioration \u201d. <em>(People ex rel. Jamaica W. S. Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Comrs., </em>196 N. Y. 39, 57-58; see, also, <em>People ex rel. B. L., H. &amp; P. Co. </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>203 N. Y. 7, 22, 23, 25; <em>Knoxville </em>v. <em>Water Co., </em>212 U. S. 1, 13-14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">We read the several specific limitations set forth in paragraph <em>\u201c </em>17 \u201d of the plan as we believe they would be understood by the average employee of the defendant. In the context in which it is found we construe the word \u201c profits \u201d as referring to net income derived from the defendant\u2019s operations over a given period and computed by including within items of expense properly to be deducted from current receipts, a fair allowance for depreciation of capital assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The record contains no evidence which supports the plaintiff\u2019s further contention that in May, 1941, when the payment of a pension to the plaintiff was discontinued, the <em>item11 </em>Reserve for Pensions and Benefits \u201d appearing on the defendant\u2019s books served as a basis for an obligation by the defendant to make the pension payment here in suit. The theory upon which this claim , is made is that the pension reserve account constitutes a trust fund from which the plaintiff\u2019s pension was payable irrespective of whether the defendant\u2019s operations in 1940 and 1941 produced <em>\u201c </em>profits.\u201d The item \u201c Reserve for Pensions and Benefits \u201d was created in 1906 by a book transaction which involved transferring to that account the balance in an account styled \u201c Endowment Insurance Suspense \u201d which had existed under an endowment insurance pension plan which antedated and differed from the pension plan of 1905. The balance of $54,573.74 in that former account at the time of the transfer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>was composed chiefly of commissions received by the defendant on endowment policies issued on the lives of employees together with fines collected from employees for inaccurate messages and other minor offenses. Later, in 1922, when the \u201c Reserve for Pensions and Benefits \u201d had been depleted to a figure' insufficient to meet pension payments for that year, the defendant arbitrarily transferred from surplus to the pension reserve account, $1,529,335.05. Thereafter in 1923 and 1924 similar transfers, in the amount of $22,337 each were made. The evidence is undisputed, however, that these transactions involved no withdrawal from the defendant\u2019s general funds, no segregation of its funds or assets. The general funds, out of which pension payments were made, were not disturbed. In the absence of proof that the account <em>\u201c </em>Reserve for Pensions and Benefits \u201d represented a segregation of funds or assets separate from the defendant\u2019s general funds, thus creating a trust fund or <em>res </em>upon which a trust was impressed, no basis was established by the plaintiff for his claim that the pension reserve account constituted a trust fund from which his pension for 1941 was payable. <em>(McKee </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>299 U. S. 119, 123; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Spohr, </em>180 N. Y. 201, 209; <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Greene et al., </em>125 N. Y. 506, 510.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">There remains for consideration the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that the defendant is estopped from denying that its receipt and commingling with its own funds of various types of fines and the commissions on insurance policies issued to employees, constitutes a trust for its pensioners. An answer to that charge is found in the undisputed evidence that although, as we have seen, the defendant had accumulated in the <em>\u201c </em>Endowment Insurance Suspense \u201d account between 1893-1905 the sum of $54,573.74 and had received from 1906 to the date in May, 1941, when it refused to pay the plaintiff\u2019s pension the sum of $35,541.69 \u2014 a total of $90,115.43 \u2014 it paid \u25a0 out in pensions, benefits and gratuities under its pension plan from 1906 until May, 1941, the total sum of $2,738,425.83. It also appears that the plaintiff did not lose the benefit of insurance taken out by him under the defendant\u2019s endowment insurance pension plan which antedated the pension plan of 1905. When, in the course of administering that plan the policy issued to the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>by New York Life Insurance Company came due in 1920 in the sum of $1,252.72, he authorized the defendant to invest the proceeds in shares of The Mackay Companies to be held. by the defendant until he should be pensioned or should die, at which time th\u00e9y were to be transferred to him or his estate. He also directed that a part of the shares so purchased corresponding to the defendant\u2019s total contribution to premiums on his endowment policy and to the share of profits earned by such endowment policy, with dividends and interest on dividends received on such shares, were to be taken into account in computing his pension, and the amount of his pension was to be abated to that extent. He directed that dividends on his shares were to be mailed directly to him and subsequently, when The Mackay Companies\u2019 shares were exchanged by the plaintiff for $1,600 of 5% bonds of Postal Telegraph and Cable Corporation, he acknowledged in writing that he had no further claim against the defendant in connection with that transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b144-5\">Loughran, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_i\">(dissenting). The parties are agreed that sums properly payable under this pension plan are debts of the defendant and not mere donations. One of the terms of the defendant\u2019s obligation is this: \u201cNo pension or gratuity shall be paid except out of the profits of the Company and no pension or gratuity or claim thereto shall be a charge upon or against or payable out of any of the capital assets of the Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">At the times in issue, the defendant carried on its balance sheet an entry of $19,591,678.45 under the heading \u201c Reserve for Depreciation.\u201d The opinion of the court is that this item must be given effect in arriving at the amount of the \u201c profits \u201d in question. Such a construction, in our judgment, is not the true one.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The words of the defendant\u2019s plan must be understood in their popular and ordinary sense, because common usage is the best judge of speech and the average man speaks quite simply. Moreover, these words are now to be read as they would have been so understood when the plan was set up in 1905 \u2014 long before income taxes had accentuated a scientific practice of allocating some portion of revenue to the renewal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>of assets. We cannot accept the presumption that the average employee of the defendant saw in this plan the technical \u201c depreciation \u201d procedures of the tax-assessment and rate-making cases, that are now cited against him. On the contrary, as we must suppose, he looked at the plan as a thing that was meant to urge him to work steadily, by holding out to him some hope of freedom from want in the not unlikely event of a wearing-out of his own vigor through his day by day part in the defendant\u2019s business. (See <em>Roddy </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>268 N. Y. 228, 232.)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">These considerations lead us to the conclusion that-the word \u201c profits \u201d should in this instance be taken to signify the receipts of the enterprise less current expenses, i. e., net receipts \u2014 a construction that seems to us to be likewise .quite in step with the popular and ordinary sense of the complementary provision against payment of a pension out of any \u201c capital \u201d asset. (See <em>The People </em>v. <em>The Supervisors of Niagara, 4 </em>Hill 20; <em>Paine </em>v. <em>Howells, </em>90 N. Y. 660; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Car Trust Investment Co., </em>120 App. Div. 442,193 N. Y. 617; <em>Eyster </em>v. <em>Centennial Board of Finance, </em>94 U. S. 500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">A \u201c Reserve for Pensions and Benefits \u201d which the defendant carried on its hooks included fines collected by it from its employees and rebates on insurance premiums that were p\u00e1id in part by them. Whether under these circumstances this entry was in some degree a warranty to the employees or worked an appreciable estoppel in their favor is a question that need not now be determined, if we are right in what we said above.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">We vote to reverse the judgments and to grant a new trial, with costs in all courts to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Lehman, Ch. J., Conway and Thacher, JJ., concur with Lewis, J.; Lottghran, J., dissents in opinion, in which Rippey and Desmond, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">Judgment affirmed. (See 293 N. Y. 755.)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
