The defendant, Fred M. Waring, is an orchestra <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>leader who produces and broadcasts commercially sponsored radio programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The plaintiff has been awarded a jury verdict at Trial Term upon a complaint which alleged in substance that the plaintiff originated an <em>u </em>idea \u201d for a broadcast, known as \u201c Your Song \u201d or \u201c Stop, Look and Listen,\u201d in which the radio audience was to be solicited to write to the commercial sponsor the name of a song which associated itself with some experience in the writer\u2019s life that could be recounted or dramatized by radio followed by the introduction of the song into the program; that after the plaintiff had communicated the idea to John O\u2019Connor, an agent of the defendant, and without the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge or consent and in violation of its proprietary rights therein, the defendant appropriated the idea and employed it in identical form in programs broadcast by him. Three causes of action are pleaded: The first alleges the appropriation and use by the defendant of the plaintiff\u2019s <em>\u201c </em>idea \u201d without payment therefor; the second alleges the breach of an express contract to pay for such use; the third \u2014 with which we are particularly concerned upon this appeal \u2014 alleges that plaintiff submitted its plan to the defendant in conformity with a well-established custom \u201c in the field of advertising and more especially in the field of radio program production and creation that programs, ideas and schemes are submitted to advertising agencies and to radio program producers and radio artists for the purpose and with the intent of having such advertising agencies, producers or artists either engage the services of the person presenting said program for the purpose of producing the same or for the purpose of having such advertising agency obtain commercial sponsors for said program or for the purpose of having such producer or artist purchase such program on a commercial basis \u2019 \u2019; that in conformity with such custom the plaintiff submitted the program and idea known as <em>\u201c </em>Your Song \u201d to the defendant for the purpose of realizing financial profit from any use that might be made of it; that despite such custom and in violation thereof, the defendant adopted plaintiff\u2019s idea but failed and refused to compensate the plaintiff, thereby causing, the plaintiff monetary damages sought herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">At Trial Term the second cause of action, based upon an express contract, was withdrawn by the plaintiff at the close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>of its evidence. The two remaining causes of action were submitted to the jury on the theory that the first was based on a contract implied in fact and the third was based on a contract implied in law. The Trial Justice submitted to the jury two special questions: (1) Was there a contract implied in fact \u2014 which the jury answered \u201c no and (2) Was there a contract implied in law \u2014 which the jury answered \u201c yes.\u201d Upon the latter answer the jury awarded to the plaintiff a verdict of $13,000 which, upon a stipulation by the plaintiff, the Trial Justice reduced to $6,500. The Appellate Division, one Justice dissenting, modified the judgment by reinstating the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In view of the jury\u2019s finding as to the first cause of action \u2014 that no contract implied in fact had been proved \u2014 and the second cause of action alleging the breach of an express contract having been withdrawn, there remains for our consideration only the third cause of action which the trial court treated as one \u201c alleging a contract implied in law, based in part on the customs of the trade</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The plaintiff does not claim that the \u201c idea\u201d or formula known as \u201c Your Song\u201d was ever communicated directly to the defendant. It appears from the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s president Grombach, that there were six occasions when, by telephone conversations with Waring\u2019s agent O\u2019Connor, he failed in his effort to arrange a luncheon meeting with the defendant at which he could bring to the defendant\u2019s attention the idea or program which he claimed was well adapted for use by the defendant\u2019s orchestra. In one of those telephone conversations, according to Grombach\u2019s testimony, he \u201c explained the idea to [O\u2019Connor] roughly over the phone.\u201d He claims further that he later sent to O \u2019Connor a letter in which he stated \u2014 \u201c The attached might interest you and, by the way, don\u2019t forget I\u2019d like to talk to Fred and yourself about this vehicle I spoke to you about before.\u201d Grombach also.testified that he enclosed in the letter a \u201c presentation \u201d \u2014 defined by him as \u201can outline of the idea together with a list of' the elements of the idea * * * \u201d \u2014 and that he spoke later to O\u2019Connor who acknowledged receipt of the letter and the \u201c presentation.\u201d The plaintiff, however, failed upon the trial to identify the \u201c presentation \u201d, which he claims to have sent to O\u2019Connor and accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>ingly it was rejected as evidence in the case. The plaintiff charges that, after the communications claimed to have been had by its president Grombach with O\u2019Connor, the defendant Waring appropriated plaintiff\u2019s idea and used it in four broadcasts which he conducted in January, 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">When O\u2019Connor was called as a witness for the defendant he denied receiving the letter which Grombach claims to have sent him. He recalled a telephone conversation in which Grombach asked for a luncheon engagement with the defendant <em>\u201c </em>because he (Grombach) had an idea,\u201d but O\u2019Connor denied that at any time Grombach told him of \u201c the nature or character of the idea. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The defendant Waring denied that he appropriated the plaintiff\u2019s \u201c idea \u201d or program. He testified that prior to the present suit he had received no knowledge or information as to the creation or production of the radio program idea claimed by the plaintiff in this action; that he had seen no script or presentation relating to the idea and had never talked to the plaintiff\u2019s president Grombach with respect to such an idea. The defendant also testified that 0 \u2019Connor had never brought to his attention directly or indirectly \u201c the radio program idea created by the plaintiff in this action \u201d or any prospectus or presentation of such a program; that O\u2019Connor never mentioned to him any communication between him (O\u2019Connor) and the plaintiff corporation \u201c relative to program ideas,\u201d nor did the defendant at any time authorize O\u2019Connor to do any business with the plaintiff on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The defendant admits that in four broadcasts in January, 1939, he used as a short interlude a formula, suggested by his own publicity technique expert, during the performance of which he urged his radio listeners to write him letters referring to some experience in which a song changed the course of the writer\u2019s life. Concededly the formula for that interlude differed widely from the <em>\u201c </em>idea \u201d of which the plaintiff now claims to be the originator. It bore the title <em>\u201c </em>The Tune That Turned the ' Tide the letter writer did not participate in its rendition and its duration was only a few minutes as compared with the longer period required for the performance of the program which is' the subject of the present suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>We may eliminate as a basis for the defendant\u2019s liability the alleged breach of an express contract, because the plaintiff has withdrawn that charge. We may also eliminate as a basis for the defendant\u2019s liability a contract implied in fact, because a jury has found that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence failed to establish such a contract. That finding, however, has an important bearing upon our present problem. This court has said \u2014 <em>\u201c </em>A contract cannot be implied <em>in fact </em>where the facts are inconsistent with its existence; or against the declaration of the party to be charged; or where there is an express contract covering the subject-matter involved; or against the intention or understanding of the parties; or where an express promise would be contrary to law. The assent of the person to be charged is necessary and unless he has conducted himself in such a manner that his assent may fairly be inferred he has not contracted.\u201d <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Schloss, </em>218 N. Y. 400, 406-7.) Applying to the case at bar the rule stated in the sentence last quoted above, which the Trial Justice read to the jury, we may infer from the jury\u2019s finding \u2014 that no contract implied in fact existed \u2014that the defendant did not assent to the unsolicited disclosure to him of the plaintiff\u2019s <em>\u201c </em>idea \u201d and that the defendant did not conduct himself in a manner which imports his assent.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Schloss (supra, </em>at p. 407) it was said that0a contract implied in law <em>\u201c * * </em>* is not a contract or promise at all. It is an obligation which the law creates, in the absence of any agreement, when and because the acts of the parties or others have placed in the possession of one person money, or its equivalent, under such circumstances that in equity and good conscience he ought not to retain it, and which <em>ex aequo et tono </em>belongs to another.\u201d (See, also, 1 Williston on Contracts, [rev. ed.], \u00a7 3, p. 9.) Guided by that definition we have reached the conclusion that the Trial Justice erroneously permitted the jury to find the existence of a contract implied in law \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>based in part on the customs of the trade,\u201d as he expressed it. By that expedient the jury \u2014 after finding that there was no evidence of the defendant\u2019s assent to the plaintiff\u2019s unsolicited disclosure of its .idea \u2014 was permitted to substitute for such assent evidence of an alleged custom in the field of radio program production. That custom was described by the plaintiff\u2019s president as follows: \u201c When someone submits the formula of a program to an agency, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>advertiser, network, or talent, the people to whom it is presented either are interested in that idea and take the idea and pay a reasonable value therefor, or make a deal with the person who produced the program based on that formula, or they do not do anything with it and forget about it. In other words, there is a relationship of trust there.\u201d (It should be said that the sentence last quoted above was stricken out by the Trial Justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Such a custom \u2014 <em>\u201c * * * </em>cannot create a contract where there has been no agreement by the parties and none is implied by law; nor can it give validity to a contract which the law declares void.\u201d <em>(Stulsaft </em>v. <em>Mercer Tube &amp; Mfg. Co., </em>288 N. Y. 255, 260.) In the present case no \u201c deal \u201d was made between the plaintiff and defendant. The jury has so found. And if we accept the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s president that he explained to O\u2019Connor <em>\u201c </em>roughly over the phone \u201d the \u201c idea \u201d which he desired to bring to the defendant\u2019s attention, that disclosure, as we have seen, came to O\u2019Connor unsolicited either by him or by the defendant. Even though it be assumed that on a subsequent occasion the defendant Waring caused to be arranged and performed in a radio broadcast an interlude in which there were elements common to the plaintiff\u2019s idea, the prior gratuitious, unsolicited disclosure allegedly made by the plaintiff\u2019s presid\u00e9nt, unprotected by contract, does not create an enforcible contract implied in law. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Schloss, supra, </em>p. 407; <em>Bristol </em>v. <em>E. L. A. Society, </em>132 N. Y. 264, 267; <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Western Union Telegraph Co., </em>259 App. Div. 224, 225, affd. 285 N.
