This issue is readily resolved by reference to our recent holding in <em>Auto-Owners Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St. 3d 156, in which we stated at paragraph one of the syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">\u201cWhere an insured has paid separate premiums in a single policy providing several vehicles with uninsured motorist coverage, the insured is entitled to recover under the uninsured motorist provisions of the policy an amount up to the aggregate sum of the uninsured motorist coverages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">The appellee herein and her husband made regular payments to State Auto for insurance coverage on their family\u2019s three vehicles. Included within these payments were three separate premiums fob uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage. As stated in <em>Lewis, supra, </em>at 158, \u201c* * * [t]he purpose of uninsured motorist coverage * * * is to afford the insured additional protection in the event of an accident with an uninsured motorist, not to provide coverage to a vehicle. * * *\u201d Thus, the appellee and her husband effectively purchased three separate coverages of $300,000 and were thereby entitled to a total of $900,000 coverage for damages resulting from any one accident \u2014 even when such accident involved only one of the three insured family vehicles.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The second issue presented is whether the $100,000 paid to the appellee by another <em>insurer may </em>be deducted by State Auto directly from the limits of the appellee\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage, <em>or </em>whether the terms of the appellee\u2019s coverage permit State Auto to set off the $100,000 only against the appellee\u2019s total damages. In other words, may State Auto reduce its total uninsured motorist coverage for the appellee\u2019s family to $800,000 ($900,000 in total stacked coverage minus $100,000 already paid to appellee by another insurer), or may State Auto only deduct the $100,000 payment to the appellee from appellee\u2019s total damages <em>(e.g., </em>if appellee has one million dollars in damages, then $100,000 is set off against those damages and State Auto is still obligated to appellee for a full $900,000 of uninsured motorist coverage).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">This issue is resolved by reviewing the express language of the policy that was issued by State Auto to the appellee and her husband. The relevant portion of the policy, contained in Part I, Limits of Liability, Paragraph C, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u201cAny amount payable under the Uninsured Motorists Coverage because of bodily injury sustained in an accident by a person who is an insured under this coverage shall be reduced by</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u201c(1) all sums paid on account of such bodily injury by or on behalf of (i) the owner or operator of the uninsured highway vehicle * *</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The appellant argues, in effect, that the words, \u201cany amount payable\u201d should be interpreted to mean \u201cthe total amount of coverage provided, if payable.\u201d The appellee, on the other hand, would interpret \u201cany amount payable\u201d to mean \u201cany damages compensable.\u201d We find this latter interpretation clearly to be the most reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Appellant\u2019s \u201cinterpretation\u201d is, in reality, an \u201cinsertion.\u201d State Auto would have the court read additional terms into its policy. The appellee\u2019s interpretation, however, equates \u201camount payable\u201d to \u201cdamages compenable\u201d by looking to the plain meaning of the policy\u2019s terms and by focusing on the nature and purpose of uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage. When purchasing this coverage, an insured expects to be protected against a loss caused by another that is not covered by that other person\u2019s insurer. Thus, an \u201camount payable\u201d under uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage is an <em>amount of damages suffered </em>by the insured, which amount is greater than the insurance coverage held by the party causing the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">Even if there were some doubt as to the propriety of appellee\u2019s interpretation of her policy, however, this doubt still would be resolved in her favor. As we noted in <em>Gomolka I, supra, </em>at 174, \u201c[I]anguage in a contract of insurance reasonably susceptible of more than one meaning will be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>strued liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer.\u201d <em>Buckeye Union Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1974), 39 Ohio St. 2d 95 [68 O.O.2d 56]. This rule of construction, in combination with the plain meaning of the policy terms in question, makes it clear that State Auto may only utilize the $100,000 payment to the appellee as a setoff against the total damages suffered by her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b56-7\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, C. Brown and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b56-8\">Locher, J., dissents in part.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b56-9\">Holmes, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-12\"> The insurance policy issued by State Auto to the appellee herein and her husband contained no provision that reasonably can be construed to prohibit the stacking of unin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>sured/underinsured motorist coverages. R.C. 3937.18(G) (originally R.C. 3937.181[E]), which became effective after the events that gave rise to the instant case, specifically permits the inclusion of anti-stacking provisions in insurance policies providing uninsured motorist coverages.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b56-10\">Locher, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AXb\">dissenting in part. Although I concur in the majority resolution of the second issue of this case dealing with setoff, I must dissent from that part of the opinion dealing with stacking of coverages. The reasons for my dissent were succinctly set forth in the dissent in <em>Auto-Owners Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St. 3d 156, 161 (Holmes, J., dissenting in part), in which I concurred. As was the case in <em>Auto-Owners, supra, </em>the insured should be bound by the terms of their insurance contract, which here provides for a $300,000 uninsured/underinsured coverage ceiling per accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals on the first issue..</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b56-12\">Holmes, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ax2\">dissenting. I hereby dissent from the majority concerning the first issue herein based upon the principles set forth in my dissenting opinion in <em>Auto-Owners Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St. 3d 156, 161-163.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">I also dissent from the majority opinion concerning the second issue in that the \u201cLimits of Liability,\u201d as contained in the insurance policy, are quite clear and unequivocal, and are not subject to judicial interpretation by this court. The limitation specifically states that \u201c[a]ny amount payable under the Uninsured Motorists Coverage * * * shall, be reduced by (1) all sums paid on account of such bodily injury by or on behalf of (i) the owner or operator of the uninsured highway vehicle * * *.\u201d This language is very clear and demonstrates the intent of the parties that the \u201camount payable\u201d under the facts presented would be $300,000, the maximum sum payable for \u201ceach accident,\u201d less a setoff of $100,000, the amount paid by Buckeye Union Insurance on behalf of its insured, Duk Kim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
