Appellees argue that appellant\u2019s failure to allege that the actions filed against appellant were instituted maliciously, without probable cause, and were terminated in appellant\u2019s favor is fatal to appellant\u2019s complaint and warrants dismissal thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>In <em>Scholler </em>v. <em>Scholler </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St. 3d 98, this court stated in paragraph one of the syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u201cAn attorney is immune from liability to third persons arising from his performance as an attorney in good faith on behalf of, and with the knowledge of his client, unless such third person is in privity with the client or the attorney acts maliciously.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Neither court below had the benefit of our decision in <em>Scholler, supra, </em>which announced the general rule of an attorney\u2019s liability to third persons. The question thus becomes whether appellant\u2019s complaint states a cause of action cognizable under the rule established in <em>Scholler, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Appellant\u2019s complaint alleges that appellees, by filing lawsuits against appellant, \u201cintentionally inflicted harm upon * * * [appellant] without any excuse or justification, to * * * [appellant\u2019s] damage.\u201d An action for malicious prosecution or abuse of process \u201cmay be maintained where a proceeding is carried on maliciously and without probable cause.\u201d <em>Diehl </em>v. <em>Friester </em>(1882), 37 Ohio St. 473, 475; <em>Brinkman </em>v. <em>Drolesbaugh </em>(1918), 97 Ohio St. 171, 181. As it was stated in <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Pollock </em>(1889), 46 Ohio St. 367, 370:</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\u201cIt is a wrong to disturb one\u2019s property or peace; and to prosecute one maliciously, and without probable cause, is to do that person a wrong. * * * The burden of establishing both malice and want of probable cause will prove a sufficient check to reckless suits of this character. When the plaintiff sets the law in motion, he is the cause, if it be done groundlessly and maliciously, of defendant\u2019s damage * *</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">It is well-established that a court may not dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted unless it appears \u201cbeyond doubt from the complaint that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts entitling him to recovery.\u201d <em>O'Brien </em>v. <em>University Community Tenants Union </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 242 [71 O.O.2d 223], syllabus; <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St. 2d 106, 108 [22 O.O.3d 332]; <em>Blankenship </em>v. <em>Cincinnati Milacron Chemicals </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 608, 610-611 [23 O.O.3d 504]; <em>Dickerhoof </em>v. <em>Canton </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 128, 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Bearing in mind that Civ. R. 8(A)(1) only requires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\u201d we hold that appellant\u2019s complaint is sufficient to avoid a motion to dismiss under Civ. R. 12(B)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>Scholler </em>establishes that an attorney may be liable to third persons if the attorney acts maliciously. Further, appellant\u2019s complaint does allege intentionally inflicted harm as a result of the numerous lawsuits commenced by appellees. It will be incumbent upon appellant to establish that these lawsuits were instituted maliciously, without probable cause, and, as a general rule, were terminated in appellant\u2019s favor. Nonetheless, it does not render appellant\u2019s complaint fatally defective and subject to dismissal that each element of its cause of action was not set forth in the complaint with crystalline specificity.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the trial court for farther proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b93-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.

Brown, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-11\"> Appellant also urges this court to recognize a cause of action predicated upon appellees\u2019 alleged failure to comply with Civ. R. 11, which states that an attorney may be subjected to appropriate action for, as an example, violating the rule by signing a groundless complaint. We agree with the court of appeals that the \u201cappropriate action\u201d referred to in the rule is simply a reference to a disciplinary proceeding brought under the Rules for the Government of the Bar of this court and does not provide the basis for a civil action against the attorney who violates this rule. As the Staff Notes to Civ. R. 11 state:</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">\u201cA wilful violation of Rule 11 by an attorney may subject him to appropriate court disciplinary action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b93-8\">Clifford F. Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A9y\">dissenting. The complaint in this case does not state a claim for relief against defendants for malicious prosecution for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">In order for the complaint to state a good cause of action warranting relief for malicious prosecution, the plaintiff must allege four essential elements: (1) malicious institution by defendant of prior proceedings against plaintiff, <em>Woodruff v. Paschen </em>(1922), 105 Ohio St. 396; (2) lack of probable cause, <em>Melanowski </em>v. <em>Judy </em>(1921), 102 Ohio St. 153, paragraph one of the syllabus, and 52 American Jurisprudence 2d (1970) 226, Malicious Prosecution, Section 64; (3) termination of the prior proceedings in plaintiffs favor, <em>Levering </em>v. <em>National Bank </em>(1912), 87 Ohio St. 117; and (4) seizure of plaintiffs person or property during the course of the prior proceedings, <em>Woyczynski </em>v. <em>Wolf </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App. 3d 226, paragraph one of the syllabus, and <em>Battig </em>v. <em>Forshey </em>(1982), 7 Ohio App. 3d 72, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">The only wrongful acts alleged in the complaint in this case are that defendants \u201cby filing lawsuits on behalf of <em>Kennecorp Enterprises, Inc.\u201d </em>and others \u201cintentionally inflicted harm upon the plaintiff without any excuse or justification, to plaintiff\u2019s damage.\u201d These excerpted allegations fulfill only the first element of four enumerated above, namely, malicious institution by defendant of prior proceedings against plaintiff, and do not allege or even give rise to an inference that the remaining three essential, designated elements exist, namely, lack of probable cause, termination of the prior proceedings in plaintiff\u2019s favor, and seizure of the person or property of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>The recent case of <em>Scholler </em>v. <em>Scholler </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St. 3d 98, and paragraph one of the syllabus thereof, are entirely irrelevant to the issue in the present <em>Border City </em>case. <em>Scholler </em>did not involve a malicious prosecution action, and did not consider the essential elements of such an action. Instead, <em>Scholler </em>was an action by a former wife as plaintiff, on behalf of herself and her minor son, against her former husband, Michael Scholler, and her own attorney, Thomas Willoughby, seeking damages for fraud incident to misrepresentations concerning financial affairs in a prior dissolution of marriage proceedings between the Schollers. The action against defendant attorney Willoughby was on the theory of legal malpractice, as is evident from the <em>Scholler </em>opinion, at 102, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u201cThe second issue is whether Alyce Scholler on behalf of Philip Scholler may maintain an action against Willoughby in malpractice even though Philip is a third party to the attorney-client relationship that existed between Willoughby and Alyce Scholler.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\"><em>Scholler </em>in no way affects the above-cited legal precedents in Ohio which require the four essential elements discussed above to be pleaded and proved in a malicious prosecution action. Finally, <em>Scholler </em>did not consider the sufficiency of a complaint to state a cause of action in malicious prosecution, or otherwise, when challenged by a motion to dismiss, as was done here by defendants Moan and others. Our holding today is, therefore, without precedent. It is, moreover, a judicial aberration.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The majority opinion states:</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u201c* * * An action for malicious prosecution or abuse of process \u2018may be maintained where a proceeding is carried on maliciously and without probable cause,\u2019 * * *\u201d citing three cases, <em>Diehl </em>v. <em>Friester </em>(1882), 37 Ohio St. 473, 473-475; <em>Brinkman </em>v. <em>Drolesbaugh </em>(1918), 97 Ohio St. 171, 181; and <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Pollock </em>(1889), 46 Ohio St. 367, 370. Careful examination of these three cited cases reveals no support for that broad proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\"><em>Diehl, supra, </em>was an action for false imprisonment, not malicious prosecution, by a party imprisoned for nonpayment of a fine imposed upon him for an alleged contempt of court in disregarding an injunction not authorized by law. The plaintiff in <em>Diehl </em>sued the party causing the imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\"><em>Brinkman, supra, </em>also involved a false imprisonment action, not malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\"><em>Pope, supra, </em>held that an action may be maintained for maliciously and without probable cause instituting and prosecuting an action in forcible entry and detainer. The plaintiff in <em>Pope </em>charged in his complaint that he had successfully defended two forcible entry and detainer actions brought by the defendant, <em>i.e., </em>both actions terminated in verdicts in favor of Pope. The issue in <em>Pope </em>is framed at 368 as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">\u201cWill the prosecution of a suit in forcible entry and detainer, which results in a verdict for the defendant, where the same is prosecuted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>maliciously, and without probable cause, afford ground for an action in the nature of a suit for malicious prosecution? \u2014 is the question in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ar\">Unlike <em>Pope, supra, </em>the complaint of Border City makes no statement alleging or raising an inference that the prior civil actions filed by defendants terminated in favor of Border City.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Unlike <em>Border City </em>where there was no alleged interference -with plaintiff\u2019s person or property, in each of the <em>Diehl </em>and <em>Brinkman </em>cases, <em>supra, </em>the action was for false imprisonment, and there was a definite seizure of plaintiff\u2019s person. The significant difference between a false imprisonment action and a malicious prosecution action is explained in <em>Brinkman, supra, </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u201cFalse imprisonment <em>per se </em>is not concerned with good or bad faith, malicious motive or want of probable cause on the part of the prosecuting witness, or the officer causing the imprisonment. If the imprisonment was lawful, it is not the less lawful that any or all of the foregoing elements existed. These elements relate to an action of malicious prosecution, but are not essential to an action in false imprisonment.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Also, unlike the present case, the <em>Diehl, Brinkman </em>and <em>Pope </em>cases were not concerned with actions against any attorneys as defendants. These three cited cases set no standard of liability for attorneys prosecuting civil actions on behalf of their clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">For these reasons I dissent. The appellate court should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b95-9\">Locher, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
