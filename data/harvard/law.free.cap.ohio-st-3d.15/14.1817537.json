When an attorney is retained by a client, he must competently and conscientiously perform his legal services. An attorney\u2019s failure to render the legal services for which he was paid, or to return any fee advanced by a client, is \u201ctantamount to theft of that fee from the client.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel </em>v. <em>Sigall </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St. 3d 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">This court in <em>Sigall </em>addressed a case of neglect by an attorney similar to the instant case and imposed a one-year suspension. <em>Id. </em>at 16-17. We find that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(6), DR 7-101(A)(2), and DR 9-102(B)(3) and (4). Respondent\u2019s total failure to attend to matters entrusted to him by his clients and his unprofessional financial dealings reflect adversly on the entire legal profession and will not be tolerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">It is the judgment of this court that respondent be suspended from the practice of law in the state of Ohio for a period of one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b42-12\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
