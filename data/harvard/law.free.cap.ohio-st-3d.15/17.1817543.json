Petitioner\u2019s prior difficulties which resulted in his suspension were the result of his physical difficulties rather than any active misconduct. Petitioner\u2019s conscientious efforts to maintain his legal expertise have convinced this court that he possesses the mental, educational and moral qualifications required for readmission to the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Therefore, Melvin J. Stinchfield\u2019s petition for reinstatement is granted and his indefinite suspension is removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b44-10\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
