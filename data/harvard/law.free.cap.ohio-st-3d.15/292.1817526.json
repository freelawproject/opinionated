Times </em>standard.\u201d) Such a standard was similarly adopted by this court in <em>Dupler </em>v. <em>Mansfield Journal </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 116 [18 O.O.3d 354].</p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">Then, in <em>Rosenblatt </em>v. <em>Baer </em>(1966), 383 U.S. 75, the high court stated that the inquiry into whether one is a public official is necessarily a question of law for the trial judge to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-16\">The Supreme Court extended the <em>N.Y. Times </em>standard to cover \u201cpublic figures\u201d in <em>Curtis Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Butts </em>(1967), 388 U.S. 130. In that case, the court defined a public figure as one who commanded a substantial amount of public interest by his status alone, or one who had thrust himself by purposeful activity into the vortex of an important public controversy. The court reasoned that public figures should be held to the more difficult <em>N.Y. Times </em>standard because public figures have sufficient access to the means of counterargument in order to expose the falsity of the defamation complained of. <em>Id. </em>at 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>The court further extended the <em>N.Y. Times </em>standard in <em>Rosenbloom </em>v. <em>Metromedia, Inc. </em>(1971), 403 U.S. 29, to private individuals where the matter reported was of concern to the public. <em>Rosenbloom </em>was a plurality opinion, and marked the most comprehensive application of the <em>N.Y. Times </em>standard. However, the rule of law set forth in <em>Rosenbloom </em>was unable to command a majority vote of the justices, and revealed the disagreement within the court that, perhaps, the application of the <em>N.Y. Times </em>standard was in need of further refinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">We believe that if <em>Rosenbloom </em>and <em>Butts </em>were the last statements made by the high court concerning the definition of a public figure or official, we would be compelled to agree with the courts below that Milkovich is a public figure, and that the <em>N.Y. Times </em>standard would be applicable to his claim for relief. Needless to say, the <em>Rosenbloom </em>extension of the <em>N. Y. Times </em>standard to private individuals was reexamined in <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974), 418 U.S. 323, and the Supreme Court retreated from its prior holding. In <em>Gertz, </em>the high court acknowledged the necessity of maintaining the <em>N.Y. Times </em>standard with respect to public figures and officials in order to fortify First Amendment freedom and to prevent self-censorship by the media. However, the court stated that the need to avoid self-censorship by the media was not the only societal value at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 341. With respect to private individuals, the court held that a different standard must apply in order to protect the state\u2019s interest in compensating injury to the reputation of private persons. Therefore, the <em>Gertz </em>court redefined the meaning of a public figure in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u201cFor the most part those who attain this status [as a public figure] have assumed roles of especial prominence in the affairs of society. Some occupy positions of such persuasive power and influence that they are deemed public figures for all purposes. More commonly, those classed as public figures have thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The court in <em>Gertz </em>also noted that a person can become a public figure for a limited range of issues by being drawn or voluntarily injecting himself into a particular public controversy. In holding that Gertz was not a public figure for the purposes of defamation law, the court stated that although Gertz was well known in some circles, he had achieved no general fame or notoriety in the community, and had no persuasive involvement in the affairs of society. <em>Id. </em>at 351-352.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Two years later, the high court had before it the case of <em>Time, Inc. </em>v. <em>Firestone </em>(1976), 424 U.S. 448. In <em>Firestone, </em>the court reiterated its holding in <em>Gertz </em>with respect to the definition of a public figure, and held that the plaintiff, Mrs. Firestone, was not a public figure under <em>Gertz. </em>In spite of the fact that Mrs. Firestone was prominent among the \u201c400\u201d of Palm Beach Society, that she had subscribed to a press clipping service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>which evidenced her frequent mention in the printed medium, and that she had held several press conferences during the course of her divorce proceedings <em>(id. </em>at 484-485 [dissenting opinion]), the court found that the <em>Gertz </em>definition of public figure status had not been satisfied. The court also stated that Mrs. Firestone\u2019s divorce proceeding was not the type of \u201cpublic controversy\u201d envisioned in <em>Gertz. Id. </em>at 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">More recently, the Supreme Court sustained the <em>Gertz </em>characterization of a public figure in <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Proxmire </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 111, 134; and <em>Wolston </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Assn., Inc. </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 157, 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Turning our attention to the matter at hand, the appellees herein contend that in view of the accomplishments and honors earned by Milkovich in the area of high school wrestling,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the lower courts properly designated .him as a public figure. Appellees submit, and the court of appeals agreed, that the <em>Butts </em>decision is quite similar to the case at bar in that both Butts and Milkovich attained pervasive notoriety in their respective communities as prominent sports personalities, and that, therefore, Milkovich must be held to be a public figure in the same manner as Butts.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">We disagree, and find that such a determination by this court would require us to ignore the redefinition of the public figure status as enunciated in Gertz and its progeny. In applying the <em>Gertz </em>standard to the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>sub judice, </em>we hold that Milkovich is not a public figure as that term is utilized in First Amendment analysis. While appellant may be an individual recognized and admired in his community for his coaching achievements, he does not occupy a position of persuasive power and influence by virtue of those achievements. By the same token, appellant\u2019s position in his community does not put him at the forefront of public controversies where he would attempt to exert influence over the resolution of those controversies. While appellant did become involved in a controversy surrounding the events during and subsequent to his team\u2019s wrestling match with Mentor High School, appellant never thrust himself to the forefront of that controversy in order to influence its decision. Furthermore, it cannot be said that appellant assumed the risks of public life through the advertisement of his wrestling clinics. If this were the case, then any widespread advertisement for purely business purposes could result in the classification of an individual as a public figure. Given the application of the public figure definition since <em>Gertz, </em>we find appellant\u2019s status to be akin to the status of the plaintiff in <em>Firestone, supra, </em>rather than the status of the athletic director in <em>Butts, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Likewise, we reject appellees\u2019 argument that appellant is also a \u201cpublic official\u201d by virtue of his employment as a public high school teacher and coach. The United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Rosenblatt, supra, </em>at 85:</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u201c* * * It is clear, therefore, that the \u2018public official\u2019 designation applies at the very least to those among the hierarchy of government employees who have, or appear to the public to have, substantial responsibility for or control over the conduct of governmental affairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Our interpretation of <em>Rosenblatt </em>leads us to conclude that the facts of the instant case are insufficient to qualify appellant as a public official for the purposes of defamation law. While appellees place great reliance on the case of <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Corinthian Television Corp. </em>(Okla. 1978), 583 P. 2d 1101, where a grade school wrestling coach was held to be a public official, we find that a similar interpretation by this court would unduly exaggerate the \u201cpublic official\u201d designation beyond its original intendment. In any event, we are unpersuaded that the <em>Rosenblatt </em>definition of a public official was intended to encompass a person like appellant under the facts and circumstances contained in the instant cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Therefore, we hold that for the purposes of defamation law and analysis as set forth in <em>N. Y. Times Co. </em>and <em>Gertz </em>and their progeny, the appellant herein is not a public figure or public official as a matter of law. On remand, the trial court is instructed to proceed under the rule of law pronounced in <em>Embers Supper Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co. </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St. 3d 22, rather than that rule of law set forth in <em>Dupler, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Having found appellant to be a private individual in the realm of First Amendment analysis, our focus turns to the issue of whether the alleged defamatory article expresses constitutionally protected opinion; or whether it contains an assertion of fact which, if false, is not protected by the First Amendment. The courts below held that the article in question expressed the author\u2019s \u201cheartfelt\u201d opinion, thus rendering it non-actionable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Gertz, supra, </em>at 339-340: \u201cWe begin with the common ground. Under the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea. However pernicious an opinion may seem, we depend for its correction not on the conscience of judges and juries but on the competition of other ideas. But there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Many courts have interpreted this statement as requiring absolute constitutional protection for statements of opinion in the context of the laws of libel. See, <em>e.g., Orr </em>v. <em>Argus Press Co. </em>(C.A. 6, 1978), 586 F. 2d 1108. This court intimated in <em>Yeager </em>v. <em>Local Union 20 </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 369, 372, albeit in the context of a labor dispute, that where language is used which is capable of different meanings, such language constitutes an expression of opinion, not fact, and is protected. Nevertheless, this court has not adopted any specific standard with which to guide courts in determining what constitutes an expression of opinion, and what constitutes an expression of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Some courts have adopted a variation of a \u201ctruth or falsity\u201d test in order to distinguish between assertions of fact and assertions of opinion. See, <em>e.g., Buckley </em>v. <em>Littell </em>(C.A. 2, 1976), 539 F. 2d 882, certiorari denied (1977), 429 U.S. 1062. Under this approach, the objectionable statements are evaluated to determine whether the statements are capable of being proven false empirically.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Other courts have analyzed the fact/opinion distinction by applying the standard of the \u201cordinary person\u201d; <em>i.e., </em>whether an ordinary reader of the alleged libelous statements would understand the statements as an expression of the author\u2019s opinion, or as statements of existing facts. See, <em>e.g., Mashburn </em>v. <em>Collin </em>(La. 1977), 355 So. 2d 879.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">While we decline to establish a <em>per se </em>rule in determining what constitutes a protected opinion or a potentially redressable assertion of fact, our review of the instant cause leads us to conclude that the lower courts erred in holding that the statements in issue were nothing more than the writer\u2019s \u201cheartfelt\u201d opinion. We find that the statements in issue are factual assertions as a matter of law, and are not constitutionally protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>as the opinions of the writer. Nothing in the article effectively precautions the reader that the author\u2019s statements are merely his considered opinions. The plain import of the author\u2019s assertions is that Milkovich, <em>inter alia, </em>committed the crime of perjury in a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In reversing the appellate court on this issue, we are persuaded by the cogent rationale supplied by Judge Friendly in <em>Cianci </em>v. <em>New Times Publishing Co. </em>(C.A. 2, 1980), 639 F. 2d 54, at 64:</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u201cIt would be destructive of the law of libel if a writer could escape liability for accusations of crime simply by using, explicitly or implicitly, the words \u2018I think\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Therefore, based upon the foregoing, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, and remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-9\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, C.

Browtsf, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ARb\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent on the basis that the alleged defamatory article expresses a constitutionally protected opinion and accordingly cannot be the basis of a defamation action.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">There is a growing judicial recognition that pure statements of opinion are absolutely privileged from being the basis for a defamation suit. See, <em>e.g., Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974), 418 U.S. 324. In <em>Orr </em>v. <em>Argus Press Co. </em>(C.A. 6, 1978), 586 F. 2d 1108, 1114, the <em>Gertz </em>principle regarding a statement of opinion was applied: \u201cIt is now established as a matter of constitutional law that a statement of opinion about matters which are publicly known is not defamatory.\u201d The underlying rationale is that even erroneous opinion is to be tolerated in order that self-censorship not prevail over robust public debate.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">In the instant case, appellant was essentially accused in the article of perjury, <em>i.e., </em>lying under oath. The great weight of authority holds that allegations concerning illegality are not absolutely protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-15\">\u201cWhile the Restatement (Second) of Torts posits an absolute privilege for opinions, it explicitly recognizes that an allegation of criminal behavior is properly the subject of a defamation action. Most courts have not faced the question of whether such accusations should be categorized as facts or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>opinions. .They have acknowledged, nonetheless, either implicitly or explicitly, that such accusations are not absolutely protected under the first amendment and have only the more limited <em>New York Times </em>privilege reserved for statements not made in reckless disregard of the truth.\u201d Note, Fact and Opinion After <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc.: </em>The Evolution of a Privilege (1981), 34 Rutgers L. Rev. 81, 114-115.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">In the instant case, the statements were not made in reckless disregard of the truth. The author disclosed the basis upon which his opinions were formulated. He stated he attended the wrestling match in question and was present at the OHSAA hearing. The writer also indicated he had a recounting of the due process proceedings held in Franklin County from Dr. Meyer, who had also been at the OHSAA hearing. Under these facts, I cannot find that the writer acted in reckless disregard of the truth. Resultantly, in my opinion, this editorial opinion may not form the basis of a defamation suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Having determined that the article constituted a constitutionally privileged opinion, it is unnecessary to consider the issue of whether appellant was a public figure.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b326-6\">Holmes, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aip\">dissenting. In the first instance, it appears to me that the publication with which we are concerned here is an expression of an opinion by the reporter, and not an untruthful statement of fact. As such, the statement is not actionable under First Amendment protection. <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974), 418 U.S. 323; <em>Hotchner </em>v. <em>Castillo-Puche </em>(C.A.2, 1977), 551 F. 2d 910; and <em>Orr </em>v. <em>Argus-Press Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1978), 586 F. 2d 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">An opinion can be libelous only if a defamed plaintiff establishes four very limited conditions: (1) the opinion article must imply the existence of facts unknown to the general reader; (2) these implied, unknown facts must not be disclosed in the article; (3) these implied, undisclosed facts must be false; and (4) these implied, undisclosed and false facts must be the basis for the opinions stated in the article. <em>Orr </em>v. <em>Argus-Press Co., supra; Hotchner </em>v. <em>Castillo-Puche, supra. </em>The privilege for opinion can be lost only if the article does not disclose the facts underlying the opinions. 3 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1977) 170, Section 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">In the case before us, the trial court carefully reviewed the subject article and then held that the article fully disclosed the facts upon which its opinions were formulated. In affirming the trial court\u2019s decision, the court of appeals held that \u201c[t]he record supports the trial court\u2019s analysis. Moreover, the article, as an opinion, disclosed its underlying facts. The writer * * * referred to events and circumstances upon which he based his opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">The article plainly refers to at least three distinct but related events <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>upon which the author\u2019s personal opinions and editorial conclusions were derived:</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">(1) The February 9, 1974 wrestling meet between Maple Heights High School and Mentor High School;</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">(2) the administrative hearings on the wrestling meet conducted by the Ohio High School Athletic Assocation; and</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">(3) the proceedings before, and the decision of, the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County regarding the due process aspects of the OHSAA administrative hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The author further states in the article that he attended, covered and reported upon the wrestling match in question and the administrative hearings before the OHSAA. The article also explains that the opinions expressed regarding appellant\u2019s testimony before the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County were based upon the author\u2019s conversation with Dr. Harold Meyer, Commissioner of the OHSAA, who attended the court hearing. Thus, a reader was free to agree or disagree with Diadiun\u2019s expressed opinions based upon the facts clearly stated in the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Furthermore, it is my view that the lower courts must be affirmed under the facts presented here in that Milkovich could well be considered to be a public figure under the criteria set forth in the recent opinions of the United States Supreme Court. In <em>Curtis Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Butts </em>(1967), 388 U.S. 130, the court held that a person\u2019s prominence in the sports world could make him a public figure based upon the facts presented in a given case. Similarly, the proof before the trier of the facts in this case established that Milkovich was a public figure within the area of the publication of appellee\u2019s newspaper column, and perhaps reasonably beyond such geographic area. By his own admission, Milkovich is one of America\u2019s outstanding coaches and a nationally acclaimed sports figure. His coaching record is unparalleled in Ohio and throughout the country, and he has been honored by civic groups, legislative bodies and numerous sports organizations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">In accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s requirements in Butts, supra, the trial court in the case <em>sub judice </em>properly ruled, in summary judgment proceedings, that Milkovich is a public figure. Appellant\u2019s attainments and prominence as a national sports figure, honored by sports, civic and legislative bodies, with coaching records seemingly unparalleled in Ohio and nationally, unquestionably establish him as a public figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">In addition, Milkovich, by his own actions, has established himself as a \u201cpublic figure\u201d under the standards of <em>Gertz, supra. </em>In that case, the Supreme Court summarized the law regarding \u201cpublic figure\u201d status in libel cases by stating that, \u201c[tjhose who, by reason of the notoriety of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>achievements or the vigor and success with which they seek the public\u2019s attention, are properly classed as public figures * * <em>Id. </em>at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Based on the foregoing, and construing all of the evidence most favorably in favor of Milkovich at the time of the motion for summary judgment, I conclude that the appellant failed to raise any genuine issue of material fact upon which a jury could find actual malice with any standard of convincing clarity, and therefore the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Locher, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b327-12\"> A list of such accomplishments is found in fn. 1 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
