This court holds that <em>all </em>of taxpayer\u2019s RMI is subject to the tax, and therefore reverses the decision of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">A review of the applicable statutes is necessary for resolution of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">R.C. 5709.01 is the basis for any taxable property analysis, and at the time relevant herein read in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">\u201c* * * All personal property located and <em>used in business </em>in the state * * * [is] subject to taxation * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">R.C. 5701.08 defines \u201cused in business\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b329-15\">\u201c(A) Personal property is \u2018used\u2019 within the meaning of \u2018used in business\u2019 * * * when stored or kept on hand as material, parts, products, or merchandise. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b329-16\">\u201c(B) \u2018Business\u2019 includes all enterprises * * * <em>conducted for gain, ;profit, or income. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-18\">Therefore, all raw materials which are held in inventory for eventual use in producing \u201cgain, profit, or income\u201d are subject to personal property tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-19\">R.C. 5711.16 defines a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d to be:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>\u201cA person who purchases, receives, or holds personal property for the purpose of adding to its value by manufacturing * * * different materials <em>with a view of making a gain or profit by so doing </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">R.C. 5711.16 further states that the average monthly value of all taxable property of the manufacturer is then taxed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Applying these statutes to the case at bar, we find first that GATC is a \u201cmanufacturer.\u201d We find further that the <em>entire </em>RMI of GATC is held \u201cwith a view of making a gain or profit,\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 5711.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">GATC urges, and the court of appeals so held, that only that portion of its RMI which corresponds to the percentage of tank cars <em>sold </em>to total cars <em>manufactured </em>is taxable. Such a proposition excludes from taxation the percentage of RMI that is eventually used in the manufacture of leased cars. <em>Ex-Cell-O Corp. </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1976), 49 Ohio App. 2d 131 [3 O.O.3d 188],<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is cited by GATC and the court of appeals as direct authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The proposition urged by GATC ignores the clear reading of the applicable statutes. R.C. 5711.16 and 5701.08(B) do not draw a distinction between selling and leasing. To be subject to taxation, the property need only have been held for eventual production of gain, profit, or income. Gain, profit, or income is produced whether the final product is sold or leased. We may not inject new words into a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Therefore, we reject the holding in <em>Ex-Cell-O, supra. </em>Contrary to the court\u2019s language in <em>Ex-Cell-O, Equilease Corp. </em>v. <em>Donahue </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St. 2d 81 [39 O.O.2d 88], and <em>Southland Stores No. 3, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bowers </em>(1960), 171 Ohio St. 271 [13 O.O.2d 207], do not support the <em>Ex-Cell-O </em>result. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>Equilease </em>and <em>Southland </em>did not involve RMI held for manufacturing purposes, which is the situation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">It follows, then, that the RMI of a manufacturer such as GATC is \u201cused in business\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 5701.08(A) and (B). Therefore, pursuant to R.C. 5709.01, 5701.08(A) and (B), and 5711.16, the average monthly value of all raw material inventory of a manufacturer is subject to personal property tax, regardless of whether the final product is sold or leased.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">On cross-appeal, GATC argues that by virtue of its status as a public utility, it is therefore exempt from personal property tax, pursuant to R.C. 5727.03. It argues further that to impose personal property tax on its RMI would constitute an impermissible double tax in view of the tax imposed on GATC under R.C. 5727.24 <em>et seq.We </em>find neither of these claims to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">GATC qualifies for public utility status under R.C. 5727.01(A)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by virtue of its falling within the definition of an \u201cequipment company\u201d under R.C. 5727.01(E)(5).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> R.C. 5727.03<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> exempts public utilities from, <em>inter alia, </em>the personal property tax. However, GATC\u2019s RMI is <em>not </em>exempt, for the reason that GATC is a \u201cdual capacity\u201d enterprise: its manufacturing operations are distinct from its equipment leasing operations. GATC is an equipment company only to the extent that it is \u201c* * * engaged in the business of furnishing or leasing cars * * *.\u201d (R.C. 5727.01[E][5].)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Therefore, the RMI is subject to the personal property tax since only the manufacturing operations are involved herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Further, GATC is not subjected to an unconstitutional double taxation of its RMI. The tax imposed under R.C. 5727.24 <em>et seq. </em>is expressly termed an <em>excise </em>tax in R.C. 5727.27.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> An excise tax is one levied on a privilege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>and not one levied directly against the property. <em>Howell Air, Inc. </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St. 2d 32, 34 [51 O.O.2d 62]. The personal property tax, on the other hand, is obviously a property tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">For the reasons stated herein, this court rules that all of GATC\u2019s RMI is subject to the personal property tax. Accordingly, the decision of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b332-7\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, C. Brown and J. P.
