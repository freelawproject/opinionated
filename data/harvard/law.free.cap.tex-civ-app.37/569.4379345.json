We thank you for this additional trouble which you are thus subjected to. I remain, yours very truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">\u201cJules Besiege, Asst. Cas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">The evidence was that the $696.92 was placed by Miller &amp; Sayers on their books to the credit of the Boatmen\u2019s Bank. Afterwards when a suit was brought on the recognizance, J. B. Sayers and W. J. Bright, who were the sureties on Hannon\u2019s recognizance bond, these persons requested of the Boatmen\u2019s Bank the further sum of $1,000 which was forwarded and likewise placed to the credit of the Boatmen\u2019s Bank. The $696.92 was received April 20, 1903, and the $1,000 on May 21, 1903. This aggregate sum was thus in Miller &amp; Sayers\u2019 hands on August 1, 1903, when the state garnisheed them on the judgment against Hannon.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">The testimony by deposition of P. T. Heal, traveling auditor of the Wrought Iron Range Company, was in substance that upon the conviction in Gonzales County of Hannon, a salesman in the employ of the Wrought Iron Range Co., that last named company procured the Boatmen\u2019s Bank to indemnify Miller <em>&amp; </em>Sayers in the matter of Han-non\u2019s appeal. The testimony by deposition of Culver, vice president of the Wrought Iron Range Co., was the same. The witness testified also': \u201cIt was not my intention nor the intention of* any other official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>of the Wrought Iron Eange Company either at the time the original bond was arranged or at the time the two cash indemnities were sent to Miller &amp; Sayers, nor has it been our intention at any time since then to ever pay the fine and costs assessed against Hannon except as a last resort and after all legal remedies had been exhausted and we had been compelled to do so by the court of final jurisdiction. J. W. Hannon never at any time had the slightest property in or claim to a single dollar of the cash indemnities hereinbefore referred to. The only object or purpose of \u25a0 the Wrought Iron Eange Company in making the bond referred to was to enable it to obtain a decision from the highest courts of Texas to the effect that the law under which Hannon was prosecuted was illegal and unconstitutional and that it was not unlawful to sell ranges in the manner and under the circumstances such as were shown to exist in the Hannon case. If, as I have been informed, Hannon was convicted in the County Court of Gonzales on August 28, 1902, he was not at that time in the employ of the Wrought Iron Eange Company, his connection as an employe of said company having terminated on June 14, 1902. J. W. Hannon left absolutely nothing on deposit either with the Wrought Iron Eange Company or the Boatmen\u2019s Bank, nor has he secured said company in any other manner for making the original bond or for the $1,696.92 in cash indemnities sent to Miller &amp; Sayers. The purpose for which said bond was made is fully set forth in my answer to the 9th inty. Ho money was ever placed with Miller &amp; Sayers by the Wrought Iron Eange Co., or by the Boatmen\u2019s Bank upon any authority received from said company, for the purpose of paying the fine assessed against J. W. Hannon in the County Court of Gonzales County, Texas. The Wrought Iron Company has never sent any money to Miller &amp; Sayers or authorized the Boatmen\u2019s Bank to send them any money to be used for the use and benefit of J. W. Hannon. All money sent to Miller &amp; Sayers by our authority or instructions was sent as an indemnity to protect Miller &amp; Sayers in case action should be brought against Hannon\u2019s sureties on his recognizance bond, and they should be compelled to pay any judgment that might be had against them on account of same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The testimony of J. D. Sayers, F. T. Heal and W. L. Culver was that these remittances were for the purpose of securing or indemnifying Miller &amp; Sayers in the matter of Hannon\u2019s appeal and that none of it was the money of Hannon and this was undisputed except for certain expressions in said letters, which will be referred to further on in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The verdict was for plaintiff in garnishment, and upon this judgment was rendered against Miller &amp; Sayers for the $696.92 with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">By assignment of error Miller &amp; Sayers contend that upon the testimony no judgment was proper except one in their favor, with which contention we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The garnishees answered in the terms of the statute negativing any liability. This answer was controverted by plaintiff by allegation in substance that on May 11, 1903, there was deposited with the firm of Miller <em>&amp; </em>Sayers the sum of $800 for the use and benefit of J. W. Han-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>non, and for the purpose of paying off the judgment in said case of ' the State of Texas v. J. W. Hannon. . . . \u201cAffiant further says that he is informed that said money was so deposited with said Miller &amp; Sayers by the Wrought Iron Range Co. through a bank in the State of Missouri. Affiant further says that said money was still at the date of the service of the writ of garnishment in this case.\u201d The burden \u2022 of proof was on the state to show a relation between Hannon and Miller &amp; Sayers authorizing the latter to be held as garnishees.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\">The principle relied on in support of the judgment is stated by appellee as follows: Where a principal sends money to his agent with instructions to turn the money over to a third party, or for the benefit of a third party, the agent thereby becomes the debtor of the third party and the third party may sue and recover of said agent and need not prove anything but that the money was turned over to the agent for the benefit of plaintiff.\u201d There is absolutely no testimqny in this case to call into exercise this well settled principle of law. .There is not one-word of testimony that the money sent Miller &amp; Sayers was to be paid over to Hannon, or held for Hannon.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">If the money was to be applied in settlement of the judgment, it was to be paid to the state and not to Hannon, in which event the state might have sued Miller &amp; Sayers for the money upon the theory embodied in said proposition of law, but it would not make them liable in garnishment upon the theory that they were debtors, or had moneys of Hannon.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The facts upon which appellee bases its contention are found in Miller &amp; Sayers\u2019 letter of April 18, to the Boatmen\u2019s Bank, in which they say: \u201cYou will therefore please confer with them and direct that draft be forwarded immediately to Harwood &amp; Walsh who represented J. W. Hannon in the trial court and on appeal, to cover the amount \u2022 of the judgment, interest and costs in order that a forfeiture may be prevented.\u201d And in reply thereto of April 20, by which a draft was enclosed and which concluded in the following words: \u201cHerewith I return said statement together with our check for the amount of $696.92. Please apply same in settlement of this claim and return the account to us receipted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The check was not sent to Harwood &amp; Walsh but to Miller &amp; Sayers, who did not pay off the judgment with it, but deposited it with themselves to the credit of the Boatmen\u2019s Bank, in other words, held it.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The garnishment was not served on Miller &amp; Sayers until August 1. Before that time it is manifest from the later correspondence and events, that the Boatmen\u2019s Bank and the Wrought Iron Range Co., for which the former was acting throughout in this matter, had clearly fixed the purpose and destination of the money and did not intend it to be used to pay off the judgment. In fact at the date of the garnishment and for a long time before if Miller &amp; Sayers had so applied the money, it would have been contrary to the desire and instructions of the party who had caused it to be sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">But as already stated, if the directions given in the letter of April 20 had not been thus defined or changed, the fund could not have been reached by garnishment, and it can not be subjected in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>by such a writ unless there be testimony from which the jury was authorized to find that the money sent was the property of Hannon. It may be if the case stood entirely-on the letter of April 20, that it might have implied and a jury might have been authorized to find that such was the fact. But it would be merely presumptive evidence of such fact, if any, and as the record is in the case the jury could not have found such fact in the face of the undisputed testimony, that he had no interest whatever in the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The ease as it appears to us has been fully developed and as the views we have expressed lead us to the conclusion that no judgment would be upheld on the testimony adduced except one for defendant, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed and judgment rendered here in favor of the garnishees, without reference to the other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\n<em>Reversed and rendered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
