The sole issue on appeal is the sufficiency of the original indictment which charged that in the County of Prince William, Virginia, on the 16th day of August, 1975, \u201cClifton Douglas Crawford did unlawfully and feloniously rob The Southland Corporation, t/a 7-11 Store of United States currency having a value of $256.39, against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>peace and dignity of the Commonwealth, in violation of \u00a7 18.1-91 of the 1950 Code of Virginia, as amended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">At the outset of the trial the court asked if there were any amendments to the indictment, and the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney responded in the negative. One Wendal Wilkie Barker, an employee of The Southland Corporation, was then called as a witness on behalf of the Commonwealth. He testified that on August 16, 1975, the defendant Crawford took from him at gunpoint approximately $130 of his employer\u2019s money and $15 of his own. At the conclusion of Barker\u2019s testimony, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney moved to amend the indictment by inserting the words \u201cWendal Barker, an employee of\u201d between the word \u201crob\u201d and the words \u201cThe Southland Corporation\u201d. The amendment was permitted over defendant\u2019s objection. Defendant was again arraigned, and defense counsel was given the opportunity to reexamine defendant under the amended indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The trial judge, in permitting the amendment, observed that he was satisfied the amendment made no change in the actual nature of the crime charged. He then advised the defendant and his counsel that if they were \u201csurprised\u201d and not prepared to proceed further \u201cunder the amended indictment\u201d a continuance would be granted. This offer was refused. At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the defendant offered no evidence in his own behalf and renewed his qbjection to the action of the court in permitting the indictment to be amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Defendant argues that the original indictment, purporting to charge Crawford with the crime of robbery, failed to allege that the money was taken from the person of another and that lacking this element the indictment was fatally defective because it charged no crime. \u201cConsequently, because the indictment found by the grand jury stated no offense and was invalid, it necessarily follows the trial court had no power to amend the indictment... . The conviction on the amended indictment was therefore void.\u201d <em>Wilder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 145, 148, 225 S.E.2d 411, 414 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Robbery in Virginia has been repeatedly defined as a common law crime, <em>Butts </em>v. <em>Commomuealth, </em>145 Va, 800, 811, 133 S.E. 764, 767 (1926), against the person, <em>Falden </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>167 Va. 542, 545, 189 S.E. 326, 328 (1937), for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>which the punishment is fixed by statute, Code \u00a7 18.1-91.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 495, 496, 211 S.E.2d 71, 72 (1975), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">\u201cRobbery at common law is defined as the taking, with the intent to steal, of the personal property of another, from his person or in his presence, against his will, by violence or intimidation. The phrase \u2018... of the personal property of another, from his person or in his presence . . . \u2019 has been broadly construed to include the taking of property from the custody of, or in the actual or constructive possession of, another. <em>Durham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 166, 168, 198 S.E.2d 603, 605-06 (1973).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-6\">\u201cIn the commission of robbery the property must be taken by force and violence, not necessarily from the owner, but from any person in possession thereof whose right- of possession -is superior to that of the robber. The very fact that property is taken from a person by the use of firearms, violence or threatened violence, is, within and of itself, sufficient to show that the person from whom it was taken was in possession thereof. <em>Barfield </em>v. <em>State, </em>137 Tex. Crim. 256, 129 S.W.2d 310, 313, 123 A.L.R. 1093, 1097 (1939).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">In <em>Falden </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>we reversed a judgment convicting the defendant on an indictment which charged conspiracy \u201cto rob a certain United States mail truck\u201d, stating that robbery is a crime against the person. We held: \u201cIt is unnecessary to emphasize the fact that the truck referred to in the alleged indictment was an inanimate thing, and therefore, incapable of being robbed167 Va. at 546, 189 S.E. at 328. The distinction between <em>Falden </em>and the instant case is that here the indictment does not charge that a store, an inanimate thing, was robbed. It charges the robbery of a corporation which can only act through persons \u2014 its agents, servants, employees and officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>The Court in <em>Green </em>v. <em>State, </em>185 Ark. 1098, 51 S.W.2d 511 (1932), was faced with an indictment for the robbery of \u201cthe Bank of Horatio, Arkansas, a corporation\u201d. While in Arkansas the crime of robbery is defined by statute, the elements thereof are substantially identical to those of common law robbery in Virginia. In <em>Green </em>the Court emphasized Arkansas\u2019 statutory provision that \u201cperson includes a corporation as well as a natural person\u201d,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">\u201c[A] corporation acts through its agents, and, if the agents of the corporation were put in fear and the property was taken from them \u2018unlawfully, wilfully, feloniously, violently and forcibly * * * and by intimidation,\u2019 we think it would be unnecessary to name the particular agent or person in charge of the property of the corporation in the indictment.. . .\u201d 185 Ark. at 1099, 51 S.W.2d at 512.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Virginia Code \u00a7 19.2-220, dealing with criminal procedure generally, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">\u201cContents of indictment in general. \u2014 The indictment or information shall be a plain, concise and definite written statement, (1) naming the accused, (2) describing the offense charged, (3) identifying the county, city or town in which the accused committed the offense, and (4) reciting that the accused committed the offense on or about a certain date. In describing the offense, the indictment or information may use the name given to the offense by the common law, or the indictment or information may state so much of the common law or statutory definition of the offense as is sufficient to advise what offense is charged. (1975, c. 495.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Rule of Court 3A:7, which concerns \u201cthe indictment and the information\u201d, follows substantially the language of Code \u00a7 19.2-220 except that it provides that in describing the offense charged the indictment shall also cite \u201cthe statute or ordinance that defines the offense or, if there is no defining statute or ordinance, prescribes the punishment for the offense\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">Effective January 1, 1972, Rules were adopted by this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>covering criminal practices and procedure in courts in Virginia. Rule of Court 3A:2 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">\u201cThese rules are intended to provide for the just determination of criminal proceedings. They shall be interpreted so as to promote uniformity and simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay. Errors, defects, irregularities or variances that do not affect substantial rights shall not constitute reversible error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Simply stated, the issue is whether the offense of robbery was sufficiently stated in the original indictment, keeping in mind that an indictment must give the accused notice of the nature and character of the offense charged so that he can make his defense. The indictment in the instant case correctly names the accused, Crawford. It describes the offense charged as \u201crob The Southland Corporation of United States currency having a value of $256.39\u201d. It specifically refers to Code \u00a7 18.1-91, which section concerns only the crime of robbery. It identifies the county in Virginia in which the accused committed the offense as Prince William. It recites that the accused committed the offense on August 15, 1975, a day definite. Further, the indictment is substantially in the form suggested by the Rules of this Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">It is clear from a reading of the indictment that the defendant was charged with the commission of only one offense and that was robbery, a crime for which he could be punished only as provided in Code \u00a7 18.2-58.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A store empty of persons cannot be robbed. It can be burglarized and larceny can be committed therein. But the defendant was not indicted for breaking and entering or for larceny. When the indictment charged that the defendant robbed The Southland Corporation of $256.39, it in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>effect charged that he committed robbery by putting the agents of the corporation in fear and taking its money from their personal protection and in their presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">While the amendment permitted by the trial court was desirable and properly allowed, it was not essential for the purpose of fully acquainting the defendant Crawford with the fact that he was charged with a particular robbery and if found guilty would be punished as provided by the only section in the Code of Virginia which prescribes a penalty for the crime of robbery. The original and unamended indictment returned by the grand jury did that.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The judgment of the lower court is</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-8\"> Code \u00a7 18.2-68 (Repl.
