Ingram, the wife, was awarded a final divorce from Robert Lee Ingram, the husband. The wife also was awarded custody of the infant child of the parties, alimony of $800 per month, child support of $400 per month, counsel fees of $4,000, and costs. We granted the husband an appeal limited to consideration of the \u201camount awarded for alimony, child support and attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-21\">The record shows that the parties were married March <em>6, </em>1971. One child, a son, was born of the marriage on September 13, 1972. The parties separated June 15, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-22\">At the time of the marriage, the husband was 41 years of age, the wife 30. Each previously had been married and divorced. He had three children by his prior marriage; she had one child by an earlier marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Before the marriage, the wife had been employed by the husband as his secretary in a used auto parts business in Virginia Beach. During the marriage, the wife was not gainfully employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The husband\u2019s auto parts business was successful. In 1972, the last full year before the parties separated, the business had gross sales of $533,159.71, earning therefrom a gross profit of $198,241.69 and a net profit of $27,533.71. In addition to this venture, the husband owned interests in other businesses and in valuable real property. As of December 31, 1972, the husband\u2019s assets were valued at $2,218,-610.47 and his liabilities were listed at $589,296.77, for a net worth of $1,629,313.70. The husband\u2019s annual income was estimated \u201croughly\u201d at $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The parties lived in a luxuriously furnished waterfront home, purchased by the husband for $190,000 shortly before the marriage. They enjoyed the use of two Rolls Royce and two Lincoln automobiles and a private airplane. They employed a maid, entertained frequently, and traveled often. And, as the husband states in his brief, he \u201cindulged the wife with money, mink coats and stoles, charge accounts, clothes, cars, furniture, and jewelry and diamonds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The wife testified that, although she would need \u201cabout $800 a week\u201d to support herself and the child born of the marriage, she could \u201cget by on $500 a week.\u201d The trial court\u2019s allowance for wife and child support totalled $1,200 per month, or slightly more than one-half the \u201c$500 a week\u201d figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">As has been noted, we limited the appeal in this case to consideration of the <em>amount </em>of alimony, child support, and counsel fees awarded by the trial court. Notwithstanding this limitation, the husband\u2019s argument concerning alimony is devoted almost exclusively to the proposition that the wife is entitled to no support at all or to support only for a fixed period sufficient to enable her to obtain employment and become self-sustaining. We expressly rejected this proposition, however, when we limited the appeal. Adhering to the limitation, we will consider only the reasonableness of the <em>amounts </em>awarded by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The husband\u2019s argument concerning the reasonableness of the awards for alimony and child support is abrupt and conclusory. He says that both awards are \u201cobviously excessive.\u201d The award to the wife is excessive, he asserts, because it is \u201cbased upon insufficient evidence.\u201d The award in favor of the child is excessive, the husband proclaims, because \u201c[n]o two year old child requires $400 per month.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>In oral argument, the husband chided the trial judge for disregarding the standards set forth in Code \u00a7 20-107 for determining wife and child support.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These standards, however, were not added to the Code section until the 1975 session of the General Assembly, and they did not become effective until after this case was tried and finally decided. But because the standards are basically the same tests traditionally applied in determining alimony and child support, we are quite willing to employ them in testing the reasonableness of the awards in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">When so tested, the amounts awarded for wife and child support do not appear unreasonable. Given the picture of the financial needs and resources in this case, as reflected in the record, and considering the discretion vested in the trial court by Code \u00a7 20-107, <em>supra,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>3*we cannot say, as a matter of law, that the amounts are \u201cobviously excessive\u201d or unsupported by evidence. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>216 Va. 432, 435, 219 S.E.2d 689, 692 (1975); <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>213 Va. 42, 43, 189 S.E.2d 361, 363 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">With respect to counsel fees, the husband contends that the amount awarded, $4,000, is excessive. The award, he says, should have been limited to $1,000, the amount of retainer the wife had paid her attorney from funds she derived by check drawn on the husband\u2019s account.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The amount of counsel fees, however, was a matter for the exercise of the sound discretion of the trial court. Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-79, -99, -103; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>216 Va. 161, 162, 217 S.E.2d 800, 801 (1975). In the absence of an abuse of this discretion, such an award will not be disturbed. Finding no abuse in this case, we leave the award unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-9\">The standards set forth in Code \u00a7 20-107 for determining wife and child support are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">\u201c(1) The earning capacity, obligations and needs, and financial resources of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">\u201c(2) The education and training of the parties and the ability and opportunity of the parties to secure such education and training;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-12\">\u201c(3) The standard of living established during the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-13\">\u201c(4) The duration of the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-14\">\u201c(5) The age, physical and mental condition of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-15\">\u201c(6) Such other factors as are necessary to consider the equities between the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b181-16\"> Code \u00a7 20-107 provides that in a divorce case the court may decree <em>as it shall deem expedient </em>\u201cconcerning the estate and the maintenance and support of the parties, or either of them, and the care, custody and maintenance of their minor children.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b181-17\">The trial court allowed the husband credit for the amount of the retainer, thus reducing to $3,000 his liability for counsel fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
