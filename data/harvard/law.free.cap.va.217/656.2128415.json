Noell, Jr., sued appellees Gene T. Angle, T. D. Board, and Russell M. Dyer for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>compensatory and punitive damages, which plaintiff claimed resulted from his wrongful arrest on a charge of feloniously attempting to break and enter Angle\u2019s residence in Franklin County on March 15, 1974. The defendants, sued in their individual capacities', were deputy sheriffs of the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">At the conclusion of all the evidence during the jury trial, the court below sustained defendants\u2019 motion to strike plaintiffs evidence and summary judgment was entered for defendants on August 21,1975. We awarded plaintiff a writ of error limited to consideration of one assignment of error, which attacked the trial court\u2019s action in sustaining the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The facts are not in material dispute, the bulk of the probable cause evidence being presented through the testimony of the defendants, called as adverse witnesses by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Near midnight on March 14, 1974, defendant Angle\u2019s wife, while in their home alone with the couple\u2019s three small children, heard a noise which \u201csounded like the [locked] garage door being lifted.\u201d The garage was attached to the dwelling. Shortly thereafter, she observed the \u201cfigure of a man\u201d standing about 40 feet from the home near a picnic table in the back yard, but was unable to identify the individual due to the poor lighting conditions. Through a rear window she continued to observe the man, who was facing the house, for what \u201cseemed like an eternity\u201d but which was actually only a few minutes. The prowler then \u201cjust turned and walked down into the woods\u201d, which adjoined the Angles\u2019 back yard, and disappeared from her sight.</p>\n<p id=\"AaU8\">Mrs. Angle immediately telephoned her husband, who was on duty at the Franklin County Sheriff\u2019s office, and reported the incident to him. Angle rushed to his home and, after his wife again \u201crelated the same facts\u201d, radioed the dispatcher at the sheriff\u2019s office and asked that the Bedford County Sheriff be requested to send the \u201cBedford County tracking dog\u201d to Angle\u2019s home. Defendants Board and Dyer, who were on duty patrolling in a police vehicle, heard Angle\u2019s radio call for the dog and proceeded to Angle\u2019s home. Mrs. Angle then advised Board and Dyer of what she had earlier heard and seen. The three deputies examined the garage door and found it still locked but raised three to five inches, which was \u201cas far as it could be raised with the latch on\u201d because of \u201cplay in the door\u201d. Fingerprint \u201csmudges\u201d, never identified, were \u201clifted\u201d from the door handles.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>About 40 minutes after Board and Dyer reached Angle\u2019s home, Bedford Deputy Sheriff William Mayhew arrived with \u201cDixie\u201d, a seven-year-old State-owned purebred registered bloodhound, which Mayhew customarily \u201chandled\u201d on tracking assignments. Mrs. Angle and the defendants informed Mayhew of the facts and Mayhew then led Dixie to the picnic table area. The dog \u201cseemed to pick up a trail\u201d, went to the garage door, and proceeded to the wooded area where Mrs. Angle had last seen the prowler. The leashed dog continued, \u201crunning the track good\u201d, through bushes across a \u201cbranch\u201d, through a field, south along the gravel shoulder of a paved highway for \u201ca quarter of a mile\u201d, into the highway median strip south for about 500 feet, back to the highway shoulder south for \u201cmaybe half a mile\u201d, back into the median strip, across to the other side of the highway, still tracking south, to the shoulder of an intersecting highway, up a hill, past a yard in front of one house, and into the corner of the yard of plaintiff\u2019s residence to its front door, a distance of about 1.5 miles from Angle\u2019s home. Mayhew then pulled Dixie away from the door several times and took it to different locations in and outside of plaintiff\u2019s yard. Each time the dog returned directly to plaintiff\u2019s front door, sniffing its bottom edge.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">During the tracking, Mayhew handled Dixie\u2019s leash with defendant Dyer following on foot. Defendant Board, in radio contact with Dyer, pursued by automobile accompanied by another Bedford deputy. Defendant Angle remained at his home monitoring the Board-Dyer radio conversations, which revealed the exact course of the trail. When Dyer described the location where the tracking terminated, Angle recognized it to be the residence of Noell, whom Angle knew.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Angle then went to Noell\u2019s home and found the other officers waiting in the front yard. Upon being advised by Mayhew of Dixie\u2019s actions on Noell\u2019s premises, Angle decided to knock on the front door to \u201csee what we could find out.\u201d The time was about 2:00 a.m. on March 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Plaintiff and his wife were awakened by the knocking. Noell opened the door and asked the five officers, who were in uniform, the purpose of their visit. Angle indicated there had been \u201ctrouble\u201d at Angle\u2019s home and implied Noell knew the nature of the \u201ctrouble\u201d, which Noell denied. When the details of the incident were then related to Noell, he stated that he had been at home since about 8:00 p.m. that same evening, the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>when he returned from obtaining medicine for his wife and small child, who were both ill, and that he had retired about 10:00 p.m. Noell then stated to the group that Angle had been \u201charassing him and his wife for some time [and] he was getting tired of it\u201d; that he \u201cwanted everyone\u2019s name that was standing in the yard\u201d; and that he would sue all of the officers \u201cin the morning\u201d unless they left his premises at once.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The evidence revealed that in 1973, about 13 months prior to this incident, Angle and Noell had an \u201cencounter\u201d in which Angle accused Noell of \u201cfollowing\u201d Mrs. Angle and \u201ctrying to go with her\u201d, which accusation Noell denied. Noell testified that he had no further \u201cconfrontation\u201d or direct \u201cinvolvement\u201d with defendant Angle after their initial \u201cencounter\u201d and before the present dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Noell testified that when he unlocked his front door and opened it, Angle \u201cwas red in the face, ready to come in after me\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s wife stated Angle was \u201cin a rage\u201d and \u201cloud\u201d and that Angle sought to go into detail with her about the 1973 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Noell further testified that, following the brief discussion on his front porch, Angle stated to Noell that the officers would discuss the evening\u2019s incident with the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and that \u201cwhatever he advises, we are going to take his advice and take action.\u201d Noell also testified that, to his knowledge, no person visited his home or yard that evening prior to arrival of the officers and that he had not \u201cused\u201d the front door of his residence for at least two to six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">The officers next went to the Franklin County Sheriff\u2019s Office and Robert C. McLaughlin, then Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney of Franklin County, was called to the county jail. Upon his arrival there about 3:00 a.m., McLaughlin saw Dixie in Mayhew\u2019s custody. McLaughlin testified he had a special interest \u201cin bloodhounds and tracking dogs\u201d; that prior to the day in question he had observed Dixie \u201cin action\u201d tracking. McLaughlin discussed the evening\u2019s incident with Mayhew, Board and Angle. At that time, Angle informed McLaughlin of his 1973 \u201cencounter\u201d with Noell. McLaughlin testified that upon \u201cgetting [the information] all together\u201d, he advised the officers \u201cthey had probable cause, to go to the magistrate and seek a warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Thereafter, Board appeared before a magistrate and the warrant was issued. Noell was then arrested at his home by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Board and Dyer about 4:00 a.m., taken to jail, fingerprinted, photographed, placed in a cell, bonded, and released from custody about 8:00 a.m. the same day. He retained counsel and within several weeks after the arrest, but before the preliminary hearing, the charge was \u201cnol prossed\u201d on motion of McLaughlin because of \u201cinsufficient evidence to obtain a conviction.\u201d The present action was filed about 11 months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">In sustaining defendants\u2019 motion to strike, the court below ruled the defendants acted on advice of counsel after \u201ca full and complete and honest disclosure\u201d of the relevant facts, and that probable cause for initiating the criminal proceedings existed as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">We have recently examined, in <em>Bain </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>217 Va. 387, 228 S.E.2d 576 (1976), the malicious prosecution cause of action. There, we were not required to decide whether the defense of advice of counsel had been established as a matter of law because the jury had already properly determined that the lay prosecutor had proceeded independently without the advice of counsel. But here we confront the narrow question whether the trial court erred in deciding the advice of counsel issue, and in turn the probable cause question, as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Among the elements of the cause of action, upon which the plaintiff has the burden of proof, are that the criminal prosecution was initiated by the defendant without probable cause and with malice. 217 Va. at 393, 228 S.E.2d at 581. And malice may be \u201cinferred from the want of probable cause, but the latter can never be inferred from even the plainest malice.\u201d <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Shelor, </em>69 Va. (28 Gratt.) 891, 909 (1877). And, too, if the defendant sustains his advice of counsel defense, it is considered he had probable cause for initiating the criminal proceeding, although the advice he received may have been wrong. <em>Bain, supra, </em>217 Va. at 394, 228 S.E.2d at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Advice of counsel may be a shield against a suit for malicious prosecution if the defendant proves (1) that he sought counsel with an honest purpose of being informed as to the law, (2) that he made a full, correct and honest disclosure to counsel of all material facts in his knowledge bearing on the plaintiff\u2019s guilt, or which should have been within his knowledge had he made a reasonably careful investigation bearing on such guilt and (3) that he was in good faith guided by the advice of counsel in causing the arrest of the plaintiff. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Atlantic Coast </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number><em>Line Ry., 105 </em>Va. 72, 76-77, 80, 53 S.E. 3, 3-4, 5 (1906). <em>See Bain, supra, </em>217 Va. at 394, 228 S.E.2d at 581. Whether such advice is thus sought and obtained is usually a question for the jury, <em>Spitzer </em>v. <em>Clatterbuck, </em>202 Va. 1001, 1004, 121 S.E.2d 466, 468 (1961); <em>Commander </em>v. <em>Provident Relief Ass\u2019n, </em>126 Va. 455, 464, 102 S.E. 89, 92 (1920), but when reasonable minds cannot differ that the defense has been established, it becomes the function of the court to decide the question as a matter of law. <em>American Ry. Express Co. </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>148 Va. 1, 17, 138 S.E. 496, 501 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Plaintiff argues the trial court invaded the province of the jury by striking the evidence. He contends a jury could find defendants failed to prove \u201cthey sought advice with an <em>honest </em>purpose.\u201d He asserts that given \u201cthe obvious rage of Defendant Angle and the fact of his apparent belief that Noell had been pursuing his wife, presumably with romantic notions, a-year earlier, Angle\u2019s motives were questionable at the best.\u201d He argues the jury could have found Angle wanted Noell arrested to terminate any further \u201cepisodes\u201d between Noell and Angle\u2019s wife, and \u201cnot to bring a criminal to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Plaintiff also contends a question of fact was raised \u201cwhether there had been full disclosure of all material facts the Defendant <em>knew </em>or <em>should have known </em>if they had made a reasonably careful investigation.\u201d He argues there was \u201cvirtually no investigation beyond interviewing [defendant\u2019s] wife and following the dog.\u201d He labels \u201cfeeble\u201d the unsuccessful attempt to identify the fingerprints. He says there was \u201cample opportunity to make impressions of footprints, to check for items missing from the garage, [and] to check out Noell\u2019s claims of going [for medicine] and being home all evening after 8:00 p.m.\u201d He suggests defendants should have inquired about Noell\u2019s \u201cgeneral reputation, character and the likelihood that he could flee before a more thorough investigation could be completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">The main thrust of Noell\u2019s argument is directed to defendant Angle. But he also urges defendants Board and Dyer are jointly liable with Angle because they, too, acted \u201cwith malice, ill will and with a reckless and wanton disregard for Plaintiff\u2019s rights\u201d. We reject the plaintiff\u2019s contentions and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">Contrary to plaintiffs initial argument, we believe the evidence conclusively establishes that Angle and the other defendants sought McLaughlin\u2019s advice with a <em>bona fide </em>desire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>to be informed as to the law and in an effort to obtain guidance regarding further handling of the case. The plaintiff speculates that Angle had an ulterior motive in seeking McLaughlin\u2019s counsel. None of the credible evidence supports such a notion. In the first place, 13 months had passed since the 1973 episode, the first and only confrontation between the plaintiff and Angle. Moreover, on the day in question, the officers stated to Noell they would be guided by the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s instructions. Furthermore, and more importantly, Angle, in reporting a crime at his own home, disclosed to McLaughlin the facts of the 1973 confrontation. If Angle intended to harass Noell for selfish reasons, as alleged, it is reasonable to conclude that' Angle would have concealed the 1973 incident from McLaughlin, to lessen the probability that McLaughlin, feeling the officers had overstated the case due to Angle\u2019s personal involvement, would decide against prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Nor are we persuaded by plaintiff\u2019s second contention. We find the evidence positively establishes the defendants made a full, correct, and honest disclosure to McLaughlin of all material facts, bearing on Noell\u2019s apparent guilt, which were in their knowledge, or which should have been in their knowledge under the circumstances. Plaintiff dwells on the argument that defendants should have made a further, extended investigation before seeking McLaughlin\u2019s advice. But a <em>reasonably careful </em>investigation is all the law requires, not an investigation sufficient to convict. Here, the officers were armed with explicit information from Mrs. Angle, an identified reliable source, of what she had heard and seen. Her account was confirmed, in part, by the officers\u2019 observations of the locked but raised garage door. Then, an experienced and well-trained tracking dog, which according to the evidence had been highly successful in finding criminals and lost persons, corroborated some of Mrs. Angle\u2019s observations by starting to track precisely where she said the prowler disappeared from her sight. Thereafter, the dog tracked without hesitation 1.5 miles directly to Noell\u2019s front door. At the front door, the officers learned that Noell denied the charge and that he- claimed to have been home for about six hours. They observed him immediately become belligerent, threatening to sue each uniformed officer. Fingerprint identification was not feasible. The evidence showed that while the Franklin County police author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>ities had the facilities to obtain fingerprints, they were not equipped to promptly identify them; the same was true as to \u00abfootprint identification. Finally, and significantly, McLaughlin, who possessed all of the foregoing information and who had independent knowledge of the dog\u2019s qualifications and reliability, did not recommend additional investigation, obviously concluding he had sufficient facts on which to make an objective probable cause decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">For these reasons, the judgment of the trial court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
