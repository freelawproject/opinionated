It is hereby requested, provided and agreed that the provisions hereof in regard to the support of the children of the parties are subject to change in the event of a change of the circumstances of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">In May 1971, after the older child of the parties reached her majority of 21 years, the trial court interpreted and applied the agreement, and ordered that the sum of $225 per month be paid by the father to the mother for the support of the younger child, who was then fourteen years of age, \u201cuntil the further order of [the] Court.\u201d Subsequently, the age of majority was changed from 21 to 18 by enactment of the General Assembly effective July 1,1972 (Acts 1972, cc. 824, 825). Code \u00a7 1-13.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Thereafter, the father filed a petition asking that effective February 16, 1975, the date the younger child became 18, the trial court relieve him of the duty to make further child support payments. Following a hearing, the court below on August 20, 1975 denied the father\u2019s request and ordered him to continue to make support payments for the benefit of the younger child until the child reached 21. The appeal which we granted the father from the foregoing order requires us to construe the June 15, 1960 contract to determine whether the parties intended the support payments in issue to continue until the child attained the age of 21 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">This is not an <em>Eaton </em>case; it is more akin to <em>Meredith, </em>decided after the ruling appealed here, than <em>Paul, </em>and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">In <em>Paul, </em>relied upon by the mother, we held that the 1972 enactment lowering the age of majority did not operate to relieve the father from making the agreed support payments for two children who had attained age 18. There, the court-approved 1969 agreement provided for support payments to be made until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>the children became 21, were married, entered the armed forces, became employed full-time, or were \u201cotherwise emancipated.\u201d 214 Va. at 652, 203 S.E.2d at 124. In <em>Meredith, </em>relied upon by the father, we relieved the father of his obligation of support when the child became 18; we concluded the parties did not intend to continue the father\u2019s duty of child support \u201cbeyond the period within which, in the absence of an agreement, he would have been liable under Virginia law for such support.\u201d 216 Va. at 638, 222 S.E.2d at 512. There, the 1970 contract which was incorporated into the final divorce decree required the father to support the child \u201cuntil such child shall Teach his majority.\u201d 216 Va. at 637, 222 S.E.2d at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In contrast to <em>Paul </em>and <em>Meredith, </em>the Mack agreement provides for support of the \u201cminor children\u201d of the parties. The father argues, and the mother agrees, the word \u201cminor\u201d is used in this contract as an adjective modifying \u201cchildren\u201d and that such use of \u201cminor\u201d should not be interpreted as a \u201ccontractual undertaking\u201d on the father\u2019s part. The mother maintains, however, that when all the provisions of the agreement are considered along with the extrinsic evidence, it is obvious the parties intended the father to support the younger child until the child becomes 21. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">We first turn to the contract. In addition to the foregoing provisions relating to child support, the parties also agreed upon: child custody and visitation, immediate divestment of the parties\u2019 respective interests in their jointly-owned realty and personalty, a lump-sum cash payment to be made by one party to the other on or before November 1, 1960, alimony to be paid by the husband to terminate ten years from the date of the agreement, and, extension of the father\u2019s life insurance coverage, with the mother and two children remaining as beneficiaries under the policy. These provisions are similar to the \u201cother\u201d provisions in the <em>Meredith </em>agreement, 216 Va. at 638, 222 S.E.2d at 512, as disclosed by an examination of the <em>Meredith </em>record, but are dissimilar to the \u201cother\u201d provisions of the <em>Paul </em>agreement, which showed the intent of the parties for the father to provide support for the children even after they attained the age of 21. 214 Va. at 653-54, 203 S.E.2d at 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">As the mother urges, we shall also examine the extrinsic evidence, presented over the father\u2019s objection and not mentioned by the chancellor in his written opinion. We will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>assume, but not decide, the evidence was admissible. The mother\u2019s evidence showed the parties contemplated the father would support both children until they each obtained a college education and became self-supporting. The father testified, however, the parties never intended he would be obligated to provide child support beyond the time when his legal obligation therefor ended. This extrinsic evidence, even if admissible, is obviously in direct conflict; we therefore cast it aside as having no value in our search for the intent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Accordingly, we return to the contract which, unlike the agreements in <em>Paul </em>and <em>Meredith, </em>fixes no specific date or time when the father\u2019s obligation to pay child support is to terminate. Even though the law existing when the contract was executed in June, 1960, specified 21 years to be the age of majority, the terms of the agreement fail to demonstrate the parties relied on such fact. <em>Cf Paul, </em>214 Va. at 653, 203 S.E.2d at 125. Consequently, and because minority is a legal status subject to change by the legislature rather than a vested right, 216 Va. at 638, 222 S.E.2d at 512, we hold the parties intended that Mack\u2019s duty to support his \u201cminor\u201d children terminated on the day when, in the absence of any agreement, his legal liability for such support under Virginia law ended \u2014 and that was February 16,1975, this child\u2019s 18th birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">For these reasons, the trial court erred in requiring the father to continue child support payments until the child reaches 21 years of age. We will therefore reverse the order appealed from and enter a decree relieving the father of any requirement to pay child support after the child reached the age of 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final decree.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
