We limited the appeal to a consideration of whether the original indictment was sufficient to charge the accused with commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The face of the original indictment stated that defendant on or about February 4, 1975, in the City of Richmond,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">\u201cdid feloniously and unlawfully have in his possession two or more stolen credit cards issued to Mrs. John W. Cowan, against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Va. Code \u00a7 18.1-125.3, 18.1-125.5 and 18.1-100\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The indorsement on the back of the indictment contained the words \u201cCREDIT CARD THEFT\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">The defendant\u2019s motion to quash the indictment was overruled at a pre-trial hearing and the charge was amended over defendant\u2019s objection. At trial, the Commonwealth proved that when arrested on the day in question defendant had on his person credit cards which had been contained in a pocketbook stolen from the victim a short time before the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>The defendant argues the original indictment was invalid because it charged \u201cmere naked possession\u201d of credit cards, which is \u201cno offense at all.\u201d Consequently, he contends, it was not susceptible of amendment and his conviction on the amended charge was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The Commonwealth argues the only defect in the original indictment is that the crime of credit card theft was stated \u201ctoo generally\u201d; that Code \u00a7 18.1-125.3, note 1 <em>supra, </em>cited at the foot of the indictment, proscribes several types of criminal activity involving the possession of a credit card; that when the charge under the original indictment is read in conjunction with that statute, it is obvious the defendant was not charged with \u201cmere possession of credit cards alone\u201d, but with \u201cunlawful and felonious possession of credit cards in violation of \u00a7 18.1-125.3.\u201d We do not agree with the Commonwealth that the indictment was legally sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">It is apparent from a review of the record that the Commonwealth intended to charge the defendant under subsection (a) of \u00a7 18.1-125.3(1) and not under subsections (b), (c) or (d). Hence, we need only examine that subsection to determine whether the statutory offense was sufficiently stated, keeping in mind that an indictment must give the accused notice of the nature and character of the offense charged so he can make his defense, although in charging a statutory offense it is not necessary to follow the identical words of the statute. <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 830, 839, 36 S.E.2d 561, 566 (1946). <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-220 and 19.2-221; Rule 3A:7(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Subsection (a) deals with the acts of <em>taking </em>a credit card, <em>obtaining </em>a credit card, <em>withholding </em>a credit card, and <em>receiving </em>a credit card. The challenged indictment charged defendant with \u201cpossession\u201d of stolen credit cards. But in the context of subsection (a) possession is not synonymous with taking, obtaining, withholding or receiving. While possession may <em>result </em>from any of the foregoing acts, the subsection deals with the <em>manner </em>in which possession is acquired and not with possession alone. Accordingly, a charge of mere possession of a stolen credit card is not sufficient to state the offense of credit card theft under subsection (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Moreover, the foregoing proscribed acts must be accompanied by an intent to use the card, or to sell it, or to transfer it to a person other than the issuer or the cardholder. <em>See Cheatham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 286, 290, 208 S.E.2d 760, 763 (1974). Such intent is not alleged in the original charge, and this defect also invalidates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>the indictment. <em>Tompkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>177 Va. 858, 13 S.E.2d 409 (1941); <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>165 Va. 750, 181 S.E. 351 (1935); <em>Merritt </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>164 Va. 653, 180 S.E. 395 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Furthermore, the references at the foot of the charge to the credit card theft and grand larceny statutes fail to save the indictment. Such references support, but do not replace, the \u201cdefinite written statement\u201d, Code \u00a7 19.2-220 and Rule 3A:7(a), required in the body of an indictment. <em>Cf. Washington </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 185, 191-92, 217 S.E.2d 815, 822 (1975). Code \u00a7 18.1-125.5, also cited, is irrelevant because the statute on its face applies the presumption, stemming from possession, to credit card forgery and not credit card theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Nor is the indictment salvaged by the reference to \u201ccredit card theft\u201d in the indorsement or return. \u201cThe indorsement is not a substantive part of an indictment and is not determinative of the legal sufficiency of the accusation to charge the crime for which it is sought to hold the accused to answer; it neither strengthens nor weakens the legal force of the averments in the charging portion of the indictment.\u201d 2 C. Torcia, <em>Whartoris Criminal Procedure, </em>\u00a7 250 at 46 (12th ed. 1975) (footnotes omitted). <em>See Price </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 62 </em>Va. (21 Gratt.) 846, 856-62 (1872).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Consequently, because the indictment found by the grand jury stated no offense and was invalid, it necessarily follows the trial court had no power to amend the indictment. <em>See Evans </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>183 Va. 775, 781, 33 S.E.2d 636, 638-39 (1945); Code \u00a7 19.2-231; Rule 3A:8(c). The conviction on the amended indictment was therefore void.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">For these reasons, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"ANi\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-9\"> At the time of the alleged offense, the Code sections cited in the indictment (1974 Cum. Supp.) provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-10\">\u201c\u00a7 18.1-125.3 [now \u00a7 18.2-192].
