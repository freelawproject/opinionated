Specifically, the defendant contends the confession was inadmissible under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), because it was obtained after he had announced during police interrogation that he desired to consult an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-17\">The issue of the confession\u2019s admissibility was determined adversely to the defendant in a pre-trial suppression hearing. Later, in a non-jury trial, the confession was admitted into evidence, and the defendant was convicted of the robbery of Rabbi Phillip Pincus, which had occurred on January 16,1975, at Temple Emanuel in the City of Virginia Beach.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>The evidence produced at the suppression hearing shows that on March 4, 1975, Detective Summerlin of the Virginia Beach Police Department interviewed the defendant at the city jail concerning the Pincus robbery. At the time of the interview, the defendant was in custody on an unrelated burglary charge, upon which he was represented by the Public Defender.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Prior to questioning the defendant concerning the Pincus-robbery, Detective Summerlin advised him of the nature of the charge under investigation and also gave him the \u201cMiranda warnings.\u201d The defendant told Summerlin he understood his rights, and he signed a \u201cwaiver of rights\u201d form. Among other things, the waiver stated: \u201cI do not want a lawyer at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">At \u201cone point\u201d in the interview, the defendant stated he \u201cwould like to talk to an attorney.\u201d However, \u201cimmediately after making request for an attorney\u201d but before Summerlin said \u201canything,\u201d the defendant \u201cbegan to ask [Summerlin] questions about the offense.\u201d Summerlin answered the inquiries, and \u201cshortly after that [the defendant] gave [Summerlin] the confession.\u201d The interview lasted \u201cthirty minutes or so\u201d and was free of coercion or duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Indisputably, <em>Miranda </em>requires that if, during custodial interrogation, \u201cthe individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u201d 384 U.S. at 474. This does not mean, however, \u201cthat the accused may not later waive his earlier request for counsel, though such waiver is not to be lightly assumed. The burden of establishing such waiver by the preponderance of the evidence, however, rests upon the [prosecution] and that burden is a heavy one, requiring convincing evidence.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>549 F.2d 942, 945 (4th Cir. 1977) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">The facts in <em>Grant </em>are strikingly similar to the present factual situation. In custody in South Carolina on an unrelated charge, Grant, after receiving the \u201cMiranda warnings\u201d and signing a waiver form, was questioned by FBI agents concerning a Richmond bank robbery. He denied Complicity in the crime and requested a lawyer. The agents questioned Grant no further concerning the robbery but proceeded to obtain from him \u201cstandardized identification information.\u201d Grant inquired whether he would be returned to Richmond and what would be the procedure in connection with the Richmond case. The agents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>answered the inquiries, and then the defendant stated, \u201c[i]t is ail true.\u201d Although the \u201cMiranda warnings\u201d were repeated and Grant was reminded of his request for an attorney, he proceeded to detail the circumstances of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">In affirming Grant\u2019s conviction, the Court stated that <em>Miranda </em>does not \u201cprotect an accused, even though he has requested counsel, from a spontaneous admission made under circumstances not induced by the investigating officers or during a conversation not initiated by the officers.\u201d Grant, the Court held, had \u201cvoluntarily and intelligently\u201d waived \u201chis previously invoked right to counsel.\u201d 549 F.2d at 946, 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">We agree with this rationale, and we adopt it as dispositive of the present case. It supports our view, previously expressed, of the application of <em>Miranda </em>in similar situations. <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 307, 311, 227 S.E.2d 737, 740-41 (1976); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 725, 727-28, 187 S.E.2d 180, 182-83 (1972); <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 260, 263, 183 S.E.2d 725, 728 (1971); <em>Land </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 223, 228-29, 176 S.E.2d 586, 589-90 (1970); <em>Penn </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 229, 241, 169 S.E.2d 419, 427 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">The record establishes convincingly that, after announcing he \u201cwould like to talk to an attorney\u201d but before Detective Summerlin said \u201canything,\u201d the defendant initiated further conversation concerning the offense and thereafter freely confessed the crime. By his actions, therefore, the defendant voluntarily and intelligently waived his prior request for counsel. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
