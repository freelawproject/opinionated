U. S. Const, amends. VI, XIV, \u00a7 1; Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 8. We consider whether testimony given by a witness during a preliminary hearing on a murder charge may properly be received as substantive evidence for the prosecution in the subsequent trial for both the murder and a robbery arising out of the same occurrence when the witness is deceased at the time of trial. We think the evidence was admissible and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">On September 9,1973, at about 11:00 p.m., Johnny Doho Lam, while accompanied by his wife, was fatally shot outside his restaurant in Hampton during the course of an armed robbery which occurred immediately after he had closed the business for the night. At the trial the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence showed that as Lam and his wife prepared to enter their automobile parked at the front door of the restaurant, the assailant approached the couple and demanded money. When Lam said he had none, Mrs. Lam threw her billfold to the assailant, who took it, shot Lam in the back of the head, and ran from the scene. Defendant Harvey James Fisher, sometimes known as James Harvey Fisher, was apprehended about 18 months later in Georgia and charged in a warrant with Lam\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">A preliminary hearing on the murder charge was held on July 3, 1975 in the General District Court of the City of Hampton at which Ronald McCarthy, an eyewitness to the shooting and an alleged accomplice of Fisher, testified that Fisher committed the murder. Following the hearing, the case was certified to the circuit court, the judge of the court not of record finding there was probable cause to charge defendant with the murder. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-186 (then \u00a7 19.1-106); Rule 3A:5(b)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">Within two weeks after the preliminary hearing, the witness McCarthy was found stabbed to death in a motel room in Jacksonville Beach, Florida. On August 4, 1975, the Hampton grand jury indicted defendant for Lam\u2019s murder; defendant was also charged in two additional indictments with armed robbery of both Lams. During the December 1975 trial on the three indictments in the court below, over defendant\u2019s objection, a transcript of McCarthy\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony was read to the jury as a part of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. Defendant presented an alibi defense, claiming he was in Fayetteville, North Carolina, at the time of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>The jury found defendant guilty of the murder in the first degree, guilty of armed robbery of Mrs. Lam, and not guilty of robbery of Mr. Lam. On December 19, 1975, the trial court entered judgment on the jury\u2019s verdicts and sentenced Fisher to 20 years\u2019 confinement in the penitentiary for the murder and to ten years\u2019 imprisonment for the robbery. We awarded defendant a limited writ of error to consider the correctness of the trial court\u2019s action in permitting use of McCarthy\u2019s hearsay testimony in the trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">We examine first the propriety of admitting the statement for use in the murder prosecution. In so doing, we study further the preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">Testifying during the hearing in addition to McCarthy were an investigating police officer and Mrs. Lam, the only other eyewitness to the shooting who also identified Fisher as the assailant. Defendant was present and was represented by the two attorneys who were subsequently trial counsel and who are no,w appellate counsel. During the hearing the prosecutor propounded 16 questions to McCarthy, the direct examination covering approximately five pages of the transcript. Defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the witness contains 135 questions and answers, comprising about 28 pages of transcript, which also includes repeated overruled objections made by the prosecutor. There was no redirect examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">During the direct examination, McCarthy testified that he knew defendant, whom he identified in the courtroom; that he was with defendant when the crimes were committed and saw him \u201cpull a robbery and shoot a man\u201d; that defendant was standing behind the man holding him \u201cby the shirt with the gun on his head\u201d; that \u201cit all happened in a matter of a split second\u201d; and that he \u201csaw the woman throw a pocketbook across the car ... and [he] heard the gun go off....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">During cross-examination, McCarthy stated he was unsure of the exact date of the crimes; that he and defendant lived in Fayetteville; that they came to Hampton on the day of the crimes \u201cto steal some money\u201d; that they had initially planned to rob a \u201cbookie\u201d in Hampton but as they waited outside the bookie\u2019s home they saw him with \u201ca lot of other people\u201d and decided to rob the owner of the White Oaks Restaurant, located near Lam\u2019s restaurant. McCarthy testified that when he and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>defendant reached the White Oaks Restaurant they separated, McCarthy going to \u201ccheck\u201d the back door which he found locked. The witness further testified that as he returned to the front of that restaurant, he saw Fisher about 35 yards away \u201ccommit this particular act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Contending the only \u201crole\u201d he played was to run from the scene with Fisher after the shooting, McCarthy described in detail Fisher\u2019s physical appearance and dress at the time. He further testified defendant told him, as they were leaving the scene in an automobile which they had parked in the vicinity, that \u201che didn\u2019t know how he shot the man or why\u201d and that \u201cthe gun just went off. .. . [I]t was an accident.\u201d He also stated that after the shooting he saw defendant handling money, which was contained in a lady\u2019s wallet in Fisher\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">Further on cross-examination, McCarthy admitted that he was wanted by the police on a number of \u201cbad check\u201d offenses for which he had not been arrested; that he had been previously convicted of a felony; that he had been arrested and charged with Lam\u2019s murder; and that the Hampton police had promised to drop the \u201ccheck charges\u201d against him if he \u201ctestified to what [he] knew about\u201d the Lam crimes and if he made \u201crestitution on all the checks.\u201d McCarthy further admitted that approximately a month after the murder and before he had been arrested for it, he made \u201cdemand upon the outstanding reward money that [had] been posted [in a substantial amount] for this crime\u201d. Cross-examination raised the inference that McCarthy had been led to believe that if he testified against Fisher, the murder charge against him would not be prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">At the trial, the fact of McCarthy\u2019s death was stipulated; the court reporter, who took down and transcribed the testimony at the preliminary hearing, authenticated the accuracy of the transcript, from which McCarthy\u2019s sworn testimony was read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">Respecting use of the testimony to support the murder charge, defendant contends his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him was violated because the jury was deprived of the \u201copportunity to observe the appearance and demeanor of the witness\u201d, and because \u201cthe limitation of cross-examination at a preliminary hearing held only to establish probable cause is not the type of confrontation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>satisfies either\u201d the federal or state constitutional guarantees. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Since at least near the turn of the century, this Court, and the Supreme Court of the United States, have recognized the admissibility in a criminal trial of prior-recorded testimony of an unavailable witness under certain circumstances. In <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>109 Va. 807, 63 S.E. 462 (1909), relying on <em>Mattox </em>v. <em>United States, </em>156 U.S. 237 (1895), we sustained defendant\u2019s contention the trial court erred in refusing to receive in evidence the testimony given by defendant\u2019s deceased wife at a former <em>trial </em>of the case, at which the witness was cross-examined by the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney. Disapproving dicta in three earlier cases, the <em>Parks </em>court decided that such evidence was admissible, \u201cassuming always that there has been a due cross-examination\u201d. 109 Va. at 809, 63 S.E. at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">In <em>Mattox, </em>defendant had been awarded a new trial on appeal of a murder conviction. At the second trial, the prosecution introduced the recorded testimony of two witnesses, since deceased, given at the first trial. The Supreme Court rejected defendant\u2019s argument that his right of confrontation had been abridged. The Court noted \u201cthe authority in favor of the admissibility of such testimony, where the defendant was present either at the examination of the deceased witness before a <em>committing magistrate, </em>or upon a former trial of the same case, is overwhelming\u201d, 156 U.S. at 241 (emphasis added), and held \u201c[t]he substance of the constitutional protection is preserved to the prisoner in the advantage he has once had of seeing the witness face to face, and of subjecting him to the ordeal of a cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">In contrast and more recently in <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400 (1965), later use of preliminary hearing testimony of an unavailable witness was held improper when defendant was without counsel at the prior hearing and did not attempt to cross-examine the witness. But the court noted: \u201cThe case before us would be quite a different one had [the witness\u2019] statement been taken at a full-fledged hearing at which [defendant] had been represented by counsel who had been given a complete and adequate opportunity to cross-examine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">Subsequently, in <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Page, </em>390 U.S. 719 (1968), <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. 149 (1970), <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>400 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>U.S. 74 (1070), and <em>Mancusi </em>v. Stubbs, 408 U.S. 204 (1972), the Supreme Court addressed the confrontation issue in the context of varying factual situations. For example, in <em>Maneusi, </em>the prosecution offered at a retrial the transcript of testimony of a then unavailable witness given at the first trial about nine years earlier. The Court found no constitutional error in permitting the prior-recorded testimony to be read to the jury at the second trial. The Court held that \u201c[s]ince there was an adequate opportunity to cross-examine\u201d the witness at the first trial, and since counsel for defendant \u201cavailed himself of that opportunity,\u201d the transcript of the testimony carried \u201csufficient indicia of reliability\u201d and provided \u201cthe trier of fact a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth\u201d of the earlier testimony. 408 U.S. at 216. Applying the foregoing test, we reach the same conclusion in the present case, there being no issue as to McCarthy\u2019s unavailability.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">During the preliminary hearing, one of defendant\u2019s two attorneys present at the hearing conducted a vigorous, detailed and searching cross-examination of McCarthy focusing on the two main issues which later developed at the trial, as far as McCarthy\u2019s testimony was concerned \u2014 identification of defendant as the assailant and McCarthy\u2019s credibility. The testimony was given under oath in a judicial proceeding which was distinctly adversary. Hence, the transcript of McCarthy\u2019s testimony at the preliminary hearing carried sufficient indicia of reliability and provided the jury a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of his prior statements. Accordingly, we find no constitutional error in permitting this use of the prior testimony to support the murder charge. <em>See Virgin Islands </em>v. <em>Acquino, </em>378 F.2d 540, 547-49 (3d Cir. 1967); <em>State </em>v. Ford, 336 So.2d 817, 819 (La. 1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mustone, </em>353 Mass. 490, 492-94, 233 N.E.2d 1, 3-4 (1968); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacob, </em>222 N.W.2d 586, 589-90 (N.D. 1974); 5 Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 1375 (Chadbourn rev. 1974); 3 C. Torcia, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 650 (13th ed. 1973); McCormick, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7\u00a7 255-58 (2d ed. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">We now turn to the use of McCarthy\u2019s prior testimony in the prosecution of the robbery charge. Defendant argues that his right of confrontation was violated \u201cto a greater degree\u201d by such use because at the time of the preliminary hearing defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>had\" not been charged with robbery \u201cand the focus of cross-examination [was] necessarily on the murder alone.\u201d We also reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">The robbery and murder indictments grew out of one transaction, the events of which took place \u201cin a matter of a split second.\u201d The evidence of the murder necessarily included the facts surrounding the robbery. And defendant\u2019s cross-examination unavoidably dealt not only with the two issues common to both charges, identification of defendant and McCarthy\u2019s credibility, but also with the details of the robbery. Under these circumstances, such evidence was properly received by the trial court in support of the robbery indictment. <em>See State </em>v. Jackson, 30 N.C. App. 187, 226 S.E.2d 543 (1976); <em>Fox </em>v. State, 102 Ark. 393, 144 S.W. 516 (1912).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s contention the trial court erred in permitting use of the transcript because, he says, it was prepared at the request of defendant\u2019s attorney and \u201cat cost to [defendant] thereby constituting attorney\u2019s work product\u201d which enjoyed a \u201cprivileged status.\u201d In the first place, this complaint was not made in the trial court and we will not notice such an objection for the first time on appeal. Rule 5:21 (then Rule 5:7). Secondly, there is no merit to the contention, even if the point had been properly preserved. The attorney\u2019s \u201cwork product\u201d privilege does not preclude use at a subsequent trial of recorded testimony given in open court during a preliminary hearing at which the witness has been, or could be, compelled to testify. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mustone, </em>353 Mass, at 494, 233 N.E.2d at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">For these reasons, the judgments of conviction will be</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
