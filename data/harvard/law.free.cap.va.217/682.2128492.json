After the jury had been sworn, Johnson moved to exclude all witnesses. The trial court excluded all witnesses except the investigating officer. We granted Johnson a writ of error to consider the effect of an amendment to Code \u00a7 8-211.1 adopted by the'General Assembly effective June 1,1975. Acts 1975, c. 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-21\">Prior to amendment, the statute read in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-22\">\u201cIn the trial of every case, civil or criminal, the court . . . may upon its own motion and shall upon the motion of any party, require the exclusion of every witness <em>irhose presence is not necessary to the proceedings. . </em>..\u201d (Italics supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>The 1975 amendment deleted the italicized language. Addressing that language in <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 255, 183 S.E.2d 734 (1971), we declined to speculate upon legislative intent and held that the statute did not vest a defendant with an absolute right to exclusion of all witnesses. In accord, we ruled in <em>Yorke </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 776, 188 S.E.2d 77 (1972), <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 609, 212 S.E.2d 268 (1975), and <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>City of Norfolk, </em>216 Va. 369, 218 S.E.2d 735 (1975), that exclusion of witnesses was a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. In all these cases, the trial date antedated the effective date . of the 1975 amendment. Here, the amendment was in effect on the day of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Johnson argues that, while a defendant\u2019s right to exclusion under the old statute was qualified, <em>i.e., </em>it extended only to those witnesses whose presence at trial was not necessary, the amendment removed that qualification and made a defendant\u2019s right absolute. We agree. In its amended form, Code \u00a7 8-211.1 permits of no rational construction but that \u201cupon the motion of any party\u201d a trial court \u201cshall\u201d exclude \u201cevery witness\u201d during the trial of \u201cevery case, civil or criminal\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The Commonwealth, contends that this construction is defeated by the language of Code \u00a7 19.2-266 (Repl. Vol. 1975) which reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-7\">\u201cIn the trial of all criminal cases ... the court may, in its discretion, exclude from the trial any person\u00e9 whose presence would impair the conduct of a fair trial....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">Although the words \u201cpersons\u201d may include witnesses, we read that statute (previously, Code \u00a7 19.1-246 (Cum. Supp. 1975)) to apply primarily to spectators. Legislative history supports our view. Code \u00a7 19.2-266 and the 1975 amendment to Code \u00a7 8-211.1 were adopted at the same session of the legislature. We cannot assume that the General Assembly intended to enact two contradictory statutes. Rather, we conclude that it intended the two statutes to serve different functions in furtherance of a common goal, <em>viz., </em>a fair trial for all litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">The judgment will be reversed and the case will be remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
