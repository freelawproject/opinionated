With the notice was filed a certified copy of the annexation ordinance, passed the day before by the Council of Radford, which set forth the necessity for and expediency of annexation. Attached and made a part of the ordinance was the map in question, which showed the land to be annexed and, according to the ordinance, .. generally indicatefd] the various land usage of [such] areas....\u201d The City relied entirely on the map to describe existing land uses in the territory sought, as permitted by Code \u00a7 15.1-1033(b), no attempt having been made to set them forth in the body of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Following service of process and publication of the notice and ordinance, Code \u00a7 15.1-1035, the proceeding was docketed for hearing. The three-judge trial court was duly designated, Code \u00a7 15.1-1038, and, on May 19,1975, it heard and took under advisement the counties\u2019 respective motions to dismiss and pleas to the jurisdiction, which had been filed during the course of the proceeding. The counties asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court lacked jurisdiction because the ordinance, and the map, failed to set forth the existing land uses and failed to indicate \u201cgenerally subdivisions, industrial areas, farm areas, vacant areas and others\u201d, as required by \u00a7 15.1-1033(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Subsequent to the hearing, the City filed on July 9, 1975, a \u201cTender and Motion\u201d to which was attached a certified copy of another ordinance adopted by its Council on July 2,1975. In this motion, the City denied the original map filed with the initial pleading was \u201cin any way deficient for the purposes contemplated by Section 15.1-1033,\u201d but asked leave to \u201cfile an additional map ... as additional pleadings herein\u201d, relying on Code \u00a7 15.1-1046.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The July ordinance \u201cadopted for annexation purposes [the] additional map\u201d and authorized its filing as \u201can exhibit in said annexation proceedings, ... for the sole purpose of providing specificity to the general uses of land in the area sought for annexation already shown on the map previously annexed to\u201d the November 1974 ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">By written opinion dated September 3, 1975, the annexation court unanimously decided the original map was insufficient and sustained the counties\u2019 pleas to the jurisdiction. It also ruled it had no power to consider the July \u201cTender and Motion\u201d. Accordingly, by final order of September 22, 1975, the proceeding was dismissed because the \u201cOrdinance of Annexation herein of the City of Radford does not comply with the mandatory requirements of \u00a7 15.1-1033....\u201d From this order, we awarded Radford an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The City contends the November 1974 ordinance and map as originally filed provided the information required by \u00a7 15.1-1033 and, therefore, the trial court erred in dismissing the proceeding. Radford also contends, in the alternative, that even if the original map was deficient, nevertheless, the trial court erred in refusing to consider and grant the July \u201cTender and Motion\u201d and in refusing to receive and file the second map which, it says, \u201csufficiently provided\u201d the information required by the statute. We do not agree with either of these contentions. The decision of both of the foregoing issues, as the trial court noted, is controlled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>by the principles enunciated in <em>Martinsville </em>v. <em>County of Henry, </em>204 Va. 757, 133 S.E.2d 287 (1962),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">With respect to the City\u2019s first contention, we held in <em>Martinsville </em>that while substantial compliance will satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 15.1-1033, a failure to so comply is jurisdictional. 204 Va. at 760-61, 133 S.E.2d at 289. In that case, the City\u2019s map purported to show \u201cExisting Land Use and Proposed Annexation Areas\u201d, but it actually demonstrated only proposed uses. In deciding the map was insufficient, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">\u201cNeither the ordinance nor the attached map supplies the \u2018detailed information\u2019 required by the statute. The legend on the map does not pretend to show the existing uses of the area sought to be annexed, the subdivisions, industrial areas, farm areas, or vacant areas.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">In this case, it is true, as Radford argues in an effort to persuade us <em>Martinsville </em>does not control, there was no Martinsville-type affirmative erroneous effort made on the face of the map to depict <em>proposed </em>uses. Rather, the City endeavored, as demonstrated by the language of the original ordinance, <em>supra, </em>to show on the map <em>existing </em>uses of the area to be annexed. But the attempt was unsuccessful. The statute requires \u201cdetailed information\u201d' as to existing land use and permits the dimensions of the areas devoted to a particular use to be indicated \u201cgenerally.\u201d Note 1, <em>supra. </em>Radford\u2019s initial map fails to substantially comply with that criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The map shows on its face it was prepared by a consulting engineer and based on \u201cU.S. Geological Survey Mapping.\u201d There is no explanatory list of symbols, only words or abbreviations found beside some of the small dots, small squares, and other undefined marks appearing on the map. Most of the map is unmarked, except for contour lines. When unmarked, it cannot be assumed the land was \u201cvacant\u201d any more than it can be assumed the land was used as \u201cfarm area.\u201d Also, many of the markings which do appear are vague and indefinite. For example, in the area of Montgomery County sought, written on the map beside the dots and squares are words such as \u201cwater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>tank\u201d, \u201cgravel pit\u201d, \u201cRock Road Cem.\u201d, \u201cOld Brick Ch.\u201d, and \u201cTrailer Park.\u201d Even if we assume such designations are sufficient to connote the use to which the land in that specific location was put, they are inadequate to describe \u201cgenerally\u201d the dimensions of.the area devoted to such uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Moreover, the names of various individuals are shown within outlined areas, presumably to indicate the owners of parcels of real estate. Yet, one must speculate upon the use to which the respective owners were putting the land. This is illustrated by the designation of one such parcel as \u201cH. W. Huff Farm\u201d; the record shows this was not a farm area at all, but a residential subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Additionally, in the area of Pulaski County sought, the only reference to use is \u201cSt. Albans Hospital.\u201d But an examination of the map fails to reveal the area in which hospital activities were conducted; the record shows there were residential and agricultural uses in that same area.</p>\n<p id=\"AWZ\">We now address the reason for our rejection of the City\u2019s alternative contention. The City, by its July \u201cTender and Motion\u201d, made an attempt, under the guise of correcting a procedural defect, to cure a flaw in the annexation ordinance itself. But \u00a7 15.1-1046, note 2 <em>supra, </em>relied on by the City, only authorizes the trial court to permit amendment because of a defect, imperfection or omission in the notice, pleadings or trial. <em>Portsmouth </em>v. <em>County of Norfolk, </em>198 Va. 247, 252, 93 S.E.2d 296, 301 (1956). Radford\u2019s map deficiency, however, was not in the notice, pleadings or trial, but in the annexation ordinance, a legislative act of the City Council. And the annexation statutes do not expressly provide for amendment of such ordinance after the suit is filed. Consequently, this being a purely statutory proceeding, the trial court lacked the authority under \u00a7 15.1-1046 to permit the City to effect indirectly by amendment of pleadings that which its Council was not empowered to accomplish directly by legislative action. <em>See Martinsville, supra, </em>204 Va. at 762, 133 S.E.2d at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">For these reasons, the judgment of the trial court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-6\"> \u201c\u00a7 15.1-1033.
