Holland was a passenger in the right front seat of an automobile being driven by her husband, defendant-appellant Daniel Holland, when it was in collision with one being operated by Adolphus Croson. Plaintiff sued her husband and Croson alleging their joint negligence caused her to sustain bodily injuries and other damages. A jury found for plaintiff against her husband, but in favor of Croson, and assessed the damages at $2,000. The husband moved to set aside the verdict on the ground plaintiffs own testimony absolved him of negligence. The trial court overruled the motion, and judgment was entered on the verdict. We granted the husband a writ of error to the January 30,1976 final order. Croson is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">The collision occurred about 6:20 p.m. on Airline Boulevard, a four-lane, east-west street with two travel lanes running in each direction. Both vehicles were being driven east, at speeds not revealed by the testimony, in a 35 mile-per-hour zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">The statements of the parties as to the facts of the accident were in direct conflict. The evidence offered by plaintiff and her husband showed the Holland vehicle was being operated in the left eastbound lane when Croson, suddenly and without warning, drove his automobile from the right eastbound lane into the left lane in front of the Holland car, causing the right front fender and right side of the Holland vehicle to collide with the \u201cleft rear side and bumper\u201d of Croson\u2019s vehicle. Croson\u2019s evidence on the other hand, showed that immediately before the accident, he was traveling in the left eastbound lane preparing to make a left turn. He stated he actuated his left-turn signal and that, while stopped in the left lane, his vehicle was struck on the left rear side by Holland\u2019s following vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">During plaintiff\u2019s full description of the accident, she testified \u201ca car from our right side just cut right in front of [our] car.\u201d To the question: \u201cMrs. Holland, as I understand it, this accident occurred when this other car swerved in front of you; is that right?\u201d, plaintiff answered \u201cYes, sir.\u201d These statements were characteristic of her whole account of the incident. In addition, to the questions: \u201cYour husband wasn\u2019t driving poorly, was he?\u201d and \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything wrong, did he?\u201d, plaintiff answered \u201cNo, sir.\u201d Plaintiff further testified she was looking \u201cstraight ahead\u201d at the time. She denied her attention was distracted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>anything within or outside the vehicle, or by any conduct of her infant daughter who was sitting on her lap.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">We must determine if plaintiff may rely on Groson\u2019s evidence to sustain her ease, and to create a jury issue as to the husband\u2019s negligence, or whether her own testimony, which exonerated the husband of negligence, is binding upon her and bars her recovery as a matter of law. We think she is precluded by her own testimony, under the <em>Massie-Firmstone </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">Here, there is clear and unequivocal testimony from the plaintiff that, through no fault of her husband\u2019s, the vehicle in which she was riding was struck by a car which suddenly cut in front of it from the right lane. Fair-minded men could not reasonably infer from this positive testimony that plaintiff\u2019s husband was negligent. To the contrary, plaintiff\u2019s factual account of the events, acquired from her front-seat vantage point, absolves the husband of any wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">Plaintiff contends her statements are non-binding opinions. But we have more than mere opinion that the husband \u201cwasn\u2019t driving poorly\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything wrong\u201d, which would be insufficient, standing alone, to- block plaintiffs claim. <em>See Yates </em>v. <em>Potts, </em>210 Va. 636, 639, 172 S.E.2d 784, 786-87 (1970); <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Bulluck, </em>208 Va. 551, 553-54, 159 S.E.2d 820, 823 (1968). Rather, plaintiff\u2019s testimony that Croson \u201cjust cut right in front of\u201d and \u201cswerved in front of\u201d Holland are recitals of facts within her knowledge which are certain and unambiguous. Thus, she will not be heard to contend those statements are untrue by attempting to rely on Croson\u2019s evidence which is in irreconcilable conflict with hers. <em>See Harris </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>211 Va. 459, 462, 177 S.E.2d 534, 536 (1970). Accordingly, the plaintiff is bound by her testimony and the trial court erred in ruling to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">For these reasons, the judgment appealed from will be reversed, the verdict will be set aside and final judgment will be entered here in favor of the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1026-21\"> 134 Va. 450, 114 S.E. 652 (1922).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
