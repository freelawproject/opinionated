Upon arraignment, he moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that he had been indicted under the wrong statute and was liable to prosecution only for a misdemeanor under Code \u00a7 18.1-290. On June 7,1974, after a hearing, the defendant was convicted of felonious escape, and he was subsequently sentenced to a term of one year in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-24\">The record shows that on January 12,1974, the defendant was arrested in the City of Hampton on a charge of larceny from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>the person.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was transported to the Hampton Police Department, where he was processed and placed in the lockup in the custody of the desk sergeant. Approximately one and one-half hours later, it was discovered that the defendant had escaped.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Code \u00a7 53-291, under which the defendant was indicted and convicted, was worded,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for an inmate in a penal institution as defined in \u00a7 53-9 ... to do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">U</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">\u201c(2) To escape from such penal institution ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">\n<em>a</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">\u201cFor [this] offense ... the inmate shall be guilty of a felony and he shall be punished by confinement in the penitentiary not less than one nor more than five years . . ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">Code \u00a7 53-9, referred to in \u00a7 53-291, was worded,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-12\">\u201cThe term ... <em>\u2018penal </em>institution\u2019 as used in this title means and includes every ... lockup .. . owned, maintained or operated by any political subdivision of the Commonwealth ....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">Code \u00a7 18.1-290 (now \u00a7 18.2-479), under which the defendant says he should have been charged and tried, was worded, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-14\">\u201cIf any person lawfully ... in the custody ... of any law enforcement officer on a charge or conviction of a criminal offense escape ... he shall be confined in jail not exceeding six months, or be fined not exceeding five hundred dollars, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-15\">Thus, when the defendant escaped, he was liable under the felony statute, \u00a7 53-291(2), because he was an inmate in a \u201cpenal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>institution,\u201d <em>viz., </em>the lockup maintained by the City of Hampton. He was also liable under the misdemeanor statute, \u00a7 18.1-290, because he was lawfully in the custody of a law enforcement officer on a charge of a criminal offense. The question we must decide is whether the defendant should have been prosecuted only for a misdemeanor under \u00a7 18.1-290.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The defendant contends that \u201cit is the character or nature of the confinement which determines\u201d whether an escapee should be prosecuted under the misdemeanor statute or the felony statute; the \u201ckey\u201d is whether at the time of the escape, the prisoner has been \u201cassigned to the direct custody of the State Penitentiary system.\u201d The defendant points out that the felony statute, \u00a7 53-291, is entitled \u201cFelonies by convicts in general\u201d and is part of Title 53, Chapter 12, which chapter is entitled \u201cCrimes by Convicts.\u201d He then argues that because, when he escaped, he had been only processed on a criminal offense and not convicted, he was not a \u201cconvict\u201d within the contemplation of \u00a7 53-291 and had not been \u201cassigned to the direct custody of the State Penitentiary system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">We disagree with the defendant\u2019s argument. In the first place, use of the word \u201cconvict\u201d in the titles of the chapter and Code section in question is not controlling; the summary title is not part, and does not determine the meaning, of the body of a statute. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 143, 146, 207 S.E.2d 833, 836 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Furthermore, nothing in the misdemeanor statute indicates it establishes the exclusive offense for persons who escape before conviction or assignment to the penitentiary system, and nothing in the felony statute indicates it is applicable only to those who escape after conviction and assignment to the penitentiary system. As we have already demonstrated, \u00a7 53-291 clearly includes within its terms the escape offense involved here: while held for prosecution, the defendant was an inmate in a penal institution within the contemplation of \u00a7 53-291, and when he escaped, he violated that section. <em>See Kelly </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>353 F. Supp. 1050 (W.D. Va. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">In our opinion, it is a matter of prosecutorial election whether the Commonwealth proceeds under the misdemeanor statute or the felony statute against an accused in the defendant\u2019s situation. <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>192 Va. 665, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>669, 66 S.E.2d 605, 607 (1951). Conviction, of course, under one of the statutes bars prosecution under the other. Code \u00a7 19.1-259 (now \u00a7 19.2-294). In this case, for some reason undisclosed by the record, the Commonwealth chose to press the more serious charge; but we cannot gainsay its right to make that election.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-16\"> The defendant subsequently received a three-year penitentiary sentence on the larceny charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b474-17\"> Section 53-291 was amended and reenacted at the 1975 session of the General Assembly. Acts 1975, c. 588.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b474-18\"> Section 53-9, in effect at the time of the defendant\u2019s escape and trial, was repealed by Acts 1974, cc. 44, 45. The same definition of \u201cpenal institution\u201d is now contained in \u00a7 53-19.18, and present \u00a7 53-291 refers to that Code section.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
