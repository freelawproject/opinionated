Scott was convicted of this \u201cshoplifting\u201d charge following a bench trial and sentenced to confinement in the penitentiary for a term of one year and six months. The indictment alleged and the Commonwealth proved defendant had been convicted in April 1974 and June 1975 of unlawful concealment for violations of a Portsmouth city ordinance, the provisions of which were essentially identical to Code \u00a7 18.1-126.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The issue is whether, in sentencing defendant under the provisions of \u00a7 18.1-126.1(b) which permit confinement in the penitentiary for violation of \u00a7 18.1-126 if defendant had been before twice \u201cconvicted in the Commonwealth of Virginia for the like offense\u201d, the trial court erred in considering the two prior city ordinance convictions. We conclude there was no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Relying on <em>McKay </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>137 Va. 826, 120 S.E. 138 (1923), defendant contends the two city misdemeanor convictions should not have been counted to support this penitentiary sentence because, she says, convictions under a city ordinance for unlawful concealment, even though the substantive provisions of the city and state enactments are similar, do not constitute \u201clike offenses\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 18.1-126.1(b). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Defendant argues the phrase \u201clike offenses\u201d refers only to convictions stemming from state charges under Code \u00a7 18.1-126. She contends the language of \u00a7 18.1-126.1(a) that \u201c[a]ny person convicted for the first time of an offense under \u00a7 18.1-126, when the value of the goods or merchandise involved in the offense is less than one hundred dollars, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor ..means the first time one is tried under \u00a7 18.1-126 and convicted of its violation, as here, a first offense is committed and the defendant must be punished as a first offender under subsection (a) and cannot properly be punished as a third offender under subsection (b). She contends \u201cno matter how many times the defendant is tried . .. under the city ordinance, there could never be a felony conviction\u201d under the state statute. Conceding the language may also be interpreted to mean, as the Commonwealth argues, that the prior city convictions may properly be considered in fixing this punishment, defendant argues, nonetheless, that this penal statute is so ambiguous as to leave reasonable doubt of its meaning and, accordingly, the court should refuse to impose the penalty. We do not agree with defendant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We find the language of the statute unambiguous and the meaning clear.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An objective reading of subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 18.1-126.1 demonstrates the General Assembly, in plain terms, has designed a system of enhanced punishment for those who repeatedly commit the \u201cshoplifting\u201d offenses defined in \u00a7 18.1-126, whether the prior conviction resulted from charges under a comparable local ordinance or under the state statute. Subsection (a), on the one hand, establishes the punishment for a first offender charged under \u00a7 18.1-126, when the value of the goods or merchandise is below one hundred dollars. Subsection (b), on the other hand, deals with repeaters, when the foregoing value is involved. Under (b), a second offender is punished as a misdemeanant and a third or subsequent offender is punished as a felon, if such defendant \u201chas been before convicted in the Commonwealth of Virginia for the like offense.\u201d There is no express or implied limitation in this clause preventing consideration of convictions for \u201clike offenses\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>are based on comparable local ordinances. Indeed, the only-restriction in the challenged provision is geographical, that is, the conviction must have occurred in \u201cthe Commonwealth of Virginia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Provisions of the type under attack are not unique. For example, Code \u00a7 19.2-297 provides enhanced punishment if, upon conviction of petit larceny, a defendant \u201chas been before sentenced in the United States for the like offense. ...\u201d If the General Assembly had intended to limit the prior convictions to those resulting from violations of the state statute it could have easily so provided; it did not and we refuse to place a restriction in the statute where none exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>McKay </em>is misplaced. McKay was convicted in the Circuit Court of Augusta County of a second offense under the state prohibition law and sentenced to a term in the penitentiary. He had been earlier convicted of a similar offense under a Roanoke city prohibition ordinance. Section 4 of the state statute provided that any person violating \u201csections three and three-a of this act . . . shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor for the first offense, and of a felony for any subsequent offense committed after the first conviction.. ..\u201d 137 Va. at 828-29, 120 S.E. at 138-39. The sole issue was: What constituted a \u201cfirst conviction\u201d under the state prohibition law? We decided that those words and \u201csubsequent offense\u201d were not intended to include a \u201cconviction\u201d under, or \u201coffense\u201d against, a city ordinance. We said \u201c[t]he language embodied and expressed in the statute, fairly interpreted, disclose[d] no such intention and purpose on the part of the legislature.\u201d 137 Va. at 831, 120 S.E. at 139. Indeed, there, by the very terms of the statute, consideration of prior convictions was limited to violations of the state law. <em>See Faulkner </em>v. <em>Town of South </em>Boston, 141 Va. 517, 523, 127 S.E. 380, 381-82 (1925). As we have said, no such limitation appears in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">We likewise reject defendant\u2019s complaint that the evidence was not sufficient to convict. The finding of guilt was based on eyewitness testimony, which amply supported the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-17\"> The pertinent statutes (now, with slight modifications, \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-103 and 18.2-104) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-18\">\u201c\u00a7 18.1-126.
