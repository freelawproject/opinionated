Code \u00a7 58-151.041 requires that taxable income, excluding certain classes, of such a corporation be apportioned to Virginia by a formula which includes a property factor, a payroll factor and a sales factor. These factors represent elements of the Virginia operation as a percentage of the total operations of the corporation. The three percentages are averaged and the result is applied to the total net taxable corporate income to yield the income subject to taxation by Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">If any corporation believes that the statutory method of allocation or apportionment has operated or will operate to subject it to taxation on a greater portion of its Virginia taxable income \u201cthan is reasonably attributable to business or sources within this State,\u201d it may apply to the State Department of Taxation under Code \u00a7 58-151.051 for approval to use an alternative method of allocation or apportionment. If the Department, upon such application, concludes the statutory method \u201cis in fact inapplicable or inequitable\u201d, the Department must redetermine the taxable income by the alternative method of allocation or apportionment \u201cas seems best calculated to assign to [Virginia] for taxation the portion of the income reasonably attributable to business and sources within the State\u201d, not exceeding the amount determined by use of the statutory rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Lucky Stores, Inc., a California corporation authorized to transact business in Virginia, was not permitted by the State Department of Taxation to use a separate accounting method for its Virginia operation as an alternative to the statutory three-factor method in computing its Virginia corporate income tax for the fiscal years ending January 31, 1971 (hereinafter 1970) and January 30, 1972 (hereinafter 1971). Following payment under protest of the assessments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>based on the statutory formula, the taxpayer filed a petition for correction of erroneous tax assessment, Code \u00a7 58-1130, in December 1973 against the Commonwealth of Virginia, Department of Taxation, alleging the assessment and collection of the taxes were erroneous and illegal in that the use of the statutory method subjected the taxpayer to taxation on a greater portion of its income than was reasonably attributable to its Virginia activities. It further alleged the refusal of the Tax Department to permit the taxpayer to file its Virginia returns under the alternative method of allocation, i.e., separate or direct accounting, was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">After a hearing the trial court ruled, in the March 13, 1975 order appealed from, that the \u201cevidence before the court is clear that the denial of the alternative method did result in a tax on income not attributable to the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the court having concluded that such tax was a tax upon business income not attributable to business or sources within this state, such denial was unreasonable and arbitrary and the Petitioner is permitted to file its tax returns for the fiscal years [in question] by the alternative method.\u201d Accordingly, the taxpayer was exonerated from the payment of the assessed amounts and refunds were ordered which, including interest, totalled $39,084. We granted the Commonwealth a writ of error. Code \u00a7 58-1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The controversy centers around whether the taxpayer\u2019s operation in Virginia was part of a nationwide unitary business or whether the Virginia business activity was separate so that its profits and losses could be segregated for purposes of income taxation. This requires a close examination of the facts, about which there is no substantial dispute, including Lucky\u2019s method of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The record shows that during the period in question the taxpayer, whose corporate headquarters was in California, operated approximately 400 stores of various types throughout the United States with total corporate income reported for federal income tax purposes in 1971 of approximately $371 million. Two department stores were located in Virginia carrying the name \u201cMEMCO\u201d, one in Annandale which opened in August of 1970 and the other in the City of Fair-fax which opened in November of 1970. Lucky operated supermarkets, discount centers and other department stores nationwide. Milk and meat processing plants, and bakeries, were operated in California and the midwest region. Three stores and a warehouse were operated in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Administratively, Lucky\u2019s nationwide operation was divided into three regions: northern California, southern California, and a midwest region located in Illinois. The Virginia and Maryland stores were the general responsibility of a division manager located in the southern California region, who also supervised 28 stores in California. Direct supervision of the Virginia stores was by a local director of operations, one of 26 corporate employees who moved to the Virginia area from the California home office in February 1970 after Lucky decided in 1968 to enter Virginia. To supplement the home office staff, additional employees were recruited locally to operate the Virginia stores. The local director of operations remained in Virginia for two and one-half years \u201cdeveloping a new area\u201d and at the time of trial was one of Lucky\u2019s nationwide directors of operations, again residing in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Both Virginia stores operated a supermarket and sold hardware, paint, giftware, cosmetics, health and beauty aids, toys, major and small appliances, wearing apparel and jewelry. They each had a pharmacy and a snack bar. The Fairfax store had a gasoline station and sold tires, batteries and automobile accessories. Dry cleaning, watch repairing and selling of shoes was conducted in concession departments of the stores. These concessions were staffed by nonMEMCO employees and Lucky merely occupied a landlord-tenant relationship with the concessionaires except that Lucky \u201cdemanded of them that they would pursue the policies that [Lucky] had laid down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Lucky\u2019s merchandising concept sought to produce a \u201cone-stop shopping center . . . within one roof\u201d. The physical properties and the personnel structure were both organized to yield an \u201cautonomous\u201d and \u201cself-sustaining unit\u201d. Routine daily decisions were made at the local level. Food was purchased locally from a wholesale cooperative located in Virginia and \u201cstore-door vendors\u201d, which sold bread and beverages. No food supplies were bought in Virginia from Lucky or its affiliates. Major appliances, hardware, paint, and patio materials were purchased from local vendors. The appliances were lodged in Lucky\u2019s Maryland warehouse for distribution to the Virginia and Maryland stores. Pricing of the merchandise, except apparel, was done locally. Milk, meat and bakery goods manufactured by Lucky were not used in the Virginia stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Apparel sold in Virginia was purchased and priced in New York City by a staff of Lucky\u2019s buyers, who served the company nation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>wide. The apparel was shipped to Virginia where it comprised from ten to twenty percent of Lucky\u2019s gross Virginia sales during the period in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Invoices for all local purchases of goods sold in Virginia were forwarded to California for accounting and for payment. Sales records were kept locally and transmitted to California. Profits from the Virginia stores went to the corporate treasury in California and expenses which exceeded profits in Virginia were paid by Lucky from California. Daily payroll records were kept locally, but compensation was set in California and payment of Virginia employees was controlled by the corporate headquarters. Lucky did not advertise nationally but artwork for the local advertising was done in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Lucky\u2019s controller testified the separate, or direct, accounting method which Lucky utilized accounted for each of its stores \u201cindividually as a separate profit center\u201d in order to \u201carrive at the total operating results of a particular store or group of stores.\u201d Lucky initially filed its 1970 corporate income tax return on the separate accounting basis showing a net loss of $240,455 for its Virginia operations as compared with a net profit of $248,722 computed under the statutory three-factor method. For 1971 Lucky also prepared its return using the separate accounting method showing a net income subject to Virginia taxation of $135,869 as compared with a net income of $496,076 computed according to the statutory method.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">At trial Lucky submitted a schedule of direct and allocated items from the profit and loss statements of the Virginia stores using the separate accounting method. This schedule showed that all items of income and expense were directly attributable to the Virginia stores, except General and Administrative Expenses amounting to $169,734 in 1970 and $376,161 in 1971 which were allocated to Lucky\u2019s Virginia activities on the basis of gross sales. Lucky\u2019s controller described this item:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">\u201cThe general and administrative expenses are those that are incurred elsewhere than in a store, and those expenses are essentially the costs of operating the central office and the other administrative types of costs that are incurred in the various regions and in the corporate office. They are allocated to the stores in proportion to the sales of the stores. They are uniformly allocated throughout the company on that same basis without any regard to what the resulting amount is that gets charged to a store.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>A number of items in the schedule of direct and allocated items contained computations which differed from those in a similar schedule for 1970 submitted to the State Tax Commissioner almost two years prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">During his testimony, the Commissioner explained that in administering requests for use of an alternative method of apportionment suggested by a taxpayer, the State Tax Department, proceeding under Code \u00a7 58-151.051 to ascertain whether the statutory method is \u201cin fact inapplicable or inequitable\u201d, had an established policy it followed in making such determination. Such policy was in force during 1970 and had been explained in a Department Corporate Income Tax Circular published December 15, 1971, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">\u201cA request for permission to use an alternative method of allocation and apportionment shall be accompanied by data sufficient to show either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">\u201c(1) That the statutory method is in fact inapplicable because it produces an unconstitutional result under the particular facts and circumstances of the taxpayer\u2019s situation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">\u201c(2) That the statutory method is in fact inequitable because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">\u201c(a) It results in double taxation of the income, or a class of income, of the taxpayer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">\u201c(b) The inequity is attributable to Virginia, rather than to the fact that some other state has a unique method of allocation and apportionment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">The Commissioner stated that, applying the foregoing criteria to these facts, he decided the statutory three-factor method was not inapplicable or inequitable in this case. One important factor to be considered, the Commissioner testified, was that Lucky operated a unitary business, which he defined as one involving mutual dependency between the parent and the local operation, having the same management in the same type business. He testified that use of the statutory formula did not produce an unconstitutional result \u201cbecause we were not pulling in income that some other state could tax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Am_L\">The Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses criticized Lucky\u2019s allocations for general and administrative expenses, stating they were arbitrary, inaccurate, and without sufficient documentation. A certified public accountant, who was a Tax Department employee charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>examining returns of multistate corporations, testified for the Commonwealth that he could not say from an accounting standpoint that Lucky\u2019s effort represented an accurate separate accounting method.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">At the threshold, it is important to focus upon the rules of decision applicable in the trial court in a case such as this in which a petition for correction of erroneous tax assessment is filed under Code \u00a7 58-1130 alleging misapplication of Code \u00a7 58-151.051. The proceeding, of course, attacks the administrative decision of the State Tax Commissioner, who is the officer duly authorized by law to administer the tax laws of the Commonwealth. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 58-33. Under these circumstances, the taxpayer is confronted with a presumption of validity attached to the decision of the administrator and the burden is on the taxpayer to prove that the assessment is contrary to law or that the administrator has abused his discretion and acted in an arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable manner. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corp., 202 </em>Va. 13, 18, 116 S.E.2d 44, 47-48 (1960); <em>Union Tanning Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>123 Va. 610, 632-33, 96 S.E. 780, 786-87 (1918). The evidence must be sufficiently strong to \u201csatisfy\u201d the trial court that the taxpayer was erroneously assessed. Code \u00a7 58-1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">We must also place the statutory scheme in proper perspective. The corporate income taxpayer under Code \u00a7 58-151.051 (\u00a7 58-132 during 1970 and 1971) has no absolute <em>right </em>to use an-alternative method of allocation and apportionment. The statute mandates use of the three-factor formula method, Code \u00a7 58-151.041 (\u00a7 58-131.8 during 1970 and 1971) and use of that method is the rule and, as the name implies, use of an alternative method is the exception. Moreover, an alternative method may be used <em>only </em>if in the exercise of a sound discretion the Tax Commissioner concludes that the three-factor formula \u201cis in fact inapplicable or inequitable\u201d. The Commissioner, in Corporate Income Tax Circular No. 1, <em>supra, </em>has interpreted the foregoing statutory language to mean that the three-factor formula method is in fact \u201cinapplicable\u201d if it produces \u201can unconstitutional result\u201d and is in fact \u201cinequitable\u201d if it \u201cresults in double taxation of the income\u201d of the taxpayer and \u201cthe inequity is attributable to Virginia\u201d rather than to another \u201cunique\u201d method used in some other state.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">So we turn to the merits of this controversy against the foregoing background. We must determine the basic questions whether the Commissioner has misapplied the law and whether he has abused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>his discretion or acted unreasonably, arbitrarily or capriciously. Intertwined with these questions is the decision whether Lucky\u2019s Virginia activities are part of a unitary business.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">We hold that the operation of Lucky in Virginia was part of a unitary business. The importance of such a determination is that use of a separate accounting method is incompatible with proper, accurate and efficient taxation of a multistate corporation conducting a unitary business. <em>Western Auto Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>245 Minn. 346, 359, 71 N.W.2d 797, 806 (1955).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">\u201cA multi-state business is unitary when the operations conducted in one state benefit and are benefited by the operations conducted in another state or states. The essential test to be applied is whether or not the operation of the portion of the business within the state is dependent upon or contributory to the operation of the business outside the state. If there is such relationship, the business is unitary. Stated another way, the test is whether a business\u2019 various parts are interdependent and of mutual benefit so as to form one business rather than several business entities and not whether the operating experience of the parts is the same in all places. Various portions of a business may be carried on exclusively in different states without destroying its unitary character if the integral parts are of mutual benefit to one another.\u201d <em>Crawford Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>State Commission of Revenue and </em>Taxation, 180 Kan. 352, 359, 304 P.2d 504, 510-11 (1956) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The undisputed facts in this case demonstrate that Lucky\u2019s operation within Virginia in 1970 and 1971 was \u201cdependent upon\u201d and was \u201ccontributory to\u201d the operation of Lucky outside Virginia. There was unity of ownership and management, with local decisions on routine matters, of necessity, being made in Virginia remote from corporate headquarters in California. The \u201cnew area\u201d in Virginia was established by a team of trained personnel sent from corporate headquarters led by an executive who remained on the local scene several years and then returned to the home office. Apparel sold in Virginia, which constituted as much as twenty percent of Lucky\u2019s gross Virginia sales, was purchased and priced by a central corporate staff based in New York. Payment for local purchases of goods sold was made from California. Wages of local personnel were paid from California. Daily sales records kept locally were transmitted to the West Coast. Local profits became corporate profits and local losses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>were underwritten by the parent. It is true, as Lucky argues, that many portions of its business were carried out locally as a part of its concept of autonomous merchandising and that many profit producing activities were shown to be directly attributable to Virginia. Nevertheless, Virginia\u2019s operation was an integral part of the business activity of the corporation, these parts being of mutual benefit to one another and mutually dependent on each other. <em>See Butler Brothers </em>v. <em>McColgan, </em>315 U.S. 501 (1942); <em>Bass, Ratcliff &amp; Gretton, Ltd. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commission, 266 </em>U.S. 271 (1924); <em>Underwood Typewriter Co. </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>254 U.S. 113 (1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">As we now examine the Commissioner\u2019s exercise of his discretion and his application of the law, the questions concern the alleged unconstitutional application of the statutory formula to Lucky. Lucky does not contend that double taxation has resulted. Lucky\u2019s argument presents the issue: Does use of the three-factor formula method produce a tax on income not reasonably attributable to business in Virginia? Stated another way, does the evidence show Virginia has \u201creached out\u201d and taxed Lucky\u2019s income earned elsewhere? The answer to both questions is in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The main thrust of Lucky\u2019s effort to demonstrate that use of the statutory formula produced a tax on income not reasonably attributable to business in Virginia was the attempt to show that Virginia\u2019s share of Lucky\u2019s taxable income under the statutory formula exceeded that resulting from separate accounting. Such a showing is insufficient to prove Virginia has \u201creached out\u201d to tax income earned elsewhere. Moreover, the allocation by Lucky of general and administrative costs to Virginia under its separate accounting was a major factor in the resulting disparity between the dollar amount of income produced by the two methods. But no attempt was made by Lucky to dissect the components of this item and to determine more precisely the actual cost to Lucky of each item and the amount of such cost reasonably attributable to the Virginia activity. Such procedure was an effort to assign arbitrarily a large expense item to the Virginia operation without relating it to the actual cost incurred in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In determining the constitutional validity of the statutory taxing formula, we must compare the percentage of total taxable income produced by the formula in question with the percentage of total taxable income produced by the taxpayer\u2019s proposed method. Unless a gross disparity in percentages results, the statutory formula must be upheld. Of lesser constitutional significance is the comparison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>urged by Lucky, that is, the difference in dollar amounts between competing methods. That difference is a \u201cswing\u201d of $500,000 when the 1970 statutory net profit of about $250,000 is compared with the separate accounting net loss of about $250,000 and a \u201cswing\u201d of $264,131 when the 1971 statutory income of approximately $400,000 is compared with the separate accounting figure of $135,869.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Illustrative of the importance of percentage comparisons is <em>Butler Brothers, supra, </em>in which the United States Supreme Court reviewed a California statute imposing a franchise tax measured by net income. The Illinois taxpayer with its headquarters in Chicago was engaged in the wholesale merchandising business. It had wholesale distributing houses in seven states, including one in San Francisco. Each of its houses maintained stocks of goods, served a separate territory, had its own sales force, handled its own sales and all solicitations, credit and collection arrangements and kept its own books of account. All receipts from sales in California were credited to the San Francisco outlet. The taxpayer maintained a central buying division through which all goods for resale were ordered (the only material factual difference from the case at bar because here only apparel was purchased by a corporate staff). The taxing statute was a property, payroll and sales three-factor statute and by its application 8.137 percent, or $93,500, of a profit of $1,149,677 was allocated to California. The taxpayer, using separate accounting, claimed it had a loss of $83,000 attributable to its California activities after it allocated $100,091 of home office expense to the San Francisco house and emphasized that use of the statutory formula converted the loss to a gain, the difference being about $175,000. The taxpayer claimed the statutory method reached income earned outside California and was unconstitutional. The Court disagreed saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">\u201cOne who attacks a formula of apportionment carries a distinct burden of showing by \u2018clear and cogent evidence\u2019 that it results in extra-territorial values being taxed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">tF ip</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">\u201cIt is true that appellant\u2019s separate accounting system for its San Francisco branch attributed no net income to California. But we need not impeach the integrity of that accounting system to say that it does not prove appellant\u2019s assertion that extra-territorial values are being taxed. Accounting practices for income statements may vary considerably according to the problem at hand. Sanders, Hatfield <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>&amp; Moore, A Statement of Accounting Principles (1938), p. 26. A particular accounting system, though useful or necessary as a business aid, may not fit the different requirements when a State seeks to tax values created by business within its borders. [Citation omitted] That may be due to the fact, as stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis in <em>Underwood Typewriter Co. </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>254 U.S. 113, 121, that a State in attempting to place upon a business extending into several States \u2018its fair share of the burden of taxation\u2019 is \u2018faced with the impossibility of allocating specifically the profits earned by the processes conducted within its borders.\u2019 Furthermore, the particular system used may not reveal the facts basic to the State\u2019s determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">*.y. -y-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">\u201cAt least since <em>Adams Express Co. </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>165 U.S. 194, this Court has recognized that unity of use and management of a business which is scattered through several States may be considered when a State attempts to impose a tax on an apportionment basis. ...\u201d 315 U.S. at 507-08.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Under the evidence Lucky\u2019s Virginia taxable income for 1970 computed according to the statutory formula was .646 percent of Lucky\u2019s total taxable income for federal purposes; for 1971 it was less than 1.312 percent of such income. Lucky\u2019s computation produced a net loss for 1970 and a Virginia tax on approximately .36 percent of its total taxable income for 1971.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Therefore, in neither year did the statutory formula produce a difference of as much as one percent of Lucky\u2019s total income. We, therefore, conclude that the application of the statutory method in this case has not produced an unconstitutional result. <em>See generally Bass, Ratcliff &amp; Gretton, Ltd., supra; Underwood Typewriter Co., supra. Cf. Hans Rees\u2019 Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>283 U.S. 123 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">For these reasons we hold the Commissioner has not misapplied the law nor has he abused his discretion nor has he acted arbitrarily or capriciously in requiring Lucky to use the statutory three-factor method. Furthermore, and according the required weight to the construction of a statute by a state official charged with its administration, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Progressive Community Club, </em>215 Va. 732, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>739, 213 S.E.2d 759, 763 (1975), we find the interpretation stated in Corporate Tax Circular No. 1 to be reasonable and rational.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Consequently, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed, the petition for correction of erroneous tax assessment will be denied, and the proceeding dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b283-9\">This percentage is derived by dividing Lucky\u2019s 1971 total taxable income of $37,798,115 as reported on its federal income tax return into its separate accounting Virginia taxable income of $135,869.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
