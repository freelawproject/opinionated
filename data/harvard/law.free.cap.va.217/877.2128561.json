Barfield, Commissioner of the<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Revenue (hereinafter referred to collectively as the \u201cTax Department\u201d) and to recover the sum of $35,455.06, including interest, paid under protest. WTAR alleged <em>inter alia </em>that certain broadcasting \u201cequipment and parts and accessories thereto\u201d were exempt from such taxation by Code \u00a7 58-441.6(j), and that commercial advertising films were exempt by Code \u00a7 58-441.6(a). The trial court held, in a written opinion incorporated in its final order, that the items assessed by the Tax Department were not exempt under the statutes and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">The facts are not substantially in dispute. WTAR, pursuant to a. license granted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), operates a VHF television station and both AM and FM radio stations in the Tidewater area. From December 1, 1967 through January 1, 1973, WTAR did not remit sales taxes on certain production items classified under the categories of studio lighting equipment, video-tape equipment, raw film, news gathering equipment, and props. The Tax Department determined that all this equipment was taxable when not used directly in broadcasting, and prorated the sales taxes according to WTAR\u2019s percentage of exempt use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">During the time period in question, WTAR also produced commercial advertisements for its customers and broadcast them over its facilities. WTAR filed, as an exhibit, a copy of the bill to one of its customers showing a breakdown of the cost of preparation of an advertising film shown over its station. The bill listed separate charges for studio time, art work, dubs, and acting talent, rather than a lump sum due for the final product. WTAR\u2019s witnesses testified that the advertising films in question were usually retained by the studio and not delivered to the customers. However, the customer had the right to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>the advertising film if he chose to do so. The Tax Department determined that production of films by WTAR for commercial advertisements to be used over its station and elsewhere was a sale of tangible personal property and not exempt from the payment of sales taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\">The first of the two issues presented involves the interpretation of Code \u00a7 58-441.6(j) which exempts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-5\">\u201cBroadcasting equipment and parts and accessories thereto and towers used or to be used by commercial radio and television companies or concerns which are under the regulation and supervision of the Federal Communications Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">WTAR contends (1) that \u201cbroadcasting\u201d consists not only of the transmission of a signal over the air, but also of all processing, editing, and programming which goes into making up the signals, and (2) that regulation 1-88 promulgated by the State Tax Commissioner unduly restricts the language of the statute by making the exemption applicable only to tangible personal property used directly in \u201cbroadcasting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">On the other hand, the Tax Department contends (1) that \u201cbroadcasting equipment\u201d for \u00a7 58-441.6(j) purposes refers only to \u201cequipment and parts and accessories thereto and towers\u201d actually used in the transmission of the signal from its source forward through the transmitter into the air, and (2) that regulation 1-88 constitutes a permissible exercise of the rule making power expressly delegated to the Tax Commissioner by Code \u00a7 58-441.41, as amended. Thus, the questions presented on the first issue are whether \u201cbroadcasting equipment\u201d as used by the General Assembly in Code \u00a7 58-441.6(j) refers to \u201cprogramming\u201d as advocated by WTAR or to \u201ctransmitting\u201d as the Tax Department contends, and whether regulation 1-88 is an unwarranted extension of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">In determining the issues presented on this appeal, we follow our established rules of statutory construction. Virginia adheres to the rule of strict construction of tax exemptions. Taxation is the rule, not the exception. Therefore, tax statutes are strictly construed against the taxpayer. When a tax statute is susceptible to two constructions, one granting an exemption and the other denying it, the latter construction is adopted. <em>Winchester TV Cable Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>216 Va. 286, 289-90, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>217 S.E.2d 885, 889 (1975). This policy is specifically mandated by the Virginia Constitution, Article X, \u00a7 6(f), and in all cases involving the construction of Code \u00a7 58-441.6 since the adoption of our revised Constitution, we have followed the rule of strict construction. <em>E.G., Winchester TV, supra; Dept. Taxation </em>v. <em>Prog. Com. Club, </em>215 Va. 732, 734-36, 213 S.E.2d 759, 761-62 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">The Virginia Retail Sales and Use Tax Act, Title 58, c. 8.1, does not define the word \u201cbroadcasting\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 58-441.6(j). Thus, we must ascertain the legislative intent and give the word its proper meaning. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Community Motor Bus Co., </em>214 Va. 155, 157, 198 S.E.2d 619, 620 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">WTAR first argues that the reference to FCC regulation in Code \u00a7 58-441.6(j) controls the meaning of the word \u201cbroadcasting\u201d as it is used in that statute. Beginning with that premise, WTAR further argues that the chief concern of the FCC is with the quality of the station\u2019s programming. The argument continues that because the FCC is concerned with the quality of programming rather than with the mere emission of an electronic signal, \u201cprogramming\u201d for FCC purposes means \u201cbroadcasting\u201d for sales and use tax purposes. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">Basing this exemption only on the fact of FCC regulation would completely ignore the language in the first part of the statute. We specifically rejected an analogous argument by ruling in <em>Winchester TV </em>that the word \u201cbroadcasting,\u201d rather than FCC regulation, governs the applicability of \u00a7 58-441.6(j). 216 Va. at 290, n. 2, 217 S.E.2d at 889, n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-7\">WTAR next asserts that the clear import of our decision in <em>Winchester TV </em>is that \u201cbroadcasting\u201d encompasses all items of personal property which are necessary and essential to put a program on the air. Its reliance on <em>Winchester TV </em>is misplaced. That issue was not before us. There we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-8\">\u201cAt issue is applicability of the statutory exemption [to cable television operations] and not the extent to which it applies to specific items of property.\u201d 216 Va. at 287, 217 S.E.2d at 887.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-11\">The issue in <em>Winchester TV </em>was whether a community antenna television system (CATV) was \u201cbroadcasting\u201d for \u00a7 58-441.6(j) purposes. In holding that the CATV did not qualify for the \u00a7 58-441.6(j) exemption, we relied on the dictionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>definition of the verb \u201cbroadcast.\u201d According to the dictionary, \u201cbroadcasting\u201d means dissemination to \u201can <em>unlimited number </em>of receivers.\u201d 216 Va. at 290, 217 S.E.2d at 889. Because a CATV receives signals from other television stations, amplifies them and then sends them through wire only to its paying customers, we held that its activities did not qualify as \u201cbroadcasting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-4\">Even though WTAR\u2019s reliance on <em>Winchester TV </em>is misplaced, that case is instructive in deciding the issues in the present case. There, we specifically rejected the contention that \u201cprogramming equals broadcasting.\u201d 216 Va. at 288, 217 S.E.2d at 887-88. We also relied on an objective source to define the all-important word \u201cbroadcasting.\u201d As in <em>Winchester TV, </em>dictionary definitions illuminate the meaning of the word \u201cbroadcasting\u201d in this case. The noun \u201cbroadcast\u201d is defined as \u201cthe act of sending out sound or images by radio or television transmission ... for general reception.\u201d Likewise as a verb, \u201cbroadcast\u201d means \u201cto send out from a transmitting station for an unlimited number of receivers\u201d and \u201cto send out radio or television signals.\u201d Even more importantly, the adjective \u201cbroadcast\u201d means \u201ccast or scattered in all directions\u201d and \u201cmade public by means of radio or television.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">Thus, the accepted dictionary definition of \u201cbroadcasting\u201d and its related forms resolves the question whether \u201cbroadcasting\u201d means \u201cprogramming\u201d or \u201ctransmitting.\u201d. The definitions focus on the fact of \u201cdissemination\u201d or \u201cdistribution,\u201d not on what is being disseminated. \u201cBroadcasting\u201d thus means \u201ctransmitting.\u201d We also note other definitions of \u201cbroadcasting.\u201d The Federal Communications Act [FCA] defines \u201cbroadcasting\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-6\">\u201c[B]roadcasting means the dissemination of radio communication intended to be received by the public, directly or by the intermediary of relay stations.\u201d 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 153(o) (1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">Interestingly, the FCA definition is very similar to the dictionary one. The FCA definition focuses on the intent to disseminate directly to the public, not the preparation of program materials for such dissemination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\"><em>Teleprompter Corp. </em>v. <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>415 U.S. 394 (1974) and <em>Fortnightly Corp. </em>v. <em>United Artists, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>392 U.S. 390 (1968),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> relied upon by WTAR, involve suits against CATV systems for copyright infringements. They do not lend support to WTAR\u2019s contention that broadcasting means programming.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">WTAR also asserts that the Tax Department and the court below ignored the words \u201cparts and accessories thereto\u201d in interpreting the language of the statute. We do not agree. The language applies to parts and accessories of broadcasting equipment and towers used directly in the transmission of the signal from its source forward through the transmitter and into the air. <em>Winchester TV, </em>216 Va. at 290, 217 S.E.2d at 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">We hold that the broadcasting exemption applies only to broadcasting equipment and accessories thereto used directly in the act of disseminating a signal into the air, not to the equipment and accessories used to create the material which may be disseminated. This construction of the statute is not inconsistent with regulation 1-88 promulgated by the Tax Commissioner. Hence, the assessments made by the Tax Department on the items when used only in the production of programs, not in transmitting them, were not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">The second issue presented in whether WTAR\u2019s sales of commercial advertisements are excluded from Virginia\u2019s retail sales and use tax pursuant to Code \u00a7 58-441.6(a), which exempts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-7\">\u201cProfessional, insurance, or personal service transactions which involve sales as inconsequential elements for which no separate charges are made, [and] services rendered by repairmen for which a separate charge is made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1034-8\">WTAR contends that the commercials are the end product of their employees\u2019 personal and professional skills and that the films which were used to show the advertisements are inconse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>quential elements of the transaction with its customers. Thus, WTAR argues that the commercials are exempt from sales taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\">Code \u00a7 58-441.4 imposes a sales tax on every person who engages in the business of selling at retail or distributing tangible personal property, or who rents or furnishes any of the things or services taxable under the Virginia Retail Sales and Use Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">Of relevance here is Code \u00a7 58-441.2(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-6\">\u201c \u2018Sale\u2019 means any transfer of title or possession, or both, exchange, barter, lease or rental, conditional or otherwise, in any manner or by any means whatsoever, of tangible personal property....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">Since the sales tax is levied and imposed only on tangible personal property, the personal service exception in reality exempts from taxation personal property transferred as an inconsequential element of a personal service transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">We have not previously considered the issue of when a sale of tangible personal property is an inconsequential element of a personal service transaction. The test applied by a preponderance of the authorities from other jurisdictions with sales tax statutes similar to our Virginia statutes is: if the \u201ctrue object\u201d sought by the buyer is the services per se, the exemption is available, but if the true object of the buyer is to obtain the property produced by the service, the exemption is not available. <em>Federated Department Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kosydar, </em>45 Ohio St. 2d 1, 340 N.E.2d 840 (1976), and numerous other Ohio cases there cited. <em>Accord, Dist. of Columbia </em>v. <em>Norwood Studios, Inc., </em>118 App. D.C. 358, 336 F.2d 746 (1964); <em>Green </em>v. <em>Sgurovsky, </em>133 So. 2d 663 (Fla. App. 1961); <em>Cusick </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>260 Ky. 204, 84 S.W.2d 14 (1935). <em>Contra, Hawes </em>v. <em>Dimensions, Inc., </em>122 Ga. App. 190, 176 S.E.2d 602 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">Applying the \u201ctrue object\u201d test to this case, we believe that parties purchasing commercial advertisements from WTAR were more interested in the final product than in the service that produced it. To be sure, the customer obtained the technical expertise of the production personnel, but some service is involved in the production of every article that is sold. However, the primary object and concern of the advertisers was to obtain a finished film with its special alignment of molecules and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>chemicals which produce the images that advertise the customer\u2019s products when put on the air. Hence, we hold that the true object of the buyer of the advertisement was not the service <em>per se, </em>but the end product produced by the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">WTAR also argues that its advertising films were exempt because it made no separate charge for the film itself. The evidence showed that an invoice to a customer itemized the separate charges for studio time, art work, \u201cVTR\u201d dubs, and talent. However, we do not find this evidence is dispositive of the issue. As the Commonwealth pointed out in oral argument, a bill for an oil painting could be divided into amounts spent for brushes and studio rental, neither of which actually form a part of the completed picture. Yet, the manner of computing the invoice cannot alter the fact that without a suitable finished product the painting would have no commercial value. Likewise, in the case of WTAR\u2019s advertising films, the method of computing the bill cannot alter the fact that the buyer was primarily interested in the completed film to be shown on the station rather than in the services involved in producing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">WTAR\u2019s final argument is that Code \u00a7 58-441.4 could not apply to a production of advertising films if the films were never transferred to the customer. However, under the provisions of Code \u00a7 58-441.2(b), a sale means \u201cany transfer of title or possession, ... in any manner or by any means whatsoever, of tangible personal property.\u201d Hence, the showing of films over television was tantamount to a delivery of possession of tangible personal property to the buyer of the advertisement for which he paid a consideration, and WTAR furnished \u201cthe things or services\u201d taxable under Virginia\u2019s Retail Sales and Use Tax Act. Even though WTAR does not usually transfer physical custody of its advertising films, it furnished and transferred the films to its customers by putting the electronic signals on the air which produced the buyer\u2019s advertisements. Moreover, the advertising film was available to the buyer if he desired it. The product the customer was buying was the advertisement, not the service that produced it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the court below is</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1034-9\"> In <em>Fortnightly, </em>Mr. Justice Stewart, speaking for the Court, observed that \u201c[t]he television broadcaster in one sense does less than the exhibitor of a motion picture or stage play; he supplies his audience not with visible images <em>but only with electronic signals.\u201d </em>(emphasis added) 392 U.S. at 398. That observation lends support to the Tax Department\u2019s contention and the trial court\u2019s finding that the term \u201cbroadcasting\u201d encompasses only the process of transmitting electric signals, not the production of programs for transmission which is analogous to the stage production contrasted by the Court in <em>Fortnightly.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
