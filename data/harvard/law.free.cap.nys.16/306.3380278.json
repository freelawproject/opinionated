(2) That on the 30th day of April, 1890, the plaintiffs, at the defendant\u2019s request and upon its promise to repay the same, paid the wages of five men, amounting to $24.85, for services rendered in setting in place certain of the defendant\u2019s steam-pipes and connections at said station, and that there became due from the defendant on account thereof the said Sum of $24.85. (3) That at divers times between the 17th day of December, 1889, and the 17th day of June, 1890, the plaintiffs sold and delivered other goods and merchandise to the defendant, and performed other work and labor for it at its request, and in connection with its said business, and that the reasonable value and agreed upon price therefor amounted in the whole to the sum of $3,368.07, which amount became due from the defendant therefor. \u201d From an order sending the case to a referee defendant appeals.

The allegation in which this cause of action is found is so general and wanting in detail that the court is left to infer or spell out the fact that there may possibly be involved and in dispute on the trial many items of account. It has been distinctly held by the court of last resort that the moving party, to bring the case within the purview of the provision of the Code, must allege at least such a state of facts as will justify the legal inference that the trial will involve the examination of a long account. <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>McNaughton, </em>117 N. Y. 111, 22 N. E. Rep. 562. The affidavit of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, read in support of the motion, does not supply the omission suggested. It contains the opinion of the attorney that the trial will require the examination of a long account, but fails to give the facts upon which the same is based. The most that the plaintiffs have proved is that possibly the trial may develop that it is necessary to examine many items of account, but this is not sufficient to justify or support an order of compulsory reference. By the seventh and eighth paragraphs of the answer, the defendant admits the sale and delivery of all the goods and merchandise and work performed, set out in the third cause of action, and joins issue on one payment of $29.48, and the value or agreed price of the merchandise and labor constituting the plaintiffs\u2019 third cause of action. The mere statement of the issues made by the pleadings makes the inference quite probable that very few items will come in dispute on the trial. The counterclaim set up in the answer is for damages for alleged breach of contract, and in no sense involves an account such as is required to make the case referable, under section 1013 of the Code. The order appealed from must be reversed, and the motion denied, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
