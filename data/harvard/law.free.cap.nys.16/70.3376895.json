The right of the widow to prosecute an action to enforce her claim for dower should not be stayed by the subsequent commencement of a partition action, so that the enjoyment of her estate will be postponed until the heirs at law can settle their differences. The order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
