That such evidence is admissible was determined by the court of appeals in <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>Dobson, </em>78 N. Y. 75, which we followed; reference to that case being made \u2022in our opinion herein published in 14 N. Y. Supp. 925. Appellant\u2019s counsel does not undertake to distinguish the present case from that of <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>Dobson; </em>and the only ground for this application\u2014that the question herein determined by us is novel, and has not yet received the consideration of the .highest appellate court\u2014is therefore untenable. The motion should be denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
