The claimants appeal from orders granting allowances, in addition to costs, to the owner of the vessels, the prevailing party. The appeals were heard together. Affirmed.

The costs and allowances granted by that act were not set forth bodily in the statute. They were incorporated into it by reference to the Code of Procedure then in existence, and became a portion of the act as effectually as if they had been set forth in words. The subsequent repeal of the Code of Procedure did not affect the act of 1862. That stands as it did before. The allowances made were therefore proper, and are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-19\"> Laws 1862, c. 482, \u00a7 24, provides: \u201cJudgment for costs shall be rendered in favor of the successful party as in personal actions, and the successful party shall be entitled to recover the costs and allowances provided for in the Code of Procedure in civil actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
