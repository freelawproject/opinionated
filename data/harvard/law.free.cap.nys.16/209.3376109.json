In an action for rent under this lease, there was evidence that portions of the building had been totally wrecked by fire, and that the whole was uninhabitable until repaired. <em>Held, </em>it was a question for the jury whether there was an eviction, or whether the lessee was warranted in surrendering the premises.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-16\">\u2022Appeal from trial term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-17\">Action by the New York Real-Estate &amp; Building Improvement Company against Thornton H.

On the trial, the plaintiff conceded the affirmative to the defendant. A number of witnesses were called, including members of the fire department, who testified that portions of the building were a complete wreck, and it was also admitted by plaintiff, from the 4th day of January, 1890, until the premises in question were repaired, they were not in a fit condition to be inhabited to do business in. At the conclusion of defendant\u2019s testimony, plaintiff moved for a direction by the court, while defendant asked leave to go to the jury upon the ground that there was sufficient evidence upon the question of eviction; also upon the ground that there was sufficient evidence to warrant the defendant in asking the permission of the court to proceed with the trial, upon the testimony that the premises were so damaged as to warrant the defendant in surrendering possession of them, and in refusing to pay rent by reason of the result produced by the fire. The trial justice granted the motion for a direction in favor of the plaintiff, and denied the application of defendant for leave to go to the jury. To this defendant duly excepted. The trial justice erred. There was sufficient evidence to have submitted to the jury as to whether there was an eviction by ieason of the condition of the building, or whether the premises were in such a condition as to warrant the defendant in surrendering possession thereof. Without considering any of the other questions, we think, for the reasons above stated, the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
