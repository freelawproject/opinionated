The application was made on an affidavit setting forth that relator was the-secretary of the United States Cremation Company, Limited; that, pursuant to the by-laws of said company, a meeting of stockholders for the election of directors was held June 30,1891, at which the defendants were inspectors; that the relator held the proxies of certain stockholders, which proxies were in the usual form, except that they were to be used at a meeting to be held \u201cJune, 1891,\u201d and that defendants refused to receive them, or permit relator to vote thereon. An order to show cause why the inspectors should not be required to receive and count the votes represented by these proxies, and their certificate of election be amended, was granted, and upon the return-day thereof defendants appeared and submitted themselves to the direction of the court in the premises, the application being opposed by two of the directors of the company. A peremptory writ was granted, and defendants appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b154-10\">Argued before Van Brunt, P.

The only relief which could be afforded where the inspectors had acted improperly would be to order a new election in case justice requires such action. The proceeding for that purpose is prescribed by statute. The order appealed from should be reversed, with costs of appeal, and the proceedings dismissed, with $20 costs. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-13\"> Section 15 of chapter 563 of the Laws of 1890 provides as follows: \u201cThe supreme court shall, upon the application of any person or corporation aggrieved by or complaining of any election of any corporation, or any proceeding, act, or matter touching the same, upon notice thereof to the adverse party, or to those to be affected thereby, forthwith and in a summary way hear the affidavits, proofs, and allegations of the parties, or otherwise inquire into the matter or causes of complaint, and establish the election or order a new election, or make such order and give such relief as right and justice may require, and may in its discretion order issues to be made up in such manner and form as it may direct, to try the rights of the respective parties touching the matters complained of \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
