The next morning he returned to the saloon, and a witness testified that he poured something into a glass from a whisky bottle, which the witness paid for, though he did not see deceased drink it. He was killed in less than three hours from that time. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence warranted a verdict that his intoxication was produced by liquor sold him by defendant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-9\">Appeal from circuit court, Ulster county.

He was killed by a train of cars, about half past 8 in the morning of May 26th. The afternoon previous, about 5 o\u2019clock, he had been at defendant\u2019s saloon. There he drank lager-beer. There is some evidence that such lager-beer was intoxicating. The next morning, about half past 5 or 6 o\u2019clock, he was also at defendant\u2019s saloon. He poured out a drink from a bottle like a whisky bottle behind the bar, which Kemp, the witness, declined to take, because, as he said, he didn\u2019t wish to get drunk again. Kemp took a glass of beer, and paid for the drink which deceased took, although lie said that he did not see deceased drink it. The whole transaction is plain enough. The deceased is shown to have been drunk before 10 o\u2019clock the evening previous, as he came out of Ludwig\u2019s saloon, and to have been asleep on Ludwig\u2019s stoop about 5 o\u2019clock the morning of his death. No question is raised on the appeal except that the evidence was not sufficient for the jury. No alleged errors as to the admission of evidence are pointed out in the defendant\u2019s brief. We have given a brief outline of the evidence, and it seems to us that it would have been improper to grant a nonsuit. The jury were justified in their conclusion that the liquor drunk by the deceased at the defendant\u2019s saloon was in part the cause of his intoxication. That such intoxication was the cause of his death is not disputed. Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
