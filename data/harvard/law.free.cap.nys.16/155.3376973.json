Edmund H. Martine, an expert witness in behalf of the plaintiff, after stating the physical effects of the railway upon the premises, was asked: \u201cIn your opinion, based upon your experience, do you consider that these physical effects in any way affect the value of these premises?\u201d To this question the defendants objected on the grounds that it was incompetent, and that it called for the opinion of the witness on a matter which it is the exclusive province of the court to determine. The objection was overruled, the defendants excepted, and the witness answered, \u201cI dpi\u201d The plaintiff in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>quired, \u201cHow?\u201d The defendants objected upon the same grounds,, the injection was overruled, the defendants duly excepted, and the witness an swered, \u201cIt depreciates the value, both fee and rental. \u201d The plaintiff then asked: \u201cIn your opinion, based on your experience and knowledge of values, does it depreciate the fee and rental values, to what extent?\u201d The defendants objected on the same grounds, but the court overruled the objection, to-which the defendants -duly excepted, and the witness answered: \u201cIt would probably be worth thirty-three and a half per cent, more than it is to-day.\u201d Thereupon the defendants moved to strike out the answer, and to the denial-of the motion duly excepted. It is evident beyond the possibility of dispute-that the questions challenged by the defendants, called* for and elicited the opinion of the witness on the very issue before the court for judicial decision. That issue was whether, and how much, the railway depreciated the value of plaintiff\u2019s property; and, if there were such depreciation, that depreciation was the exact measure of plaintiff\u2019s injury. But the fact of the injury- and the amount of the injury were the precise issues which the nature of the action and the state of the pleadings propounded to the court for determination. \u201cThe amount of damages thus caused to the plaintiff\u2019s fee is the precise question which the court or jury must determine. * * * The precise and specific question which is to be determined by the court or jury is by this interrogatory placed before the witness for his opinion and decision. To permit it to be asked and answered is beyond all question against the great mass of authority in this and other states.\u201d <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>(N. Y. App.) 28 N. E. Rep. 486, (opinion by PECKHAM, J.) \u201cIt is the province of the jury to determine upon the facts spread before them in the evidence whether the plaintiff has suffered damages, and the amount of the compensation therefor. \u201d <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>121 N. Y. 31, 44, 24 N. E. Rep. 20. Again, the answer, \u201cIt would probably be worth 33J per cent, more than it is to-day,\u201d is, in effect, a statement of the opinion of the witness as to what would be the value of the property without the railway,\u2014evidence which, in Roberts\u2019 <em>Case </em>and <em>Doyle\u2019s Case, </em>28 N. E. Rep. 495, the court of appeals has just decided to be incompetent, and its admission sufficient ground for reversal. The refusal, therefore, to strike out the answer was error. We are of opinion that the trial court committed errors as well in the exclusion as in the admission of evidence, <em>e. g\u201e </em>in rejecting evidence of the course of values of adjacent properties, <em>(Doyle's Case,) </em>and evidence of benefits to plaintiff\u2019s property from the presence of the railway, <em>(Doyle\u2019s Case;) </em>but we forbear the discussion of these errors, since in any event another trial is inevitable. Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, costs to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
