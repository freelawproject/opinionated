The summons was published in the Evening Post and the Evening Sun on the same day, but was not published in the Law Journal until the following day,\u2014more than 30 days after the granting of the attachment. The first publication of the summons, as required by the order of publication, was not commenced within 30 days after the granting of the attachment, and the attachment therefore fell. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Troncoso, </em>76 N.
