In 1882 the defendant erected its dam. Chapter 406, Laws 1882, authorized defendant to erect a dam across the Hudson river at Mechanicsville, on its own land, \u201cin such a manner as not injuriously to affect the water privilege at Stillwater village as it now exists, or any water privilege now existing between the Stillwater village and lands of the Hudson River Water-Power and Paper Company. \u201d The distance between the two dams is 12,000 feet. Before defendant erected its dam, the difference in level between the surface water at the tail-race of plaintiffs\u2019 lowest mill and the surface of the water at the point where defendant afterwards erected its dam was 25.53 feet. The difference between the surface of the water at the tail-race of plaintiffs\u2019 lowest mill and the top of defendant\u2019s dam is 12.45 feet. The defendant\u2019s dam sets back the water above it for nearly 8,000 feet up stream. The defendant\u2019s dam is about 945 feet long. The water usually flows over its crest or spillway at depths varying from five inches to five feet; the depth, when the river is in its normal condition, being between one and two feet. The defendant\u2019s dam is about 16 feet high, measuring from the lowest part of the bottom of the river. The surface of the slack water at the head of the dam is about three feet higher than its surface near the crest of the dam. The surface of the slack water at the head of the dam is six feet lower than the floor of plaintiffs\u2019 tail-race, and the distance between the two points is about 4,000 feet; the river flowing through a channel obstructed by three islands and several reefs and many large boulder rocks. The testimony on the part of the plaintiffs tended to show that before the erection of defendant\u2019s dam the plaintiffs\u2019 mills were free from obstruction by back-water, and that since such erection they have been continually obstructed. The testimony on the part of defendant tended to show that it was impossible, in the nature of the ease, for the back-water of defendant\u2019s dam to reach the higher level of plaintiffs\u2019 tail-races. The trial court was satisfied that the obstruction, substantially as claimed by the plaintiffs, existed, but held that they had failed to show that it was caused by defendant\u2019s dam.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b691-3\">Argued before Learned, P.

The learned trial court, as we learn from the opinion, was satisfied that since the erection of the defendant\u2019s dam the plaintiffs\u2019 water privilege has been injuriously affected by back-water. The testimony in support of this contention is practically uncontradicted, and amply justifies the statement of the learned judge that \u201csince the erection of defendant\u2019s dam, in 1882 or 1883, there has been some increase in the depth of the water at plaintiffs\u2019 mills.\u201d This increase appears to have been constant, and its effect was to impair the efficiency of plaintiffs\u2019 water-power and mills. But the trial court found that the plaintiffs had not shown that this increased depth of water was caused by defendant\u2019s dam. Expert witnesses on the part of the defendant testified that it was an \u201chydraulic impossibility\u201d for it to be so caused. Expert witnesses on the part of the plaintiffs did not specifically testify to the contrary opinion. They testified that they discovered no other cause than the defendant\u2019s dam, and, in substance, that this case demonstrated itself, since the rise of the water followed the erection of the dam so closely as to be convincing that the dam was the cause. The conclusion of the trial court has the support of the testimony of defendant\u2019s experts, and we cannot demonstrate that it is erroneous. It is easy to assume certain propositions respecting the slack water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>in the defendant\u2019s dam acting as an obstruction to the flow of the water from above; as that the retardation of the flowing volume by the slack water at the point of impact causes the flowing volume to flow more slowly immediately above that point, and that the retarded current itself becomes at every point up the stream a new obstruction, retarding the flow above it; and that, this continuing to the plaintiffs\u2019 tail-race, would cause the obstruction there. Now, conceding that under certain conditions the phenomenon called the \u201cpiling\u201d of water in a flowing stream exists, the conditions which would produce such a result are not so definitely and clearly understood as to enable the judge or juror, in the absence of assistance from expert testimony, to decide correctly respecting its existence or non-existence in a case like this. It may be that the knowledge of the so-called \u201cexperts\u201d upon the subject cannot be greatly relied upon when they pass from theoretical propositions to their concrete application. Be this as it may, the burden rested upon the plaintiffs to prove their case, and that required them to show that the defendant\u2019s dam was the cause of the back-water at the tail-race of their mills. This they did not do, and hence the judgment must be affirmed. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Learned, P. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b692-6\">Mayham, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AyC\"><em>(concurring.) </em>I see no sufficient reason for granting a new trial in this case. The plaintiffs, to recover, must establish by proof that their rights have been injuriously affected by the construction of the defendant\u2019s dam. \u2022 This proposition the trial court held that they had failed to maintain. The only evidence on the part of the plaintiffs which is claimed to establish it is the fact that immediately after the construction of the defendant\u2019s dam the water rose at the plaintiffs\u2019 lower mill. The reason for this is not explained in the evidence. The undisputed evidence is that the difference between the height of the surface of the water at the tail-race of the plaintiffs\u2019 lower' mill and at the top of the defendant\u2019s dam was about 12J feet. The distance between the dams is about 12,000 feet, and defendant\u2019s dam is about 945 feet long, and the depth of the water as it passes over its. top varies from 5 inches to 5 feet. There is therefore a difference in height at the time of highest water of 7|- feet. There is a substantial agreement\"of all the witnesses as to the distance between the dams, and the fall from plaintiffs\u2019 to the defendant\u2019s in the river-bed; and no witness has undertaken to swear that water would pile up so as to rise above its common level sufficiently to overcome this 7J feet elevation of plaintiffs\u2019 tail-race above the top of the water at highest flood on defendant\u2019s dam. To hold that the water from the defendant\u2019s dam, upon these facts, could set back so as to interfere with the free flow of water at the tail-race of the plaintiffs\u2019 lower mill would seem to reverse all well-known principles governing hydraulics. If the physical facts upon which this case must turn could be changed by further testimony, then there might be some reason for granting a new trial. But the elevations at the different points have been ascertained, and there is no dispute about them. They cannot be altered on a new trial. The natural laws governing the flow of water are quite as unchangeable, and with these material and controlling factors in this case the same result must follow on a new trial as has already been reached by the trial court. It is true that no explanation has been furnished for the somewhat remarkable coincidence of the rise of the water at the tail-race of the plaintiffs\u2019 mill at the time of the erection of the defendant\u2019s dam, but, unless it is traceable to some natural cause connected with and arising out of the erection of the defendant\u2019s dam, we cannot assume, as against well-understood physical laws governing matter, that it was produced by water setting back from this dam. At all events, the burden is upon the plaintiffs to establish that proposition if true, which they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>have failed to do. There is no claim on this appeal that a new trial should be granted on the ground of the newly-discovered evidence. 1 think, therefore, that the judgment should be affirmed. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
