Bliss, </em>55 N. Y. 139. The only question, then, to be considered is whether the judgment sought to be recovered in this action would affect the title to, or the possession, use, or enjoyment of, real property. The action is brought manifestly to impress a lien upon real estate, and to have that lien foreclosed, and the real estate sold to satisfy the same. Such an action clearly affects the title to, or the possession, use, or enjoyment of, real estate. Under the guise of a demurrer to a complaint in such an action, a motion cannot be entertained to cancel a <em>Us pendens. </em>The right of the plaintiff to recover must be determined in a different manner. The order should be affirmed, with \u00a910 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-16\"> Code Civil Proc. N. Y. \u00a7 1670.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
