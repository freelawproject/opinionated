It follows that the order appealed from must be affirmed. After an attorney has appeared in an action, it may well be that a service upon him should be sufficient upon which to base proceedings for contempt against the client. But such change in the practice must be made by the legislature. Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
