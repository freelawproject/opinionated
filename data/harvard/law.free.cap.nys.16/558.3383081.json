Martin and Alvin 0. Eaton for an alleged nuisance in maintaining and using a barn on the lands -of the defendant Martin, occupied by the defendant Eaton, from which the defendants caused or permitted water used by the defendants in washing wagons on the premises to leak through manure heaps suffered to accumulate thereon, over and above the premises of the plaintiff, causing offensive and unwholesome odors upon her premises and in her dwelling; and in the complaint asked that the defendants be enjoined and restrained from continuing -such nuisance, and asked judgment for damages. The answer was in substance a denial, but admits the ownership and occupancy by the defendant of 'the premises as set forth in the complaint, and alleges that the barn therein \u00bfreferred to has been upon such premises for over fifty years. On the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>the justice formulated two interrogatories, which he submitted to the jury, \u25a0both of which the jury answered in the negative, on whigh findings the defendant moved for judgment, and the court, adopting the findings of the jury, gave judgment for the defendants. The plaintiff moved for a new trial upon 'the minutes, which was denied; and now, from the judgment and order denying a motion tor a new trial, plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Arg\">Reversed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b595-5\">Argued before Learned, P.

The plaintiff\u2019s husband, while being examined, testified that he made com.plaint to the board of health. He was then asked this question: \u201cWhat did the board decide in regard to it?\u201d This question was objected to by the defendants, and before any ruling was made by the court the plaintiff made the \u25a0following offer: Plaintiff offered to prove that the health officer refused to interfere, and stated that the public had nothing to do with it, as it was a matter of private damage. The court sustained the objection, and excluded the evidence, to which plaintiff duly accepted. We see no error in this ruling by the court. The decision and determination of the board of health upon \u25a0an <em>ex parte </em>examination, not in the presence of the defendants, could not bind them or affect their interests, and was not competent evidence against them. It could neither confer a right of action upon the plaintiff nor deprive the defendants of any ground of defense, and, when objected to by the defendants, was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Hor do we see that it was error for the court to exclude the opinion of this witness as to the cause of the illness of his son. It was objected to on the ground that that inquiry was not within the questions raised by the pleadings, and not proper on the question of damages, and also that the witness was not competent to give the opinion asked for. We think the objections well taken on the latter ground. There was an allegation of special damages for sickness \u2022of the plaintiff\u2019s son, under which, proof, if competent in other respects, might have been admissible. But there is no proof in'this case that the witness was \u2022qualified to give the opinion called for by the question. The only evidence of the qualification of the witness to give the opinion asked for was his statement that he was a botanic physician, that he had no license to practice, but \u2022had his medicines patented, and had a rightto sell them anywhere. That evidence does not show or tend to show that the witness had any special knowledge in reference to the causes of disease. After proving, as above indicated, all of the knowledge or sources of knowledge of the witness bearing upon his skill as an expert, the plaintiff asked this question: \u201cIn your judgment, would such a smell in your yard, as it was at the time your son was taken sick, have a tendency to produce such a sickness?\u201d This question was objected to by the defendants, on the ground, among others, that witness was not competent, and that objection was sustained, as we think, correctly, for the reasons above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">The plaintiff also objected to evidence tending to prove the condition of the plaintiff\u2019s premises. The witness Waterbury was permitted to answer, under the plaintiff\u2019s objection, that on account of the filthy condition of the plaintiff\u2019s hen-yard on plaintiff\u2019s premises he would not live there if it was given \u2022to him. The precise question in answer to which this evidence was given does not appear, but we are left to the inference that it was testimony called for by some appropriate inquiry, especially as the answer was not disclaimed by the defendants, but the testimony retained after objection by the plaintiff, which the case shows was taken in due time. The defendants insist that the \u2022evidence was harmless, especially as it was the manner adopted by the witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>in expressing his estimate of the rental value of the plaintiff\u2019s premises without the existence ojr effect of the alleged acts or omissions of the defendants. We cannot agree with the defendants in this conclusion. It was doubtless-competent for the defendants to prove the rental value of the plaintiff\u2019s premises as they were without the alleged injury to them by acts or omissions of the defendants. But it should have been done, if at all, by competent evidence. The rental value of premises may be estimated by a witness and testified to, but it must be the market or merchantable value of the use of the-premises, and not the estimate that witness may put upon the same for his own use. To the individual witness, who may have no use for the article, the value-of which he is asked to estimate, it may be valueless, while in the general market it may be valuable, and hence the inquiry always is confined to-market value. The inquiry upon this subject should have been confined to-the rental value with and without the alleged nuisance; and that should be estimated by what it would rent for, and not by the estimate that the witness-would put upon it for his own use. <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Schoellkopf, </em>53 N. Y. 152; <em>Van Buren </em>v. <em>Water-Works Co., </em>(Sup.) 3 N. Y. Supp. 336; <em>Barrick </em>v. <em>Schifferdicker, </em>(Sup.) 1 N. Y. Supp. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The appellant also insists that the learned trial court erred in not submitting to the jury, after the word \u201ccaused\u201d in his second proposed question for the jury, the words \u201cor permitted,\u201d upon the request by the plaintiff, which, the court refused, and to which refusal the counsel for the plaintiff excepted. If the amendment proposed by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel had been adopted by the-court, the question would have read as follows: \u201cDid the defendants, by any improper or unreasonable use of their barn lot, cause or permit foul or refuse-water drainage to flow on plaintiff\u2019s land, so as to depreciate its value?\u201d If the defendants by any improper or unreasonable use of their barn lot permitted the refuse water drainage to flow on plaintiff\u2019s land, so as to depreciate its-value, it is difficult to see why they would not be liable. Permitting a nuisance to exist which was caused by the person creating it is a repetition of the-nuisance. In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>12 N. Y. 492, Denio, J., says: \u201cEvery continuance of a nuisance is, in judgment of law, a fresh nuisance.\u201d But in this case, under the question as submitted, and.from the charge of the learned, judge, the jury might well have inferred that the continuance of the conditions injurious to the plaintiff furnished no ground of action, and, unless-they found that the defendants caused it, the plaintiff was remediless. This,, we think, was restricting the inquiry of the jury within too narrow limits, and the court, in adopting the findings of the jury, must be held to have been: restricted in the same manner. In the case above quoted the same learned judge added: \u201cBut I am of opinion that an action on the case will lie against one who continues a nuisance by which damage is occasioned to the plaintiff, without notice first given to remove it. \u201d In this case some question was raised as to the exercise of the equitable power of the court to compel a defendant to\u00e1bate a nuisance without a request made to abate the same. But no such question can arise in the case at bar, as the uncontradicted evidence is that a request was made of both defendants before the commencement of the action, to abate the alleged nuisance. We are of opinion that the error referred to-in the admission of evidence, and the erroneous refusal of the learned judge-to submit to the jury the question as to whether or not the defendants permitted the existence of the alleged nuisance, may have improperly prejudiced, the rights of the plaintiff, and that for these reasons the judgment should be-reversed. Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, costs to abide event-</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
