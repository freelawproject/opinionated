Perry, plaintiff, against the Erie Transfer Company, defendant, to recover for the hire of certain teams to defendant, which was a New Jersey corporation. Plaintiff was also a non-resident. It appeared from the evidence that the contract was made in New Jersey, but was to be performed in part in New York. From a judgment for plaintiff entered on the verdict of a jury, defendant appeals. Code Civil Proe. N. Y. \u00a7 1780, provides that \u201can action against a foreign corporation may be maintained by another foreign corporation, or by a non-resident in one of the following cases only: * * * (3) Where the cause of action arose within the state.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b189-19\">Argued before Ehrlich, C.

Such being the case, the want of jurisdiction was not an issue to be tried. It was waived. Although the defendant is a foreign- corporation, the action is transitory, and but for the non-residence of the plaintiff, the court would have had jurisdiction of both subject-matter and parties. The objection, or grounds upon which it is based, ought to have appeared in some form by the pleadings. The cause of action was clearly proved, and verdict properly directed. It follows that the judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
