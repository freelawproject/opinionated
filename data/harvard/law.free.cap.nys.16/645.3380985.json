Wensley, plaintiff\u2019s attorney, it is adjudged that plaintiff do have and recover of the defendants the sum of $7,674.02 as damages, and $1,521.59 costs, amounting in all to $9,195.61, and that plaintiff have execution therefor. Wm. J. Kaiser, Clerk.\u201d The defendants made a motion to strike out the words included above in brackets, and the motion was denied, and the defendants have appealed from the order. We think the motion was erroneously denied. There was nothing before the clerk to justify the interpolation of the objectionable words. He had authority to enter a general judgment in favor of the plaintiff against the defendants, and then his power was exhausted. His duties in making the entry were ministerial, and he could neither enlarge nor abridge the scope or operation of the judgment he was authorized to enter. The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion should be granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
