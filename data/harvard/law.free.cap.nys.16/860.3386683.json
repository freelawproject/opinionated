Defendants\u2019 books, which were unimpeached, showed a full payment for that week, and this was contradicted only by plaintiff\u2019s-testimony, and by the fact that it was defendants\u2019 rule to hold back a week\u2019s wages \u25a0 as security for the faithful performance of the work on hand. <em>Meld, </em>on appeal, that a finding for plaintiff must be reversed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b896-11\">8. Same\u2014Admissibility of Evidence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b896-12\">In an action to recover for work done by the job, defendants relied upon a system of tickets and accounts made out in the presence of the employes, which clearly showed the amount of work done each day. Prom these it appeared that on the morning of the day on which plaintiff quit .work he had a very large amount of unfinished work on hand. <em>Meld, </em>that a refusal to admit evidence of the usual amount of work done weekly by plaintiff, to show that it was impossible for him to have completed the work he had-on hand, was error, for which a judgment for plaintiff' must be reversed. \u2022</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b896-13\">Appeals from fifth district court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b896-14\">Actions by Barnet Goldstein against Mary H.

The answers were the same in each case, consisting of a general denial, and pleading payment, and failure of the plaintiff to perform conditions precedent. By consent the three actions were tried as-one. Defendants were makers and sellers of women\u2019s clothes, doing business under the name of White, Howard &amp; Co. Plaintiff Goldstein was employed by them by the week, and sued for pay for a week and a day and a half, amounting in all to $24.50. The other two plaintiffs were employed by the piece, and sue for work done, amounting in the case of Gurewitz to $46, and in the-case of Ostrowsky to $37.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>Unless there is a special agreement to the contrary, work, whether measured by the job <em>(Cunningham </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>20 N. Y. 486; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>17 N. Y. 173; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>86 N. Y. 131) or by time, <em>(Waters </em>v. <em>Davies, </em>55 N. Y. Super. Ct. 39,) must be finished, in order that there shall be a right to pay for it. In other words, there must be performance or a waiver of conditions precedent before there can be a right to recovery. <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>119 N. Y. 86, 23 N. E. Rep. 175; <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Willson, </em>81 N. Y. 341. The plaintiff Goldstein admits in his testimony that he left in the middle of the week. Consequently he could not recover anything for the portion of \u2022the week he worked unless there was a waiver of further performance on defendants\u2019 part. This was attempted to be shown on plaintiff\u2019s part by some evidence to the effect that Mrs. White, one of the defendants, discharged them; but the testimony on the defendants\u2019 behalf, we think, overwhelmingly confutes this, and shows that the real cause of the difficulty was an attempt to force the defendants to' pay a disputed claim of another employe, by leaving their employ in a body. As to the week\u2019s wages prior to the week he left, it is true, he denies having received it; but defendants\u2019 books, which were in no wise impeached, show that he was fully paid up to the Saturday preceding his leaving; and that, although it is a rule of the defendants to keep back one week\u2019s wages as security for the faithful performance of the work by those \u25a0employed by the week. These facts sharply called the attention of defendants\u2019 witnesses to the fact of payment, and we fail to see how they could have testified to the payment without being guilty of both falsifying their employers\u2019 books and committing perjury, neither of which are we .willing to impute to them from anything appearing in the return.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The plaintiffs Gurewitz and Ostrowsky both swear that they had fully finished all the work given them by the defendants before they left on a Tuesday noon. But the defendants had a system of tickets, and a method of keeping accounts, by which it go old be readily and accurately ascertained what work had been finished each day. Each night the book-keeper\u2019s duty was to learn what had been finished by each piece-worker during the day, and write it with the date upon a ticket in the workman\u2019s presence, and it is not probable that any workman would allow any error to pass uncorrected, as on its correctness depended his pay. All the tickets from the date of the last settlement in full with these two plaintiffs were offered in evidence on the trial, as were also the accounts between these parties. In addition to this, every Friday night the book-keeper got from each piece-worker a list of work then unfinished in their hands. Such a list was made from information furnished by plaintiffs on Friday, April 17th, preceding Tuesday, April 21st, when they all left. A comparison of the tickets, the accounts, and these lists show that seven garments were unfinished, and in Ostrowsky\u2019s hands, on the morning of Tuesday, the day he left, and that eight unfinished garments were in Gurewitz\u2019s hands. It seems to us quite improbable that all of these garments could have been finished in half a day. Besides, several witnesses on defendants\u2019 behalf positively testify that none of them were finished. Defendants\u2019 book-keeper was asked to state what the plaintiffs had \u2022earned weekly while in defendants\u2019 employment. This was objected to by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, and the court sustained the objection. We think this error, in view of the extraordinary claim made by the two plaintiffs as to the work they must have done on Tuesday morning. The answer, partly given, \u25a0shows that they must have accomplished more than three times the amount of work done in at least one week before, in half a day. Where, as in this case, it is uncertain which party should succeed, it was held in <em>Strawbridge </em>v. <em>Vandenburgh, </em>(Sup.) 10 N. Y. Supp. 610, that the court will reverse for slight errors, and. we think that course should be followed in this case. Judg.ments reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the .event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
