Y. Supp. 518, (herewith decided.) The evidence in the two cases is, in substance, identical. The appeal is from a judgment on a verdict; but as the judgment is challenged only for insufficient proof of defendant\u2019s negligence and plaintiff\u2019s non-negligence, and as those points are ruled against the appellant in the other case, it results that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
