The court overruled the objection, and the witness, answering the question as first propounded, said: \u201cTo the par [fee?] value of the lot it would be about 26 to 25 per cent.\u201d Again: \u201cPlease state your estimate of the injury from the elevated railroad to the light, and also to the building on the lot, in dollars and cents, confining your estimate to the injuries from the road in respect of noise and the impairment of light?\u201d To this question defendants objected on the grounds above stated, and also on the ground that \u201cit is incompetent for the witness to give his opinion upon the amount of damage;\u201d but the objection was overruled, exception duly taken, and the. witness answered: \u201cTaking all the elements of the railroad together\u2014I cannot suggest light and noise alone; I should say, dirt and cinders and gases\u2014 the depreciation of the rental value would be about 33^- per cent., in combination.\u201d Upon the opinion in <em>McGay's Case, </em>16 N. Y. Supp. 155, (herewith decided,) this evidence was clearly incompetent, and its admission adequate ground of reversal. Again, to the same witness, plaintiff propounded this inquiry: \u201cHave you formed an opinion as to whether Sixth avenue, near Twenty-Third street, would have been a better street, with higher values, supposing that elevated railroad had never come there, or the reverse?\u201d To this question defendants objected that it was \u201cincompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial; also as speculative and conjectural, and not a proper subject for opinion.\u201d The objection was overruled, defendants duly excepted, and the witness answered, \u201cIt would have improved materially for the better without the elevated road in all ways, \u201d etc. Upon the opinion in <em>Wallach </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>16 N. Y. Supp. 156, (herewith decided,) and the adjudication in <em>Roberts\u2019 Case, </em>(N. Y. App.) 28 N. E. Rep. 486, and <em>Gray's Case, </em>Id. 498, this evidence was incompetent, because purely conjectural and speculative, and its admission sufficient ground for reversal. Waiving consideration of other points presented by appellants, for the errors specified the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial had, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
