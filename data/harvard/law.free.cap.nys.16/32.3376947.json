The complaint alleged that defendant had failed to pay the royalties, had lacked' diligence .in endeavoring to sell the boilers, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>had injured the reputation of such boilers by bad workmanship. It asked judgment for $40,000, covering the unpaid royalties and the unliquidated damages for the other breaches of the contract. Defendant offered to allow judgment for $2,000 and costs, under Code Civil Proc. NT. Y. \u00a7 738, which provides that in case such offer is accepted judgment must be entered accordingly. Plaintiff accepted the offer, and then moved for an additional allowance, which motion the court refused, and it appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b69-5\">Argued before Van Brunt, P.

It appeared that after issue joined the defendant served an offer of judgment, which was accepted by the plaintiff, whereby defendant offered to allow judgment for a certain sum and costs. The plaintiff made a motion for an allowance, which was denied by the court because of a supposed want of power. In this we think the court erred. The case of <em>Landon </em>v. <em>Van Etten, </em>(Sup.) 10 N. Y. Supp. 802, seems to be in conflict with this proposition. Although the precise question was not involved, yet it was there held that an allowance was part of the costs, and that a defendant succeeding after an offer, being entitled to costs, was entitled to an allowance. The case of <em>Wing </em>v. <em>De La Rionda, </em>126 N. Y. 680, 28 N. E. Rep. 223, also establishes the principle that an extra allowance is part of the costs. Therefore, the plaintiff being entitled to costs, the court had power in a proper case to grant an allowance. Our attention has been called to the case of <em>Penfield </em>v. <em>James, </em>56 N. Y. 659, in which the court seems to have held that, where an insufficient offer of judgment was served, the plaintiff was not entitled to an allowance. We think that either the court must have acted under a misapprehension of the facts, or the case must be incorrectly reported. The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the plaintiff allowed to renew his motion at special term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
