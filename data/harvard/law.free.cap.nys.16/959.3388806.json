It appears that the defendant started business as the \u201cNinth Avenue Bank,\u201d but subsequently changed its name to the \u201cHomestead Bank.\u201d It then applied to the plaintiff to secure the facilities of the clearing-house, and plaintiff undertook to do the business of the defendant through the clearing-house, provided defendant would keep on deposit with plaintiff $20,000 as a compensation. Defendant failed to keep on deposit with the plaintiff the amount agreed, and an agreement was then made that $1,200 should be allowed to plaintiff for its services in the clearing-house, of which sum $500 was paid. The case was properly submitted to the jury. There arena exceptions either to the charge or in the admission of testimony that show error on the part of \u25a0the trial justice. The motion to dismiss was properly denied, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
