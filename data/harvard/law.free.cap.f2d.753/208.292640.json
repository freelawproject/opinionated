KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"AqO\">Although the aches and pains derived from physical activity have always been part of our American heritage, only recently have they become fashionable and profitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-17\">In the spring of 1982, Thompson Medical Company (\u201cThompson\u201d) introduced \u201cSport-screme,\u201d a topical analgesic designed to relieve the muscle soreness associated with sports activities. Two years later, in the spring of 1984, Pfizer Inc. (\u201cPfizer\u201d) introduced a similar product, \u201cBEN-GAY SportsGel,\u201d which was also targeted specifically at the \u201cweekend athlete.\u201d On August 16, 1984, Thompson filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, pursuant to Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a) (1982), seeking a preliminary injunction against Pfizer\u2019s further use of the name \u201cSportsGel.\u201d Judge Griesa, finding a likelihood of confusion between \u201cSport-screme\u201d and \u201cBEN-GAY SportsGel,\u201d granted the preliminary injunction. He based his decision solely on the similarity of the marks and Thompson\u2019s priority of use.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-18\">Because the court below did not address the question whether \u201cSportscreme\u201d was a protectible mark, and failed to examine the strength of \u201cSportscreme,\u201d the proximity of the marks, the sophistication of topical analgesic consumers, and Pfizer\u2019s intent in selecting its mark, we vacate the order granting the preliminary injunction and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-19\">Suits for trademark infringement demand a \u201ccomprehensive analysis of all the relevant facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>See Vi-tarroz Corp. v. Borden, Inc., </em>644 F.2d 960, 968-69 (2d Cir.1981). Accordingly, we set forth the facts giving rise to the dispute in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-21\">\n<em>Thompson\u2019s \u201cSportscreme\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-22\">Thompson, a New York corporation, is this nation\u2019s second-most successful manufacturer of topical analgesic rubs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To cap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>italize on the fitness craze of the past decade, Thompson, in 1979, conceived of \u201cSportscreme,\u201d a topical analgesic directed at the growing group of \u201cweekend warriors,\u201d those sedentary individuals who engage in sporadic physical activity and are thus particularly susceptible to muscle pain and soreness.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">After selecting the name \u201cSportscreme,\u201d Thompson conducted two trademark searches, which revealed that the word \u201csports\u201d was used in connection with a variety of products. From late 1979 until \u201cSportscreme\u2019s\u201d launch in February 1982, Thompson engaged in concept development and product formulation, and prepared testing, trade and consumer programs. Sales to consumers began in April 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Patently aware of Pfizer\u2019s dominant position in the topical analgesic market, Thompson embarked on an extensive and intensive advertising campaign to promote and publicize \u201cSportscreme.\u201d With total expenditures in excess of $8 million, Thompson employed electronic and print media to reach the \u201cweekend athlete.\u201d To this end, \u201cSportscreme\u201d advertisements were aired on ESPN (a cable television sports network) and carried in <em>Runner </em>magazine. Among the messages conveyed by Thompson was that unlike \u201csmelly BEN-GAY,\u201d \u201cSportscreme,\u201d with its aromatic scent, leaves its users smelling \u201cnice and clean.\u201d \u201cSportscreme\u201d samples were distributed without charge at swimming, biking, golfing and triathlon competitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The success of this advertising campaign was manifested by \u201cSportscreme\u2019s\u201d steadily increasing sales volume and market share. From April to November of 1982, retail sales of \u201cSportscreme\u201d totalled $700,-000; in the fiscal year ending November 30, 1983, sales rose to $1.2 million; and for the fiscal year ending November 30, 1984, retail sales revenues were projected at more than $2.5 million. Indeed, within an eighteen month period, \u201cSportscreme\u2019s\u201d market share had increased from 0.8% to 4.2%.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\n<em>Pfizer\u2019s \u201cBEN-GAY SportsGel\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Pfizer, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in New York, is a major manufacturer of pharmaceutical products, and is the nation\u2019s leading producer of topical analgesic rubs. Since acquiring the assets of Bengue, Inc. in 1964, Pfizer has enjoyed a 40% share of the topical analgesic market.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">For more than three-quarters of a century, Pfizer\u2019s BEN-GAY was typically purchased and used by arthritis sufferers and persons afflicted with ordinary muscle aches. But as Americans became more interested in fitness, the universe of consumers to which topical analgesic rubs could be marketed exploded. This potential source of market expansion was not overlooked by Pfizer executives. Beginning in 1981, BEN-GAY\u2019s advertising campaign assumed a physical-fitness orientation, with major sports figures extolling the virtues of BEN-GAY. A by-product of this advertising was to inculcate in millions of American weekend athletes an understanding of the therapeutic effects of topical analgesics.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">In 1976, Pfizer contemplated introducing a new line of BEN-GAY products aimed specifically at the sports-active consumer. Although the seeds of the so-called \u201cBEN-GAY Sports Stick\u201d were sown in 1976, preliminary testing from 1977 to 1979 delayed its introduction, and manufacturing complications ultimately forced Pfizer to abandon the stick formulation entirely. Buoyed by the sales increase generated from its sports-related advertising campaign, Pfizer remained determined to capitalize fully on the nation\u2019s physical fitness trend.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">Consequently, in the fall of 1983, Pfizer decided to reposition the existing BEN-GAY gel formulation as a sports product, stressing its value to persons who engage in sports activities, while simultaneously deemphasizing its ability to relieve minor arthritis pain. The product was named \u201cBEN-GAY SportsGel.\u201d Thomas Laugh-lin, a group marketing director for BEN-GAY products, testified that the name was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>selected because it concisely and accurately described the product: a BEN-GAY gel product for use by sports participants. Laughlin explained that the name \u201cBEN-GAY SportsGel\u201d was the natural derivative of its abandoned predecessor, \u201cBEN-GAY Sports Stick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Pfizer\u2019s lawyers then commissioned a trademark search that uncovered, in addition to \u201cSportscreme,\u201d a litany of marks using the word \u201csports\u201d in connection with closely related products \u2014 Sports-Rub, Sports Balm, Sport Cream, Sport Lotion, Sport Oil, etc. There were also pending trademark applications for two topical analgesic rubs that would compete directly with \u201cBEN-GAY SportsGel,\u201d called SportsRub and Sports Ice. After reviewing this data, Pfizer\u2019s in-house trademark lawyer, William Goebelbecker, concluded that Pfizer was \u201creasonably safe\u201d in adopting the name \u201cSportsGel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Armed with a name and a product, Pfizer next devised a comprehensive packaging strategy. \u201cBEN-GAY SportsGel,\u201d like the other BEN-GAY tube products (and like \u201cSportscreme\u201d), was packaged in standard IV4 and 3 ounce containers. And like all products in the BEN-GAY \u201cfamily,\u201d the \u201cSportsGel\u201d container prominently displayed the BEN-GAY logo (emblazoned in red) and the traditional diagonal stripes in three shades of the same color. The package\u2019s red, white and blue color scheme was selected for its \u201cbright, bold, patriotic\u201d qualities. The dominant colors on the \u201cSportscreme\u201d container were yellow and green.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Both Thompson\u2019s \u201cSportscreme\u201d and Pfizer\u2019s \u201cBEN-GAY SportsGel\u201d utilized a \u201cfifth panel,\u201d a riser that extends from the back of the box and is believed to enhance a product\u2019s saleability, particularly during the period of its introduction. Before determining the precise packaging configuration, Pfizer conducted a cost-benefit analysis to determine the financial efficacy of utilizing a fifth panel. In light of Pfizer\u2019s desire not to advertise \u201cBEN-GAY Sports-Gel\u201d independently from other products in the BEN-GAY line, the marketing benefits to be derived from the more costly configuration were predicted to exceed the added expense. These calculations proved to be correct. \u201cBEN-GAY SportsGel\u201d was introduced in the spring of 1984, and after just two and one-half months, sales had exceeded one million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">\n<em>The Trial Court Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A_7\">On August 16, 1984, three months after \u201cBEN-GAY SportsGel\u201d had been introduced and full national distribution was under way, Thompson filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, pursuant to Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, seeking a preliminary injunction against Pfizer\u2019s continued use of the name \u201cSportsGel.\u201d A two-day hearing was conducted by Judge Griesa on August 30 and 31, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">On August 31, Judge Griesa delivered an oral opinion from the bench. Describing the case as a \u201cclose one,\u201d the district judge found that Thompson\u2019s survey purportedly establishing actual confusion among consumers,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was so replete with testing flaws as to be \u201cof limited utility,\u201d and that the \u201cBEN-GAY SportsGel\u201d and \u201cSportscreme\u201d packages are \u201cstrikingly different\u201d in their \u201cessential features.\u201d Nevertheless, Judge Griesa granted the preliminary injunction. His conclusion that the name \u201cSportsGel\u201d infringed Thompson\u2019s use cf. \u201cSport-screme\u201d was based upon the similarity of the marks and Thompson\u2019s priority of use. He failed, however, to address whether Thompson\u2019s mark was protectible. Neither did he evaluate the strength of \u201cSport-screme,\u201d the proximity of the marks, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>sophistication of topical analgesic consumers, or Pfizer\u2019s intent in selecting its mark. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The touchstone of our analysis is the Lanham Trade-Mark Act. Animated by economic and marketing realities, the Act\u2019s framers believed that promoting the distin-.guishability of goods would safeguard the public, as well as stimulate competition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 43(a) of the Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> relevant portions of which are printed in the margin, protects against false designation of origin and false description or representation, whether or not a registered trademark is involved.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">This seemingly straightforward proscription has spawned a weighty, indeed un-wieldly, body of case law, obsessed more with minute calibrations than clear legal principles. To a large extent, of course, this result is to be expected. Razor-thin judgment calls are indigenous to the law of trademark protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">In determining whether an existing unregistered mark should be protected against the introduction of a \u201csimilar\u201d mark by a junior user, we have traditionally employed a variety of approaches, including the mark\u2019s classification; its likelihood of confusion; and the \u201csecond-comer\u201d doctrine. These standards, however, suffer from a variety of analytical infirmities that limit their ability to resolve disputes satisfactorily.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">\n<em>Trademark Classification:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">\n<em>Determining A Mark\u2019s Eligibility For Protection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">One mode of analysis in trademark infringement cases examines a mark\u2019s eligibility for trademark protection. Writing for the court in <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537 </em>F.2d 4 (2d Cir.1976), Judge Friendly set forth what quickly became the classic formulation of this principle. He noted that there exist four categories of terms, each one conferring a differing degree of eligibility for trademark protection. \u201cArrayed in an ascending order which roughly reflects their eligibility to trademark status and the degree of protection accorded, these classes are (1) generic, (2) descriptive, (3) suggestive, and (4) arbitrary or fanciful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-15\">Generic terms \u2014 \u201cthe common descriptive name of an article or substance\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 are ineligible for any trademark protection. Descriptive marks, those \u201cdescrib[ing] the qualities, ingredients, effects or other features of the product naturally and in ordinary language\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> are protectible only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>where secondary meaning can be established. Suggestive terms require \u201cimagination, thought and perception to reach a conclusion as to the nature of goods,\u201d <em>see Stix Products, Inc. v. United Merchants &amp; Manufacturers, Inc., </em>295 F.Supp. 479, 488 (S.D.N.Y.1968), and are eligible for protection without proof of secondary meaning. Finally, arbitrary or fanciful marks \u201cenjoy all the rights accorded to suggestive terms as marks \u2014 without the need of debating whether the term is \u2018merely descriptive\u2019 and with ease of establishing infringement.\u201d <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, supra, </em>537 F.2d at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">More than sixty years ago, Judge Learned Hand, reacting to the amorphousness of these standards, stated, \u201cIt is quite impossible to get any rule out of the cases beyond this: That the validity of the mark ends where suggestion ends and description begins.\u201d <em>Franklin Knitting Mills, Inc. v. Fashionit Sweater Mills, Inc., </em>297 F. 247, 248 (2d Cir.1923), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>4 F.2d 1018 (2d Cir.1925) <em>(per curiam). </em>It cannot be gainsaid that the judiciary is ill-equipped to distinguish between the descriptively suggestive and the suggestively descriptive mark.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition, societal vicissitudes demand that the categories retain fluidity to accommodate a particular mark\u2019s evolving usage over time. <em>See, e.g., King Seeley Thermos Corp., supra, </em>(\u201cthermos,\u201d once suggestive, was held to be generic); <em>Haughton Elevator Co. v. Seeberger, </em>85 U.S.P.Q. 80 (1950) (\u201cescalator,\u201d originally fanciful, was held to have become generic). Moreover, the determination whether a mark is descriptive or suggestive cannot be made in a vacuum; it is necessary to surmise the mental processes of those in the marketplace at whom the mark is directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">The classification of a particular term represents merely a threshold determination. After a mark has been duly catalogued and its eligibility for protection has been determined, we must then examine a litany of factors to evaluate whether consumers are likely to be confused as to the source of the product.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">\n<em>Likelihood of Confusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"aej-dedup-0\">The ultimate inquiry in most actions for false designation of origin, as with actions for trademark infringement,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is whether there exists a \u201clikelihood that an appreciable number of ordinarily prudent purchasers [will] be misled, or indeed simply confused, as to the source of the goods in question.\u201d <em>Mushroom Makers, Inc. v. R. G. Barry Corp., </em>580 F.2d 44, 47 (2d Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1116, 99 S.Ct. 1022, 59 L.Ed.2d 75 (1979). Writing for the court in <em>Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elects. Corp., </em>287 F.2d 492, 495 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 820, 82 S.Ct. 36, 7 L.Ed.2d 25 (1961), Judge Friendly noted that such an assessment properly turns on the examination of many factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-14\">[The] strength of the mark, the degree of similarity between the marks, the proximity of the products, the likelihood that the prior owner will bridge the gap, actual confusion, and the reciprocal of defendant\u2019s good faith in adopting its own mark, the quality of defendant\u2019s product, and the sophistication of the buyers. Even this extensive catalogue does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>exhaust the possibilities \u2014 the court may have to take still other variables into account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 495. <em>Accord Lever Bros. Co. v. American Bakeries Co., </em>693 F.2d 251 (2d Cir.1982); <em>Vitarroz Corp. v. Borden, Inc., </em>644 F.2d 960 (2d Cir.1981). The <em>Polaroid </em>court\u2019s prescience has been borne out, as the catalogue of original <em>Polaroid </em>factors has been expanded. <em>See, e.g., McGregor-Doniger Inc. v. Drizzle Inc., </em>599 F.2d 1126, 1140 (2d Cir.1979) (\u201cthis Court has frequently supplemented its consideration of the <em>Polaroid </em>factors by balancing the conflicting interests of the parties involved\u201d); <em>Chandon Champagne Corp. v. San Marino Wine Corp., </em>335 F.2d 531, 536 (2d Cir.1964) (considering, in addition to the original <em>Polaroid </em>factors, the nature of the senior user\u2019s priority, the senior user\u2019s delay in asserting its claim, and the harm to the junior user as compared to the benefit to the senior user that would result from the requested injunction).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Although the <em>Polaroid </em>balancing test was traditionally confined to products that were \u201cnon-competing,\u201d <em>see McGregor-Do-niger Inc., supra, </em>599 F.2d at 1139, \u201cnoncompetitive,\u201d <em>see Scarves By Vera, Inc. v. Todo Imports, Ltd. (Inc.), </em>544 F.2d 1167, 1173 (2d Cir.1976), or \u201cdifferent,\u201d <em>see Mushroom Makers, Inc., supra, </em>580 F.2d at 47, it now properly extends to competing products. <em>See Plus Products, supra, </em>722 F.2d at 1004 n. 6; <em>American International Group, Inc. v. London American International Corp., </em>664 F.2d 348, 351 n. 2 (2d Cir.1982); <em>Vitarroz, supra, </em>644 F.2d at 965-67; <em>Kiki Undies Corp. v. Promenade Hosiery Mills, Inc., </em>411 F.2d 1097,1099 (2d Cir.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The wisdom of the likelihood of confusion test lies in its recognition that each trademark infringement case presents its own unique set of facts. Indeed, the complexities attendant to an accurate assessment of likelihood of confusion require that the entire panoply of elements constituting the relevant factual landscape be comprehensively examined. No single <em>Polaroid </em>factor is pre-eminent, nor can the presence or absence of one without analysis of the others, determine the outcome of an infringement suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">For example, if the determination of a mark\u2019s strength were to stand as the centerpiece of the <em>Polaroid </em>analysis, with the remaining factors relegated to positions of lesser significance, weak marks would automatically be found unlikely to cause confusion among purchasers as to source; strong marks would invariably be deemed to cause confusion. The likelihood of confusion test would then merely become a variation of the \u201ctrademark classification\u201d approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">\n<em>The Second-Comer Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">The final mode of analysis traditionally employed in trademark infringement cases is the \u201csecond-comer\u201d doctrine, an adjunct of trade piracy. As Learned Hand cogently noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-11\">\u201cWhy it should have chosen a mark that had long been employed by [plaintiff] and had become known to the trade instead of adopting some other means to identify [their] goods is hard to see unless there was a deliberate purpose to obtain some advantage from the trade which [plaintiff] had built up.\u201d Indeed, it is generally true that, as soon as we see that a second comer in a mark has, for no reason that he can assign, plagiarized the \u201cmake-up\u201d of an earlier comer, we need no more____[W]e feel bound to compel him to exercise his ingenuity in quarters further afield.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-14\"><em>American Chicle Co. v. Topps Chewing Gum, Inc., </em>208 F.2d 560, 562-63 (2d Cir.1953), quoting <em>Miles Shoes Inc. v. R.H. Macy and Co., </em>199 F.2d 602, 603 (2d Cir.1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-15\">A senior user in possession of a distinctive mark has a right not to have a second comer intentionally cause a likelihood of confusion between two marks in an attempt to exploit the reputation of the senior user\u2019s mark, since this would deprive the first user of control over its reputation and goodwill. <em>See Spring Mills, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>Inc. v. Ultracashmere House, Ltd., </em>689 F.2d 1127, 1135 (2d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">This test has resisted doctrinal classification. Some courts have simply incorporated the second-comer doctrine into the <em>Polaroid </em>analysis. <em>See, e.g., Spring Mills, Inc., supra. </em>But because the two elements necessary to trigger the second-comer doctrine \u2014 a strong mark and bad intent \u2014 are themselves included in the <em>Polaroid </em>analysis, the doctrine would appear to be a redundancy, unless it retains independent significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">This seemingly superfluous approach may be an outgrowth of Polaroid\u2019s recent expansion into the realm of competing products. Prior to <em>Vitarroz </em>and its progeny, there did not exist a systematic mode of analysis capable of incorporating a second-comer\u2019s bad intent and the strength of the senior user\u2019s mark in trademark infringement cases involving competing products. As a result, the second-comer doctrine offered an avenue of relief for the senior user. But with Polaroid\u2019s expansive coverage, this is no longer the case. Consequently, courts that purport to apply the second-comer \u201ctest\u201d should recognize that they are merely emphasizing two of the <em>Polaroid </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">In one sense, however, this doctrine remains fully extant. A second-comer may violate Section 43(a) by falsely representing his goods as those of the trademark owner. <em>See Sutton Cosmetics (P.R.) Inc. v. Lander Co., Inc., </em>455 F.2d 285, 287-88 (2d Cir.1972). A claim of \u201cpassing off\u201d may be established even if the goods are not confusingly similar; the wrong lies in the misrepresentation of the source. <em>See Warner Bros. v. American Broadcasting Co., </em>720 F.2d 231, 247 (2d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-17\">Against this backdrop, and in light of the Lanham Act\u2019s avowed purpose of ensuring consistent and uniform legal rights and remedies in a national economy,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we shall now attempt to clarify the law in the area of trademark infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-18\">The starting point of our examination is determining whether a mark is eligible for protection. In making such an evaluation, we rely upon the classifications clearly set forth in <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Co., supra. </em>Recognizing that our initial categorization may determine a mark\u2019s eligibility for protection, and aware that the distinctions between generic and descriptive,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and descriptive and suggestive are often illusory, we believe a new emphasis is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-19\">The link between secondary meaning and likelihood of confusion is critical, yet it has often been overlooked by courts. Section 43(a) is meant to protect the public from confusion regarding the source of goods produced.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If a mark has secondary meaning, a purchaser will associate it with a certain producer, and will be likely to make that same association when an identical mark (or a confusingly similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>mark), is used on another producer\u2019s product. In the absence of secondary meaning, however, there will be no such association in the minds of the purchasing public.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Consonance with the avowed purpose of Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, then, demands an examination of secondary meaning to determine whether an unregistered mark is eligible for protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">If an unregistered mark is deemed descriptive, proof of secondary meaning is required for the mark to be protectible. <em>See 20th Century Wear, Inc. v. Sanmark-Stardust Inc., </em>747 F.2d 81, 87, 90 n. 10 (2d Cir.1984). Suggestive marks are eligible for protection without any proof of secondary meaning, since the connection between the mark and the source is presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ3\">Where a mark is ineligible for protection, there is no need to examine likelihood of confusion. Such an inquiry would, of course, be redundant, since a determination that a mark is ineligible for protection establishes that consumers do not associate that mark with a particular source. The rationales for denying protection to marks that do not connote a source of origin include: (1) the public\u2019s inherent \u201cright\u201d to call a product by its name, <em>see Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., </em>305 U.S. 111, 119, 59 S.Ct. 109, 113, 83 L.Ed. 73 (1938); (2) exclusive appropriation of a generic/descriptive mark is \u201cunfair\u201d to competitors, <em>see King Seeley Thermos Co., supra, </em>321 F.2d at 581; and (3) such an appropriation creates or entrenches a monopoly, <em>see Canal Co. v. Clark, </em>80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 311, 324, 20 L.Ed. 581 (1871); <em>Aloe Creme Laboratories, Inc. v. Milsan, Inc., </em>423 F.2d 845, 849 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>398 U.S. 928, 90 S.Ct. 1818, 26 L.Ed.2d 90 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">It is against this landscape of trademark law that we turn to the precise issue presented on appeal \u2014 whether the district judge properly granted Thompson\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">Our inquiry commences with a determination whether Thompson\u2019s \u201cSportscreme\u201d is eligible for protection. Although the district judge failed to address this issue, an \u201cappellate court is in as good a position as the trial judge\u201d to make such an evaluation. <em>See McGregor-Doniger, Inc., supra, </em>599 F.2d at 1333. We hold that \u201cSport-screme\u201d is a descriptive mark and, as such, is eligible only if Thompson can establish that it has acquired secondary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">Thompson asserts that an imaginative link is necessary to connect the concept of a topical analgesic used in connection with sports activities to the name \u201cSportscreme.\u201d We disagree. No exercise of the imagination is necessary for the public to understand that the product is a cream useful in connection with sports.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Marks that describe the use to which a product is put are descriptive. <em>See </em>3 R. Callmann, <em>The Law of Unfair Competition, Trademarks and Monopolies </em>\u00a7 18.05, at 27 (L.Altman 4th ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">The foregoing analysis comports with the rationale for distinguishing between suggestive and descriptive terms, and the purpose underlying the protection of trademarks. In protecting only those descriptive terms that have acquired secondary meaning, we recognize that potential market entrants should not be foreclosed from using descriptive terms to label their products. This concern, however, is inapposite where suggestive terms are involved. As Judge Lumbard persuasively noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-13\">The English language has a wealth of synonyms and related words with which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>to describe the qualities which manufacturers may wish to claim for their products and the ingenuity of the public relations profession supplies new words and slogans as they are needed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-5\"><em>Aluminum Fabricating Co. of Pittsburgh v. Season-All Window Corp., </em>259 F.2d 314, 317 (2d Cir.1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Thompson points to the availability of alternative names to describe a topical analgesic designed to relieve the aches and pains of sports participants, and argues that this militates in favor of protection. But this assertion misapprehends the relevant concern. The trademark law should not grant, in effect, a monopoly to the first mark that effectively and concisely describes a product\u2019s use or function. Were this exclusive appropriation to occur, future entrants would be required to adopt a \u201cless-descriptive\u201d term, and engage in increased advertising to recoup the lost consumer appeal. Entry barriers would be created, discouraging entry and competition, particularly from small firms. This result is expressly at odds with the purposes of the trademark laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\n<em>Secondary Meaning</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AT3Z\">Having concluded that \u201cSportscreme\u201d is a descriptive mark, we must now determine whether it has acquired secondary meaning. As we have noted, \u201cSportscreme\u201d deserves protection only if it can be established that \u201cconsumers have come to associate [it] with a particular manufacturer or source.\u201d <em>Perfect Fit Industries, Inc., supra, </em>618 F.2d at 953. If, however, secondary meaning cannot be established, \u201cSport-screme\u201d will be ineligible for protection, and our analysis will conclude without having to address the likelihood of confusion. Absent secondary meaning, purchasers will not associate \u201cSportscreme\u201d with a particular source of origin. By definition, there could not be likelihood of confusion as to source.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">\u201c[P]roof of secondary meaning entails vigorous evidentiary requirements,\u201d <em>Ralston Purina Co. v. Thomas J. Lipton, Inc., </em>341 F.Supp. 129, 134 (S.D.N.Y.1972), with Thompson bearing the burden of establishing that \u201cSportscreme\u201d had acquired secondary meaning by the spring of 1984. <em>See Saratoga Vichy Spring Co., Inc. v. Lehman, </em>625 F.2d 1037, 1042 (2d Cir.1980). In determining whether a mark has acquired secondary meaning, we have examined: advertising expenditures, <em>see Harlequin Enterprises Ltd. v. Gulf &amp; Western Corp., </em>644 F.2d 946, 949 (2d Cir.1981); <em>McGregor-Doniger Inc., supra, </em>599 F.2d at 1132, 1133 n. 4; consumer studies linking the name to a source, <em>see Harlequin Enterprises Ltd., supra, </em>644 F.2d at 950 n. 2; <em>American Footwear Corp. v. General Footwear Co., </em>609 F.2d 655, 663 (2d Cir.1979); <em>Grotrian, Helfferich, Shulz, Th. Steinweg Nachf. v. Steinway &amp; Sons, </em>523 F.2d 1331, 1340-41 (2d Cir.1975); sales success, <em>see Harlequin Enterprises Ltd., supra, </em>644 F.2d at 949 n. 1; unsolicited media coverage of the product, <em>see id. </em>at 950; <em>Scarves By Vera, Inc., supra, </em>544 F.2d at 1174 (2d Cir.1976); attempts to plagiarize the mark, <em>see Harlequin Enterprises Ltd., supra, </em>644 F.2d at 950; <em>Perfect Fit Industries, Inc., supra, </em>618 F.2d at 954-55; and length and exclusivity of the mark\u2019s use, <em>see Saratoga Vichy Spring Co. v. Lehman, </em>491 F.Supp. 141, 150 (N.D.N.Y.1979), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>625 F.2d 1037 (2d Cir.1980); <em>American Footwear Corp., supra, </em>609 F.2d at 663. In assessing the existence of secondary meaning, no \u201csingle factor is determinative,\u201d <em>id., </em>and every element need not be proved. Each case, therefore, must be resolved by reference to the relevant factual calculus.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Although Thompson offered proof of secondary meaning, at trial \u2014 including its advertising expenditures, as well as increases in its sales revenues and market share, Judge Griesa made no finding on this issue. Accordingly, we remand to the district court so it may fully consider all evidence relevant to the issue of secondary meaning. If the district court rules that \u201cSportscreme\u201d has not acquired secondary meaning, the mark cannot be protected and the inquiry properly concludes. If, on the other hand, the court below finds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>\u201cSportscreme\u201d has acquired secondary meaning, it may proceed to consider whether Thompson has proved likelihood of confusion as to source and, if so, trademark infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\n<em>Likelihood of Confusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ape\">Although the court below found a likelihood of confusion as to source between \u201cSportscreme\u201d and \u201cBEN-GAY Sports-Gel,\u201d it did so based solely on the similarity of the marks and Thompson\u2019s priority of use. Such a conclusion represents a radical departure from this Court\u2019s unwavering adherence to the principles set forth in <em>Polaroid </em>and expanded by its progeny. As we cautioned in <em>Lever Bros. Co., supra, </em>693 F.2d at 253, \u201c[n]o single ... factor is preeminent, nor can the presence or absence of one determine, without analysis of the others, the outcome of the infringement suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Because Judge Griesa did not address the strength of Thompson\u2019s mark, the proximity of the marks, the sophistication of topical analgesic consumers, Pfizer\u2019s intent in selecting \u201cSportsGel\u201d as its mark, the chance that Thompson would bridge the gap into gel products and Thompson\u2019s delay in filing this infringement action, we believe his finding of likelihood of confusion was made precipitously.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Furthermore, we feel impelled to comment upon the two findings that were made by the district judge \u2014 the similarity of the marks and Thompson\u2019s priority of use. In finding the marks to be confusingly similar, the district court contrasted \u201cSportscreme\u201d with \u201cSportsGel,\u201d emphasizing their bisyllabic nature, as well as their identity of prefix. In so doing, Judge Griesa examined only a \u201cfragment\u201d of Pfizer\u2019s mark, instead of considering that \u201cSportsGel\u201d is linked prominently with the BEN-GAY line of products. <em>See Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd., </em>746 F.2d 112, 117 (2d Cir.1984); <em>Vi-tarroz, supra, </em>644 F.2d at 968-69; <em>McGre-gor-Doniger, supra, </em>599 F.2d at 1133-34; <em>Beech-Nut, Inc. v. Warner-Lambert, Co., </em>480 F.2d 801, 804 (2d Cir.1973). We believe a comparison of each mark in its entirety minimizes the likelihood of consumer confusion as to source.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Moreover, the trial judge held that Pfizer\u2019s duty as a second-comer to the sports rub market required it to select a mark that entirely avoided any possibility of confusion with Thompson\u2019s \u201cSportscreme.\u201d Pfizer\u2019s failure to do so, according to the district judge, buttressed the finding of trademark infringement. But, in so ruling, the court below misapplied the second-comer doctrine, which we have invoked only where there exists a highly distinctive mark of the senior user and proof of bad faith by the junior user.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See Spring Mills, Inc., supra, </em>698 F.2d at 1135-36. Neither requisite element was found by the district judge. Indeed, his conclusion that \u201cthe second-comer who knows about the name and package design and so forth of the first-comer has some obligation to name his product and design his packaging so as to avoid confusion,\u201d would, if applied, confer exclusive trademark protection to the first user of a mark, regardless of the mark\u2019s distinctiveness. Such a result would be inimical to the purposes of trademark law.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">In light of our views set forth in Section III, we find \u201cSportscreme\u201d to be a descriptive mark that is protected only if it has acquired secondary meaning. That issue must be determined by the trial court.. If the court finds that \u201cSportscreme\u201d has not acquired secondary meaning, the mark is not protected and no further inquiry is necessary. Only if the district court rules that \u201cSportscreme\u201d has acquired secondary meaning must it comprehensively examine the <em>Polaroid </em>factors to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>there exists a likelihood of confusion as to source.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Accordingly, we vacate the order granting the preliminary injunction, and remand to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-15\">.

At the hearing, Thompson introduced into evidence a survey that purported to measure consumer confusion between \"Sportscreme\u201d and \"BEN-GAY SportsGel.\u2019' The survey was conducted by telephone; consequently, the respondents were unable to examine the packages. Moreover, the questions asked referred to \"Sportscreme\" and \"SportsGel,\" omitting entirely any reference to BEN-GAY. The survey\u2019s conclusion that 22% of the respondents believed that a connection existed between \"Sport-screme\u201d and \u201cSportsGel\u201d was challenged during the course of the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\">.

Warner-Lambert Corp., </em>480 F.2d 801, 803 (2d Cir.1973). That the dispute in <em>Vibrant Sales </em>arose in the context of a design claimed to be a trademark, whereas the action in <em>Beech-Nut </em>involved a word mark provides a principled means of reconciling these superficially inconsistent holdings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b301-8\">.
