(Universe) appeals from a decision of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Griesa, J.) dismissing its federal and state claims alleging an infringement of its federally registered trademark and dilution of the value of that mark. Alfred Patrieelli, <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the dismissal of his counterclaims against Universe asserting malicious prosecution. In the continuing litigation between these beauty pageant promotors, it is clear that the competition is not confined to the contestants vying for fame and fortune. Universe and Patrieelli have been before us on three previous occasions. Since the previous decisions are relevant to the present appeal, they are briefly described.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Universe has been conducting and promoting the \u201cMiss Universe\u201d and \u201cMiss U.S. A.\u201d pageants since 1952. In 1966 Universe registered with the United States Patent Office the trademark \u201cMiss U.S.A.\u201d and the service marks \u201cMiss U.S.A.\u201d and \u201cMiss United States of America.\u201d The trademark \u201cMiss U.S.A. Beauty Pageant\u201d was registered in 1968. Universe\u2019s gross revenues from conducting beauty pageants are approximately $5 million and its annual net income is approximately a million and a half dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Patricelli was Universe\u2019s franchisee for the New England States from 1952 to 1961. In this role he conducted state beauty pageants to select contestants for the \u201cMiss U.S.A.\u201d contest. In 1959, while still a franchisee for Universe, Patricelli organized a national beauty contest to select an American contestant to the World Beauty Pageant in London, England. Patricelli used the title \u201cMiss U.S.A.-World Beauty Pageant\u201d to identify his contest. Universe sued to prevent trademark infringement, <em>Miss Universe, Inc. v. Patricelli, </em>271 F.Supp. 104 (D.Conn.1967), and obtained a temporary restraining order prohibiting Patricelli from using the term \u201cMiss U.S.A.World Beauty Pageant.\u201d On appeal, we affirmed but noted that Patricelli was not precluded from using a \u201ctitle descriptive of his contest to select a representative from the United States of America for the World Beauty Pageant in London, England, such as Miss World-U.S.A.\u201d <em>Miss Universe, Inc. v. Patricelli, </em>386 F.2d 997, 997 (2d Cir.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">Patricelli then commenced to use the mark \u201cMiss World-U.S.A.\u201d At a later trial on the merits, the district court, after determining that Universe\u2019s service and trademarks were valid and had acquired secondary meaning, concluded that confusion had occurred as a result of Patricelli\u2019s use of the title \u201cMiss World-U.S.A.\u201d Accordingly, it enjoined Patricelli\u2019s use of any terms confusingly similar to Universe\u2019s marks, including, \u201cMiss U.S.A.-World\u201d and \u201cMiss World-U.S.A.\u201d Again, we affirmed the district court insofar as it upheld Universe\u2019s mark and agreed with the district court\u2019s finding that the mark had acquired secondary meaning. <em>Miss Universe, Inc. v. Patricelli, </em>408 F.2d 506 (2d Cir.1969). Nonetheless, with respect to the likelihood of confusion, we concluded that the marks \u201cMiss U.S.A.\u201d and \u201cMiss World-U.S.A.\u201d do not share the same tendency for confusion. <em>Id. </em>at 511. Hence, we held that the injunction issued was too broad and reversed that part of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">Thus armed with two decisions in his favor, Patricelli continued to use the mark \u201cMiss World-U.S.A.\u201d until 1977 when Miss World decided not to continue him as its American franchisee. Patricelli then began his own beauty pageant using the title \u201cMiss Venus World U.S.A.\u201d Started in 1978, the Miss Venus pageant is held in Bridgeport, Connecticut once a year, and is unaffiliated with any international contest. Its annual revenue is approximately $24,-000. Patricelli was immediately sued by his former franchisor for using its registered trademark \u201cMiss World\u201d and enjoined from using the word \u201cWorld\u201d immediately preceding or following the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>\u201cMiss.\u201d This decision was affirmed on appeal, presumably because Patricelli was no longer the Miss World franchisee. <em>Mecca Limited v. Patricelli, </em>595 F.2d 1209 (2d Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">No longer using the word \u201cWorld\u201d, Pa-tricelli instead began using the title \u201cMiss Venus-U.S.A.\u201d to describe his Connecticut contest. In December 1979 Universe filed the present, fourth action against Patricel-li, alleging infringement of plaintiff\u2019s rights as defined by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1), infringement of trademark under the common law of New York, violation of \u00a7 43 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a), violation of the New York anti-dilution statute, section 368-b of the New York General Business Law, and violation of New York common law regarding unfair competition. Universe asserted that \u201cMiss Venus-U.S. A.\u201d is an infringement of the \u201cMiss U.S. A.\u201d trademark and sought injunctive relief against its use in connection with promotion of Patricelli\u2019s Bridgeport beauty pageant. Patricelli\u2019s answer to Universe\u2019s complaint asserted three counterclaims charging Universe with harassment and malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">At a pretrial conference, Judge Griesa determined that Patricelli\u2019s counterclaims could not survive a finding that Universe\u2019s claims were not frivolous. Therefore, he deferred consideration of the counterclaims until he heard plaintiff\u2019s claims. After a one-day bench trial the district judge dismissed the complaint and defendant\u2019s counterclaims, finding that there had been an insufficient showing of likelihood of confusion between the marks. Relying on our second decision in <em>Miss Universe v. Patri-celli, </em>408 F.2d 506, the trial judge held that \u201c[t]he slogan \u2018Miss Venus U.S.A.\u2019 has a different distinguishable major element from the slogan \u2018Miss U.S.A.\u2019 \u201d The evidence on actual likelihood of confusion was not persuasive since it was \u201cfragmentary indeed and very minor.\u201d The trial court also noted that the \u201cMiss U.S.A.\u201d contest has achieved a much higher degree of success than the \u201cMiss Venus-U.S.A.\u201d pageant, which indicates that \u201cthere is no real confusion and no substantial likelihood of confusion between the two slogans,\u201d nor can it (for the same reasons) be shown that there is likely to be a dilution in the value of Universe's mark as a result of Patricel-li\u2019s activities. Finally, Judge Griesa ruled that the malicious prosecution action alleged in Patricelli\u2019s counterclaims must be dismissed because plaintiff\u2019s suit had been brought in good faith. The counterclaims alleging harassment and interference with Patricelli\u2019s rights arising from plaintiff\u2019s contacting his sponsors and associates also fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">To establish liability in a trademark and tradename infringement case, the crucial issue is \u201cwhether there is any likelihood that an appreciable number of ordinarily prudent purchasers are likely to be misled, or indeed simply confused as to the source of the goods in question.\u201d <em>Mushroom Makers, Inc. v. R.G. Barry Corp., </em>580 F.2d 44, 47 (2d Cir.1978) <em>(per curiam), cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1116, 99 S.Ct. 1022, 59, L.Ed.2d 75 (1979). In assessing the likelihood of confusion, a consideration of the facts and circumstances of each case is necessary. <em>McGregor-Doniger, Inc. v. Drizzle Inc., </em>599 F.2d 1126, 1130 (2d Cir.1979). <em>See Buitoni Foods Corp. v. Gio. Buton &amp; C. S.p.A., </em>680 F.2d 290, 292-94 (2d Cir.1982); <em>Vitarroz Corp. v. Bordon, Inc., </em>644 F.2d 960, 965-67 (2d Cir.1981). To the extent that an assessment of \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d is based upon a comparison of the titles of the beauty pageants, a reviewing court is in as good a position to decide as the trial court. <em>Miss Universe, Inc. v. Patricelli, </em>408 F.2d at 509; <em>see Spring Mills, Inc. v. Ultracashmere House, Ltd., </em>689 F.2d 1127, 1130 (2d Cir.1982). Subject to the clearly erroneous test, the credibility and the weight given the testimony of the witnesses is of course for the trial judge. <em>RJR Foods, Inc. v. White Rock Corp., </em>603 F.2d 1058, 1061 n. 1 (2d Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>The only instances of confusion presented at this trial were minor, all easily cleared-up. In fact, it is less likely that there could be a showing of confusion here than in the <em>Miss Universe v. Patricelli </em>action brought in 1967. The word \u201cVenus,\u201d unlike the word \u201cWorld,\u201d cannot be so easily considered as modifying a \u201cprimary title,\u201d since the word \u201cVenus\u201d is a proper noun, not a modifier. <em>Cf. Miss Universe, Inc. v. Flesher, </em>433 F.Supp. 271, 274 (C.D.Cal.1977) (modifying adjective more likely to confuse than noun). Thus, \u201cVenus\u201d inserted between the words \u201cMiss\u201d and \u201cU.S.A.\u201d satisfied our requirement in <em>Miss Universe </em>that a different distinguishable major element be placed between the primary words allegedly infringed upon. <em>See </em>408 F.2d at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Universe argues that reliance on our 1969 opinion is misplaced since the \u201cMiss U.S.A.\u201d trademark has been strengthened considerably since that time. At trial Universe established that it had invested considerable resources in promotion and advertising to strengthen its mark, and had successfully defended its mark in numerous suits against infringement by pageant promoters. No doubt Universe has grown since 1969 and its mark is strong. Beyond that there is little to compare between Patricelli\u2019s regional beauty pageant and plaintiff\u2019s nationwide event. That competition resembles a sports engagement between a local high school team and a professional team. It is no contest. Nor is there proximity between the contests or evidence that Patricelli intends to expand. And plaintiff\u2019s name, \u201cMiss U.S. A.,\u201d is readily distinguishable from \u201cMiss Venus-U.S.A.\u201d The district court found that Patricelli\u2019s use of the title \u201cMiss Venus-U.S.A.\u201d was not likely to actually confuse the public, and that finding is not clearly erroneous. <em>See Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., </em>287 F.2d 492, 495 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 820, 82 S.Ct. 36, 7 L.Ed.2d 25 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The district court properly dismissed Universe\u2019s anti-dilution claim under the New York Anti-Dilution Statute, N.Y.Gen.Bus.Law \u00a7 368-d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In order to ensure protection and to mount a successful claim under \u00a7 368-d, a plaintiff must first have a trademark or name which is \u201ctruly of <em>distinctive </em>quality\u201d or one which has \u201cacquired a secondary meaning in the mind of the public,\u201d <em>Allied Maintenance Corp. v. Allied Mechanical Trades, Inc., </em>42 N.Y.2d 538, 546, 399 N.Y.S.2d 628, 369 N.E.2d 1162 (1977), and must prove a likelihood of dilution. \u201cTypically, dilution is characterized as a \u2018whittling down\u2019 of the identity or reputation of a tradename or mark.\u201d <em>Sally Gee, Inc. v. Myra Hogan, Inc., </em>699 F.2d 621, 625 (2d Cir.1983) (citations omitted). In the present case, Universe did not establish that Patricelli\u2019s use of \u201cMiss Venus-U.S.A.\u201d has weakened, blurred or diluted the degree of value or quality of the \u201cMiss U.S.A.\u201d mark. <em>Id. </em>at 625-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">The dismissal of Patricelli\u2019s counterclaims for malicious prosecution were also proper in light of the district court\u2019s finding that Universe had probable cause to believe it had a cause of action and that the suit was brought in good faith. <em>See Frolich v. Miles Laboratories, Inc., </em>316 F.2d 87, 88-89 (9th Cir.1963). \u201cA malicious prosecution is one that is begun in malice, without probable cause to believe it can succeed, and which finally ends in failure.\u201d <em>Burt v. Smith, </em>181 N.Y. 1, 5, 73 N.E. 495 (1905), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>203 U.S. 129, 27 S.Ct. 37, 51 L.Ed. 121 (1906). Ordinarily, it involves an interference with the claimant\u2019s person or property by resort to a provision<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>al remedy such as attachment, arrest or injunction. <em>See Williams v. Williams, </em>23 N.Y.2d 592, 596 n. 2, 298 N.Y.S.2d 473, 246 N.E.2d 333 (1969). To maintain an action for malicious prosecution, plaintiff must establish a lack of reasonable ground for defendant\u2019s prior prosecution. <em>See Heaney v. Purdy, </em>29 N.Y.2d 157, 160, 324 N.Y.S.2d 47, 272 N.E.2d 550 (1971). W. Prosser, <em>Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 120 (4th ed. 1971). The essential elements needed to sustain a malicious prosecution action are missing. Hence, Patricelli\u2019s counterclaim was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-5\">. New York\u2019s anti-dilution statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOq\">Likelihood of injury to business reputation or of dilution of the distinctive quality of a mark or trade name shall be a ground for injunctive relief in cases of infringement of a mark registered or not registered or in cases of unfair competition, notwithstanding the absence of competition between the parties or the absence of confusion as to the source of goods or services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA5\">N.Y.Gen.Bus.Law \u00a7 368-d (McKinney 1984).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
