Zant, </em>718 F.2d 979 (11th Cir.1983). In reaching our decision we adopted the district court\u2019s opinion, <em>Blake v. Zant, </em>513 F.Supp. 772 (S.D.Ga.1981), with respect to three issues, including Burger\u2019s claim that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">The Supreme Court granted certiorari limited to one aspect of that issue, <em>i.e., </em>Burger\u2019s claim that his trial counsel failed to investigate, prepare or present evidence for the sentencing phase of his capital trial. The Court concluded that the district court had apparently made a mistake in assessing the evidence on that aspect of the ineffectiveness of counsel issue. <em>Burger v. Zant, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2652, 81 L.Ed.2d 360 (1984). It therefore vacated and remanded to this court for reconsideration, particularly in light of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S.\u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 2653.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-15\">This court retained jurisdiction but remanded to the district court instructing it to extend or revise its findings and, if appropriate, its conclusions and judgment. <em>Burger v. Zant, </em>741 F.2d 1274 (11th Cir.1984). On remand the district court reexamined Burger\u2019s claim and on October 10, 1984, entered its order holding the same to be without merit. A copy of the district court\u2019s order is made an appendix to this opinion. Following entry of the district court\u2019s order we allowed counsel to supplement their prior briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-19\">Upon reconsideration, we again adopt the appended order of the district court as our own opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-20\">Our previous reversal of the district court\u2019s grant of the writ was based on the so called <em>Stephens </em>issue. 718 F.2d 981, 982. That issue is no longer before us. On the issue presently before us. we affirm the district court\u2019s holding that Burger\u2019s petition is without merit. Accordingly, we again remand to the district court with instructions that the writ be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-21\">REMANDED with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-22\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-23\">IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA BRUNSWICK DIVISION</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-24\">CHRISTOPHER BURGER, Petitioner</p>\n<p id=\"aoe-dedup-1\">v.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-25\">WARDEN ZANT, ET AL., Respondents CV280-114</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-26\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-27\">On limited remand from the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, this Court has before it the task of examining petitioner Christopher Burger\u2019s claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at his second capital sentencing trial. At that trial, petitioner received a sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-28\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-29\">Mr. Burger\u2019s crimes, trials, appeals and habeas proceedings are detailed elsewhere in the record of this case. <em>See Burger v. State, </em>242 Ga. 28, 247 S.E.2d 834 (1978) (murder conviction affirmed, sentence vacated, case remanded for resentencing), <em>Burger v. State, </em>245 Ga. 458, 265 S.E.2d 796 (1980) (death sentence affirmed), <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number><em>denied, </em>448 U.S. 913, 101 S.Ct. 31, 65 L.Ed.2d 1175 (1980), <em>Blake v. Zant, </em>513 F.Supp. 772, 787-803 (S.D.Ga.1981) (writ denied as to conviction but granted as to death sentence), <em>rev\u2019d, Burger v. Zant, </em>718 F.2d 979 (11th Cir.1983), <em>rehr\u2019g en banc denied, </em>726 F.2d 755 (11th Cir.1984), <em>vacated, Burger v. Zant, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2652, 81 L.Ed.2d 360 (1984) (remanded with instructions), <em>Burger v. Zant, </em>741 F.2d 1274 (11th Cir.1984) (limited remand to district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">Previously, this Court concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that petitioner was not denied effective assistance of counsel at his second sentencing trial. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed this Court as to this issue and adopted this Court\u2019s opinion as its own. <em>Burger v. Zant, </em>718 F.2d at 981. On appeal, the United States Supreme Court vacated the opinion of the Eleventh Circuit and instructed it \u201cto reconsider the effectiveness of counsel\u2019s assistance at petitioner\u2019s second sentencing and for further consideration in light of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S.\u2014 [104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674] (1984).\u201d 466 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The Supreme Court also noted that this Court may have mistaken the first sentencing transcript for the second sentencing transcript when it considered the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s decision not to present character evidence to the resentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">Thereafter, the Eleventh Circuit remanded the case to this Court, with instructions to \u201caddress the matter to which specific reference was made by the Supreme Court[.]\u201d 741 F.2d at 1275. The court of appeals also stated that this Court \u201cis not limited to that question and shall make such findings as it deems appropriate in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">II. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-11\">In its original decision, this Court examined petitioner\u2019s \u201cineffective assistance\u201d argument and enumerated six claims meriting discussion. 513 F.Supp. at 795. In light of the standards announced in <em>Washington, </em>this Court affirms its earlier decision as to claims two through four, as well as claim six; they provide no grounds for habeas relief. Claim one will be reexamined <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-15\">A. <em>Failure to Present Mitigating Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-16\">Turning to petitioner\u2019s fifth claim \u2014 that his counsel was ineffective because he failed to present mitigating evidence to the sentencing jury \u2014 the Court reviews the standards articulated in <em>Washington, supra, </em>and <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984). In <em>Washington, </em>the Supreme Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-19\">[established a two-prong test for analyzing ... [ineffective assistance] challenges. First, the defendant must establish that his counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. Once that threshold is crossed, the defendant must then demonstrate that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-20\"><em>Green v. Zant, </em>738 F.2d 1529, 1536 (11th Cir.1984) (hereafter, <em>Green)', see also Smith v. Wainwright, </em>741 F.2d 1248 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Douglas v. Wainwright, </em>739 F.2d 531, 533 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Boykins v. Wainwright, </em>737 F.2d 1539 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Solomon v. Kemp, </em>735 F.2d 395 (11th Cir.1984). \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome [of the trial].\u201d <em>Boykins, </em>at 1543, quoting <em>Washington, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2068. \u201cFurthermore, a defendant must satisfy both the performance and prejudice prongs to successfully demonstrate an ineffective assistance claim. <em>[Washington </em>], at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 2069. <em>Chadwick v. Green, </em>740 F.2d 897, 900 (11th Cir.1984) hereafter, Chadwick.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Courts need not ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>dress both of these components \u201cif the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\u201d <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 2069, 80 L.Ed. at 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">In addition, the <em>Washington </em>court emphasized that \u201ca substantial burden of proof rests on a defendant who advances such a claim; the challenged proceeding enjoys a \u2018strong presumption of reliability.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 2069.\u201d <em>Boykins, </em>at 1543.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-10\">Finally, the Eleventh Circuit noted in <em>Green </em>that its</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-11\">[o]wn cases have established that \u2018[ejffective assistance does not mean errorless assistance, nor counsel judged ineffective by hindsight,\u2019 <em>Goodwin v. Balk-com, </em>684 F.2d [794,] 804 [(11th Cir.1982) ], and our determination of whether petitioner was denied effective assistance \u2018must be based on the totality of circumstances in the entire record rather than on specific actions.\u2019 <em>United States v. Gibbs, </em>662 F.2d 728, 730 (11th Cir.1981). Thus, even if we agree that any of petitioner\u2019s complaints against his counsel is well founded, this does not necessarily mean that constitutionally ineffective assistance has been established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1020-12\">738 F.2d at 1536.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-13\">In its original Order, this Court did review the resentencing record but erroneously cited to the transcript of the first sentencing trial. Accordingly, the Court will again review the second sentencing transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-14\">As he did at the first sentencing trial, attorney Alvin Leaphart decided not to direct the jury\u2019s attention to character-oriented mitigation evidence at petitioner\u2019s second sentencing trial. (Federal Habeas Hearing Record, hereafter, \u201cR.\u201d 34, 73). Although he was aware of the fact that Georgia permits a broad scope of mitigating evidence to be admitted at capital sentencing trials (R. 34, 36), it was Leaphart\u2019s judgment \u201cthat the best approach was ... to argue the difference in [age between Burger and accomplice Thomas Stevens, as well as] the difference in their participation in the crime.\u201d (R. 34). In addition, he sought to \u201cmake the District Attorney prove his case[,]\u201d (R. 18) by using the rules of evidence \u201cto prevent [the prosecution] from doing so.\u201d (R. 18). The trial record reflects this strategy. <em>See, e.g., </em>Tr. 65, 67, 95-6, 106-7, 109, 111, 117, 136, 180-181, 185-191.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-19\">Apparently in recognition of the range of evidence the State is permitted to present at sentencing trials <em>(see </em>note 6 <em>infra), </em>in addition to the strength of the evidence against his client, Leaphart decided to rely primarily on his closing argument to the jury. In his argument, Leaphart illuminated the acts of co-indictee Stevens<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and minimized Burger\u2019s involvement in the murder and related crimes. He fully emphasized the fact that Stevens was twenty years old at the time of the crime, while Burger was only seventeen; that Stevens, the chief architect of the crimes, had considerable influence over petitioner. (Tr. 251, 253). He enumerated, as he did at the first sentencing trial, the series of criminal acts committed by Stevens in contrast to the relatively fewer acts committed by Burger, who \u201cwas only following Stevens.\u201d (Tr. 250-255).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-20\">Next, Leaphart attempted to stimulate the jurors\u2019 religious sensitivities. (Tr. 256). He also argued that an \u201ceye for an eye\u201d was a notion popular with the people of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>Moses and of the old testament, but not with the people of today.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Tr. 257-258).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">Leaphart concluded his closing argument by re-emphasizing the contrast between the acts of Stevens and Burger, then asking the jury \u201c[w]hat would Jesus Christ do if he were sitting in our shoes today?\u201d (Tr. 259).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">The outline above reflects the best strategy Leaphart felt was available to him. Interviews with Burger (R. 37), Burger\u2019s mother (R. 37, 44) and an attorney who had befriended Burger and his mother (R. 44), in addition to his consultation with a psychologist<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (R. 44, 50) and review of psychologists\u2019 reports obtained through Burger\u2019s mother (R. 35-36, 44), convinced Leap-hart that a more exhaustive investigation into Burger\u2019s background would not be a profitable pursuit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He also concluded that presenting background and character evidence to the sentencing jury would have been at best unproductive (R. 34, 52), and at worst, harmful to his client (R. 73).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Leaphart decided to keep his client off the stand for a number of reasons. He testified that he was not able to keep Burger from talking about his crime to others. (R. 65). He believed that Burger enjoyed talking about the crime, <em>id., </em>and he feared that petitioner would gloat about it on the stand. (R. 66). He did not believe that Burger\u2019s mother would be able to provide testimony sufficiently useful to warrant calling her to the stand. \u201c[Sjhe could not add anything ... other than being a mother and saying I don\u2019t want you to put my child in jail, or in the electric chair.\u201d (R. 68). He also feared that during cross-examination she would disclose unfavorable information about her son. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-13\">In <em>Cape v. Francis, </em>741 F.2d 1287 (11th Cir.1984), another Georgia state prisoner under sentence of death also sought habeas relief by alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty stage of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-14\">The Eleventh Circuit did</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-15\">[n]ot detect any semblance of ineffectual representation during the penalty stage of the trial to support Cape\u2019s charge that his lawyer did not present sufficient mitigating evidence. Counsel investigated potential mitigating evidence and presented that which he felt would reflect favorably to his client. The mere fact that other witnesses might have been available or that other testimony might have been elicited from those who testified is not sufficient ground to prove ineffectiveness of counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-17\">It is true Cape\u2019s counsel presented some mitigating evidence while in the instant case petitioner\u2019s counsel presented no mitigating evidence. It is also true, however, that Leaphart\u2019s conversations with Burger, Burger\u2019s mother and family friend, together with his study of psychologists\u2019 reports, indicated to him that further investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>into this area would have been fruitless. Furthermore, and especially in light of his perception of Burger\u2019s personality, Leap-hart, who had represented other death penalty defendants (R. 30, 58-59), feared opening the door to needless illumination of contrary character evidence by the prosecution on cross-examination. This Court\u2019s inquiry is therefore properly focused on the reasonableness of Leaphart\u2019s investigation and decision regarding this rejected strategy. In that regard,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-4\">[strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchangeable; and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support <em>the limitations on investigation. </em>In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\"><em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 695 (emphasis added). Further focusing on what \u201climitations on investigation\u201d would be evaluated in assessing the reasonableness of an attorney\u2019s performance, the Supreme Court emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-7\">[wjhen a defendant has given counsel reason to believe that pursuing certain investigations would be fruitless or even harmful, counsel\u2019s failure to pursue those investigations may not later be challenged as unreasonable. In short, inquiry into counsel\u2019s conversations with the defendant may be critical to a proper assessment of counsel\u2019s investigation decisions, just as it may be critical to a proper assessment of counsel\u2019s other litigation decisions. See <em>United States v. DeCoster, </em>624 F.2d [196] at 209-210 [(D.C.Cir.1976)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\"><em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 2066-2067, 80 L.Ed.2d at 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">Leaphart testified that Burger never gave him the names of any witnesses that might have been helpful to him at trial. (R. 63). Despite this, Leaphart did consult, as mentioned above, with Burger\u2019s mother and volunteer \u201cbig brother,\u201d (R. 77) and reviewed reports written by Burger\u2019s former psychologists. He was unable to unearth background information sufficiently helpful to warrant further investigation, nor to sway his decision not to emphasize petitioner\u2019s character at the second sentencing trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-11\">Petitioner Washington, like petitioner Burger, also confessed to, <em>inter alia, </em>his involvement in the crimes of kidnapping and murder. Unlike Burger, Washington had pleaded guilty and relied on an earlier plea colloquy with the sentencing judge, who had commended Washington for taking responsibility for his crimes. In both cases, however, defense counsel were faced with evidence of their clients\u2019 confessions, the overwhelming strength of the evidence against their clients and aggravating circumstances surrounding the crimes. In preparing for the sentencing hearing in <em>Washington, </em>counsel spoke with the defendant\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-12\">wife and mother, though he did not follow up on the one unsuccessful effort to meet with them. He did not otherwise-seek out character witnesses for respondent. [cit]. Nor did he request a psychiatric examination, since his conversations with his client gave no indication that respondent had psychological problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-13\">466 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 2057, 80 L.Ed.2d at 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-15\">As in the instant case, Washington\u2019s \u201c[c]ounsel decided to look no further for evidence concerning respondent\u2019s character and emotional state. That decision reflected <em>[inter alia,] </em>trial counsel\u2019s sense of hopelessness about overcoming the eviden-tiary effect of respondent\u2019s confessions to the gruesome crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[t]rial counsel could reasonably surmise from his conversations with [his client] that character and psycho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>logical evidence would be of little help____ Restricting testimony on [Washington\u2019s] character to what had come in at the plea colloquy ensured that contrary character and psychological evidence and [Washington\u2019s] criminal history, which counsel had successfully moved to exclude, would not come in.\u201d 466 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 2071, 80 L.Ed.2d at 701.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, the mitigating evidence \u201c[a]t most show[ed] that numerous people who knew [Washington] thought he was generally a good person and that a psychiatrist and a psychologist believed he was under considerable emotional stress that did not rise to a level of extreme disturbance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">In the instant case, counsel was faced with evidence of not only Burger\u2019s signed, but sworn confession (Tr. 151-153), to participation in a gruesome crime. This evidence was bolstered by, <em>inter alia, </em>eyewitness and tangible evidence. The crime included petitioner\u2019s depraved act of asking the victim if he \u201cwas all right\u201d before petitioner drowned him. Similar to the setting in <em>Washington, </em>counsel in the instant case was convinced from what he learned from his investigation that no productive result would obtain from further pursuing Burger\u2019s background, even in light of Leaphart\u2019s knowledge that Burger had come from a broken home, <em>see Griffin v. Wainwright, </em>588 F.2d 1549, 1562 (M.D.Fla. 1984), and that emphasizing character evidence would be the wrong strategy to employ. This judgment is not unreasonable, especially in light of the fact that calling a character witness to the stand is not without risk; there are, almost invariably, unknown poisons to be hatched out of the mud by way of cross examination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number><em>e.g., Knighton v. Maggio, </em>740 F.2d 1344, 1448 (5th Cir.1984) (defense counsel not ineffective when he made \u201cthe value judgment that the gain to be expected from the favorable testimony of family witnesses would not justify the risk of the potential harm from unfavorable testimony expected on cross-examination.\u201d). The reasonableness of the decision should be viewed not in hindsight, but primarily in light of the information supplied by the defendant. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 2067, 80 L.Ed.2d at 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">In <em>Collins v. Francis, </em>728 F.2d 1322 (11th Cir.1984), Collins contended that his</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATJp\">counsel was ineffective because he failed to investigate for possible use at the sentencing phase of his trial any evidence of mitigating circumstances. [Collins] allege[d] that counsel failed to look into his character and the record and the background of his family. He also allege[d] that counsel failed to contact his relatives and friends regarding testimony they might have been able to give on the issues of guilt or punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">Collins pointed to affidavits from friends who said they would have vouched for his good character at the trial. Collins\u2019 counsel stated \u201cthat Collins never gave him the names of such friends; consequently, he made no attempt to uncover any[,]\u201d <em>(id.) </em>and the habeas court gave credence to counsel\u2019s testimony.

Zant, </em>718 F.2d at 987-991 (Johnson, J., dissenting), the Court will revisit its earlier conclusion. This claim is best analyzed by first examining what was and was not actually present in this litigation. As noted above, Burger and coindictee Stevens were tried separately. Each was represented by appointed counsel. Burger\u2019s counsel did employ a strategy adverse to Stevens\u2019 interests when he emphasized Stevens\u2019 greater culpability in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-12\">On the other hand, Stevens\u2019 counsel was also Leaphart\u2019s partner, Robert B. Smith. (R. 13-14). It is undisputed that the two lawyers made no attempt to construct a \u201cChinese Wall\u201d between themselves. In fact, in varying degrees, they worked together on both cases at the trial and appellate levels. (R. 18, 40-41). Smith sat in with Leaphart on Burger\u2019s case, but Leap-hart did not involve himself with Stevens\u2019 trial, which followed Burger\u2019s. (R. 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-14\">Leaphart was questioned on what effect, if any, his collaboration with Smith had on his resolve to represent Burger.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-15\">THE COURT: Did you pull any punches in order to protect Stevens?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-16\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-17\">THE COURT: If crucifying Stevens would have helped Burger, would you have done it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-19\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-20\">Q. Did you do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-21\">A. Didn\u2019t have the opportunity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-22\">(R. 53).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-23\">As mentioned above, Leaphart did emphasize Stevens\u2019 greater culpability in the crime. He also investigated Stevens to ascertain what, if anything, might be useful to his defense of Burger. (R. 54). In addition, he constantly attempted to plea bargain with the prosecutor in the case. (R. 65). However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-24\">A. [d]uring the first trial [the prosecutor] just flatly refused to even discuss it in any terms. And, then when we got it reversed on the sentence feature I continued to \u2014 in that time to try to negotiate with the \u2014 the district attorney about entering a plea, for Mr. Burger to serve a life sentence. And, he insisted on trying it and insisted on seeking the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-25\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-26\">The prosecutor\u2019s flat refusal-to engage in plea bargaining is not surprising when viewed in light of the strength of the case against Burger. As mentioned above, this evidence included Burger\u2019s signed, sworn confession (Tr. 151-153), which was coupled with a <em>Miranda </em>waiver (Tr. 201-203), along with eyewitness and tangible evidence. In addition, there is no suggestion that this evidence was not available to be used against Stevens. This background provides suitable perspective to the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>ing examination by petitioner\u2019s federal ha-beas attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-5\">Q. Mr. Leaphart, did at any time during the representation did you talk to the District Attorney about the possibility of Mr. Leaphart (sic) testifying against Mr. Stevens?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-6\">A. You mean Mr. Burger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-7\">Q. Mr. Burger, excuse me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-8\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-9\">Q. There was no discussion of his testimony in exchange for a lighter sentence for Mr. Burger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-10\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1027-11\">(R. 38-39).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-12\">Since the prosecution \u201cflatly refused to even discuss\u201d plea bargaining, it follows that Leaphart would not have talked to the prosecutor about offering his client\u2019s testimony against Stevens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-13\">Leaphart testified that at no time did he believe a conflict of interest to exist in the case during the trials and appeals. (R. 62). Finally, the conflict of interest issue was never raised at the trial level. (R. 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-14\">The standards for reviewing a conflict of interest claim are well settled.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-15\">For a conflict of interest to cause representation to fail Sixth Amendment standards, the conflict must be actual, not speculative. <em>United States v.

Judge Johnson stated that Leaphart and Smith acted as one attorney; that Leaphart in effect represented both Burger and Stevens. 718 F.2d at 988. Setting aside the fact that Burger and Stevens received separate trials, the Court turns to <em>United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339 (5th Cir.1984), where the Fifth Circuit stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-20\">\u201c[a] conflict of interest is present whenever one defendant stands to gain significantly by counsel adducing probative evidence or advancing plausible arguments that are damaging to a codefendant whom counsel is also representing.\u201d [cits].

Although it may be said that the two attorneys at times acted as one while each prepared for trial and appeal, any inducement of Leaphart to actively represent conflicting interests\u2014 \u201cto pull any punches\u201d in his representation of Burger \u2014 would be at best speculative, not actual.

In fact, Leaphart testified that he neither felt nor recognized the existence of a conflict of interest when he represented Burger. (R. 62).

In response to questions aimed at illuminating Leaphart\u2019s overall knowledge and capabilities in handling criminal cases, Leaphart indicated that \"[i)n the trial in the <em>original [i.e., </em>guilt/innocent phase of the] casef,]\u201d he felt that the presentation of witness testimony would not have been worth the loss of his ability to open and close during the final argument phase of the trial.

A review of the record reveals that Burger was denied the effective assistance of counsel by both his appointed counsel\u2019s active representation of his co-indictee\u2019s conflicting interest and his counsel\u2019s failure to present any evidence on his behalf at either of his two sentencing proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">The general principles applicable to ineffective assistance of counsel claims were articulated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>See also King v. Strickland, </em>748 F.2d 1462 (11th Cir.1984). To demonstrate that the assistance provided by counsel was so deficient as to require reversal, a defendant must make a two-pronged showing. First, he must demonstrate that his counsel made errors so serious that he was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 2064. Such errors must be outside the generous range given to \u201creasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2066. Second, the defendant must demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the deficient performance. To meet this portion of his burden, defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Id. </em>at 2068. A court reviewing an ineffective assistance claim, however, must bear in mind that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-14\">the ultimate focus of inquiry must be on the fundamental fairness of the proceeding. In every case the court should be concerned with whether, despite the strong presumption of reliability, the result of the particular proceeding is unreliable because of a breakdown in the adversarial process that our system relies on to produce just results.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1028-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-16\">The Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>also considered the showing that is required when a defendant argues that counsel was ineffective by reason of conflict of interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Where counsel breaches the duty of loyalty to his client, a limited presumption of prejudice applies. <em>Strickland v. Washington, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2067; <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 345-350, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1716-1719, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980). Prejudice is presumed if the defendant can demonstrate that counsel \u201cactively represented conflicting interests\u201d and \u201cthat an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2067; <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, supra, </em>446 U.S. at 350, 348, 100 S.Ct. at 1719, 1718.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-17\">Turning first to Burger\u2019s conflict of interest claim, the record is clear that Burger\u2019s counsel actively represented both Burger and Stevens. Both Burger and Stevens were charged with and indicted for the murder of Roger Honeycutt. Both were appointed counsel by the trial court at approximately the same time. Burger\u2019s appointed counsel, Leaphart, and Stevens\u2019 appointed counsel, Smith, were partners in a two-partner law firm. At the federal habe-as hearing, Leaphart testified that he inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>viewed both Burger and Stevens. Leap-hart also testified that he assisted Smith in the preparation of Stevens\u2019 case and that Smith assisted him in the preparation of Burger\u2019s case. Both lawyers discussed the issues involved in each case and researched the law together.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Smith and Leaphart collaborated in preparing the briefs for both Burger and Stevens on each defendant\u2019s first appeal to the Supreme Court of Georgia; Leaphart testified that he \u201cprimarily\u201d prepared the briefs for Burger and Stevens on the second appeal to the Supreme Court of Georgia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The fee received by each attorney for representing each client was deposited in the law firm\u2019s corporate account. At no time in his representation of Burger did Leaphart or the trial court ever inform Burger of a possible conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">Whether analyzed as a situation where one attorney, Leaphart, represented both Burger and Stevens,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or where one law firm represented both Burger and Stevens,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the end result was that Leaphart was actively involved in the defense of both to the extent that a conflict of interest was clearly established.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-11\">Although multiple representation is the paradigm context in which conflict of interest claims arise,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a finding of multiple representation alone does not establish ineffective assistance of counsel. The conflict must be shown to be actual, not merely speculative, before representation will violate Sixth Amendment standards. <em>Baty v. Balkcom, </em>661 F.2d 391, 397 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981). \u201cAn actual conflict of interest occurs when a defense attorney places himself in a situation \u2018inherently conducive to divided loyalties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zuck v. </em>Alabama, 588 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>F.2d 436, 439 (5th Cir.1979) <em>(quoting Castillo v. Estelle, </em>504 F.2d 1243, 1245 (5th Cir.1974)); <em>see also Baty v. Balkcom, supra, </em>661 F.2d at 397 (\u201c[a]n actual conflict of interest exists if counsel\u2019s introduction of probative evidence or plausible arguments that would significantly benefit one defendant would damage the defense of another whom the same counsel is representing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">In this case the fundamental issue framed by counsel was not Burger\u2019s guilt but the extent of his culpability. At the habeas corpus hearing, Leaphart exhaustively reviewed the evidence that the extent of Burger\u2019s culpability was less than that of Stevens.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In sum, this evidence was as follows. At the time the crime was committed, Burger was seventeen; Stevens was twenty. Burger has \u00e1n I.Q. of 82 and possible brain damage. Stevens appeared to be the leader in their relationship; Burger was the follower. Stevens planned and initiated the robbery of the victim; Burger followed his instructions. Stevens actually committed the robbery; Stevens made the victim undress; Stevens forced the victim to perform oral sodomy on Stevens; Stevens anally sodomized the victim; Stevens tied the victim up and forced him to get in the trunk of the cab. Stevens told Burger they would have to kill him; Burger said he didn\u2019t want to kill him. Stevens told Burger they would have to get rid of the cab by driving it into the pond; Stevens ordered Burger to drive the cab with the victim locked in the trunk into the pond. Burger drove the cab and the victim into the pond. In short, the essence of Burger\u2019s defense was that he was less culpable than Stevens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">In this situation, any evidence or arguments made by counsel in Burger\u2019s behalf would, by the very nature of Burger\u2019s defense, damage Stevens. Such adversity in the interests of Leaphart\u2019s clients demonstrates that an actual conflict of interest existed. <em>See Zuck v. Alabama, supra, </em>588 F.2d at 439 (adversity sufficient to demonstrate actual conflict of interest exists if \u201cthe attorney owes a duty to the defendant to take some action that could be detrimental to his other client\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">The evidence provided by petitioner also demonstrates that this conflict \u201cadversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2052. On several occasions, Leap-hart refrained from taking actions in support of Burger that would have been detrimental to Stevens. For example, at no time in his representation of Burger did Leaphart offer Burger\u2019s testimony against Stevens in exchange for a sentence less than the death penalty for Burger.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Baty v. Balkcom, supra, </em>661 F.2d at 397 N. 12 (\u201c[p]lea bargains are perhaps the most obvious example of the manifest effects of a conflict of interest at pretrial proceedings.\u201d); <em>see also Flaming v. State, </em>246 Ga. 90, 270 S.E.2d 185, 189 (Bowles, J., concurring) (\u201c[n]o two defendants share equal responsibility for a crime. Usually one is more culpable than the other or for any number of reasons has a greater degree of responsibility for what occurred. One may also be more entitled to leniency based on such factors as age, intelligence, motive, background, previous conduct or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>record, etc. Common counsel eliminates any practical possibility of plea bargaining.\u201d). The district attorney\u2019s disinclination to plea bargain did not stop Leaphart from \u201cconstantly attempting\u201d to bargain for a life sentence; there is no reason why it should have deterred him from making the more attractive offer of Burger\u2019s testimony against Stevens. Moreover, at Burger\u2019s trial Stevens was not called as a witness by the defense. Finally, Leaphart prepared the briefs for both Burger and Stevens on each defendant\u2019s second appeal to the Supreme Court of Georgia. In Burger\u2019s brief, Leaphart does not argue that he was the less culpable party, although the scope of the Supreme Court of Georgia\u2019s appellate review in capital cases includes a consideration of whether the \u201csentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d O.C.G.A. 17-10-35(c)(3) (1982), formerly Ga.Code Ann. 27-2537(e)(3) (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">Once a defendant has made the two showings required by <em>Strickland v. Washington, supra, </em>prejudice is presumed. 104 S.Ct. at 2067. <em>See also Westbrook v. Zant, </em>704 F.2d 1487, 1499 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Baty v. Balkcom, supra, </em>661 F.2d at 395 (\u201cwhen counsel is confronted with an actual conflict of interest, prejudice must be presumed, and except under the most extraordinary circumstances, the error cannot be considered harmless\u201d) <em>(quoting Turnquest v. Wainwright, </em>651 F.2d 331, 334 (5th Cir.1981)). Even accepting the district court\u2019s finding, adopted by the majority in this case, that Leaphart did not \u201ctailor[] his [trial] strategy toward protecting Stevens,\u201d there is sufficient evidence of an actual conflict and of tangible adverse effect on Leaphart\u2019s performance to establish a Sixth Amendment violation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">Burger also argues that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because Leaphart failed adequately to investigate possible mitigating evidence or to present <em>any </em>evidence, in mitigation or otherwise, at either of his two sentencing proceedings. Counsel\u2019s duty of effective representation continues into the sentencing phase of his client. <em>See Stanley v. Zant, </em>697 F.2d 955, 963 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201cThe special importance of the capital sentencing proceeding gives rise to a duty on the part of defense counsel to be prepared for that crucial phase of the trial.\u201d). At the core of the duty of effective representation is the \u201cindependent duty to investigate and prepare.\u201d <em>Goodwin v. Balkcom, </em>684 F.2d 794, 805 (11th Cir.1982). To fulfill this obligation, counsel must make reasonable investigations or make a reasonable decision that makes further investigation unnecessary. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2066. An examination of the relevant facts suggests that Leaphart failed in both his duty of investigation and his duty of representation at the sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">The district court found that Leaphart\u2019s investigation into available mitigating evidence consisted solely of conversations with Burger\u2019s mother and an attorney who had befriended her. Although the content of those conversations and the identity of possible character witnesses were not clear, the district court concluded that Leaphart made \u201cadequate if hardly ideal inquiries\u201d and that his \u201cinvestigation appears to meet at least minimal professional standards.\u201d Such an investigation should not be characterized as reasonable or substantial. Moreover, even the scant amount of information which was unearthed through Leaphart\u2019s investigation was not presented in the proceeding itself. Nor can it be said that Leaphart\u2019s choice to curtail investigation and to present no evidence at the sentencing proceedings was a reasonable strategic decision based on reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>assumptions. Leaphart has attempted to justify his approach by reference to three strategies or assumptions: 1) that Leap-hart\u2019s theory of defense, or strategy, was to make the state prove its case; 2) that, if mitigating evidence had been offered at Burger\u2019s sentencing proceedings, Leaphart would have lost the right to opening and closing argument; and 3) that Leaphart chose to rely in closing on the argument that Burger had never been in trouble before, which would have been undercut by an investigation into and testimony concerning Burger\u2019s background. Even conceding that broad range must be given to the operation of professional judgment, <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2065-66, none of these strategies or assumptions withstand scrutiny for reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">Leaphart testified concerning his strategy or theory of defense in Burger\u2019s case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ay9-dedup-0\">Well, of course, my theory of defense was of course trying to make the District attorney prove his case. And my theory of defense was to \u2014 well, that in effect in essence what it was. And, use whatever rules of evidence and to prevent him from doing so.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">And, specifically concerning the second trial solely on the issue of penalty, Leaphart again testified that he \u201cfelt that case should have been tried on the facts and make the District Attorney \u2014 I say make him, use whatever rules of evidence to exclude those harmful facts.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The law provides that the state must prove its case, whether defense counsel is present or not. Relying on the state\u2019s case is not a \u201cstrategy\u201d for the defense, but rather reflects an abandonment of counsel\u2019s obligation to develop a case for his client. This proffered strategy is tantamount to no strategy at all; and reliance on such a strategy in a capital sentencing proceeding, as an alternative to investigating and presenting available mitigating evidence, is patently unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-10\">Second, Leaphart testified that he made a decision not to offer any evidence in mitigation in order to preserve his right to opening and closing arguments. Again, the basic assumption on which this strategy was based is patently unreasonable. O.C.G.A. 17-10-2(a) &amp; (c) (1982), formerly Ga.Code Ann. 27-2503(a) &amp; (c) (1933), provide for the conduct of sentencing proceedings in capital cases: \u201cThe district attorney shall open and the defendant or his counsel shall conclude the argument.\u201d The presentation of evidence by the defendant at a capital sentencing proceeding in no way affects this division of argument between the state and the defense. In fact, this procedure was followed at Burger\u2019s sentencing proceedings: the district attorney opened and the defense closed final arguments to the jury. Leaphart simply failed to inform himself of basic Georgia criminal procedure in sentencing proceedings. <em>Cf. Young v. Zant, </em>677 F.2d 792 (11th Cir.1982). No strategy based on such a false assumption is reasonable. The district court clearly erred in concluding otherwise.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-11\">The district court also found that Leap-hart\u2019s failure to substantially investigate mitigating evidence was based on a strategic choice to rely in closing argument on the \u201cmajor argument\u201d in Burger\u2019s behalf that he had no prior record of violent crime and had never been in trouble before. As it relates to Burger\u2019s second sentencing proceeding, this finding is contradicted by the record: at no point in his closing argument did Leaphart mention the lack of evidence that Burger had a record or had been in trouble before. Instead, Leaphart\u2019s closing argument at the second sentencing proceeding stressed Burger\u2019s comparative lack of culpability and asked for the jury\u2019s mercy. This argument would not have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>undercut by the presentation of humanizing evidence concerning Burger\u2019s background.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">In short, Leaphart\u2019s decision neither to conduct substantial investigation nor to present any evidence at the sentencing pro-, ceedings was not a reasonable strategic choice. It was, moreover, readily distinguishable from the choices made by attorneys in those cases relied upon by the district court. In <em>Cape v. Francis, </em>741 F.2d 1287 (11th Cir.), the district court found that petitioner\u2019s attorney presented some mitigating evidence during the sentencing proceeding; and in <em>Strickland v. Washington, supra, </em>petitioner\u2019s attorney relied on character testimony that had come in at an earlier plea colloquoy. 104 S.Ct. at 2071. Leaphart\u2019s presentation of no evidence in the instant case is different; it represented an error \u201cso serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2064.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">But the Sixth Amendment inquiry does not end with a finding of unreasonable performance by counsel. Burger may prevail only if he shows both a denial of effective assistance and actual prejudice to the course of his defense. <em>Id. </em>In this case, however, prejudice is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">At the federal habeas hearing, Burger offered the testimony of his mother and numerous affidavits concerning his troubled childhood and background. This evidence demonstrated that Burger\u2019s parents had been married when his mother was fourteen and his father was sixteen. His parents divorced when he was a child. Neither parent wanted Burger and his childhood was spent being shuffled between the two. His father threw him out of the house; his mother sent him back to live with his father. Burger\u2019s mother remarried. Burger\u2019s stepfather beat Burger, and beat Burger\u2019s mother in his presence; Burger\u2019s stepfather involved him in drugs and alcohol when he was eleven years old. Burger\u2019s mother and stepfather moved from Indiana to Florida. Burger was sent to live with his father. Burger\u2019s father beat him and refused to have anything to do with him. Burger ran away and hitchhiked to Florida to live with his mother, selling his shoes to buy food along the way. When Burger arrived barefoot in Florida, his stepfather told him he could not stay with them. Burger\u2019s mother told juvenile authorities that she didn\u2019t want him, and to send him back to his father in Indiana. When Burger arrived in Indiana, his father locked him out of the house. Burger was taken in by a neighbor, as he had nowhere else to go. The clinical psychologist who examined Burger testified at a motion hearing that Burger had an I.Q. of 82 and possible brain damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-9\">I cannot accept the holding that the failure to present this evidence was not prejudicial to Burger. The district court found that, although the affidavits of the character witnesses supplied by Burger at the hearing do \u201ccontain references to a difficult childhood which might have created some sympathy for Mr. Burger,\u201d they also contained references to drug abuse, juvenile probation and violence. However, the thrust of the character testimony offered by Burger was not that Burger was a model citizen, but that Burger\u2019s personality and motivation could be explained by his unusually stormy childhood. Although this is precisely the kind of humanizing evidence that \u201cmay make a critical difference, especially in a capital case,\u201d <em>Stanley v. Zant, supra, </em>697 F.2d at 969, Leaphart elected neither to conduct further investigation nor to use the evidence at the sentencing proceeding. Having heard the state\u2019s case, unmitigated by any evidence presented on behalf of petitioner, two sentencing juries recommended the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-10\">Failure to present this substantial, available mitigating evidence meets the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland v. Washington, supra. </em>In fact Leaphart\u2019s failure to investigate or to present evidence on his client\u2019s behalf is an apt example of the kind of \u201cbreakdown in the adversarial process,\u201d <em>id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>at 2069, that requires a reviewing court to find the results of a proceeding unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">For these reasons, I would reverse the district court\u2019s finding that Burger was afforded the effective assistance of counsel during his state court proceedings and remand this case with directions to grant the writ.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1028-12\">. The Sixth Amendment guarantee of effective assistance of counsel necessarily includes the guarantee of conflict-free counsel. <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 70, 62 S.Ct. 457, 464, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v.

The warden-appellant argues that the conflict of interest cases relied upon by Burger are inapposite as involving the representation of multiple defendants by one attorney. Here, appellant contends, Burger and Stevens were represented by \"separate\u201d attorneys. This argument is contrary to the facts as reflected by the record. Leaving aside the fact that Leaphart and Smith were partners in the practice of law, the attorneys here were each active in the defense of the other\u2019s client and \"seem to have viewed themselves as a defense 'team' acting on behalf of [both] of the accused.\" <em>United States ex rel.

From this account, it appears that plea negotiations were entered into in this case; that Leaphart never offered Burger\u2019s testimony against Stevens; and that, after Burger\u2019s first trial had begun, the district attorney refused to discuss a plea on whatever terms Leaphart had offered, presumably not the terms of Burger\u2019s testifying against Stevens since Leaphart testified he did not at any time make such an offer. Thus, appellant\u2019s argument that no <em>pretrial </em>conflict of interest could have arisen due to the district attorney\u2019s refusal to plea bargain is contradicted by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">. The district court appears to take the position that it would not be possible to make a full demonstration of prejudice of the type, for example, that is required for general ineffective assistance claims under <em>Strickland v. Washington. </em>Whether or not such a showing would be possible is not relevant, however, to the issue of conflict of interest. In conflict of interest cases, as noted above, a limited presumption applies on a showing of some \"adverse effect\u201d on the lawyer\u2019s performance, which has been amply demonstrated in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">.

The district court's explanation that Leap-hart\u2019s rationale was appropriate in the context of the culpability trial provides no justification for its application in the context of a sentencing proceeding where, as noted above, the Georgia procedural rules are different.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
