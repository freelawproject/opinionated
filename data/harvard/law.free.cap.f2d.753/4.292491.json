Dolata and Robert A. Dolata seek review of a decision of the Railroad Retirement Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) denying them a residual lump-sum death benefit payable to them as survivors of their brother, Michael R. Dolata, under Section 6(c)(l)(v) of the Railroad Retirement Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231e(c)(l)(v) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">We reverse and remand with directions to award them the benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">The pertinent facts of this case are not in dispute. Leon S. Dolata and Robert A. Dolata are the only siblings and, except for a natural child, the only close relatives of Michael R. Dolata. In 1959, Elizabeth Marie Dolata was born of Michael Dolata\u2019s marriage to Marianne Elizabeth Ptak. Michael and Marianne were divorced in 1965. On January 13, 1970, an order of adoption was entered in the Erie County, New York Surrogate\u2019s Court, under which Elizabeth was adopted by her natural mother and her new husband, Charles F. Fraresso. Under New York law, N.Y.Dom.Rel.L. \u00a7 117 (McKinney 1977), that adoption terminated the legal relationship of parent and child between Michael Dolata and Elizabeth Fraresso.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-17\">Michael Dolata, who was a railroad employee insured under the Railroad Retirement Act, died on December 4, 1979, leaving a lump-sum death benefit to be paid under Section 6(c) of the Railroad Retirement Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231e(c). He left no surviving widow, parent, grandchild, or grandparent. Elizabeth Fraresso applied for the lump-sum benefit on June 1, 1981, and the petitioners applied for the same benefit on November 23, 1981. The Bureau of Retirement Claims paid Elizabeth the benefit and denied the petitioners\u2019 claim. On May 16, 1983, petitioners filed an appeal of their claim to the Board\u2019s appeals referee who denied it by memorandum opinion. Petitioners then exhausted all further administrative remedies and sought review in this court pursuant to 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231g and \u00a7 355(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-18\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b91-19\">This appeal thus raises a pure question of law. Since no spouse, grandchild, or parent survived Michael Dolata, it is clear that under Section 6 of the Railroad Retirement Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231e(c), the Dolata brothers would be entitled to the benefit if there is no legal child.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Railroad Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>tirement Act adopts the provisions of the Social Security Act for purposes of determining whether an applicant is the child of a deceased employee,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which in turn provides that the question is to be governed by the law of the state where the employee was domiciled at the time of his death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Michael Dolata died while domiciled in New York. New York Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 117 provides that adoption terminates the right of a natural child to take from his natural parent in intestate succession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\">\u00a7 117 Effect of Adoption</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">1. After the making of an order of adoption the natural parents of the adoptive child shall be relieved of all parental duties toward and of all responsibilities for and shall have no rights over such adoptive child or to his property by descent or succession, except as hereinafter stated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">The rights of an adoptive child to inheritance and succession from and through his natural parents shall terminate upon the making of the order of adoption except as hereinafter provided____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">2. This section shall apply only to the intestate descent and distribution of real and personal property and shall not affect the right of any child to distribution of property under the will of his natural parents ... or under any inter vivos instrument heretofore or hereafter executed by such natural parent ... or kindred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-14\"><em>See also In re Bielinski v. Herman Unger-man, Inc., </em>103 A.D.2d 73, 479 N.Y.S.2d 585 (1984). However, New York law simultaneously confers on the child the right to take in intestate succession from his or her adoptive parent. N.Y.Dom.Rel.Law \u00a7 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-15\">In affirming the award to Elizabeth Fraresso, the Board did not apply New York State law but relied instead on the so-called \u201cdeemed child\u201d provisions of the Social Security Act. Those provisions, entitled \u201cQualification of Children Not Qualified Under State Law,\u201d were enacted in 1965, as part of a series of extensive amendments to the Social Security Act. The deemed child amendment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-16\">(3) An applicant who is the son or daughter of a fully or currently insured individual, but who is not (and is not deemed to be) the child of such insured individual under paragraph (2) of this subsection, shall nevertheless be deemed to be the child of such insured individual if: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac\">(C) in the case of a deceased individual\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM\">(i) such insured individual\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-17\">(I) had acknowledged in writing that the applicant is his or her son or daughter,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-18\">(II) had been decreed by a court to be the mother or father of the applicant, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-19\">(III) had been ordered by a court to contribute to the support of the applicant because the applicant was his or her son or daughter,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>and such acknowledgment, court decree, or court order was made before the death of such insured individual, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWd\">(ii) such insured individual is shown by evidence satisfactory to the Secretary to have been the mother or father of the applicant, and such insured individual was living with or contributing to the support of the applicant at the time such insured individual died.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The Board argues that Elizabeth falls under part (ii) of this section, citing a Board General Counsel Opinion, <em>Quinton v. Garrett, </em>No. L-78-264.3. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">We first consider whether the deemed child provisions apply to legitimate children such as Elizabeth who are later adopted by someone else. We conclude that they do not and that they were enacted to provide rules of eligibility for benefits, uniform across state lines, with regard to illegitimate children. The pertinent legislative history describes this purpose of the amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">(j) Definition of child</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY\">The bill provides that a child be paid benefits based on his father\u2019s earnings without regard to whether he has the status of a child under State inheritance laws if the father was supporting the child or had a legal obligation to do so. Under present law, whether a child meets the definition for the purpose of getting child\u2019s insurance benefits based on his father\u2019s earnings depends on the laws applied in determining the devolution of interstate (sic) personal property in the State in which the worker is domiciled. This provision would be effective for the second month after the month of enactment. It is estimated that 20,000 individuals (children and their mothers) will become immediately eligible for benefits under this provision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">10. Definition of Child</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aav\">Under present law, whether a child meets the definition of a child for the purpose of getting child\u2019s insurance benefits based on his father\u2019s earnings depends on the laws applied in determining the devolution of intestate personal property in the State in which the worker is domiciled. The States differ considerably in the requirements that must be met in order for a child born out of wedlock to have inheritance rights. In some States a child whose parents never married can inherit property just as if they had married; in others such a child can inherit property as the child of the man only if he was acknowledged or decreed to be the man\u2019s child in accordance with requirements specified in the State law; and in several States a child whose parents never married cannot inherit his father\u2019s intestate property under any circumstances. As a result, in some cases benefits must be denied where a child is living with his mother and father in a normal family relationship and where neither the child nor his friends and neighbors have any reason to think that the parents were never married.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-11\">The committee believes that in a national program that is intended to pay benefits to replace the support lost by a child when his father retires, dies, or becomes disabled, whether a child gets benefits should not depend on whether he can inherit his father\u2019s intestate personal property under the laws of the State in which his father happens to live. The committee has therefore included in the bill a provision under which benefits would be paid to a child on the earnings record of his father, even though the child cannot inherit the father\u2019s intestate property, if the father had acknowledged the child in writing, had been ordered by a court to contribute to the child\u2019s support, had been judicially decreed to be the child\u2019s father, or is shown by other evidence satisfactory to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare to be the child\u2019s father and was living with or contributing to the support of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1\">S.Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 1, 17, 109-110, <em>reprinted in </em>1965 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, 1943, 1958, 2049-50. The Supreme Court, in upholding the constitutionality of the deemed child provisions in <em>Mathews v. Lucas, </em>427 U.S. 495, 96 S.Ct. 2755, 49 L.Ed.2d 651 (1976), recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>that these provisions were intended to provide illegitimate children who were dependent on a parent with a means of establishing paternity after that parent\u2019s death. In contrast to the Board, we do not read these provisions to provide an additional mechanism for establishing paternity when a child already has legitimate parents under state law under \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A). Such a strained reading would allow a child who was subsequently adopted to take from two sets of parents, a result surely not intended by the 1965 amendment. We thus regard the purpose of the deemed child provisions to be that of setting forth uniform rules for establishing a parent-child relationship where one has not previously existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">We also note that the structure and relationship of the provisions in question fully supports our conclusion that the statute does not apply to legitimate children of an insured later adopted by another. We recognize that a hypertechnical reading of Section 416(h) might seem to allow an adopted child who was not entitled under state law to take from his or her natural parent under' \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A) to resort to \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C), which literally covers sons or daughters not deemed to be children under \u00a7 416(h)(2). We are unconvinced, however, that such language applies to children other than those who have never had a legally recognized parent-child relationship with the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Moreover, Elizabeth appears to be expressly barred from taking the lump sum award by the terms of the statute. Although the Board argues on appeal that its award to Elizabeth falls under part (ii) of the subsection, that provision explicitly requires that Michael Dolata be living with or contributing to the support of the applicant at the time of his death. Michael Dolata was doing neither, and we are not persuaded by the Board\u2019s contention that since the lump sum award is in effect a refund of contributions rather than income support, the requirement of dependency is either irrelevant or may be waived by the Board. As described above, the legislative history clearly indicates otherwise. We thus believe that such a showing of dependency is a necessary condition to a lump sum award under \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Other provisions of \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C) confirm our view. Part I requires an acknowl-edgement of paternity in writing, which was neither provided here nor is seemingly relevant to the case of a natural and legitimate child at birth such as Elizabeth. Part II requires a court decree stating that the insured is the parent. No such decree is possible where a later adoption by another has occurred. Part III requires. a court ordered support decree, which was rendered impossible under New York law by Elizabeth\u2019s adoption so far as Michael Do-lata is concerned. N.Y.Dom.Rel.L. \u00a7 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Thus, while the clear ineligibility of Elizabeth under the deemed child provisions is an independent ground for reversal, we also note that the structure and relationship of the statutory provisions supports our conclusion that they were not intended to apply to legitimate children later adopted by another and eligible to take from the adoptive parent under \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A). We therefore reverse and remand with directions to award the benefits in question to petitioners.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-14\">. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231e(c) provides, in pertinent part: (c) Payments in the absence of further benefits</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-15\">(1) Whenever it shall appear, with respect to the death of an employee, thafno benefits, or no further benefits (other than benefits payable to a widow, widower, or parent under either this subchapter or the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq.] upon attaining the age of eligibility therefor at a future date) will be payable under this subchapter or under the Social Security Act, a lump sum in an amount computed under subdivision (2) of this subsection shall be paid to such person or persons as the deceased employee may have designated by a writing filed with the Board prior to his or her death, or if there be no designation, to the following person (or, if more than one, in equal shares to the persons) whose relationship to the deceased employee will have been determined by the Board and who will not have died before receiving payment of the lump sum provided for in this subdivision\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8\">(i) the widow or widower of the deceased employee who was living with such employee at the time of such employee\u2019s death; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD\">(ii) if there be no such widow or widower, to any child or children of such employee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>(iii) if there be no such widow, widower, or child, to any grandchild or grandchildren of such employee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah\">(iv) if there be no such widow, widower, child, or grandchild, to any parent or parents of such employee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\">(v) if there be no such widow, widower, child, grandchild, or parent, to any brother or sister of such employee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE9\">(vi) if there be no such widow, widower, child, grandchild, parent, brother or sister, to the estate of such employee.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-12\">. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231e(a)(7) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-13\">(7) In determining for purposes of this subsection and subsections (c) and (d) of this section whether an applicant is the widow, widower, child, or parent of an employee as claimed, the rules set forth in section 216(h) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h) ] shall be applied.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b92-20\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A) provides;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-21\">(2)(A) In determining whether an applicant is the child or parent of a fully or currently insured individual for purposes of this sub-chapter, the Secretary shall apply law as would be applied in determining the devolution of intestate personal property by the courts of the State in which such insured individual is domiciled at the time such applicant files application, or, if such insured individual is dead, by the courts of the State in which he was domiciled at the time of his death, or, if such insured individual is or was not so domiciled in any State, by the courts of the District of Columbia.
