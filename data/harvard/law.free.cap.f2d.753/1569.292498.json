Towns\u2019 actions were taken, though, while he was on duty. Throughout the litigation and on appeal, Towns was represented by the Attorney General. Pursuant to the discretionary power of the court to award attorney\u2019s fees under the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Award Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988, the fact that damages were awarded against Towns in his individual capacity did not preclude the assessment of attorney\u2019s fees against the State. <em>See Williams v. Thomas, </em>692 F.2d 1032, 1039 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 103 S.Ct. 3115, 77 L.Ed.2d 1369 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-21\">IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED that the Petitions for Rehearing are DENIED, and no member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc (Rule 35, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Eleventh Circuit Rule 26), the Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
