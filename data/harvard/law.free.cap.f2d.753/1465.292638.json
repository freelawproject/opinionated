BLAINE ANDERSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1552-21\">The John Martin Company, et al. (JMC), appeal an award of $807.50 in attorneys\u2019 fees on the ground that the district court abused its discretion in calculating the amount of the award. Don Diamond, et al. (Diamond), cross-appeal, arguing that the post-judgment motion for fees was not timely filed. Our review leads us to conclude that the fees motion was timely filed and that the award of fees, although very small in relationship to the original request, was not an abuse of discretion in light of the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-22\">A. <em>Timeliness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1552-23\">Diamond contends that attorneys\u2019 fees may only be included in a judgment as an element of costs under California Civil Code \u00a7 1717 and that, as such, the June 30, 1983 judgment was a binding determination of that issue. <em>See, e.g., Moulin Electric Corp. v. Roach, </em>120 Cal.App.3d 1067, 175 Cal.Rptr. Ill (1981). By defining fees as an element of costs, Diamond argues that JMC failed to timely file under either Rule 59, Fed.R.Civ.P., or Cal.C.C.P. \u00a7 1033. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-24\">Diamond\u2019s argument was largely rejected by the United States Supreme Court in <em>White v. New Hampshire Dept. of Emp. Sec., </em>455 U.S. 445, 102 S.Ct. 1162, 71 L.Ed.2d 325 (1982). There, the Court held that a post-judgment motion was the appropriate procedure and was not subject to the ten-day rule of Rule 59. <em>White </em>also indicated that district courts should be free to establish local rules concerning timeliness requirements for fees motions. <em>Id., </em>455 U.S. at 454, 102 S.Ct. at 1168, 71 L.Ed.2d at 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-25\">Local Rule 9.7.5 (as it appeared in 1981) provided that jurisdiction over attorney fees be reserved until after trial of the other issues. Additionally, Local Rule 15, in detailing recoverable \u201ccosts,\u201d does not mention attorneys\u2019 fees. When viewed together with Section 1717 and California case law defining fees awarded under Section 1717 as costs, we conclude that the local rules indicate that fees discussions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1467\">*1467</page-number>are properly reserved for post-judgment consideration, as was done in the instant matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-5\">B. <em>Abuse of Discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1553-6\">A district court\u2019s decision as to what constitutes a reasonable award of attorneys\u2019 fees is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Shannon v. Northern Counties Title Insurance Company, </em>270 Cal.App.2d 686, 76 Cal.Rptr. 7 (1969) (requiring a \u201cplain and palpable\u201d abuse for reversal); <em>Clejan v. Reisman, </em>5 Cal.App.3d 224, 84 CaLRptr. 897 (1970). In view of the circumstances of this case, we find no abuse of discretion and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-7\">At the outset, Diamond suggests that the trial court should have exercised its discretion under Rule 54(d), Fed.R.Civ.P., to deny <em>any </em>fee award. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-8\">The rule in this circuit requires that federal courts in diversity actions apply state law with regard to the allowance (or disallowance) of attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Schultz v. Lamp, </em>591 F.2d 1268, 1272 (9th Cir.1978). The relevant statutory authority, California Civil Code \u00a7 1717, provides that a prevailing party in a suit on contract is entitled to an award of fees. <em>See, e.g., Lew Wenzel &amp; Co., etc. v. London Litho Supply Co., Inc., </em>563 F.2d 1367, 1368 (9th Cir.1977). Where, as here, a party sued under an alleged contract containing an attorney\u2019s fee clause prevails by establishing that there was no such contract, that party is entitled to a section 1717 fee award. <em>Care Construction, Inc. v. Century Convalescent Centers, Inc., </em>54 Cal.App.3d 701, 126 CaLRptr. 761, 763 (1976). Therefore, we conclude that the trial court acted properly by applying state law and refusing to exercise its federal discretionary power under Rule 54(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-9\">JMC contends that the trial court erred in limiting the award to only those fees incurred in the defense of the second (breach of partnership agreement) cause of action. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-10\">A review of relevant authorities supports the trial court\u2019s request for segregation. Where a cause of action based on the contract providing for attorneys\u2019 fees is joined with other causes of action beyond the contract, the prevailing party may recover fees under section 1717 only as they relate to the contract action. <em>Reynolds Metals Co. v. Alperson, </em>25 Cal.3d 124, 158 Cal.Rptr. 1, 3, 599 P.2d 83, 85 (1979). <em>See Stout v. Turney, </em>22 Cal.3d 718, 150 Cal.Rptr. 637, 644, 586 P.2d 1228, 1235 (1978) (tort action for fraud arising out of contract is not action on a contract for purposes of section 1717). A litigant may not increase the fee recovery by joining a cause of action in which fees are not recoverable with one in which they are. <em>Reynolds, supra, </em>158 CaLRptr. at 4, 599 P.2d at 84. The converse is also true; that is, joinder should not dilute the right to attorneys\u2019 fees. \u201cAttorney\u2019s fees need not be apportioned when incurred for representation of an <em>issue </em>common to both a cause of action for which fees are proper and one in which they are not allowed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>I.M.O. Development Corp. v. Dow Coming Corporation, </em>135 Cal.App.3d 451, 185 CaLRptr. 341, 349 (1982). The recognized barrier to segregation for purposes of calculating fee awards is inextricably intertwined issues. Thus, although timekeeping and billing procedures may make a requested segregation difficult, they do not, without more, make it impossible. <em>Fed-Mart Corp. v. Price, </em>111 Cal.App.3d 215, 168 CaLRptr. 525, 529-532 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-12\">\u201cAn experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services in his court [and his judgment] will not be disturbed unless ... it is clearly wrong.\u201d <em>Serrano v. Priest, </em>20 Cal.3d 25, 141 CaLRptr. 315, 328, 569 P.2d 1303, 1316 (1977). It is true that there are many criteria which may be considered in arriving at a fee award. <em>See, e.g., Erich v. Granoff </em>109 Cal.App.3d 920, 167 CaLRptr. 538, 544-545 (1980). It is equally true, however, that the burden of proof is on the party seeking the attorney fee award. <em>Fed-Mart, supra. </em>In view of the fact that the trial court based its award on the only direct evidence bearing on the issue and the fact that JMC was intransigent in the face of the district court\u2019s specific requests for further segregation and clarification, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1468\">*1468</page-number>we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in awarding JMC $807.50 as attorneys\u2019 fees in the instant matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"a3j-dedup-0\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
