The appellants alleged that Willmon Jefferson Blacktop and Concrete Contractor, Inc., owed appellants certain contributions as a result of two collective bargaining agreements entered into by appellee. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, 582 F.Supp. 1106, held that the defendant was bound by the collective bargaining agreements in question, but found that only one of defendant\u2019s employees was covered by the agreements. Specifically, the court held that pursuant to an agreement between Willmon Jefferson and the Congress of Independent Unions, Willmon agreed to hire one member of the local union and make contributions to the appellant benefit plans on his behalf. Accordingly the court ordered an accounting of the defendant\u2019s books only with respect to that one employee, and further ordered the defendant to pay all unpaid contributions on behalf of the employee. The benefit plans appeal the district court\u2019s determination that only one employee was covered by the plan, and the adequacy of the court\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee award. The appellee cross-appeals from that part of the judgment awarding contributions to the funds, and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">We have examined the record in this case and have determined that the judgment of the district court is based on findings of facts that are not clearly erroneous, and no error of law appears. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See </em>8TH CIR.R. 14.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-7\">. Honorable James H.
