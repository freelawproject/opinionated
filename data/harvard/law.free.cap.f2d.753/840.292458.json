Rex contends that his constitutional rights were violated when Teeples improperly imprisoned him by placing him on a seventy-two hour mental hold, and when Teeples and Johnson coerced his involuntary confession. The district court granted Johnson\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding as a matter of law that Johnson was entitled to absolute pros-ecutorial immunity. The court subsequently granted summary judgment for Teeples, holding that Rex\u2019s claims were cognizable only under state tort law and did not rise to constitutional violations. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-21\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b927-22\">The record in this, case is scant. Defendants presented little evidence to support their motions for summary judgment, and we must draw our recitation of the facts primarily from the pleadings and related state court opinions. Moreover, we must view the facts and inferences in the light most favorable to Rex as the party opposing the summary judgment motion. <em>Lindley v. Amoco Production Co., </em>639 F.2d 671, 672 (10th Cir.1981); 10 C. Wright, <em>A: </em>Miller &amp; M. Kane, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 2716 at 643 (2d ed. 1983). In his complaint Rex alleges that he was brought to McKee Medical Center in Love-land; Colorado at about 1:30 p.m. September 14, 1977, after he had attempted to commit suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. While Rex was hospitalized on September 14, Teeples represented himself to Rex as a minister as well as a police officer and questioned him about a recent kidnapping. Rex alleges that Teeples conspired with Dr. Howard Franklin, who was in charge of the Medical Center emergency room, to place Rex under a seventy-two hour mental hold because Teeples had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>probable cause to arrest Rex and wanted to question him further. Under Teeples\u2019 direction, Rex was transferred at about midnight on September 14 to Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">On September 15 in Rex\u2019s hospital room, Teeples and Johnson began a second interrogation which they taped. Johnson testified in the summary judgment hearing that his only responsibility had been to make certain that Rex was properly advised of his rights and that Rex had waived them, although Johnson also stated that he had been present for at least forty-five minutes of the four to five hour interrogation and had asked some questions. Rex alleges that Johnson and Teeples took advantage of his confused mental state during this questioning, deceived him into believing he was not a suspect, induced him to talk without the assistance of an attorney, and coerced him into telling them what they wanted to hear. On September 16, Rex was transferred to the Larimar County jail, and on September 19 a criminal information was filed charging Rex with attempted murder, second degree kidnapping, and third degree sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The sexual assault charge was dismissed after a preliminary hearing. Rex\u2019s first trial on the remaining counts ended in a mistrial. Following a new trial, Rex was convicted. The second degree murder count was dismissed in post-trial proceedings, and Rex\u2019s conviction on the count of second degree kidnapping was reversed on appeal. <em>People v. Rex, </em>636 P.2d 1282 (Colo. Ct.App.1981). The Colorado court concluded that Rex\u2019s statements during the September 15 interrogation were involuntary as a matter of law because \u201cthe police took advantage of [his] confused mental state and deceived him into believing that he was not a suspect in a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1284. Following a third trial at which the involuntary statements were not introduced, Rex was again convicted of second degree kidnapping. That conviction was reversed on appeal for reasons not relevant to the issues before us. <em>See People v. Rex, </em>689 P.2d 669 (Colo.Ct.App., 1984), <em>reported in </em>13 <em>Colo.Law. </em>1051 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR TEEPLES</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">Rex alleges that Teeples deprived him of his constitutional rights by Teeples\u2019 actions involving the imposition of the mental hold and by his participation in obtaining the involuntary statements. The district court held that these claims do not assert constitutional deprivations remediable under section 1983. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">\n<em>A. The Mental Hold</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b928-13\">Colorado law provides an emergency procedure under which a peace officer may, upon probable cause, place a person in an appropriate facility for a seventy-two hour treatment and evaluation when that person \u201cappears to be mentally ill and, as a result of such mental illness, appears to be an imminent danger to others or to him-self____\u201d Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 27-10-105 (1973).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rex alleges in his complaint that Teeples had Rex placed on mental hold not because he appeared to be an imminent danger to himself or others, but because Teeples suspected Rex of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-15\">The propriety of the mental hold was not addressed in the proceedings below. The record is absolutely devoid of anything on this issue except Rex\u2019s allegation that Teeples conspired with the doctor to hold Rex for an improper purpose, an allegation that we must accept as true. Notably absent is any affidavit from either the doctor or Teeples describing why Rex was placed on mental hold. If, as Rex alleges, Teeples deprived Rex of his freedom by placing him under a mental hold without the probable cause required by state law and for an improper purpose, Rex was denied his liberty without due process, an injury to his constitutional rights for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>which section 1983 provides a remedy. <em>See, e.g., Lessman v. McCormick, </em>591 F.2d 605, 609-11 (10th Cir.1979). Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">\n<em>B. The Involuntary Statements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">We also conclude that Rex has stated a constitutional claim arising from the September 15 interrogation. Extracting an involuntary confession by coercion is a due process violation. <em>Haynes v. Washington, </em>373 U.S. 503, 513-15, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 1343-44, 10 L.Ed.2d 513 (1963); and <em>Spano v. New York, </em>360 U.S. 315, 320-23, 79 S.Ct. 1202, 1205-07, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265 (1959). This is so notwithstanding the coercion is psychological rather than physical. <em>See Spa-no, </em>360 U.S. at 323, 79 S.Ct. at 1207; <em>Duncan v. Nelson, </em>466 F.2d 939, 944-45 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 894, 93 S.Ct. 175, 34 L.Ed.2d 152 (1972). Consequently, extracting an involuntary confession is actionable under section 1983. <em>Id.; Kerr v. City of Chicago, </em>424 F.2d 1134, 1138 (7th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 833, 91 S.Ct. 66, 27 L.Ed.2d 64 (1970); <em>Lewis v. Brautigam, </em>227 F.2d 124, 128 (5th Cir.1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">In this case Rex alleged that the improper interrogation took place while he was under the influence of carbon monoxide poisoning, and that defendants misled him and coerced his statements from him. The Colorado Court of Appeals reversed his conviction on this ground, concluding that the police had taken advantage of his mental state and had deceived him. We believe there are factual issues precluding summary judgment on this claim, particularly when we view the transcript of the taped interrogation most favorably to Rex. Indeed, at the summary judgment hearing Johnson conceded that nothing in the transcript establishes that Rex waived his right to an attorney and asked defendants to come back and talk to him. Johnson stated the existence of waiver was a matter of his, Johnson\u2019s, credibility because he knew what had happened there that day. Rec., vol. II, at 35. Moreover, the transcript shows that Rex repeatedly said, \u201cIf I do make an attempt to incriminate myself at any time, I wish you\u2019d get me a lawyer.\u201d Rec., supp. vol. I, at 22, 27. Under these circumstances, the issues involving the vol-untariness of the statements are particularly inappropriate for resolution by summary judgment. Accordingly, we conclude that Rex has stated a constitutional due process claim arising out of the alleged coerced confession. The summary judgment on this ground is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR JOHNSON</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">In view of our conclusion in Part IIB <em>supra </em>that Rex has alleged a constitutional claim arising from the September 15 interrogation, we must address the district court\u2019s conclusion that Johnson, as a deputy district attorney, was absolutely immune for his part in obtaining the allegedly involuntary confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">A prosecutor is absolutely immune only for those activities \u201cintimately associated\u201d with \u201cinitiating a prosecution [and] presenting the State\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 430-31, 96 S.Ct. 984, 995, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). Absolute prosecutorial immunity extends no further than necessary to protect those activities. <em>See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 811, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2735, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). Consequently, a prosecutor acting as an investigator has only qualified immunity. <em>See id. ASI </em>U.S. at 811 n. 16, 102 S.Ct. at 811 n. 16. Although identifying those acts entitled to absolute immunity is not always easy, the determinative factor is \u201cadvocacy\u201d because that is the prosecutor\u2019s main function and the one most akin to his quasi-judicial role. <em>See, e.g., Lerwill v. Joslin, </em>712 F.2d 435, 437 (10th Cir.1983); <em>Gray v. Bell, </em>712 F.2d 490, 500-02 (D.C.Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1593, 80 L.Ed.2d 125 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-16\">In <em>Atkins v. Banning, </em>556 F.2d 485, 488 (10th Cir.1977), this court distinguished between the prosecutor\u2019s quasi-judicial role warranting absolute immunity, and his \u201cpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>lice-related\u201d work not accorded such immunity. We there cited cases making this distinction: <em>Hampton v. City of Chicago, </em>484 F.2d 602, 609 (7th Cir.1973) (planning a raid to obtain evidence of criminal activity not covered by prosecutorial immunity), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 917, 94 S.Ct. 1413, 39 L.Ed.2d 471 (1974); <em>Apton v. Wilson, </em>506 F.2d 83, 91 (D.C.Cir.1974) (prosecutorial immunity not available when a civil rights claim \u201cfocuses on a prosecutor\u2019s actions in the course of directing police investigative activity\u201d); and <em>Weathers v. Ebert, </em>505 F.2d 514, 517 (4th Cir.1974) (\u201cMaking an arrest is a police function, not a judicial one ____\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 975, 96 S.Ct. 1480, 47 L.Ed.2d 745 (1976). Other courts have held that the preliminary gathering of evidence which may blossom into a potential prosecution is investigatory activity receiving only a qualified immunity. <em>McSurely v. McClellan, </em>697 F.2d 309, 320 (D.C.Cir.1982). \u201c[A] prosecutor who assists, directs or otherwise participates with, the police in obtaining evidence prior to an indictment undoubtedly is functioning more in his investigative capacity than in his quasi-judicial capacities____\u201d <em>Marrero v. City of Hialeah, </em>625 F.2d 499, 505 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">We conclude that giving Miranda warnings to a general suspect and participating in his interrogation is \u201cpolice-related\u201d work and does not fall within the category of a prosecutor\u2019s quasi-judicial functions. Accordingly, Johnson is entitled only to qualified immunity with respect to Rex\u2019s claims arising from the alleged coerced confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">Under <em>Harlow, </em>summary judgment in favor of a defendant seeking qualified immunity is appropriate only if the constitutional standards governing the challenged conduct were not clearly established. 457 U.S. at 818-19, 102 S.Ct. at 2738-39. In this case the law with respect to involuntary confessions and the ability to knowingly waive constitutional rights was clear at the time the questioning took place. The grant of summary judgment in favor of Johnson is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">This action is reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-6\">. Although this statute has since been amended, the quoted language remains unchanged. <em>See </em>Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 27-10-105 (Supp.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b930-12\">BARRETT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AfXz\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">I would affirm the district court\u2019s grant of the defendants-appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Some additional undisputed facts reflected by the record should be observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-14\">Officer Teeples, a Loveland, Colorado police officer, was called to the hospital following Rex\u2019s suicide attempt because Rex resembled a composite drawing of a kidnapping suspect. While in the emergency room, Rex requested a minister. Teeples was also a minister and he identified himself to Rex both as a minister and as a police officer. Teeples questioned Rex briefly about the kidnapping matter. Rex was later moved to another hospital, by direction of his attending physician, and placed on a 72-hour \u201cmental hold.\u201d All of this occurred September 14, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-15\">On September 15, 1977, Officer Teeples, out of concern, requested that Chief Deputy District Attorney Johnson come to the hospital to supervise Rex\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>advisement. Johnson did so and he determined that Rex could be interrogated. Johnson then advised Rex of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and Rex signed a written waiver of those rights. Teeples, and to a far lesser extent, Johnson, then questioned Rex, who eventually confessed to the kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-16\">My differences with the majority are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b930-17\">\n<em>A. The Mental Hold.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b930-18\">The emergency \u201cmental hold\u201d order was, from the record, <em>the action of the attending physician, </em>even though the action was apparently requested by Officer Teeples. Under \u00a7 27-10-105, C.R.S.1973, this action was that of a \u201cprofessional person\u201d referred to in the statute. However, the statute also authorizes the action to be taken by a peace officer. The predicate is that \u201cwhen any person appears to be mentally ill and, as a result ... appears to be an imminent danger to others or to himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>____\u201d I believe there was every reason why the propriety of the mental hold was not specifically addressed by the trial court. The justification is clear from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Under the circumstances, it was wise and prudent to certify Rex to the short-term involuntary 72-hour commitment because he was <em>then </em>dangerous to himself as shown by the suicide attempt, and, given the valid suspicions held by Officer Teeples on the criminal acts of kidnapping and attempted murder, was likely dangerous to others. Dr. Franklin, a \u201cprofessional\u201d under the Colorado statute, believed that Rex should be placed on the 72-hour \u201cmental hold.\u201d This case required a due process balancing. The action here was that recognized as valid under the subject statute by the Colorado Supreme Court in other settings. <em>See People v. Taylor, </em>618 P.2d 1127, 1137 (Colo.1980) (En Banc) (\u201cPassive injury to oneself, because of an inability to take care of one\u2019s most basic personal needs, may be as dangerous or damaging to the individual as the active threat posed by suicide.\u201d); <em>People v. Lane, </em>196 Colo. 42, 581 P.2d 719 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Rex alleged that he was <em>detained </em>\u201cwithout probable cause.\u201d \u201cProbable cause\u201d is, of course, terminology justifying the 72-hour \u201cmental hold\u201d under \u00a7 27-10-105, C.R.S.1973. Under Colorado law, when any person <em>appears </em>mentally ill and dangerous to <em>himself </em>or to others, \u201ca peace officer, a professional person, or a licensed social worker ... upon probable cause may take the person into custody, or cause him to be taken into custody ... in a [designated] facility for a seventy-two-hour treatment and evaluation.\u201d \u00a7 27-10-105, C.R.S. 1973. It is beyond dispute that Rex\u2019s suicide attempt and his own alleged confused mental state indicated that he was, at the very least, a danger to himself. These circumstances alone provided the probable cause necessary to invoke the 72-hour mental hold provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">\n<em>B. Summary Judgment for Johnson.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">I cannot agree that Deputy District Attorney Johnson is entitled only to a qualified (good faith) immunity when he appeared at the request of Officer Teeples to assure .that Rex was properly advised of his rights under <em>Miranda. </em>I realize that the courts have \u201csliced\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s functions into what they hope may be specific categories serving to identify the absolute immunity question. It <em>may be </em>helpful in certain cases. A prosecutor who accompanies police officers on routine investigative work without any specific objective in mind is involved in routine police \u201cinvestigative\u201d work. Such is not the case here. Johnson appeared at the request of Officer Teeples to <em>assure </em>(because Officer Teeples asked for help) that the mandates of <em>Miranda </em>were met <em>before </em>general police interrogation. Such is investigation in the broad- sense of law enforcement activity. Not all interrogation is investigative in the sense of \u201cpolice work\u201d in a particular scenario. I am not willing to attempt to slice the prosecutor\u2019s activities into neat niches. For example, in <em>Lerwill v. Joslin, </em>712 F.2d 435 (10th Cir.1983), although we said that the prosecutor was acting as an <em>advocate </em>before the neutral magistrate, the fact is that he prepared the arrest warrant. Thus, the prosecutor was involved in \u201cinvestigative\u201d activities necessary to his preparation of the arrest warrant simply because he had to be prepared to establish probable cause. The same is true of a search warrant or a recommendation for bail when a prosecutor appears before the magistrate. He advocates, but he has been and always must be involved in \u201cinvestigative\u201d work prior thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">Johnson was doing exactly what <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 431 n. 33, 96 S.Ct. 984, 995 n. 33, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976), contemplated, i.e% properly <em>obtaining </em>evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-12\">We recognize that the duties of the prosecutor in his role as advocate for the State involve actions preliminary to the initiation of a prosecution and actions apart from the courtroom. A prosecuting attorney is required constantly, in the course of his duty as such, to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>decisions on a wide variety of sensitive issues. These include questions of whether to present a case to a grand jury, whether to file an information, whether and when to prosecute, whether to dismiss an indictment against particular defendants, which witnesses to call, and what other evidence to present. <em>Preparation, both for the initiation of the criminal process and for a trial, may require the obtaining, reviewing, and evaluating of evidence. </em>At some point, and with respect to some decisions, the prosecutor no doubt functions as an administrator rather than as an officer of the court. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">The concurring opinion of Mr. Justice White in <em>Imbler </em>(joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall) cites with approval the rule that a prosecutor is absolutely immune from suit even for malicious prosecution. 424 U.S. at 437, 438, 96 S.Ct. at 998, 999. In deciding whether or not to prosecute, the prosecutor performs a \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d function. This, I submit, requires that the prosecutor act in \u201cobtaining, reviewing, and evaluating the evidence.\u201d 424 U.S. at 431, 96 S.Ct. at 995, <em>supra. See also For-syth v. Kleindienst, </em>599 F.2d 1203 (3rd Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>453 U.S. 913, 101 S.Ct. 3147, 69 L.Ed.2d 997 (1981). In <em>Atkins v. Lanning, </em>556 F.2d 485, 488 (10th Cir.1977), we recognize that a prosecutor must be accorded leeway in performing the function of assembling the state\u2019s case and that some investigative work is a necessary part of the prosecutor\u2019s preparation of the case. In my view the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Deputy Johnson was entitled to absolute immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">\n<em>C. Summary Judgment for Teeples.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AtQb\">Rex\u2019s involuntary statement was introduced into evidence at his first trial. It is unclear from the record whether Deputy Johnson acted as prosecutor in that trial, but assuming that he did, his adjudicative function in introducing the confession entitled him to absolute immunity against civil rights claims. <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, supra </em>424 U.S. at 430-31, 96 S.Ct. at 995-96 (1976). Although Officer Teeples does not enjoy a similar immunity against \u00a7 1983 claims, there is no evidence supporting Rex\u2019s allegation that Teeples \u201ccaused\u201d the constitutional deprivation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Teeples took Rex\u2019s confession only after being informed by Deputy Johnson that Rex had been properly advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that he had waived those rights. The decision to introduce Rex\u2019s confession was made, not by Teeples, but by the prosecutor. The decision to admit the evidence was made, not by Teeples, but by the judge. In my view, these factors constituted intervening factors sufficient to preclude a finding that Teeples caused the involuntary confession to be used against Rex. <em>See generally Duncan v. Nelson, </em>466 F.2d 939, 942 (7th Cir.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 894, 93 S.Ct. 116, 34 L.Ed.2d 152 (1972); <em>Jackson v. Dillon, </em>518 F.Supp. 618, 622 (E.D.N.Y.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">It would be sadly ironic if Officer Tee-ples could somehow be held liable under \u00a7 1983 on the basis of his dealings with Rex. It should be recalled that Officer Teeples asked Deputy Johnson to come to the hospital to insure that Rex was properly advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Johnson, seeking to assist Officer Teeples, attempted to perform this function and indeed informed Teeples that the proper procedures had been followed. Such efforts on behalf of the police and prosecutors are commendable. To hold Officer Teeples liable on these facts because the Colorado Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>Appeals subsequently found Rex\u2019s confession involuntary would in my view, be unjust. For the above-stated reasons I would hold that the district court did not err in granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-6\">. Traditional tort analysis dictates that another defendant's actions may constitute an intervening cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury and thus break the chain of causation so as to relieve the initial actor of liability if the latter defendant's actions were unforeseeable.
