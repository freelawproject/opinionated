WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1615-7\">At issue here is a school board\u2019s refusal to remove a book from a sophomore English literature curriculum based on plaintiffs\u2019 religious objections to the book. Plaintiffs brought this civil rights suit arguing that use of the book violates the religion clauses of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-8\">The district court granted summary judgment to defendants, finding no violation of the Constitution. We also must decide whether plaintiffs have standing to bring this suit, whether they were given adequate notice that the district court was considering a grant of summary judgment, and whether attorneys\u2019 fees should have been awarded to the defendant intervenor. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-9\">Cassie Grove was assigned <em>The Learning Tree, </em>by Gordon Parks, in her public school sophomore English literature class. She read part of it, found it offensive to her religious beliefs, and showed it to her mother. Her mother read the entire book and agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-10\">The Groves informed the teacher of their objections and Cassie was assigned another book. She was given permission to leave during classroom discussion of <em>The Learning Tree, </em>but chose to remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-11\">Mrs. Grove (hereinafter Grove) filed a formal complaint concerning the book with the school district. An evaluation committee concluded that <em>The Learning Tree </em>\u201cis an appropriate element of the sophomore English curriculum.\u201d Grove and the Riddles, taxpayers, appealed to the Board of Directors of the school district. After a hearing, the Board denied the request to remove the book from the curriculum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-12\">Plaintiffs then brought this civil rights suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the school district. They contend that use of <em>The Learning Tree </em>violated the religion clauses of the First Amendment. They seek damages and injunctive relief. The Mead Education Association, bargaining representative for the district teachers, was allowed to intervene as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-14\">The defendants filed motions to dismiss in district court. After reading plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits and the book and conducting a hearing, the judge granted summary judgment for the defendants and denied their requests for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-15\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-16\">I. STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-17\">If the plaintiffs lack standing to bring this suit, the courts lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>Allen v. Wright, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 3324-25, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984). To satisfy constitutional standing requirements, a plaintiff must allege distinct personal injury that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief. <em>Id. </em>104 S.Ct. at 3325. Prudential limitations on the exercise of jurisdiction include a general prohibition on a litigant\u2019s raising another\u2019s rights. <em>Id. </em>at 3324-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-20\">A. <em>Free Exercise Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1615-21\">Appellants have standing to challenge alleged violations of the free exercise clause of the First Amendment only if they claim infringement of their personal religious freedom. <em>McGowan v. Maryland, </em>366 U.S. 420, 429, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 1107, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-22\">One aspect of the religious freedom of parents is the right to control the religious upbringing and training of their minor children. <em>See Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972). As a parent, Grove has a direct, personal right to direct Cassie\u2019s religious training. <em>Collins v. Chandler Unified School District, </em>644 F.2d 759, 764 n. 1 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 863, 102 S.Ct. 322, 70 L.Ed.2d 163 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-23\">The Riddles present no claim of violation of a personal right of religious freedom. In the complaint, their only interest is iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1532\">*1532</page-number>tified as their taxpayer status. Appellants assert that the Riddles are the parents of school-age children in the district, but not that the children have attended public school there. The Riddles do not have standing to pursue their free exercise claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-4\">B. <em>Establishment Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1616-5\">Appellants have standing to challenge alleged violations of the establishment clause of the First Amendment if they are directly affected by use of <em>The Learning Tree </em>in the English curriculum. <em>Abington School District v. Schempp, </em>374 U.S. 203, 224 n. 9, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 1572 n. 9, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963). Grove has standing as a parent whose right to direct the religious training of her child is allegedly affected. <em>See Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15; <em>Abington School District, </em>374 U.S. at 224 n. 9, 83 S.Ct. at 1572 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-6\">Whether the Riddles as taxpayers may bring an establishment clause challenge is not simply answered. The Supreme Court has made it clear that a federal taxpayer has no standing to maintain a purely religious objection to federal expenditures. <em>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., </em>454 U.S. 464, 478, 102 S.Ct. 752, 762, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982). <em>But cf. </em>K. Davis, 4 <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 24:25 (2d ed. 1983). Similarly, a state taxpayer has been held not to have standing to assert a purely religious objection to Bible reading. <em>Doremus v. Board of Education, </em>342 U.S. 429, 72 S.Ct. 394, 96 L.Ed. 475 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-7\">On the other hand, municipal taxpayers have traditionally been held to have standing to assert objections to municipal expenditures. <em>See Massachusetts v. Mellon, </em>262 U.S. 447, 486, 43 S.Ct. 597, 600, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923). The First Circuit concluded, in a case subsequently reviewed on the merits by the Supreme Court, that <em>Valley Forge </em>did not change the rule that a municipal taxpayer could assert a religious objection to a city\u2019s use of public resources, there the maintenance of a creche on city property. <em>Donnelly v. Lynch, </em>691 F.2d 1029,1031 (1st Cir.1982), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1355, 79 L.Ed.2d 604 (1984). <em>See also Conrad v. City and County of Denver, </em>656 P.2d 662, 669 (Colo. 1982); <em>Fausto v. Diamond, </em>589 F.Supp. 451, 460 n. 5 (D.R.I. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-11\">We need not resolve the question of the Riddles\u2019 taxpayer standing here, however, because Grove has standing to pursue the establishment clause claims. We therefore may proceed to the merits. <em>See, e.g., Watt v. Energy Action Educational Foundation, </em>454 U.S. 151,102 S.Ct. 205, 70 L.Ed.2d 309 (1981); <em>Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp., </em>429 U.S. 252, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977); <em>Buckley v. Va-leo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-12\">II. NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-13\">Grove contends that the district judge provided insufficient notice of his intent to treat defendants\u2019 pretrial motions as motions for summary judgment. She argues that she was denied an adequate opportunity to conduct discovery that would support her claims, in violation of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-14\">Whenever a district court looks beyond the pleadings in evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6); <em>Portland Retail Druggists Association v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, </em>662 F.2d 641, 645 (9th Cir.1981). Before summary judgment may be entered, all parties must be given notice of the motion and an opportunity to respond. <em>Portland Retail Druggists, </em>662 F.2d at 645. The opportunity to respond must include time for discovery necessary to develop facts justifying opposition to the motion. <em>Id.; </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-15\">In this circuit, notice is adequate if the party against whom judgment is entered is \u201cfairly apprised\u201d that the court will look beyond the pleadings, thereby transforming the motion to dismiss into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1533\">*1533</page-number>a motion for summary judgment. <em>Mayer v. Wedgewood, Neighborhood Coalition, </em>707 F.2d 1020, 1021 (9th Cir.1983) (per curiam) (citing <em>Portland Retail Druggists, </em>662 F.2d at 645). When a party is represented by counsel, formal notice may be unnecessary. <em>See Garaux v. Pulley, </em>739 F.2d 437, 439-40 (9th Cir.1984). Notice occurs when a party has reason to know that the court will consider matters outside the pleadings. <em>See Townsend v. Columbia Operations, </em>667 F.2d 844, 849 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-6\">A represented party who submits matters outside the pleadings to the judge and invites consideration of them has notice that the judge may use them to decide a motion originally noted as a motion to dismiss, requiring its transformation to a motion for summary judgment. <em>Id.; see Garaux, </em>739 F.2d at 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-7\">Grove submitted matters outside the pleadings. On August 18 the parties agreed that the judge should then read <em>The Learning Tree. </em>On August 30 Grove submitted copies of affidavits of her witnesses. At the September 13 hearing the judge relied on the book and Grove\u2019s affidavits in deciding the motion. Grove had adequate notice that he would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-8\">III. FIRST AMENDMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-9\">The grant of summary judgment is reviewable de novo. <em>National Union Fire Insurance Co. v. Argonaut Insurance Co., </em>701 F.2d 95, 96 (9th Cir.1983). Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-10\">Local school boards have broad discretion in the management of schools. <em>Epperson v. Arkansas, </em>393 U.S. 97,104, 89 S.Ct. 266, 270, 21 L.Ed.2d 228 (1968). Judicial supervision of public education is limited to the resolution of conflicts that clearly involve constitutional values. <em>Id.; Nicholson v. Board of Education, </em>682 F.2d 858, 863 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-11\">Grove contends that the Board\u2019s refusal to prohibit use of <em>The Learning Tree </em>in high school English courses violated the First Amendment religion clauses. Those clauses provide that \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise there-cf.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-13\">A. <em>Free Exercise of Religion</em></p>\n<p id=\"agl-dedup-0\">The free exercise clause recognizes the right of every person to choose among types of religious training and observance, free of state- compulsion. <em>Abington School District, </em>374 U.S. at 222, 83 S.Ct. at 1571. To establish a violation of that clause, a litigant must show that challenged state action has a coercive effect that operates against the litigant\u2019s practice of his or her religion. <em>Id. </em>at 223, 83 S.Ct. at 1572.</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-14\">The state action at issue here is a school board policy of academic freedom and refusal to remove from the curriculum a book that offends Grove\u2019s religious sensibilities. Three factors are relevant in our analysis: (1) the extent of the burden upon the exercise of religion, (2) the existence of a compelling state interest justifying that burden, and (3) the extent to which accommodation of the complainant would impede the state\u2019s objectives. <em>Callahan v. Woods, </em>736 F.2d 1269, 1273 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-15\">The burden on Grove\u2019s free exercise of religion was minimal. Cassie was assigned an alternate book as soon as she and Grove objected to <em>The Learning Tree. </em>Cassie was given permission to avoid classroom discussions of <em>The Learning Tree. </em>We agree with the district court\u2019s finding that no coercion existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-16\">The state interest in providing well-rounded public education would be critically impeded by accommodation of Grove\u2019s wishes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1617-17\">If we are to eliminate everything that is objectionable to any of [the religious bodies existing in the United States] or inconsistent with any of their doctrines, we will leave public education in shreds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXLa\"><em>Florey v. Sioux Falls School District 49-5, </em>619 F.2d 1311, 1318 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 987, 101 S.Ct. 409, 66 L.Ed.2d 251 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1534\">*1534</page-number>(1980) (quoting <em>McCollum v. Board of Education, </em>333 U.S. 203, 235, 68 S.Ct. 461, 477, 92 L.Ed. 649 (1948) (Jackson, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-4\">In light of the absence of coercion and the critical threat to public education, we conclude that the school board has not violated the free exercise clause. <em>Id. </em>at 1318-</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-5\">B. <em>Establishment of Religion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1618-6\">The establishment clause of the First Amendment requires government neutrality with respect to religion. <em>Abington School District, </em>374 U.S. at 215, 83 S.Ct. at 1567. It was intended to protect against \u201csponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity.\u201d <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman, </em>403 U.S. 602, 612, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 2111, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971) (quoting <em>Walz v. Tax Commission, </em>397 U.S. 664, 668, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 1411, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-7\">To pass constitutional muster, challenged state action (1) must have a secular purpose, (2) must have a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion, and (3) must not foster excessive state entanglement with religion. <em>Lemon, </em>403 U.S. at 612-13, 91 S.Ct. at 2111-12. The option of nonparticipation does not save state action from an establishment clause challenge. <em>Engel v. Vitale, </em>370 U.S. 421, 430, 82 S.Ct. 1261, 1266, 8 L.Ed.2d 601 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-8\">Religious activities prohibited in public schools include daily readings from the Bible, <em>Abington School District, </em>374 U.S. 203, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844, recitation of the Lord\u2019s Prayer, <em>id., </em>posting the Ten Commandments in every classroom, <em>Stone v. Graham, </em>449 U.S. 39, 101 S.Ct. 192, 66 L.Ed.2d 199 (1980), beginning school assemblies with prayer, <em>Collins, </em>644 F.2d 759, and teaching a Transcendental Meditation course that includes a ceremony involving offerings to a deity, <em>Malnak v. Yogi, </em>592 F.2d 197 (3d Cir.1979). The Supreme Court has stated clearly that literary or historic study of the Bible is <em>not </em>a prohibited religious activity. <em>Stone, </em>449 U.S. at 42, 101 S.Ct. at 194; <em>Abington School District, </em>374 U.S. at 225, 83 S.Ct. at 1573. Not all mention of religion is prohibited in public schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-10\">Appellants contend that use of <em>The Learning Tree </em>in an English literature class has a primary effect of inhibiting their religion, fundamentalist Christianity, and advancing the religion of secular humanism. The district court concluded that use of the book was not a religious activity and that it served a secular educational function.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-11\">At issue here is not a ritual, but students reading</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1618-12\">a novel with autobiographic overtones used in the English literature class ... for purposes of exposing students to expectations and orientations of Black Americans.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1618-13\">District Court Memorandum Decision at 4. The central theme of the novel is life, especially racism, from the perspective of a teenage boy in a working class black family. Comment on religion is a very minor portion of the book. Its primary effect is secular.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-14\">Secular humanism may be a religion. <em>See Rhode Island Federation of Teachers v. Norberg, </em>630 F.2d 850, 854 (1st Cir.1980). <em>The Learning Tree, </em>however, was included in a group of religiously neutral books in a review of English literature, as a comment on an American subculture. Its use does not constitute establishment of religion or anti-religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-15\">IV. ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES</p>\n<p id=\"AV6\">Defendant-intervenor Mead Education Association moved for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees below, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. Its motion was denied. It cross-appeals that denial of fees and seeks an award of fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-16\">A defendant who prevails in a \u00a7 1983 action is awarded attorneys fees \u201conly where the action brought is found to be unreasonable, frivolous, meritless or vexatious.\u201d <em>Mayer v. Wedgewood Neighborhood Coalition, </em>707 F.2d 1020, 1021 (9th Cir.1983) (citing <em>Christiansburg Gar-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1535\">*1535</page-number><em>merit Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 700, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978)). Awards to intervenors should not be granted unless the intervenor plays a significant role in the litigation. <em>See Seattle School District No. 1 v. State of Washington, </em>633 F.2d 1338,1349-50 (9th Cir.1980), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>458 U.S. 457, 102 S.Ct. 3187, 73 L.Ed.2d 896 (1982); <em>see also Donnell v. United States, </em>682 F.2d 240, 245-49 (D.C.Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1204, 103 S.Ct. 1190, 75 L.Ed.2d 436 (1983). A district court\u2019s denial of fees is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Seattle School District No. 1, </em>633 F.2d at 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-5\">The Education Association did not play an exceptional role in this litigation. The district court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees was not an abuse of discretion. Attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal are denied also.</p>\n<p id=\"AzoZ\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1619-6\">CANBY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AWI\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-7\">I concur in Judge Wright\u2019s clear and concise opinion. Because plaintiffs pose a novel problem, however, in the delicate area of church-state relations, I write separately to amplify my views on this matter of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-8\">I. Establishment Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-9\">\u201c[0]ne of the mandates of the First Amendment is to promote a viable, pluralistic society and to keep government neutral, not only between sects, but between believers and nonbelievers.\u201d <em>Walz v. Tax Commission, </em>397 U.S. 664, 716, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 1436, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970) (Douglas, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs do not dispute this goal. They claim, however, that <em>The Learning Tree </em>reflects a set of secular, if not anti-religious values \u2014 values which they denominate \u201csecular humanism\u201d \u2014 so that inclusion of the book in the public secondary school curriculum violates this salutary principle of neutrality.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1619-15\">The sincerity of plaintiffs\u2019 religious objections to <em>The Learning Tree </em>is not disputed, nor is the fact that the book deeply offfends plaintiffs. Even accepting, however, that the work is antithetical to the particular Christian beliefs espoused by plaintiffs, its inclusion in the high school curriculum does not violate the establishment clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-16\">The first amendment prohibits the establishment of religion but does not define religion. Plaintiffs insist that <em>The Learning Tree </em>embodies the philosophy of secular humanism, and that secular humanism is a religion. There are substantial analytical difficulties with this contention, and with its underlying use of the term \u201csecular humanism.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1619-17\">A. <em>Secularism as Religion</em></p>\n<p id=\"auj-dedup-0\">Plaintiffs frequently seem to regard \u201csecular\u201d and \u201chumanist\u201d as synonyms for \u201canti-religious.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The common meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1536\">*1536</page-number>those terms does not support the assumption. \u201cHumanism,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for example, is not necessarily incompatible with religion generally or with theistic commitments, including Christianity, in particular.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We assume, however, that the thrust of plaintiffs\u2019 attack is against nontheistic<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> humanism, which they might label \u201csecular humanism.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-4\">The analytical difficulty with plaintiffs\u2019 approach is that it tends to divide the universe of value-laden thought into only two categories \u2014 the religious and the anti-religious. By adopting this dualistic social outlook, and by denominating the anti-religious half of their universe as \u201csecular,\u201d plaintiffs erect an insurmountable barrier to meaningful application of the establishment clause to controversies like this one. Whether the inclusion of <em>The Learning Tree </em>in the curriculum violates the establishment clause depends, under <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman, </em>403 U.S. 602, 612-13, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 2111-12, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971), upon whether that inclusion reflects a secular purpose and produces a secular effect. The difficulty is that plaintiffs might well concede that the primary purpose and effect was secular; indeed, that is precisely their point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-10\">It is apparent that so long as plaintiffs deem that which is \u201csecular\u201d in orientation to be anti-religious, they are not dealing in the same linguistic currency as the Supreme Court\u2019s establishment decisions. If the establishment clause is to have any meaning, distinctions must be drawn to recognize not simply \u201creligious\u201d and \u201canti-religious,\u201d but \u201cnon-religious\u201d governmental activity as well. In the parlance of <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman, </em>\u201csecular\u201d must mean \u201cnonreligious.\u201d Therefore, plaintiffs cannot succeed in demonstrating a violation of the establishment clause by showing that the school authorities are somehow advancing \u201csecular\u201d goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-11\">Part of plaintiffs\u2019 argument, however, is that secular humanism is itself a religion. They rely principally upon <em>Torcaso v. Watkins, </em>367 U.S. 488, 81 S.Ct. 1680, 6 L.Ed.2d 982 (1961).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Torcaso, </em>the Supreme Court did assume without deciding that certain non-theistic beliefs, including secu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1537\">*1537</page-number>lar humanism, were \u201creligions\u201d for purposes of the first amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1621-5\">Among religions in this country which do not teach what would generally be considered a belief in the existence of God are Buddhism, Taoism, Ethical Culture, Secular Humanism and others (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1621-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 495 n. 11, 81 S.Ct. at 1684 n. 11 (dictum). The apparent breadth of the reference to \u201cSecular Humanism,\u201d however, is entirely dependent upon viewing the term out of context. In context, it is clear that the Court meant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1621-7\">no more than a reference to the group seeking an exemption in <em>Fellowship of Humanity v. County of Alameda, </em>153 Cal.App.2d 673 [315 P.2d 394] (1957) which, although non-Theist in belief, also met weekly on Sundays and functioned much like a church____ Thus <em>Torcaso </em>does not stand for the proposition that \u201chumanism\u201d is a religion, although an organized group of \u201cSecular Humanists\u201d may be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1621-10\"><em>Malnak v. Yogi, </em>592 F.2d 197, 206 &amp; 212 (8d Cir.1979) (Adams, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-11\">Even if <em>The Learning Tree </em>is viewed as representative of what can fairly be characterized as \u201csecular humanism,\u201d it remains an autobiographical novel only tangentially concerned with religion. The work \u201cis still far removed from a comprehensive belief system laying claim to ultimate truth and supported by a formal group,\u201d <em>id, </em>at 212, which the Court was prepared to concede in <em>Torcaso </em>would constitute a religion. <em>See also Womens Sendees, P.C. v. Thone, </em>483 F.Supp. 1022, 1034 (D.Neb.1979), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>636 F.2d 206 (8th Cir.1980), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>452 U.S. 911 (1981) (concluding that nontheistic beliefs are \u201creligions\u201d in constitutional terms only if characterized by tenets and organization).</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-15\">Furthermore, in suggesting that secular humanism may be a religion, neither <em>Tor-caso </em>nor plaintiffs distinguish between \u201cestablishment\u201d and \u201cfree exercise.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Torca-so </em>is a free exercise case. While the Supreme Court has embraced a concept of religion in the free exercise context sufficiently expansive to encompass nontheistic views,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> there is much to be said for the view that the definition of religion should vary with the clause under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-16\">While a generous functional (and even idiosyncratic) definition best serves free exercise values, the same expansiveness in interpreting the establishment clause is simply untenable in an age of such pervasive governmental activity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1621-17\">To borrow the ultimate concern test from the free exercise context and use it with present establishment clause doctrines would be to invite attack on all programs that further the ultimate concerns of individuals or entangle the government with such concerns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1621-18\">Note, \u201cToward a Constitutional Definition of Religion,\u201d 91 Harv.L.Rev. 1056, 1084 (1978); <em>see Int\u2019l Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Barber, </em>650 F.2d 430, 439-40 (2d Cir.1981) (Kaufman, J.). Thus, \u201ca less expansive notion of religion [is] required for establishment clause purposes lest all \u2018humane\u2019 programs of government be deemed constitutionally suspect.\u201d L. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law </em>827-28 (1978).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1621-19\">In any event, it is sufficient here simply to point out that plaintiffs have not alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1538\">*1538</page-number>facts showing anything remotely resembling an establishment of a religion of secular humanism. At issue is not the wholesale imposition of secular humanist dogma, however defined,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but the assignment in the secondary curriculum of a discrete work, <em>The Learning Tree </em>by Gordon Parks. In assessing whether inclusion of a work violates the establishment clause, conclusionary characterizations are of little aid in the inquiry. <em>See Lynch v. Donnelly, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014,\u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1355, 1361-62 (1984). Establishment clause analysis is necessarily fact-dependent. <em>Id. </em>We must apply the clause in light of the text of the book itself, and the manner of its use in the curriculum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-6\">B. <em>Entanglement, Purpose and Effect</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1622-7\">In <em>Lynch v. Donnelly, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1355, 79 L.Ed.2d 604 (1984), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the relevance of what had generally been known as the <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman, </em>403 U.S. 602, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971), tripartite test.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Under <em>Lemon, </em>a state action or enactment does not violate the establishment clause if (1) it has a secular purpose; (2) its principal or primary effect is neither to advance nor inhibit religion; and (3) it does not foster excessive governmental entanglement with religion. <em>Id. </em>at 612-13, 91 S.Ct. at 2111-12. Although clarity, in the current context, would be aided by substituting \u201cnon-religious\u201d for \u201csecular,\u201d none of these factors supports a finding of impermissible establishment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-12\">In a somewhat novel twist on the issue of entanglement, plaintiffs claim that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aoi-dedup-1\">[t]his is not a case where we must show that the State has been too intertwined with religious agencies. In this case, the State <em>is </em>the agency of (anti-)religion. It is hard to become more entangled than thal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1622-13\">Appellants\u2019 Brief 44. This conclusion, however, is entirely dependent upon the fallacious dichotomy discounted above. <em>The Learning Tree </em>was neither purchased from nor provided by official humanist organizations. Nor does the work carry the imprimatur of these or similar religio-philosophical bodies.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There is no entanglement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-14\">Nor was selection and subsequent retention of the work impermissibly sectarian.

No such purpose has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-8\">The crux of plaintiffs\u2019 establishment claim is therefore that inclusion of <em>The Learning Tree </em>in the public schools has the primary effect of advancing the \u201creligion\u201d of secular humanism while inhibiting the plaintiffs\u2019 own religion of \u201cBiblical Christianity.\u201d Plaintiffs, insist that \u201cthe book ... clearly teaches anti-Christian concepts, values, and beliefs.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Brief 16. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that this characterization is correct, and that such views are consistent with the \u201creligions\u201d of humanism or secularism, \u201c \u2018not every law that confers an \u201cindirect,\u201d \u201cremote,\u201d or \u201cincidental\u201d benefit upon [religion] is, for that reason alone, constitutionally invalid.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lynch, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1364 <em>(citing Committee for Public Education &amp; Religious Liberty v.

Instead, the issue is whether its selection and retention by school officials \u201ccommuni-cat[es] a message of government endorsement\u201d of those elements.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is not the purpose of the public schools \u201cto cultivate an official faith or ideology, whether religious or humanistic in character____\u201d Kauper, \u201cPrayer, Public Schools and the Supreme Court,\u201d 61 Mieh.L.Rev. 1031, 1066 (1963).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Yet even the Bible may occupy a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1540\">*1540</page-number>place in the classroom, provided education and exposure do not become advocacy or endorsement. <em>Abington, </em>374 U.S. at 225, 83 S.Ct. at 1573.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-4\">In assessing whether inclusion of <em>The Learning Tree </em>communicates governmental endorsement or approval of its purportedly \u201canti-Christian\u201d or \u201csecular humanist\u201d elements, we must first examine the work as a whole. <em>See Lynch, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1362. The passages identified by plaintiffs are simply scattered references to religion in a much larger work depicting a poor, black adolescent\u2019s painful process of coming of age. Nor are these passages as much theology as anthropology, less commentary on religion than comment prompted by the frustrating confrontation of adolescents with evil, hypocrisy, and suffering. <em>See </em>Appendix. Indeed, while that distinction might be lost on third-graders, it is bound to be understood by Cassie Grove\u2019s classmates \u2014 high school sophomores confronting many of the same questions, and doubtless beginning to appreciate that many of the comforting assumptions and illusions of childhood are not always what they seemed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-5\">Second, we must examine the work as a whole in the context of the entire curriculum.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Were the school board in Cassie\u2019s district to require local principals to read over their public address systems a resolution, drawn in words from the book, declaring Jesus Christ to be a \u201cpoor white trash God,\u201d or \u201ca long-legged white son-of-a-bitch,\u201d Appendix, <em>infra </em>at 1547 and 1549, there would be little doubt that the effect would be to communicate governmental endorsement of anti-Christian sentiments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-6\">By contrast, <em>The Learning Tree </em>bears the sole signature of its author, Gordon Parks. It is a work of fiction, not dogmatic philosophy. It is one book, only tangentially \u201creligious,\u201d thematically grouped with others in the sophomore literature curriculum. Its purpose and effect is to expose students to the attitudes and outlooks of an important American subculture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-12\">Plaintiffs may be correct in suggesting that the work \u201chard[ly] ... constitutes the objective study of Christianity,\u201d Appellants\u2019 Brief 22, yet objectivity in education need not inhere in each individual item studied; if that were the requirement, precious little would be left to read. Instead, objectivity is to be assessed with reference to the manner in which often highly partisan, subjective material is presented, handled, and \u201cintegrated into the school curriculum, where [even] the Bible may constitutionally be used in an appropriate study of history, civilization, ethics, comparative religion, or the like.\u201d <em>Stone, </em>449 U.S. at 42, 101 S.Ct. at 194; <em>see Abington, </em>374 U.S. at 225, 83 S.Ct. at 1573.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-13\">Luther\u2019s \u201cNinety-five Theses\u201d are hardly balanced or objective, yet their pronounced and even vehement bias does not prevent their study in a history class\u2019 exploration of the Protestant Reformation, nor is Protestantism itself \u201cadvanced\u201d thereby. The study of Greek mythology does not \u201cadvance\u201d pantheism. Teaching about \u201cthe divine right of kings\u201d does not endorse a particular dogma, although one is necessarily explored.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1624-14\">Similarly, inclusion of <em>The Learning Tree </em>as representative of a particular literary genre neither religiously inhibits nor instills, but simply informs and educates students on a particular social outlook forged in the crucible of black rural life. To include the work no more communicates governmental endorsement of the author\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1541\">*1541</page-number>or characters religious views than to assign <em>Paradise Lost, Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, </em>or <em>The Divine Comedy </em>conveys endorsement or approval of Milton\u2019s, Bunyan\u2019s, or Dante\u2019s Christianity.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1625-4\">Even though <em>The Learning Tree </em>does not \u201cadvance\u201d secular humanism, it remains to consider whether the work \u201cinhibits\u201d fundamentalist or Biblical Christianity, as plaintiffs contend. There is, at least initially, apparent merit to this claim. When the work does discuss religion, it does so in a fashion which generally denigrates the figure of Jesus and casts doubt upon much fundamentalist doctrine \u2014 from the efficacy of prayer to the inerrancy of Scripture and benevolence of God. <em>See </em>Appendix. Nevertheless, in the context presented, these passages do not offend the establishment clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-5\">First, the work\u2019s purported hostility to religion may be more apparent than real. It is true that religious hypocrisy is one theme in the work. <em>See </em>Appendix. Yet the same might be said of both Jesus and the Old Testament prophets,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> let alone such secular \u2014 and celebrated \u2014 authors as Chaucer, Voltaire, Paine, Twain, or Sinclair Lewis.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It is also true that the adolescent protagonist in the <em>The Learning Tree </em>comes to doubt and question many of the simple pieties he has been taught. In the novel, the good die young while the wicked prosper, prejudice reigns, the innocent suffer; these circumstances lead to searching questions and nagging doubts. <em>See </em>Appendix. But they are not new questions; Job asked them as well.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Neither do they reflect hostility toward religion.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1625-9\">Of course, plaintiffs may personally espouse and prefer an unwavering acceptance of a number of the traditional religious doctrines doubted by characters in <em>The Learning Tree. </em>The issue, however, is not whether the work disapproves of any particular religious vision, including plaintiffs\u2019, but whether its inclusion in the public school curriculum indicates, intentionally or not, that the government joins in that disapproval.</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-10\">It is true that <em>The Learning Tree </em>poses questions and ponders doubts with which plaintiffs may be uncomfortable. Yet to pose questions is not to impose answers. Since the first amendment is designed as much to protect the former as prevent the latter, I cannot conclude, on the record presented, that use of <em>The Learning Tree </em>inhibits religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-11\">II. Free Exercise Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-12\">Plaintiffs allege that they- believe that \u201ceternal religious consequences\u201d result to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1542\">*1542</page-number>them and their children from exposure to <em>The Learning Tree </em>or discussion of it. That allegation<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> would probably be sufficient to present a free exercise question if Cassie Grove had been compelled to read the book or be present while it was discussed in class. She was not.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1626-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 free exercise claims appear to go further, however, and to contest the inclusion of the book in the curriculum whether or not Cassie Grove was excused. The free exercise clause does not go nearly so far. While it protects individuals from governmental interference with their religion in the absence of compelling justification, <em>see Wilson v. Block, </em>708 F.2d 735, 740 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>104 S.Ct. 371 (1983). <em>Callahan v. Woods, </em>736 F.2d 1269, 1272 (9th Cir.1984), it does not protect the individual from being religiously offended by what the government does.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-5\">Plaintiffs' submissions to this court make clear that they regard <em>The Learning Tree </em>as but a single symptom of a larger social disease: the wholesale secularization of society. As one prominent theologian has observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1626-6\">what is meant when people speak of a \u201csecular\u201d ... world [is that] it seems that ... more or less all the important spheres of human life \u2014 learning, economy, politics, law, state, culture, education, medicine, social welfare \u2014 have been withdrawn from the influence of the churches, of theology and religion, and placed under the direct responsibility and control of man...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1626-10\">H. Kung, <em>On Being a Christian </em>26-27 (1974). While plaintiffs are free to decry this secularization, and to resist, insofar as possible, its alleged perniciousness in their private lives, it is inevitable that in such a society, plaintiffs will find much with which they disagree.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1626-11\">The inevitability of this conflict between plaintiffs\u2019 religious rejection of \u201csecularism\u201d and the secularization of society suggests why antipathy alone, however sincere, is never enough to sustain a free exercise challenge. Plaintiffs are religiously offended by a particular novel; others previously before us have been religiously offended by Trident submarines or the nuclear arms race.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Were the free exercise clause violated whenever governmental activity is offensive to or at variance with sincerely held religious precepts, virtually no governmental program would be constitutionally possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-12\">When the contention is applied to education, Justice Jackson\u2019s admonition is especially appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1626-13\">Authorities list 256 separate and substantial religious bodies to exist in the ... United States____ If we are to eliminate everything that is objectionable to any of these warring sects or inconsistent with any of their doctrines, we will leave public education in shreds. Nothing but educational confusion and a discrediting of the public school system can result____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1626-15\"><em>McCollum v. Bd. of Educ., </em>333 U.S. 203, 235, 68 S.Ct. 461, 477, 92 L.Ed. 649 (1948) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1543\">*1543</page-number>(Jackson, J., concurring). The lesson is clear: governmental actions that merely offend or cast doubt on religious beliefs do not on that account violate free exercise. An actual burden on the profession or exercise of religion is required. <em>See Wilson, </em>708 F.2d at 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-5\">In short, distinctions must be drawn between those governmental actions that actually interfere with the exercise of religion, and those that merely require or result in exposure to attitudes and outlooks at odds with perspectives prompted by religion. Plaintiffs allege that they believe that \u201ceternal religious consequences\u201d would result from Cassie Grove\u2019s exposure to <em>The Learning Tree. </em>Such a belief might well require her being excused from such exposure. <em>See </em>note 26, <em>supra. </em>Mere offense, however, would not require her being excused, nor does mere offense at having <em>The Learning Tree </em>in the curriculum bring the free exercise clause to the aid of plaintiffs. There has been no violation of free exercise in this case.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1627-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-7\">We must remain sensitive to claims that government is either interfering with a religion or is supporting a competing religion. <em>See Crowley v. Smithsonian Institution, </em>636 F.2d at 743. Neither is the case here. On the contrary, if we were to grant the relief sought by plaintiffs and remove <em>The Learning Tree </em>from the curriculum because of plaintiffs\u2019 hostility to its ideas, our action would itself threaten first amendment values. \u201cOur Constitution does not permit the official suppression of ideas.\u201d <em>Bd. ofEduc. v. Pico, </em>457 U.S. 853, 871,102 S.Ct. 2799, 2810, 73 L.Ed.2d 435 (1982) (Brennan, J.) (plurality opin.). We are bound to respect that command as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-8\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-9\">To illustrate their objections to <em>The Learning Tree, </em>appellants appended fifteen separate passages from the work to their opening brief. Because analysis under the establishment clause is pre-eminently fact-dependent, <em>see Lynch v.

Jim was a fine man. Always come to church and prayer meetin\u2019.

Those about the table started to rise, but he spread his arms above them. \u201cSit, my dear children, and bless you, sister Sarah, for the wonderful repast.\u201d He plucked several toothpicks from a bowl and picked up his black \u201cpreacher\u2019s\u201d hat from the sideboard. As he passed Newt he patted him on the head. \u201cKeep studyin\u2019, boy. Givin\u2019 the right answer meant that chicken\u2019s leg instead of the part that went over the fence last.\u201d He chuckled.

Seems they ain\u2019t much good to the world, but God put 'em here. \u2022 Seems they got as much rights as we have to live. If the grasshoppers didn\u2019t eat the crops, they\u2019d starve. No worse\u2019n us killin\u2019 hogs and chickens so we don\u2019t go hungry. Hogs and chickens and cows and rabbits and squirrels, possums and such must hate us much as we hate mosquitoes and gnats and flies. Dogs and cats and horses are \u2018bout the. luckiest. \u2018Bout the only ones we don\u2019t go round killin\u2019 off all the time.

She had planned especially for him, her youngest, since the day he was born, but in the trials of living and caring for all the others she found it hard to clarify and formulate these plans. Now she welcomed the breakthrough. \u201cNewt, you just ask me anything you want and I'll try to answer you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1629-13\">\u201cWell, after the storm, Poppa said that the storm and the people killed and everything was the doin\u2019 of God.

And why did some of the town git torn up and the rest didn\u2019t?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1629-14\">Sarah Winger came to a complete stop, and Newt was instantly afraid he had offended her. He took a step beyond his mother, his face pointed straight ahead, eyes lowered and cast sideways for the reaction. Her lips parted, but she didn\u2019t speak immediately; then she started moving again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1629-15\">\u201cNewt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1629-16\">\u201cYessem.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1629-17\">\u201cYou know your poppa and me are religious people, don\u2019t you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1629-18\">\u201cYessem.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1629-19\">\u201cWell, it would be real easy for me to say, you don\u2019t question the ways of God\u2014 and I was tempted to \u2014 but I know deep in my heart that there\u2019s more to it than thal. It\u2019s true he guides us. But we cain\u2019t depend on him for everything. We gotta do things for ourself. Now, maybe if Jim had built himself a storm cellar or a stronger house, he wouldn\u2019t a got killed so easy. And if little Fannie Johnson\u2019s momma hadn\u2019t been drunk, she\u2019d a held onto that lamp and her daughter wouldn\u2019t a got burnt. It\u2019s like I say, we got to do some things for ourself. If you got a battle to fight, you cain\u2019t rightfully ask the Lord to help you and not the other fella.

It ain\u2019t a all-good place and it ain\u2019t a all-bad place. But you can learn just as much here about people and things as you can learn any place else.

But it\u2019s even more than sayin\u2019 you\u2019re a Christian. It\u2019s a matter of givin\u2019 more to this world than you take away from it. So when you die you don\u2019t owe it anything.

Maybe there ain\u2019t no hell either. Maybe there ain\u2019t no gold thrones in the clouds and maybe there ain\u2019t no pits of fire tended by a devil with a pitchfork tail. I honestly think God made us and expects us to do some good while we\u2019re here on earth. I cain\u2019t even say that God\u2019s his real name, but it\u2019s good as any. It means Almighty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1630-24\">Confusion disturbed her thoughts. \u201cAll my life I\u2019ve been told there is a better place beyond this one, Newt. And I guess I\u2019ll go to my grave believin\u2019 it. Such believin\u2019 has kept our family goin\u2019 when there wasn\u2019t much else to go on.\u201d She paused for a moment. Swallows, flying low and fast, fluttered the stillness. Then she spoke. \u201cThese are the things I was taught. It\u2019s awful hard now, this late, not to believe them.\u201d They didn\u2019t talk after thal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1630-25\">\n<em>Passage 4</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1630-26\">Wham!

Crapper slammed the door shut and followed them down the corridor. Marcus sat very still awhile, then suddenly he began to feel a deep sense of guilt, deeper than any he had ever felt in his whole life. He was bewildered. These people had come all that way to help him and he had hurt them, said things he didn\u2019t realize he could say. But what he\u2019d said was more for Crapper than for them, he realized. If Crapper hadn\u2019t stood in the door with that silly grin on his face, things might have been different. But it was too late now. The harm was done. Yet, somehow, he felt he had got a point across to Crapper. he didn\u2019t know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1550\">*1550</page-number>just whal. Maybe he was really defending those people against somebody like Crapper, who had once told him, \u201cAll niggas are stupid and crazy.\u201d In a way he was telling him that they weren\u2019t, that he was on to his kind and their \u201clily-white God\u201d that his paw damned when he got drunk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1634-4\">He glanced up.

His head fell back in the shadows and he closed his eyes, trying to form the image of a God with black skin, thick lips and coarse hair like his \u2014 but he couldn\u2019t. The image on the torn card at the foot of his bed had been implanted much too long before.

He wanted to ask God to help him fight to win, but he suddenly remembered his mother\u2019s telling him on the river road, many nights back, that God couldn\u2019t favor one fighter against another.

Realizing that if his mother died he might have to live with one or the other sister, he observed them closely \u2014 trying to decide which one he would rather be with. He liked them both, so he sat mentally sifting their habits and dispositions, applying them to his own simple, yet important, personal plans and desires. \u201cClara\u2019s a little bossy,\u201d he thought. \u201cShe\u2019d prob\u2019ly want me to stay in all the time \u2014 want to pick all my friends, too, but she likes to dress fancy\u2014 prob\u2019ly help me get some keen things to wear.

He watched the sky pale as the sun climbed to the foggy horizon and brightened the upper reaches. His mind, with unaccountable calm, explored the reality of this hour over the deep, uneven snoring of Roy and Pete, sleeping beside him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1635-14\">Their mother was dead, he knew, but it was hard to believe. Suddenly he wondered if, somewhere up there in the pale blue nothingness, her soul \u2014 free of tortured body and earthly things \u2014 was already floating silently about, knowing at last the real purpose of its sojourn on a complex and troubled earth. What if she found that all the praying and religious rites were just a lot of folly; that her soul floated with no more righteousness or dignity than that of Doc Cheney, Big Mabel, or even Captain Tuck? What a shock it would be to her!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1635-15\">He now thought uneasily of such a possibility, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel that this was more than likely the case \u2014 and the feeling shamed him. Then he softened his shame with the reasoning that if such were true, she would never begrudge anyone such equality. Whatever judgment settled upon her, he thought, would surely be the best that eternity could possibly extend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1635-16\">As Newt dressed quietly, the sun burned through the fog, warming the wet rooftops, drying the leaves and grass. And the moist cool earth took in the heat and in return gave forth little curlings of cloud that quickly disappeared in the clean morning air.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1635-17\">He entered the dining room and looked around. Everything was just about the same, except the door which the shot had blasted. Stepping to it, he ran his fingers over the splintered surface. Daylight leaked through it now, and a sudden fright gripped him, for he realized that this destruction was actually meant for Rende. Remembering the gun against his father\u2019s head, he shivered and stepped back involuntarily (this could\u2019ve been Poppa\u2019s skull), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1552\">*1552</page-number>then he moved warily across to his mother\u2019s room. They had already taken her to the undertaker\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1636-4\">The odor of camphor and medicine still hung in the air, and a bouquet of withered posies lay on the rocking chair in the corner of the room. The sheets had been removed, and the mattress was doubled upon the sagging springs. Above the antique dresser hung an oval-shaped photograph of his father and mother, framed in a polished, worn wood. It had been taken their wedding day, and both stared straight ahead \u2014 unmindful of this faraway moment when their last child would stand silent, alone and uncertain in this room of death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1636-5\">Almost in every sense, Newt had come to link death with violence. Even his mother\u2019s passing, he thought, couldn\u2019t escape a brush with it. Nearly everyone he had known intimately, and who had ceased to live, met their demise in bloodshed. And it was probably for this reason that he feared death so much \u2014 and this fear, he reasoned, was childish. His mother\u2019s easy, tranquil and unflinching acceptance of death enhanced his respect for her. Now, this morning, it was creating within him a near-fanatical desire to rid himself of this stigma that had dogged his soul since the day of Doc Cheney\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1636-6\">Turning from the room, he channeled his thoughts into an imaginary rectangular hole that someday would be his grave. And his whole being reacted against the eternal blackness, the unending airlessness, the unchangeable recumbent position of his body \u2014 never to eat, taste, feel, speak or hear again. He shuddered. Now he envisaged the others reposing about him, acre after acre; worm-bored coffin sides, everlasting decay, dust piling forever upon eternal dust \u2014 entombed in the still, suffocating blackness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1636-7\">Why, then, was life given, and for no logically explained reason taken away again? He recalled the rolling, wearisome voice of Pastor Broadnap. \u201c \u2014 From dust you came and to dust you must returneth!\u201d Newt remembered his authoritatively hollering such things over Big Mabel\u2019s coffin. He remembered, too, his swing about the pulpit, frock coat flying, sweat dripping, screaming of immortality \u2014 \u201cof the spirit, of the soul\u201d \u2014 not the good, solid body.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1619-10\">.
