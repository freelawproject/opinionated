The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Owen, J.) held that it could. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-18\">In 1976, Lachmar, a corporate partnership, entered into a shipping agreement with Trunkline LNG Company (TLC) pursuant to which Lachmar agreed to transport liquefied natural gas from Algeria to Louisiana for a period of twenty years. Trunk-line Gas Company (Trunkline) executed a separate agreement, in substance guaranteeing TLC\u2019s performance under its contract. Both agreements provide that controversies arising thereunder will be arbitrated in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-19\">The agreement between Lachmar and TLC contains a \u201cship or pay\u201d provision which requires TLC to make certain minimum annual payments regardless of whether any shipments actually are made. However, in December, 1983, TLC and Trunkline notified Lachmar that they were \u201csuspending\u201d their obligations under the contracts because of catastrophically adverse market conditions. Lachmar then demanded arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-20\">TLC and Trunkline argue that Lachmar may not go forward with the arbitration unless it joins Marad as a party. They predicate this argument upon security agreements between Lachmar and Marad pursuant to which Marad guaranteed the payment of Ship Financing Bonds issued by Lachmar to finance the construction of the two ocean tankers used in transporting the liquefied natural gas. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1271 <em>et seq. </em>In these agreements, Lach-mar granted, conveyed, assigned, etc. to Marad continuing security interests in all of its right, title and interest in its agreements with TLC and Trunkline.. The agreements also provide however that Marad shall not have any obligations under the transportation contract. TLC consented to the assignments in a written agreement which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-21\">The Security Agreements do not impose on the Secretary [of Commerce] any obligations or liabilities with respect to the Transportation Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-22\">Under New York law, made applicable by the parties, the assignee of rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>under a bilateral contract is not bound to perform the assignor\u2019s duties under the contract unless he expressly assumes to do so. <em>Sillman v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., </em>3 N.Y.2d 395, 402, 165 N.Y.S.2d 498, 144 N.E.2d 387 (1957). Included among the duties to which this rule has reference is the duty to arbitrate. <em>Matter of Kaufman, </em>272 A.D. 578, 581-82, 74 N.Y.S.2d 23 (1st Dep\u2019t 1947). Marad did not assume Lachmar\u2019s duty to arbitrate. Indeed, in the event of default in the guaranteed obligations or any related agreement, the Secretary of Commerce has the statutory right to \u201ctake such action against the obligor or any other parties liable thereunder that, in his discretion, may be required to protect the interests of the United States.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1275(e). Marad was neither a necessary nor indispensable party to the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
