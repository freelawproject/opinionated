Wex-ler, J., entered after a jury trial. They were each found guilty of one count of conspiring to distribute cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and of one count of possessing cocaine with an intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. We affirm on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">The prosecution presented four witnesses during the five-day trial: three government agents and Juan Caicedo, a participant in the scheme who subsequently entered into a cooperation agreement with the government. Judge Wexler, on the prosecution\u2019s motion, excluded evidence of a juvenile adjudication (involving kidnapping and assault with intent to rape) entered a few years earlier against Caicedo. Relying on <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974), appellants contend that this exclusion violated their Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. We disagree. <em>Davis </em>is distinguishable on at least two grounds. First, in <em>Davis </em>the witness was on probation for his juvenile adjudication at the time of the events at issue, and fear of jeopardizing his probationary status arguably furnished a strong motive to lie. <em>Id. </em>at 311, 94 S.Ct. at 1107. The witness here was not on probation and therefore did not have the same motivation to lie. Second, in <em>Davis </em>the exclusion left the defense without any substantial evidence with which \u201cto develop the issue of bias properly to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318, 94 S.Ct. at 1111. Here, by contrast, the defense had ample evidence, absent the juvenile adjudication, with which to impeach the witness\u2019 credibility in general and bias in particular. In response to questions put to him on cross-examination, Caicedo admitted that he \u201cfree based\u201d cocaine some four times a week and that free basing diminished his ability to recall. He acknowledged that as a result of his agreement with the government he would not be prosecuted for \u201c60, 70 or 80 other deals\u201d in which he had been involved. He was told that because of his cooperation with the government there \u201cmight be a possibility\u201d that he would receive a lesser sentence or a sentence under the Youth Corrections Act. And he emphasized that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know what is going to happen to these [defendants]. And to tell you the truth, I don\u2019t care.\u201d In short, appellants\u2019 ability to cross-examine Caicedo effectively was not substantially impeded by the exclusion of the evidence in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-15\">Appellants also contend that the district court should have admitted evidence of Caicedo\u2019s juvenile adjudication pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 609(d). The exclusion of the witness\u2019 juvenile adjudication did not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Lind, </em>542 F.2d 598, 599 (2d Cir.1976). In light of the ample opportunity for effective cross-examination discussed above, we cannot say that the judge erred in finding that the excluded evidence was not \u201cnecessary for a fair determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>the issue of guilt or innocence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 609(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">We therefore conclude that the challenged ruling was not improper. We question, however, whether the government was well advised to press the objection. In view of the other testimony, the additional evidence could hardly have had a significant effect on the jury\u2019s assessment of Caicedo\u2019s credibility, but the exclusion of the evidence provided defendants with a serious issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">We have considered appellants\u2019 other contentions and find them to be without merit. The admission of an incriminatory remark made by Ciro to Caicedo shortly after their arrest was proper because Caicedo was not acting as a government agent at the time. See <em>United States v. Calder, </em>641 F.2d 76, 78-79 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 912, 101 S.Ct. 1984, 68 L.Ed.2d 302 (1981). Ciro\u2019s claim that the government \u201cunreasonably and needlessly relied on extensive hearsay evidence\u201d in presenting its case to the grand jury is groundless. See <em>United States v. Dyman, </em>739 F.2d 762, 767 (2d Cir.1984). Although the district court declined to give the requested \u201chesitate to act\u201d formulation on reasonable doubt, the court\u2019s charge, read in its entirety, fairly conveyed to the jury the substance of reasonable doubt. Similarly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ciro\u2019s motion for severance. See <em>United States v. Siegel, </em>717 F.2d 9, 22 (2d Cir.1983). Sloan argues that the district court erred in permitting the government to introduce the small quantity of cocaine discovered in her possession at the time of her arrest. The evidence was properly admitted to rebut the impression defense counsel apparently tried to create, in cross-examining Detective Annarella, the undercover buyer, that Sloan might not have known that her conversation with Annarella was about cocaine. See <em>United States v. Levy, </em>731 F.2d 997, 1002 (2d Cir.1984). Finally, Sloan assigns error to the admission of her address book, which served to link her with Ciro and thus the conspiracy. We agree with the district court\u2019s determination that the book, found in Sloan\u2019s pocketbook, was lawfully seized incident to arrest. See <em>United States v. Barlin, </em>686 F.2d 81, 87 (2d Cir.1982) (\u201clady\u2019s handbag is the most likely place for a woman to conceal a weapon\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
