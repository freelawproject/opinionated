Holding that the trial court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice was an abuse of discretion, we reverse and remand to the district court so that appellant may present its federal claims for complete resolution before a federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-14\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-15\">The City of Sugar Land filed suit in state court against Signad, Inc., seeking to permanently enjoin the latter\u2019s use of a billboard allegedly not conforming with a city ordinance. Before seeking this injunctive relief, however, the City had confiscated the billboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-16\">About one month after the state action was begun, Signad filed suit in federal district court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) , asserting claims of conversion and taking without just compensation. The trial court dismissed without prejudice Sig-nad\u2019s suit in an order with no accompanying memorandum, apparently basing its order on grounds of abstention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-18\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-19\">This case presents us with a question of what is known as the \u201cfourth type\u201d of abstention, in which a federal court must decide whether to exercise jurisdiction when there are parallel state court proceedings. <em>See </em>17 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4247 (1978 &amp; Supp.1984). Although the doctrine is given the name abstention, in practice the federal courts in this context are anything but abstentious. When parallel state and federal litigation exists, the federal court\u2019s \u201cbalance [is] heavily weighted in favor of the exercise of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 16, 103 S.Ct. 927, 937, 74 L.Ed.2d 765, 780 (1983) .</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-21\">The Supreme Court first recognized this fourth type of abstention in <em>Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976). In that case, the Court expressed the view that, while a federal court generally may not decline to exercise its jurisdiction because of parallel state litigation, exceptional circumstances may exist to warrant abstention. <em>Id. </em>at 819, 96 S.Ct. at 1246, 47 L.Ed.2d at 499. It has refined the doctrine most recently in <em>Moses, </em>460 U.S. at 15-27, 103 S.Ct. at 937-43, 74 L.Ed.2d at 779-87. In that case, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-22\">When a district court decides to dismiss or stay under <em>Colorado River, </em>it presumably concludes that the parallel state-court litigation will be an adequate vehicle for the complete resolution of the issues between the parties. If there is any substantial doubt as to this, it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>be a serious abuse of discretion to grant the stay or dismissal at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">460 U.S. at 28, 103 S.Ct. at 943, 74 L.Ed.2d at 787. We see no exceptional circumstance that should require Signad to litigate its claim in the state court proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-6\">Of course, the Pullman<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>-type abstention is commonplace with section 1983 claims. <em>See, e.g., Stephens v. Bowie County, </em>724 F.2d 434 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Brooks v. Walker County Hospital District, </em>688 F.2d 334 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>462 U.S. 1105, 103 S.Ct. 2452, 77 L.Ed.2d 1332 (1983); <em>Ibarra v. Bexar County Hospital District, </em>624 F.2d 44 (5th Cir.1980). We find no decision by this court in which a <em>Colorado River </em>abstention was considered in the context of section 1983. We must agree with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s statement that the \u201cunflagging obligation\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the federal courts to exercise the jurisdiction given them \u201cis particularly weighty when those seeking a hearing in federal court are asserting ... their right to relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Tovar v. Billmeyer, </em>609 F.2d 1291, 1293 (9th Cir.1980); <em>see Canton v. Spokane School District No. 81, </em>498 F.2d 840, 845-46 (9th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-7\">In <em>Colorado River, </em>424 U.S. at 818-19, 96 S.Ct. at 1246-47, 47 L.Ed.2d at 498-99, the Court identified three factors to be considered in assessing the appropriateness of abstention in <em>in personam </em>cases: (a) the inconvenience of the federal forum; (b) the desirability of avoiding piecemeal litigation; and (c) the order in which jurisdiction was obtained by the concurrent forums. None of these factors militates against the exercise of jurisdiction in this case. As to the first factor, Signad argues that Houston, the situs of the federal litigation, and Richmond, of the state claim, are equidistant from Sugar Land, where the dispute arose. In rebuttal, the City points out that Sugar Land is 18 miles from Houston and 9.5 miles from Richmond. We reaffirm the memorable adage, <em>de minimis non curat lex.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1426-14\">On the issue of piecemeal litigation, we adopt the Ninth Circuit\u2019s view that \u201cpiecemeal litigation and some duplication of judicial effort is the unavoidable price of preserving access to the federal relief which section 1983 assures.\u201d <em>Tovar v. Billmeyer, </em>609 F.2d 1291, 1293 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-15\">Finally, with regard to the question of priority in the concurrent forums, we take cognizance of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent teaching that this element \u201cis to be applied in a pragmatic, flexible manner with a view to the realities of the case at hand. Thus, priority should not be measured exclusively by which complaint was filed first, but rather in terms of how much progress has been made in the two actions.\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 21, 103 S.Ct. 927, 940, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983). It is undisputed that discovery was at a more advanced stage in the federal than in the state litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-16\">Application of the test enunciated in <em>Colorado River, </em>then, leads us to conclude that abstention was improper here. Our decision is all the more compelling inasmuch as this is a section 1983 claim in which <em>Colorado River </em>abstention is urged; and we see none of the exceptional circumstances <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> justifying abstention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-17\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1426-8\">. <em>Railroad Comm\u2019n of Texas v.
