No. 96-481, \u00a7 204(c), 94 Stat. 2321, 2329 (the \u201cEAJA\u201d). The application, which is directed to this panel following its action on a petition for review of a final order of the Merit System Protection Board (the \u201cMSPB\u201d), requires us to consider some interesting procedural complications of the EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">In 1980, petitioner Daniel J. Miller was discharged by the Army and he appealed the discharge to the MSPB. The MSPB decided that Miller had no statutory right to an appeal, and Miller petitioned this court to review that decision. We vacated the order of the MSPB and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Miller v. United States, </em>717 F.2d 109 (3d Cir.1983). Following our order, the MSPB granted Miller some but not all of the relief he requested, and he again petitioned for review, this time to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which had, in the interim, assumed jurisdiction over MSPB decisions pursuant to the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, Pub.L. No. 97-164, 96 Stat. 25 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that Miller is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees for work performed in connection with his original appeal to the MSPB, his petition for review to this court, and the portion of his fee petition relating to those aspects of the case. Moreover, we will grant Miller thirty days to file an amended (and reorganized) fee petition documenting the hours worked and expenses incurred exclusively in connection with these aspects of the litigation. The government will then have thirty days to object to the specifics of Miller\u2019s request. Finally, we hold that we have no jurisdiction over the portion of Miller\u2019s petition regarding work done on appeal to the Federal Circuit, and we will therefore transfer that part of Miller\u2019s application to that court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">The underlying facts of this case are set out in detail in our previous opinion, <em>Miller v. United States, </em>717 F.2d 109 (3d Cir.1983). In summary, the Department of the Army discharged Miller from his position as an electronics mechanic\u2019s helper at the Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania army depot in November 1980. The Army acted after discovering that Miller\u2019s college degree rendered him overqualified for that position under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2014 (1976); it refused to request a variance from government regulations that would have permitted Miller to retain his job. Miller appealed the discharge to the MSPB, which dismissed his appeal on the grounds that he had never been an \u201cemployee\u201d and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>had no statutory right of appeal to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Miller petitioned this court for review of the MSPB order. We held that Miller was. an employee under the clear language of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(B), rejecting the Army\u2019s contention that, because Miller had never been eligible for his job, his termination did not constitute \u201cadverse action\u201d to which the definition of employee in \u00a7 7511 applies. 717 F.2d at 112. We stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayg\">We simply cannot accept [the Army\u2019s] argument. On November 9, 1980, Miller was working as an Army electrician, as he had been doing for two years; on November 10, 1980, the Army told him he no longer had a job. It is hard for us to imagine action against an individual that could be more \u201cadverse.\u201d Moreover, section 7512 makes clear that the adverse action procedures apply to \u201cremovals,\u201d and whatever the reason, Miller certainly was removed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 112-13 (footnote omitted). We thus vacated the order of the MSPB and remanded for consideration of the merits of Miller\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Our judgment remanding the case to the MSPB was entered on September 21, 1983. On November 21, 1983, Miller filed an application pursuant to the EAJA for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in prosecuting his claim before the MSPB and this court. On April 11,1984, Miller notified us that, on remand, the MSPB had, without additional briefing or argument, reinstated him. At the same time, he amended his fee application to cover the time expended on his request for fees. Since the MSPB failed to award Miller backpay or order the Army to credit him for the annual leave, sick leave, seniority, and retirement benefits that he would have earned had he been working, he again appealed for review of the MSPB decision, this time to the newly created United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9). On October 17, 1984, Miller informed us that this latest appeal was dismissed after the government paid him $6502 in back pay, and added 227 hours and 72 hours to his annual leave and sick leave accounts, respectively. Miller then amended his petition to cover the fees and expenses incurred in these latest efforts, and also requested additional fees for counsel\u2019s work on the fee petition amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">In order to be awarded reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and expenses under the EAJA, Miller must be a \u201cprevailing party\u201d as against the United States, and his application for fees must have been filed \u201cwithin thirty days of final judgment in the action.\u201d If he meets these requirements, Miller is entitled to the fees and expenses unless the government can show that its position was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">When the present petition was filed, the government attacked it as untimely because it was filed more than thirty days after this court\u2019s order remanding the case to the MSPB. Miller argued that his application was timely because it was filed prior to thirty days after time had expired for the government to appeal our decision. Since there was a conflict in the circuits on this issue, we ordered briefing by the parties. While we were in the course of preparing an opinion, another panel of this court resolved the question, holding that \u201cfee petitions under the EAJA must be filed no later than thirty days after the expiration of the time to appeal, or after the termination of the litigation by the court of last resort, or after a losing party asserts that no .further appeal will be taken.\u201d <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>749 F.2d 171 at 174 (3d Cir.1984). Under the rule set out in <em>Taylor, </em>Miller\u2019s application for fees was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">Miller was not, however, a prevailing party when he filed his fee petition. \u201cWhen a court vacates an administrative decision and remands the matter for reconsideration, the successful party generally should not recover attorney\u2019s fees at that particular time since the claimant\u2019s rights and liabilities have not yet been deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>mined.\u201d <em>Brown v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>747 F.2d 878 at 883 (3d Cir.1984). Miller\u2019s fee request, then, rather than being late, was premature. After he filed this petition, however, Miller was reinstated by order of the MSPB and was given back pay and benefits in a subsequent settlement with the Army. There is thus no question at this point in time that Miller is a prevailing party, and we see no reason why we should not treat his premature petition as though it had been appropriately filed. The government cannot complain that it is prejudiced by this result. <em>See Cape May Greene, Inc. v. Warren, </em>698 F.2d 179, 184-85 (3d Cir.1983) (premature appeal may be considered absent a showing of prejudice to the other party).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Miller is thus entitled to attorney\u2019s fees \u201cunless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified ____\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). The burden of proving substantial justification is on the government. <em>Dougherty v. Lehman, </em>711 F.2d 555, 561 (3d Cir.1983). The position of the United States includes not only its litigation position but also the agency position that made the law suit necessary. <em>National Resources Defense Council v. EPA, </em>703 F.2d 700, 708 (3d Cir.1983) (Gibbons, J., announcing the judgment of the court); <em>id. </em>at 714-17 (Thompson, J., concurring); <em>Dougherty, </em>711 F.2d at 563 n. 12. To meet its burden, the government must show (1) a reasonable basis in truth for the facts alleged; (2) a reasonable basis in law for the theory it propounds; and (3) a reasonable connection between the facts alleged and the legal theory advanced. <em>Citizens Council of Delaware County v. Brinegar, </em>741 F.2d 584 at 592-593 (3d Cir.1984); <em>Dough-erty, </em>711 F.2d at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">We believe that the Army has not met its burden of showing that its prelitigation and litigation positions were substantially justified.' Initially, the Army chose to discharge Miller after it learned of his overqualification; it refused to apply for a variance of regulations that would have permitted Miller to remain employed. When Miller attempted to have the MSPB review the Army\u2019s action, the Army contended that the MSPB had no jurisdiction because Miller had never been an \u201cemployee\u201d who suffered an \u201cadverse action,\u201d the requirements for MSPB review under the applicable law. The Army\u2019s litigation posture had no legal foundation; it was sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>ported neither by the plain language of title 5 nor by judicial precedent, and we roundly rejected it. There was therefore no basis in law for the Army\u2019s position before the agency and before this court, hence it has not met its burden of a \u201cstrong showing,\u201d <em>see Tressler v. Heckler, </em>748 F.2d 146 at 150 (3d Cir.1984), that its position was substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In view of the foregoing, Miller is entitled to obtain attorney\u2019s fees and expenses for his appeal to this court. Miller has requested, in addition, that we award him fees for work done during the appeal to the MSPB. Although \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) of the EAJA grants courts the power to award only those fees and expenses incurred by a prevailing party during \u201cactions in court,\u201d \u00a7 2412(d)(3) states that a court reviewing an \u201cadversary adjudication ... shall include\u201d in its award fees for work done before the agency \u201cto the same extent [the agency is] authorized\u201d to award fees under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">\u201cAdversary adjudication\u201d is defined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(b)(1)(C) as an adjudication \u201cin which the position of the United States is represented by counsel or otherwise.\u201d Since the government (here, the Army) is represented during proceedings before the MSPB, such proceedings meet the \u00a7 504(b)(1)(C) definition. Thus, if the MSPB could have awarded fees under \u00a7 504(a), we have the statutory authority to do so under \u00a7 2412(d)(3). The agency is empowered to award fees by the express terms of \u00a7 504(a) if the petitioner is a prevailing party and the position of the agency not is substantially justified.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As detailed above, <em>see supra </em>pp. 149-50, Miller meets both of these requirements. Therefore, we have the power under \u00a7 2412(d)(3) to award fees to Miller for the agency proceedings, and we hold that Miller is entitled to reasonable fees and expenses for the initial phase of the litigation before the MSPB.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">Miller\u2019s petition includes a request for fees and expenses that he incurred during the pendency of his appeal before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On April 2, 1982, Congress passed the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, Pub.L. No. 97-164, 96 Stat. 25 (1982). One section of that act, codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9), which became effective October 1, 1982, provides that all appeals from decisions of the MSPB are to be taken to the newly created Court of Appeals for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Federal Circuit. Accordingly, after the MSPB granted Miller only part of the relief he requested following the remand from this court, Miller petitioned the Federal Circuit for review. This appeal was dismissed when the parties agreed to a settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">This court had no jurisdiction over Miller\u2019s appeal to the Federal Circuit. It follows from this fact that we have no jurisdiction to consider Miller\u2019s petition for attorney\u2019s fees as it regards work carried out during the pendency of that appeal. We do not believe, however, that we must simply dismiss this part of Miller petition. In 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, Congress provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">Whenever ... [a] court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer [an] action or appeal to any other such court in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">It is clear that the Federal Circuit would have had jurisdiction over Miller\u2019s October 17, 1984, fee petition amendment had it been filed as an original petition with that court. Because we do not think Miller should be prejudiced by the unusual fact that jurisdiction over appeals from the MSPB was altered by Congress during the pendency of this litigation, we believe that it is \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d that we transfer this part of Miller\u2019s petition for attorney\u2019s fees to the Federal Circuit for further consideration. Although we recognize that \u00a7 1631 is addressed to the transfer of \u201ccivil actions\u201d and \u201cappeals,\u201d we have no difficulty with the proposition that this language is broad enough to cover fee petitions filed pursuant to the EAJA.in connection with a civil action or an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Miller\u2019s fee petition and its amendments make no clear distinction between work done in connection with the phases of the litigation over which we have decided Miller is entitled to fees and the phase that we have decided to transfer to the Federal Circuit. Moreover, the government has not yet made submissions addressing the details of Miller\u2019s fee request, apparently because of the disputes over the timeliness of the original fee petition and the issue of substantial justification, and because Miller has amended his petition on several occasions. For these reasons, we will grant Miller thirty days to file an amended fee petition documenting hours worked and expenses incurred solely in connection with the initial appeal to the MSPB, the appeal to this court, and the portions of the fee petition relating to these phases of the litigation. The government will then have thirty days in which to file a response. Upon receipt of these papers, we will determine the amount of fees to be awarded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-6\">. We note that <em>Brown </em>might be read to create a potential problem for future litigants in Miller's position. Under <em>Brown, </em>a litigant is generally not a prevailing party until he obtains substantive relief from a court or agency. Thus, the judgment of a court merely remanding a case back to an agency cannot be the \"final judgment in the action\u201d that implicates the thirty day rule (as it is interpreted by <em>Taylor), </em>for at the time of this judgment the potential petitioner is not yet a prevailing party. According to <em>Guthrie v. Schweiker, </em>718 F.2d 104, 106 (4th Cir.1983), the subsequent order of the agency awarding the litigant his requested relief \u2014 which makes the litigant a prevailing party \u2014 is also not the final judgment, because the \u201cEAJA draws a clear distinction between final administrative actions and final judicial actions. <em>Compare </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(a)(2) (Cum.Supp.1983) <em>with </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B) (Cum.Supp.1983).\u201d This problem was resolved in <em>Brown, </em>a social security case, by looking to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), which requires the district court to retain jurisdiction over cases remanded to the social security administration, and to affirm, modify, or reverse the agency\u2019s subsequent award of benefits. We held in <em>Brown </em>that the judgment of the district court after the agency\u2019s action on remand is the final judgment for .purposes of the EAJA in social security cases.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayz\">In this case, however, no statutory provision comparable to \u00a7 405(g) exists, and there is no obvious final judgment from which to count thirty days in accordance with the <em>Taylor </em>rule. Miller contends that the \"final judgment\u201d here was the Federal Circuit's dismissal of his appeal, but this result depends on the mere coincidence that Miller was dissatisfied with the second MSPB order and decided to file a second appeal that was dismissed after he was a prevailing party. The government suggests that the MSPB order following our remand was the \"final judgment\" because, until the issuance of that order, we retained jurisdiction over the case to ensure that our mandate was carried out. Despite the language in <em>Guthrie, </em>which was also a social security case, the government's position seems persuasive and, if correct, the putative problem would disappear. However, because we hold that we may consider Miller\u2019s premature application as timely filed no matter what constituted the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in this case, we do not have to resolve this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\">. The full language of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(a)(1) is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">An agency that conducts an adversary adjudication shall award, to a prevailing party other than the United States, fees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection with that proceeding, unless the adjudicative officer of the agency finds that the position of the agency as a party to the proceeding was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b361-10\">. In <em>Brown, </em>we stated that \"[o]n its face the [EAJA] applies only to proceedings in \u2018court\u2019 and therefore proceedings in an administrative agency are excluded from its coverage.\u201d At 880. However, this statement was made in reference only to \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A), which does apply only to \u201cactions in court.\u201d At 880. Moreover, as applied to the case before it, the statement was correct: <em>Brown </em>dealt with review of a decision of the Social Security Administration and the government is not represented at social security hearings. Such hearings, therefore, are not \"adversary adjudications\u201d to which \u00a7 504(a) (and thus \u00a7 2412(d)(3)) applies. <em>Watkins v. Harris, </em>566 F.Supp. 493, 497 (E.D.Pa.1983). The government agrees that, although the language used by the court in <em>Brown </em>appears general, it is inapplicable to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"ALp\">We note that Miller has requested fees for only 25 hours of work during the MSPB phase of the litigation. If his request were more extensive, we would be inclined to refrain from exercising our \u00a7 2412(d)(3) authority, and would remand this part of the fee petition back to the agency for consideration pursuant to its power under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(a). The MSPB is more intimately acquainted with this part of counsel\u2019s work, and could more readily assess its necessity and quality. However, where, as here, the fees requested for agency work are small compared to the overall fee request, and the agency record was reviewed by us in connection with our adjudication, we believe that such a fragmentation of the fee calculation would be unnecessary and inefficient. <em>Accord, Taylor, </em>at 174 (interpreting 30 day rule so as to avoid, <em>inter alia, </em>fragmentation of fee litigation).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
