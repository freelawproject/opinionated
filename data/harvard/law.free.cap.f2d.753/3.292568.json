Alita-lia Airlines, </em>600 F.Supp. 268 (S.D.N.Y. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Alitalia makes two arguments on appeal that are not directly addressed in Judge Haight\u2019s opinion. We find no merit in either of them. The argument that Ali-talia is prohibited from bargaining with the IAM because it lacks majority support, is answered by Section 2, Ninth of the Railway Labor Act itself, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152, Ninth (1982). Section 2, Ninth states that on receipt of the National Mediation Board\u2019s certification, \u201cthe carrier <em>shall </em>treat with the representative so certi-fied____\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Alitalia also claims that it should be allowed to withdraw recognition of the IAM because it has a good faith doubt that the IAM has majority support. Finding no precedent under the Railway Labor Act supporting its position, Alitalia relies on cases decided under the National Labor Relations Act. Acceptance of this approach would do violence to the statutory scheme established by Congress. <em>Ruby v. American Airlines, </em>323 F.2d 248, 255-56 (2d Cir.1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>376 U.S. 913, 84 S.Ct. 658, 11 L.Ed.2d 611 (1964). We find no merit in Alitalia's claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
