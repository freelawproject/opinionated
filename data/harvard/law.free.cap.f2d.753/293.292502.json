Following a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, defendant was convicted of the substantive offense but was acquitted of the conspiracy charge. His three co-defendants, Mitchell Inselberg, Michael Morrone, and Jennifer Santilli, were each acquitted on both counts. After denying defendant\u2019s post-trial motions, the district court sentenced defendant to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment and imposed a $10,-000. fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-18\">Agnes filed a timely notice of appeal on January 20, 1984. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1982). We will affirm for the reasons stated in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-19\">I. <em>Factual History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-20\">We adopt the district court\u2019s summary of the evidence presented at trial as stated in its memorandum opinion of February 27, 1984, denying defendant\u2019s post-trial motions. <em>See United States v. Agnes, </em>581 F.Supp. 462, 464-67 (E.D.Pa.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-21\">In the fall of 1980, defendant, Louis Agnes, met two stained-glass artisans, Joseph Lam and Cheryl Hahn, who were working at a stained-glass workshop in New Hope, Pennsylvania. Agnes complimented the two on their work and offered to provide them with financial backing if they ever decided to open their own business. In April of 1981, Lam and Hahn made such a decision and contacted Agnes about his earlier offer. Following some negotiations, Agnes loaned Lam and Hahn $5,000. in cash at no interest. Agnes asked Lam to sign an I.O.U. immediately, stating that he would have more formal loan documents prepared for their signatures at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-22\">Lam and Hahn opened the new business, Crescent Stained Glass Company, in mid-April 1981. Approximately one month later, Agnes met with the two and presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>them with documents to be signed. Instead of evidencing a loan agreement between Agnes and the two, the documents were written in the form of limited partnership agreements. Moreover, Agnes\u2019 name did not appear on the documents; rather the agreement listed the names of Michael Morrone and Jennifer Santilli as partners with Lam and Hahn. Agnes explained that he wanted to use the others\u2019 names to represent his interest so that his wife would not learn of this asset during their pending divorce proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Lam and Hahn were upset with the unexpected nature of the documents and were reluctant to sign them. After Agnes became angry and threatening, however, the two did sign the documents that day. The documents characterized Agnes\u2019 $5,000. advance as a capital investment by Mor-rone and Santilli, which was to be repaid without interest over a period of twenty-one months beginning in July 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Although no monthly payments were due to be made by Lam and Hahn for several months, Agnes began asking for money from the business almost immediately. In May 1981, at Agnes\u2019 insistence, Lam leased a Mercedes Benz automobile for Agnes. In June and July 1981, Lam gave Agnes two cash payments of $1,000. each in response to Agnes\u2019 constant demands for more money-</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">In mid-July 1981, when business at Crescent began to slow considerably, Agnes accused Lam of stealing money from the business and converting partnership property. Lam denied these charges and told Agnes that there was no more money to pay him. Agnes responded on several occasions by threatening to physically harm Lam if Lam did not make more payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">On September 13, 1981, Agnes entered the shop with Michael Morrone, Jennifer Santilli, Mitchell Inselberg, and three other men. Although the shop was closed, Lam and Hahn were present along with three employees, Thomas Bryant, Leigh DiMezza and Michael Rogers. Agnes announced he was closing the business and taking everything in the shop. Agnes threatened Lam and then struck him in the face. He told Lam that no one had better interfere with his efforts to remove all the property from the shop. As a result of Agnes\u2019 actions and threats, Lam, Hahn, and the three employees were placed in fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Agnes then supervised the removal of items from the shop, deciding which items would be. taken and which would be left behind. Agnes also told Morrone to guard Lam so that Lam could not leave or take items out of the shop. Agnes continued to make threats against Lam throughout the evening. Agnes told Lam, among other things, that he was going to break Lam\u2019s legs, that he would break Lam\u2019s hand so that Lam would never be able to make stained glass again, that he should put a bullet through Lam\u2019s head, and that Lam did not deserve to see his next birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">One employee, Thomas Bryant, attempted to hide from Agnes certain items held by the business on consignment. Agnes confronted Bryant, threatened him, and struck him in the jaw, causing him to fall and injure his head. The New Hope police, who had been alerted that some unusual events were taking place, came twice to the shop to investigate. But Lam, while being threatened by Agnes, sent the police away both times, telling them that there was no problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">Agnes took almost all the property in the shop, including business records, inventory, and personal items. Prior to leaving, Agnes forced Lam to sign a document stating that he had sold all of the shop\u2019s contents to Agnes for one dollar. Agnes then threatened to break Lam\u2019s legs if Lam touched the business checkbook. He told Lam he would return the next day to put a bullet through the shop\u2019s supply of raw glass, which did not fit in the Mercedes Benz and pickup truck in which the group arrived. When Lam then tried to get some of the items back from Agnes, Agnes told Lam that he should have put a bullet in Lam\u2019s head when he had the chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">In March 1982, Philadelphia police and FBI agents searched Agnes\u2019 apartment pursuant to a search warrant and discover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>ed some of Crescent\u2019s business records as well as some stained-glass items. On October 18, 1982, Agnes was indicted along with Inselberg, Morrone, and Santilli. Agnes now appeals his judgment of conviction for violating the Hobbs Act, alleging several different errors by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">II. <em>Claim-of-Right Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"AIE\">A. <em>General Claim-of-Right Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"A1U\">Defendant first alleges that the district court erred, as a matter of law, in refusing to permit the admission of any evidence demonstrating his belief that he had a lawful claim of right to the property he took from the Crescent Stained Glass shop on September 13, 1981. Defendant wished to introduce evidence supporting his contention that he was a part owner of Crescent and, as such, had a lawful right to dissolve the business and take property from it because his partner, Joseph Lam, had been embezzling money from the business. The district court did not allow the admission of such evidence, stating that any belief by defendant that he had a lawful claim of right to the property allegedly extorted is no defense to the charge of violating the Hobbs Act or conspiring to violate the Hobbs Act <em>(see </em>Tr. 401, 417).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Defendant was convicted of violating the extortion branch of the Hobbs Act as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(2). That section defines extortion as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">\u201c... the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(2) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Defendant argues that, in this case, his taking of property from the shop did not constitute extortion because it was not accomplished by the \u201cwrongful\u201d use of force, violence, or fear. He contends that the word \u201cwrongful\u201d serves to exclude from the purview of the statute the use of force in obtaining property to which one has a lawful claim of right. Defendant, therefore, maintains that the district court erred in refusing to permit him to assert a claim-of-right defense and in failing to properly instruct the jury on the meaning of the word \u201cwrongful\u201d in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">Defendant preserved these claims for appeal by raising them at trial and in post-trial motions. By memorandum opinion dated February 27, 1984, the district court rejected defendant\u2019s argument that there is a general claim-of-right defense to Hobbs Act extortion. <em>United States v. Agnes, </em>581 F.Supp. 462, 470-71 (E.D.Pa.1984). We agree with the conclusion of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-14\">The Hobbs Act was enacted by the Congress in 1946. Pub.L. No. 79-486, 60 Stat. 420 (1946). The statutory language defining extortion that was originally included in the Act remains in effect today. The language was copied substantially from the then-existing New York Criminal Code. The legislative history leaves no doubt that the definition of extortion under the Hobbs Act was to be the same as that under the New York Code as construed by the New York courts in 1946, when the Act became effective.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">Whether the Hobbs Act allows for a claim-of-right defense, therefore, depends initially on the existence of the defense under New York law in. 1946. In 1942, the Second Circuit stated that New York courts would no longer recognize a claim-of-right defense under New York\u2019s extortion statute. <em>See United States v. Pigna-telli, </em>125 F.2d 643, 647 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>316 U.S. 680, 62 S.Ct. 1269, 86 L.Ed. 1754 (1942). The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court confirmed that belief in 1952 by expressly approving <em>Pig-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number><em>natelli </em>in <em>People v. Fichtner, </em>281 A.D. 159, 165,118 N.Y.S.2d 392, 398 (1952), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>305 N.Y. 864, 114 N.E.2d 212 (1953). Thus, until 1973, when the Supreme Court of the United States rendered its decision in <em>United States v. Enmons, </em>410 U.S. 396, 93 S.Ct. 1007, 35 L.Ed.2d 379 (1973), there was little arguable authority for the proposition that a person could raise as a defense to the charge of Hobbs Act extortion that he had a lawful claim of right to the property allegedly obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The <em>Enmons </em>decision serves as the primary basis for defendant\u2019s position that there is a claim-of-right defense to the charge of Hobbs Act extortion. In <em>En-mons, </em>the Supreme Court, by a five to four vote, held that the Hobbs Act does not prohibit employees\u2019 use of violence to obtain legitimate union objectives, such as higher wages in return for services desired by the employer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Government had contended in <em>Enmons </em>that the unambiguous language of the Hobbs Act clearly reaches <em>all </em>instances in which force is used to obtain property \u2014 even during the course of labor disputes. Justice Stewart, writing for the majority, rejected this interpretation of the Hobbs Act; he countered that this construction would make the word \u201cwrongful\u201d in the Act superfluous. 410 U.S. at 399-400, 93 S.Ct. at 1009-1010. The addition of the word \u201cwrongful,\u201d in Justice Stewart\u2019s view, rendered the express language of the statute ambiguous, which required the Court to examine the legislative history of the Act to determine whether Congress intended it to cover cases of strike violence. <em>Id. </em>at 400-01, 93 S.Ct. at 1009-10.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court held that the legislative history was clear: Congress expressly declared its intent to exclude labor violence from coverage of the Hobbs Act. <em>Id. </em>at 401-08, 93 S.Ct. at 1010-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">We construed the <em>Enmons </em>decision in <em>United States v. Cerilli, </em>603 F.2d 415 (3d Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1043, 100 S.Ct. 728, 62 L.Ed.2d 728 (1980). In that case, defendants had been convicted of extortion under the Hobbs Act for coercively soliciting political contributions. Relying on Justice Stewart\u2019s statutory interpretation in <em>Enmons, </em>the defendants contended that their conduct did not violate the Hobbs Act because the solicitation of political contributions was not inherently \u201cwrongful.\u201d Judge Higginbotham, writing for the majority in <em>Cerilli, </em>agreed that such solicitations generally were not \u201cwrongful\u201d but concluded that the coercive solicitations conducted by the defendants were \u201cwrongful\u201d because the defendants had no \u201clawful claim\u201d to the contributions solicited. <em>Id. </em>at 419. The defendant in this case thus cites <em>Cerilli </em>to support his proposition that the Hobbs Act proscribes only that use of force to obtain property which is not justified by the taker\u2019s lawful claim to the property. We conclude, however, that defendant\u2019s position is not a correct reading of <em>Enmons </em>as interpreted by <em>Cerilli.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Justice Stewart\u2019s definition of the word \u201cwrongful\u201d in the Hobbs Act was not based primarily on the defendant\u2019s lawful claim to higher wages in that case. Rather, it was based on clearly expressed legislative intent that violence committed by striking workers in furtherance of their strike not be included within the proscription of the Hobbs Act. As Judge Higgin-botham stated in <em>Cerilli:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">\u201cThus we understand <em>Enmons </em>as not relying primarily on the legitimacy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>union\u2019s objectives but rather on the clear Congressional intent, as expressed both in the legislative history of the Hobbs Act and the entire federal scheme regulating labor-management relations, that violence during labor strikes not be punishable as extortion under the Hobbs Act. There is no corresponding intent to exempt the type of activity here from the ambit of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">603 F.2d at 420 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">We interpret <em>Enmons </em>to create a claim-of-right defense only in those situations in which the use of force is expressly identified by Congress as being outside the purview of the Hobbs Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s alleged behavior in this case was not so excluded by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Our interpretation of the <em>Enmons </em>decision is supported by other Courts of Appeals that have considered the issue. <em>See United States v. Zappola, </em>677 F.2d 264, 268-70 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 866, 103 S.Ct. 145, 74 L.Ed.2d 122 (1982); <em>United States v. Porcaro, </em>648 F.2d 753, 760 (1st Cir.1981); <em>United States v. French, </em>628 F.2d 1069, 1075 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 956, 101 S.Ct. 364, 66 L.Ed.2d 221 (1980); <em>United States v. Warledo, </em>557 F.2d 721, 728-30 (10th Cir.1977). Our decision is also consistent with a recent congressional statement on the issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Defendant relies on other sources of authority for its position that a claim-of-right defense to extortion prosecutions should be recognized. He points to section 223.1(3) of the Model Penal Code and its accompanying commentary, which propose the adoption of such a defense for theft offenses. <em>See </em>Model Penal Code (U.L.A.) \u00a7 223.1(3)(b) (1974). He also cites to a Report by the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Code, Pattern Jury Instructions for the Fifth and Seventh Circuits, as well as sections 100-106 of the Restatement 2d of Torts. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief pp. 18-21. None of these sources of authority are binding in this jurisdiction, and we do not find them persuasive in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-16\">Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not err in refusing to admit evidence supporting defendant\u2019s claim-of-right theory of defense. Moreover, we hold that the district court did not err in failing to deliver to the jury the definition of the word \u201cwrongful\u201d that defendant proposes. B. <em>Specific Claim-of-Right Defense Conferred by Pennsylvania Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-17\">Defendant alleges another error by the trial court relevant to the theory that his lawful claim to the property taken from the Crescent shop justified his actions in taking it. Defendant argues that, even if this court refuses to recognize a general claim-of-right defense to Hobbs Act extortion, Pennsylvania law confers on him, as a partner in a business, a specific right to dissolve a partnership and a conditional right to retain partnership property if another partner is guilty of fraud. <em>See </em>59 Pa.Cons.Stat. \u00a7 361 (1984). He alleges as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>error the district court\u2019s instruction to the jury stating that property which is obtained in violation of the Hobbs Act can be either tangible or intangible.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendant asserts that the district court, by that instruction, failed to present to the jury the possibility that he may have been acting lawfully to dissolve a business in which he was a partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The district court was correct in its refusal to grant defendant\u2019s requested instruction that he be found not guilty if his purpose in going to the Crescent shop on the day in question was solely to dissolve the business.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As the district court correctly observed, the defendant\u2019s motive in proceeding to the Crescent shop to remove property of the business is irrelevant to a Hobbs Act violation <em>(see </em>A-885). Even if defendant legitimately believed he had a legal right as a partner to dissolve the alleged partnership that existed among him, Lam, and Hahn and to remove business property from the Crescent shop, such belief would not constitute a defense to the charge of violating the Hobbs Act. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not err in instructing the jury that defendant could be found guilty under the Hobbs Act for obtaining intangible property.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">III. <em>The Mens Rea Element of a Hobbs Act Offense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">Defendant next alleges that the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that they must find him to have intended to commit extortion in order to be found guilty.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In essence, defendant contends that extortion under the Hobbs Act is a specific-intent crime.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The district court rejected defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction, agreeing with the Government that extortion under the Hobbs Act was a general-intent crime (A-875).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">We need not determine the requisite intent for extortion under the Hobbs Act in order to reject defendant\u2019s claim. Defendant has failed to properly preserve this basis for appeal. A party that does not specifically object to an alleged defect or omission in the charge to the jury does not preserve that basis for appeal unless the district court\u2019s actions constituted plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>error or affected substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olgin, </em>745 F.2d 263 at 270-271 (3d Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Logan, </em>717 F.2d 84, 91 (3d Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Palmeri, </em>630 F.2d 192, 201 (3d Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 967, 101 S.Ct. 1484, 67 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981); see Fed.R.Crim.P. 30 and 52(b).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 30 requires a party to make an objection to the charge before the jury retires in order to preserve that objection on appeal. In this case, defendant did not object to the district court\u2019s instructions on intent either immediately prior to or following the delivery of the charge to the jury. <em>See </em>A-139 to A-151; A-182 to A-190.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, given the vague, almost meaningless, instruction on intent proposed by defendants,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we cannot conclude that the district court committed plain error by substituting its own intent instructions for those of the defendant.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aam\">\"To the extent to which your requests are denied, the record, by my ruling now, will reflect the fact that you have objected and you are preserving and [sic] exception. Actually, you have an automatic exception to every adverse ruling, right?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">IV. <em>Employees as \u201cVictims\u201d under the Hobbs Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">Defendant next alleges as error the district court\u2019s instructions to the jury that any of the five persons present at the Crescent shop on September 13, 1981, may be deemed the victims of extortion if they had some interest in the business.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>asserts that, given his lawful claim as a partner to the partnership property, the court\u2019s instructions could lead a jury to believe that a partner can be convicted of Hobbs Act extortion for forcibly obtaining partnership property from one of his own employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">We find no error in the instructions by the district court. As we have already concluded, defendant\u2019s claim of right to the property obtained, whether by virtue of his ownership of or partnership in the Crescent Stained Glass business, is irrelevant to the offense of extortion under the Hobbs Act. A person can be guilty of extortion for obtaining his own property from another by the wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear. <em>See supra </em>part II of this opinion. The district court properly instructed the jury, however, that the person from whom property is obtained must have some interest in the property in order to be considered a victim of extortion. <em>See United States v. Biondo, </em>483 F.2d 635, 640 (8th Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 947, 94 S.Ct. 1468, 39 L.Ed.2d 563 (1974) (person who had a definite financial interest in a business could be a \u201cvictim\u201d under the Hobbs Act). Because having a financial interest in a business is sufficient for one to be a victim of Hobbs Act extortion,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the trial court did not err in suggesting that any of the employees of Crescent (who obviously had a financial interest in the continuing operation of the business) could be deemed victims of defendant\u2019s alleged extortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">V. <em>Alleged Variation Between Indictment and Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"AC3\">Defendant next contends that, to the extent his actions toward Crescent employee Tom Bryant formed a basis for his conviction, there was a substantial and prejudicial variance between the allegations in the indictment and the proof at trial. The original indictment against defendant had alleged both robbery and extortion under the Hobbs Act. The indictment was subsequently reduced to the charge of extortion only. Defendant contends that the evidence at trial regarding his actions toward Bryant prove, if anything, robbery not extortion. He argues that because the offense of robbery requires a specific intent to steal and because the district court refused to permit him to present evidence on his lack of such intent, he may therefore have been improperly convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">We reject defendant\u2019s argument. The threshold question when determining if there has been a prejudicial variance between the indictment and proof is whether there is substantial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, to uphold the jury verdict. If the court finds a variance, it must then determine whether the defendant has been prejudiced as \u00e1 result. <em>United States v. Fischbach and Moore, </em>750 F.2d 1183 at 1189 (3d Cir.1984); <em>see also Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 752, 756, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1241, 1243, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that Bryant \u201cconsented\u201d to part with his property, which is an essential element of Hobbs Act extortion. We believe that there was more than substantial evidence for the jury to conclude that, after being threatened and struck, Bryant <em>consented </em>to relinquish the property under his control. Thus, we find that there was no variance between the indictment and the proof. The evidence may have shown that defendant was guilty of both extortion and robbery in his conduct toward Bryant. If so, the Government had discretion to prosecute defendant solely on the extortion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>charge, and there is no merit to defendant\u2019s claim that he should have been charged with the crime to which he had a meritorious defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Even if the evidence showed that defendant robbed Bryant but did not extort from him, we do not think that such a variance would be prejudicial under the facts of this case. There was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict defendant on the extortion charge because of his actions toward persons present at the Crescent shop other than Bryant.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">VI. <em>Restrictions on the Presentation of Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Defendant assigns as error the district court\u2019s rulings that excluded or limited the testimony of five defense witnesses. We will consider each one separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">A. <em>Thomas Nihill</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Defendant called Thomas Nihill, a certified public accountant and former IRS agent, as an expert witness. The district court ruled that certain portions of Nihill\u2019s testimony must be excluded at trial. This ruling serves as the basis for one of defendant\u2019s assignments of error. We note initially that the district court has broad discretion to exclude expert testimony and that the court\u2019s actions will be sustained unless they are manifestly erroneous. <em>Salem v. United States Lines Co., </em>370 U.S. 31, 35, 82 S.Ct. 1119, 1122, 8 L.Ed.2d 313 (1962); <em>Breidor v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., </em>722 F.2d 1134, 1138 (3d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">At trial, defendant had sought to assert a defense that Joseph Lam had operated the Crescent Stained Glass business poorly and drove it into such bad financial condition that, rather than fearing defendant\u2019s actions on September 13, Lam welcomed them as an excuse he could give to creditors for not paying Crescent\u2019s debts. The district court permitted defendant to pursue this defense (A-603). Thus, the court permitted Nihill to testify as to the financial condition of the partnership (A-604). Nevertheless, Nihill was prohibited from testifying that Lam\u2019s actions in operating the business constituted embezzlement or had the earmarks of embezzlement (A-604 to A-605). The district court based its restriction on Federal Rule of Evidence 403,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> arguing that such testimony would confuse the issues, mislead the jury, unfairly prejudice the Government, and constitute cumulative evidence. <em>See Agnes, </em>581 F.Supp. at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">A district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings under Rule 403 are not to be overturned on appeal unless there is a clear showing that the district judge abused his discretion. <em>United States v. Clifford, </em>704 F.2d 86, 89 (3d Cir.1983). To the extent the testimony was relevant to defendant\u2019s claim-of-right defense, the trial court properly excluded it since that defense to Hobbs Act extortion could not be entertained in this case. Moreover, the district court\u2019s ruling did not prevent defendant from asserting his defense that Lam was not actually placed in fear by defendant\u2019s alleged actions. The district court permitted the introduction of sufficient evidence from which defense counsel still could argue \u2014 and in fact did so in closing argument <em>(see </em>GA-330 to GA-340, GA-357) \u2014 that Lam had embezzled partnership funds and had welcomed defendant\u2019s actions as an excuse for defrauding creditors. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s restriction on Thomas Nihill\u2019s testimony was neither manifestly erroneous nor an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-15\">B. <em>Helene Sandole</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-16\">Defendant sought the admission of testimony by his girlfriend, Helene San-dole, regarding conversations between them, two of which occurred about a month prior to September 13, 1981. The testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>ny was offered not for its truth, but rather to show defendant\u2019s state of mind in entering the Crescent shop on September 13\u2014 namely, that he believed Lam had embezzled partnership property.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The district court excluded the testimony, arguing that it was irrelevant to any issue at trial. The court contended that the testimony would tend to prove, if anything, defendant\u2019s motive for his actions on September 13. <em>See Agnes, </em>581 F.Supp. at 476-77. And, as the district court correctly observed, evidence of motive is not relevant to any element of extortion under the Hobbs Act. The testimony may have supported defendant\u2019s claim-of-right theory of defense, but defendant was properly prohibited from asserting such a defense. We therefore find no error in the district court\u2019s exclusion of certain portions of Helene Sandole\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">C. <em>John Metropulos</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Defendant assigns as error the district court\u2019s refusal to admit the testimony of defense witness, John Metropulos, the owner of Chicago Art Glass. In its offer of proof, defense counsel stated that Metropulos would testify as to his business dealings with Joseph Lam, including his receipt of a bad check from Lam, the fact that he tried to get Lam arrested as a result, and that Lam told him that Crescent\u2019s debt could not be paid because defendant had taken money from the business (A-538 to A-539).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The Government objected to the introduction of Metropulos\u2019 testimony on the grounds that it was extrinsic evidence of prior conduct by Lam for the purpose of attacking Lam\u2019s credibility and, as such, was inadmissible under Fed.R.Evid. 608(b).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The district court sustained the Government\u2019s objections and barred the testimony under Rule 608(b) and under Rule 403 because it was needlessly cumulative (A-541). In its ruling on post-trial motions, the court also rejected defendant\u2019s theory that Metropulos\u2019 testimony was admissible as extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by Lam. <em>See Agnes, </em>581 F.Supp. at 476. We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Metropulos\u2019 testimony for the reasons it stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">Defendant now asserts, for the first time on appeal, that one portion of Metropulos\u2019 testimony \u2014 his conversation with Lam in which Lam told him that defendant had taken money from the business \u2014 was admissible to support defendant\u2019s defense theory that Lam had welcomed the September 13, 1981, incident as a means of defrauding creditors. It is not necessary for this court to decide whether the testimony would have been so relevant. Because defendant did not offer this defense theory at trial as a justification for admission of Metropulos\u2019 testimony, we will not fault the court for possibly failing to consider this theory as a basis for admitting the testimony. <em>See United States v. Palmeri, </em>630 F.2d 192, 201 (3d Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 967, 101 S.Ct. 1484, 67 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981); <em>Government of Virgin Islands v. Edinborough, </em>625 F.2d 472, 475-76 (3d Cir.1980). We therefore reject defendant\u2019s claim that the district court erred in excluding the testimony of John Metropulos.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">D. <em>William Levine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">A Government witness, Mary Anne Zel-enevich, testified under cross-examination that defendant had contacted her in an effort to enlist her help in a scheme to frame Joseph Lam. During the presentation of the defense, defendant wished to call William Levine to testify that he had been present during the conversation between defendant and Zelenevich and that it was, in fact, Zelenevich who suggested the scheme to frame Lam.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">The trial court excluded Levine\u2019s testimony for two reasons. First, the court con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>eluded that the offer of Levine\u2019s testimony was an effort to impeach the credibility of a Government witness (Zelenevich) by extrinsic. evidence of specific prior conduct and, as such, was barred by Rule 608(b). The court also found that, because the testimony was relevant only to collateral issues of the trial,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> it would serve to confuse and mislead the jury and involve undue prejudice and a needless waste of time (A-403 to A-404). Thus, the court also excluded the testimony under Rule 403. The court\u2019s ruling under Rule 403 was a proper exercise of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Defendant also asserts that the testimony was admissible as extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statements or behavior by the Government witness Zelenevich. Yet the proffered testimony would not have tended to prove that Zelenevich had made any prior statement or engaged in any expressive behavior, concerning the subject of her testimony, that was inconsistent with her statements at trial. Levine\u2019stestimony was offered merely as a different version of the events about which Zelenevich testified. Furthermore, even if Levine\u2019s testimony could be construed as evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by Zelenevich, it would still be inadmissible because it relates to a collateral matter. <em>See Wade v. Haynes, </em>663 F.2d 778, 783 (8th Cir.1981), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>461 U.S. 30, 103 S.Ct. 1625 (1983); <em>United States v. Nace, </em>561 F.2d 763, 771, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (9th Cir.1977); <em>United States v. Blackwood, </em>456 F.2d 526, 531 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 863, 93 S.Ct. 154, 34 L.Ed.2d 110 (1972). The district court is accorded broad discretion to restrict the admission of evidence regarding collateral matters. <em>See Hamling v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 87, 124-25, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2911-12, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974); <em>United States v. Colson, </em>662 F.2d 1389, 1392 (11th Cir.1981). We conclude, for the reasons stated, that the court did not abuse that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">E. <em>Lynn Watkeys</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Defendant offered the testimony of Lynn Watkeys to show that Joseph Lam had a poor reputation in the community for truthfulness and that Lam had engaged in fraudulent dealings with Watkeys \u2014 one of his creditors \u2014 in the period after September 13, 1981 (A-440 to A-446). The court permitted Watkeys to testify regarding Lam\u2019s reputation in the community for truthfulness but excluded any testimony regarding alleged fraudulent dealings by Lam (A-446).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Defendant asserts that the excluded testimony was relevant to his defense theory that Lam was not placed in fear by defendant\u2019s actions on September 13, because Lam had thought to use the incident as an excuse for not paying his creditors. Nevertheless, the district court concluded that Watkeys\u2019 testimony would not be relevant to this defense theory because it concerned Lam\u2019s actions after September 13, 1981. As such, it would not tend to demonstrate Lam\u2019s bias or motive to lie on the witness stand concerning the events of that date. Moreover, the court reasoned, even if the testimony was relevant to the theory of defense, it was needlessly cumulative and thus excludable under Rule 403. Finally, the court explained that the testimony, which, if anything, would only tend to show specific instances of misconduct by Lam, was inadmissible under Rule 608(b). <em>Agnes, </em>581 F.Supp. at 475-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">Once again, we find the district court\u2019s ruling to be well supported in the record. We therefore hold that the ruling did not constitute an abuse of discretion by the court. .</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>VII. <em>Exemption from Sequestration Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Upon defense counsel\u2019s motion at trial, the district court ordered the sequestration of all witnesses pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 615.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Defense counsel then r\u00e9quested that Helene Sandole be exempt from the sequestration order under Rule 615(3). In support of the request, counsel stated that Sandole had served the defense as an investigator in the preparation for trial. The Government objected, claiming that Sandole was defendant\u2019s girlfriend and that she was not essential to the defense as required by Rule 615(3). The district court agreed with the Government\u2019s position and, therefore, refused to exempt Sandole from the sequestration order.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">We observe initially that the decision not to sequester witnesses because they are \u201cessential\u201d under Rule 615(3) is within the sound discretion of the district court, and a reversal on appeal will be made only upon a showing of an abuse of that discretion. <em>See Government of Virgin Islands v. Edinborough, </em>625 F.2d 472, 475 (3d Cir.1980); <em>United States v. Maestas, </em>523 F.2d 316, 321 (10th Cir.1975). In ruling on defendant\u2019s request initially, the district court incorrectly stated that it had no discretion under Rule 615(3) to allow Sandole to remain in the courtroom (GA-7). Yet, after further debate by both parties, the court adopted the Government\u2019s position that, notwithstanding the court\u2019s discretion in this matter, Sandole did not qualify as an \u201cessential\u201d person contemplated by Rule 615(3) (GA-5 to GA-9).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">Defendant relies principally on this court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Government of Virgin Islands v. Edinborough, </em>625 F.2d 472 (3d Cir.1980), as authority for the proposition that Sandole does fall within the exception created by Rule 615(3). In <em>Edin-borough, </em>the court, in dicta, interpreted Rule 615(3) broadly to permit the mother of a young rape victim to remain in the courtroom while her daughter was testifying.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The court set forth guidelines in applying Rule 615(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-12\">\u201cA party who believes that the presence of the witness is \u2018essential\u2019 must bear the burden of supporting that allegation and showing why the policy of the Rule in favor of automatic sequestration is inapplicable in that situation. The party desiring sequestration must then be given an opportunity to show why sequestration is needed. Finally, the trial court should explicate the factors considered if sequestration is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-13\"><em>Edinborough, </em>625 F.2d at 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-14\">Although, in this case, defense counsel informed the district court that Sandole had greatly assisted in the preparation of the defense and that her absence from the courtroom would result in delays at trial (GA-7), the court apparently concluded that she was not essential to the presentation of the defense. Moreover, as the district court stated in its ruling on post-trial motions, defendant failed to sustain the relevant burden of proof as articulated in <em>Oli</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number><em>ver B. Cannon and Son v. Fidelity and Cas. Co., </em>519 F.Supp. 668 (D.Del.1981). <em>See Agnes, </em>581 F.Supp. at 474. In <em>Cannon, </em>the court called for a showing that the witness</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">\u201c... has such specialized expertise or intimate knowledge of the facts of the case that a party\u2019s attorney could not effectively function without the presence and aid of the witness or that the witness would be unable to present essential testimony without hearing the trial testimony of other witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 678; <em>see also Varlack v. SWC Caribbean, Inc., </em>550 F.2d 171, 175 (3d Cir.1977) (party desiring a particular witness to be excluded from sequestration order has burden to show that the witness is essential to the presentation of the case). Defendant may have shown that Sandole\u2019s presence at trial would be helpful to the presentation of the defense, but he did not demonstrate that her presence was essential to his cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">In objecting to Sandole\u2019s exclusion from the sequestration order, the Government most likely feared that, because she was defendant\u2019s girlfriend, she would be able to modify her testimony to favor the defendant based on the testimony of others and the conduct of the trial <em>(see </em>GA-6). <em>See Miller v. Universal City Studios, Inc., </em>650 F.2d 1365, 1373 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>388 F.2d 786, 788 (9th Cir.1967). The district court adopted the Government\u2019s rationale <em>(see </em>GA-9) and, in its post-trial opinion, explained that because of the close personal relationship between defendant and Sandole, the possibility of collusion and fabrication of testimony was present. <em>Agnes, </em>581 F.Supp. at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to exempt Helene Sandole from the sequestration order. The defendant failed to demonstrate that Sandole\u2019s presence at trial was essential to the presentation of the defense, as is necessary for an exemption under Rule 615(3). Moreover, because Sandole was the girlfriend of the defendant, there was an increased possibility that she would modify her testimony to comport more fully with that of other defense witnesses. Although we agree with defendant that, at the trial, the district court should have stated more explicitly its reasons for refusing to exempt Sandole, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to do so does not constitute reversible error.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">VIII. <em>Summary</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">In summary, the trial court did not err in refusing to permit defendant to present evidence in support of his claim-of-right defense. Defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the <em>mens rea </em>element of Hobbs Act extortion will not be heard on appeal because of his failure to raise a timely objection at trial. The court\u2019s instructions regarding the potential victims of extortion in this case were correct. There was no variance between the indictment and proof with respect to defendant\u2019s actions toward Thomas Bryant. Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion either in restricting the testimony of several defense witnesses or in refusing to exempt Helene Sandole from its sequestration order.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-14\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b383-10\">. Representative Hobbs, the sponsor of the bill, stated in floor debates that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-11\">\"... there is nothing clearer than the definitions of robbery and extortion in this bill.

We believe, however, that this statement cannot be read in a vacuum, but must be placed in context with Justice Stewart\u2019s endeavor to show that violence during a lawful strike was not within the ambit of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\">.

Absent express permission by the district court for counsel to incorporate by reference objections made during the charge conference, the failure to explicitly state an objection to the charge following its delivery but prior to the jury's retiring results in a waiver of that claim on appeal under Rule 30. <em>See United States v.

As the trial court correctly observed in its ruling on defendant\u2019s post-trial motions, the conversation that was the subject of Levine\u2019s testimony occurred after September 13, 1981, and thus was collateral to the issue of defendant\u2019s intent or motive on September 13. Moreover, the issue of a possible scheme to frame Lam originated in the defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Zelenevich and was not raised by the Government in its case in chief. <em>Agnes, </em>581 F.Supp. at 475.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b392-6\">. Rule 615 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">\"At the request of a party the court shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses, and it may make the order of its own motion. This rule does not authorize exclusion of (1) a party who is a natural person, or (2) an officer or employee of a party which is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney, or (3) a person whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of his cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Fed.R.Evid. 615.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b392-9\">.

The court\u2019s holding in <em>Edinborough </em>was based solely on the defendant\u2019s failure to demonstrate that he was prejudiced as a result of the court\u2019s refusal to sequester the mother of the prosecuting witness while that witness was testifying. <em>Edinborough, </em>625 F.2d at 474.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\">. The Government also argues that the defendant\u2019s claim should be rejected because he has not shown any prejudice resulting from the court\u2019s refusal to exempt Sandole from the sequestration order. <em>See Marathon Pipe Line </em>v. <em>Drilling Rig Rowan/Odessa, 699 </em>F.2d 240, 242 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 104 S.Ct. 82, 78 L.Ed.2d 92 (1983). The district court\u2019s post-trial opinion supports the proposition that defendant was not prejudiced by Sandole\u2019s sequestration. The court observed that defense counsel vigorously and effectively examined and cross-examined witnesses without Sandole\u2019s assistance. Moreover, the court noted, the defense counsel\u2019s constant consultation with the defendant indicated that it was the defendant who was directing his own defense. <em>United States v. Agnes, </em>581 F.Supp. 462, 474 (E.D.Pa.1984). Nevertheless, because defendant requested a hearing from the district court to show prejudice, <em>see </em>Defendant\u2019s Memorandum of Law in Support of Post-Trial Motions, p. 39, and did not receive it, we do not rest our holding on defendant\u2019s failure to show prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
