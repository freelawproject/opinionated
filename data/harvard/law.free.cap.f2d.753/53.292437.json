The Board found Teamsters Local 164 guilty of unfair labor practices with respect to its employees. The opinion and order of the Board are reported at 267 NLRB 8 (August 5, 1983). Reference is made to the published decision of the Board for a recitation of pertinent facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">The Board issued the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8W\">ORDER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">The Respondent (Truckdrivers Union Local 164, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America), its officers, successors, and assigns, shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">I. Cease and desist from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">(a) Refusing to bargain collectively in good faith with Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 10, AFL-CIO as to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment covering employees in the unit herein found to be appropriate: (1) by refusing to sign the collective bargaining agreement (Ex. GC 51) mutually agreed upon on March 4, 1980; (2) by not affording those employees adequate opportunity to confer with officials of Local 10, and (3) by unilaterally changing terms and conditions of employment of those employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-14\">(b) Discharging or otherwise discriminating against any employee for filing charges with the Board;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-15\">(c) Discharging or otherwise discriminating against any employee for supporting Local 10 or any other union;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-16\">(d) Threatening any employee with economic sanctions and other retaliatory actions for filing grievances or for testifying in proceedings before the Board; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-17\">(e) In any other manner interfering with, restraining or coercing any employee in the exercise of rights guaranteed by Section 7 of the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-18\">2. Take the following affirmative actions necessary to effectuate the policies of the Act:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-19\">(a) Upon request, bargain collectively and in good faith with Local 10 and embody any understanding which may be reached in a signed agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-20\">(b) If requested by Local 10, sign and give retroactive effect to the contract (Ex. GC 51) mutually agreed upon on March 4, 1980;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-21\">(c) Rescind (1) the written warnings given to Lester, Huey, and Wilkins on April 3, 1980, to Wilkins on May 5, 1980, to Lester and Wilkins on May 14, 1980, and to Lester on October 21, 1980, as well as any others issued pursuant to unilaterally established work rules and personnel policies, and (2) the suspension given to Lester on May 5, 1980 and to Wilkins on June 27, 1980; and, with respect to both the warnings and the suspensions, expunge from Respondent\u2019s records (including personnel files) any reference thereto and notify Lester, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Huey, and Wilkins, in writing, that such action has been accomplished and that the expunged warnings and suspension notices will not be used as a basis for future personnel actions against them;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-4\">(d) Rescind the work rules and hours of service and personnel policies unilaterally established, thereby returning to the <em>status quo ante;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">(e) Offer Lester, Huey, and Wilkins immediate and full reinstatement to the jobs they held as of March 4, 1980 (or, if said jobs are no longer available, to substantially equivalent positions) without prejudice to their seniority or other rights and privileges previously enjoyed; and make them whole (in the manner indicated in \u201cThe Remedy\u201d), with interest, for any loss of earnings resulting from their respective discharges, layoffs, and suspensions, and from implementation of the unilaterally established work rules and hours of service and personnel policies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">(f) Preserve and, upon request, make available to the Board or its agents for examination and copying, all payroll records and reports and all other records necessary to analyze the amount of back-pay and other compensation due under the terms of this Order;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">(g) Post in its offices in Jackson, Michigan, copies of the attached notice marked \u201cAppendix.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">267 NLRB at 18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Upon consideration, the Court concludes that the decision and order of the Board is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 490-91, 71 S.Ct. 456, 465-66, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">It is noted that this Court recently enforced an earlier order of the Board against Teamsters Local 164 for unfair labor practices with respect to its employees in <em>NLRB v.
