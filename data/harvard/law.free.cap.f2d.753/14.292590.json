Promotions, Inc. (\u201cClass Promotions\u201d) appeals from that part of a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Charles L. Brieant, <em>Judge, </em>entered February 17, 1984, dismissing its claims for damages and forfeiture predicated upon alleged trademark infringement and unfair competition arising from the use of similar titles by two magazine publishers. D.S. Maga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>zines, Inc. (\u201cD.S. Magazines\u201d) cross appeals from that part of the judgment which prohibits D.S. Magazines from using the word \u201cClass\u201d in the title of its magazine in any form other than the one appearing on the cover of the January 1984 edition and from using any format on its magazine cover in which the words \u201cRight On! Presents\u201d are smaller or located differently from those appearing in its January 1984 edition.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">We affirm the partial dismissal of the action, but remand that part of the judgment granting an injunction in order that the district court may revise it in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Proceedings in the District Court</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">On September 12,1983, Class Promotions-moved for a preliminary injunction against D.S. Magazines\u2019 continued publication of its magazine, \u201cRIGHT ON! PRESENTS CLASS,\u201d asserting that D.S. Magazines had infringed its trademark \u201cCLASS.\u201d Following an evidentiary hearing, Judge Brieant, in a well-reasoned memorandum and order dated January 10, 1984, denied the motion, finding that there was no infringement by D.S. Magazines\u2019 later use of the mark because (1) the mark \u201cCLASS\u201d was a very weak mark; (2) there was only a slight overlap in the respective markets of the magazines; (3) D.S. Magazines did not adopt the mark in bad faith; (4) instances of actual confusion were <em>de min-imis; </em>and (5) there was no likelihood that a reasonable buyer would confuse the marks. Later, D.S. Magazines stretched its preliminary victory by changing the design of its title. It magnified the word \u201cClass\u201d by shrinking the size of the words \u201cRight On. Presents.\u201d Apparently finding that this made the word \u201cClass\u201d the identifying title, the court entered final judgment dismissing the claim for existing infringement but granting the limited injunction described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">On this appeal, Class Promotions argues that the district court erred in finding that its mark was weak, that there was no likelihood of confusion, and that there was no trademark infringement. After carefully considering the record, we cannot say that any of the challenged findings are clearly erroneous and therefore reject the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">Validity of the Mark</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">There is no question that, as between the parties, Class Promotions was the first user of the mark \u201cCLASS.\u201d In August 1979, it began publication of a bi-monthly, pocket-size, magazine, \u201cCLASS,\u201d which it distributed throughout New York City and the Caribbean. The magazine is directed to black Americans and readers interested in black culture, as well as West Indian ethnic culture and third world countries. In 1983, 150,000 copies of the magazine were distributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">D.S. Magazines publishes a number of magazines, including one called \u201cRIGHT ON!,\u201d directed to black teenagers. \u201cRIGHT ON!\u201d has been in existence for twelve years and has reached a national monthly circulation of approximately 180,-000 copies. Realizing that, since its initial publication, \u201cRIGHT ON!\u2019s\u201d subscribers had grown to adults, D.S. Magazines decided to capitalize on this audience by publishing an adult magazine entitled \u201cRIGHT ON! PRESENTS CLASS.\u201d The first issue was published in December 1982 and distributed in every major city in the United States. The magazine is full size, and its editorial emphasis is directed to black Americans, with little or no emphasis on third world countries or Caribbean culture. Slightly less than one year after its initial issue, monthly publication reached 370,000 copies, with monthly newsstand sales of approximately $235,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">A protectable trademark is established when the mark is adopted and used to identify a product. A generic mark or a descriptive mark which has no secondary meaning cannot be a valid trademark. <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., </em>537 F.2d 4 (2d Cir.1976). <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(e)(1) (1976). The district court suggested that the mark \u201cCLASS\u201d was merely descriptive and therefore not protectable. It is clear, however, that Class Promotions had adopted and used the mark \u201cCLASS\u201d as the title of its magazine. The mark is not descriptive of the publisher\u2019s product, magazines, or of any specific product offered for sale.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instead, the mark is suggestive because \u201cit requires imagination, thought and perception to reach a conclusion as to the nature of [its] goods.\u201d <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., supra, </em>537 F.2d at 11, citing <em>Stix Products, Inc. v. United Merchants &amp; Manufacturers, Inc., </em>295 F.Supp. 479, 488 (S.D.N.Y.1968). In <em>Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Chuckleberry Publishing, Inc., </em>486 F.Supp. 414, 420 (S.D.N.Y.1980), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>687 F.2d 563 (2d Cir.1982), the court held that \u201cthe word \u2018playboy\u2019, evoking the aspirations, if not the life-style, of certain men, suggests to the imagination the nature of the magazine\u2019s content\u201d and therefore is a suggestive mark. Analogously, the word \u201cClass\u201d is a suggestive mark and thus a valid trademark without proof of secondary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Non-Infringement</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Given a valid trademark, the critical issue in an action for trademark infringement is whether there is any likelihood that an appreciable number of reasonable consumers would be misled, or simply confused, as to the source of the goods in question. <em>Maternally Yours, Inc. v. Your Maternity Shop, Inc., </em>234 F.2d 538, 542 (2d Cir.1956). The court, in making this determination and fashioning equitable relief, must look not merely to the similarity of the conflicting marks but to a number of other factors. <em>Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., </em>287 F.2d 492, 495 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 820, 82 S.Ct. 36, 7 L.Ed.2d 25 (1961). <em>See also Buitoni Foods Corp. v. Gio. Buton &amp; C. S.p.A., </em>680 F.2d 290 (2d Cir.1982); <em>McGregor-Doniger, Inc. v. Drizzle Inc., </em>599 F.2d 1126 (2d Cir.1979); <em>Mushroom Makers, Inc. v. R.G. Barry Corp., </em>580 F.2d 44 (2d Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1116, 99 S.Ct. 1022, 59 L.Ed.2d 75 (1979). The so-called <em>\u201cPolaroid </em>formula\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">Where the products are different, the prior owner\u2019s chance of success is a function of many variables: the strength of his mark, the degree of similarity between the two marks, the proximity of the products, the likelihood that the prior owner will bridge the gap, actual confusion, and the reciprocal of defendant\u2019s good faith in adopting its own mark, the quality of defendant\u2019s product, and the sophistication of the buyers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-10\"><em>Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., supra, </em>287 F.2d at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">1. <em>Strength of the Mark</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">Although the word \u201cClass\u201d is capable of functioning as a trademark, the district court found that it was a very weak mark. The strength of a mark refers to its distinctiveness, \u201cor more precisely] its tendency to identify the goods sold under the mark as emanating from a particular, although possibly anonymous, source.\u201d <em>McGregor-Doniger, Inc. v. Drizzle Inc., supra, </em>599 F.2d at 1131. Applying this test, the mark \u201cCLASS\u201d is a weak mark. \u201cCLASS\u201d magazine has only been in circulation since 1979, and, although it claims to have a broad geographical scope,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> its actual distribution is narrow \u2014 150,000 copies in 1983. More importantly, there is no evidence that the mark \u201cCLASS\u201d is associated in the public\u2019s mind with the magazine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>\u201cCLASS\u201d or with its publisher, Class Promotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">2. <em>Similarity of Marks</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">D.S. Magazines\u2019 mark consists of the totality of the words \u201cRIGHT ON! PRESENTS CLASS.\u201d However, throughout the magazine and on some letterheads and business cards, the word \u201cClass\u201d is used to refer to the publication. In assessing the importance of the similarity of the marks, the district court properly focused on the general impression conveyed to the purchasing public by the respective marks. The court carefully contrasted the size, layout, design, and logotype of the two titles and found that the differing presentations of the marks reduced the potential for confusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>McGregor-Doniger, Inc. v. Drizzle Inc., supra, </em>599 F.2d at 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">3. <em>Product Proximity and Quality of Defendant\u2019s Product</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The district court contrasted the differences in appearance, size, content, geographical distribution, and audience appeal and concluded that the competitive distance between the respective magazines militated against a finding of likelihood of confusion. The physical attributes and layouts of the magazines are clearly distinguishable. Although both magazines are directed to black American audiences, the editorial emphasis of \u201cCLASS\u201d magazine is on third world and West Indian cultures, whereas \u201cRIGHT ON! PRESENTS CLASS\u201d has no such emphasis. Moreover, \u201cCLASS\u201d magazine circulates in numerous countries outside the United States, while \u201cRIGHT ON! PRESENTS CLASS\u201d is only sold in the United States. The high quality of D.S. Magazines\u2019 product is not contested by Class Promotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">4. <em>Bridging the Gap</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">The term \u201cbridging the gap\u201d is used to describe the senior- user\u2019s interest in preserving avenues of expansion and entering into related fields. Class Promotions presented no evidence that it intends to publish a magazine comparable to \u201cRIGHT ON! PRESENTS CLASS.\u201d It is therefore unlikely that \u201cCLASS\u201d magazine will bridge the gap.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">5. <em>Actual Confusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">Class Promotions contends that the district court erred in failing to consider evidence of four instances of actual confusion. These instances consisted of four isolated written communications, two from advertising agencies and two from magazine subscribers. Two of these letters were properly excluded from evidence on the ground of hearsay. The two letters which were admitted are insignificant when contrasted to the hundreds of thousands of magazines sold over the years. <em>See, e.g., Scott Paper Co. v. Scott\u2019s Liquid Gold, Inc., </em>589 F.2d 1225 (3d Cir.1978); <em>Mushroom Makers, Inc. v. R.G. Barry Corp., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">6. <em>Good Faith</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">D.S. Magazines was in good faith in its use and adoption of the mark \u201cCLASS.\u201d The magazine \u201cRIGHT ON! PRESENTS CLASS\u201d follows the older and more well-known magazine, \u201cRIGHT ON!,\u201d as part of a coherent marketing plan. Moreover, the testimony showed that D.S. Magazines launched its new magazine with no actual knowledge of any prior use of the mark \u201cCLASS\u201d and did not find out about Class Promotions\u2019 use of the mark until after it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>had made a substantial commitment to the development of its own magazine.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The district court gave due consideration to all of the <em>Polaroid </em>factors in reaching its conclusion that there was no likelihood of confusion. We agree that there was no infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Despite the finding of no infringement, we hold that the district court was correct in granting some form of permanent injunctive relief. After that court\u2019s issuance of the January 10, 1984 order, D.S. Magazines significantly reduced the size of the words \u201cRight On! Presents\u201d on its magazine cover. The effect of this reduction was to make the respective marks \u201cRIGHT ON! PRESENTS CLASS\u201d and \u201cCLASS\u201d virtually identical, thereby increasing the likelihood of confusion and raising serious questions as to D.S. Magazines\u2019. good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">These actions on the part of D.S. Magazines mandate some form of injunctive relief. We find, however, that the district court\u2019s jurisdiction is too restrictive in prohibiting D.S. Magazines from using the word \u201cClass\u201d in any form other than that of its January 1984 edition and from using any format of \u201cRight On! Presents\u201d that is smaller or located differently from the one which appears in that edition. We therefore remand this case to the district court to amend its injunction so that, in substance, it directs D.S. Magazines to use the words \u201cRight On! Presents\u201d as part of the title on its magazine cover, so as not to have the cover appear to use only the word \u201cClass,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>with respect to size and location, <em>essentially, </em>in the format found on the January 1984 edition. We affirm the rest of the district court\u2019s injunction, paragraphs 3 through 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed as to the partial dismissal of the action and remanded as to the issuance of the limited permanent injunction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\">. <em>Cf.
