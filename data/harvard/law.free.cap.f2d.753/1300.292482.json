We reject that construction of the September letter; that letter states only that the rights of Rivercity under the option agreement will prime the rights of Whitney under the Act of Collateral Mortgage and related note and the Act of Subordination referred to in the letter. That is a far cry from the guaranty by Whitney of Jackson\u2019s obligations under the option agreement needed for Rivercity to prevail here. Since Whitney did not guarantee those obligations, under no theory could American Can Company have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-29\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1386-22\"> After this opinion was released in unpublished form, the Court was advised that the District Court\u2019s opinion in this case will be published. 600 F.Supp. 908.
