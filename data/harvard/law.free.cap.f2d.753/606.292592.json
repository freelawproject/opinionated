For the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>sons stated below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">James Brown was employed by the city of Chicago\u2019s Department of Animal Care and Control. He was terminated in February of 1981; at the time of his discharge, his position was funded by CETA. The hearing officer for the prime sponsor, in an order dated August 27, 1981, concluded that Mr. Brown should be reinstated without back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Mr. Brown appealed this decision to the United States Department of Labor. On February 2, 1982, the Grant Officer issued a \u201cFinal Determination,\u201d in which he awarded Mr. Brown back pay with prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">The city, in appealing this decision to the ALJ, contested only the Grant Officer\u2019s authority to provide prejudgment interest on the back-pay award. There was no challenge of the authority to award back pay in the first instance or of the propriety of the actual award to Mr. Brown. In an order dated November 3, 1983, the ALJ concluded that the Grant Officer had the authority to impose prejudgment interest on the back-pay award and thus granted the Grant Officer\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">This petition for review followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b693-14\">Petitioners\u2019 arguments are periphrastic, and it is difficult to discern the precise nature of their attack on the ALJ\u2019s order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In general, they assert that \u201cabsent explicit statutory authority, neither the [AU] nor the grant officer has authority to impose a prejudgment interest sanction.\u201d Petitioners\u2019 Brief at 10. We conclude from this that petitioners are contesting the generic power of the ALJ and the Grant Officer to award prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-15\">Petitioners have referred us to no case that requires an explicit statutory authorization for prejudgment-interest awards and we conclude that an express legislative directive is not necessary. It is beyond cavil, and petitioners do not dispute, that an award of <em>back pay </em>is within the authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>of the Secretary of Labor. <em>See City of Chicago v. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>737 F.2d 1466, 1471-73 (7th Cir.1984); <em>Milwaukee County v. Peters, </em>682 F.2d 609, 611-12 (7th Cir.1982); <em>accord City of Philadelphia v. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>723 F.2d 330, 332 (3d Cir.1983); <em>Kentucky v. Donovan, </em>704 F.2d 288, 294 (6th Cir.1983). The statutory source of the Secretary\u2019s power to award back pay is 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 816(d)(1) (Supp. II 1978), which simply states that \u201c[i]f the Secretary concludes that any recipient of funds under this chapter is failing to comply with any provision of this chapter or the regulations [thereunder] ..., the Secretary shall have authority to ... order such <em>sanctions </em>or <em>corrective actions </em>as are <em>appropriate\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Thus, there is no explicit authority for the initial back-pay award; to the contrary, the power is simply a component of the Secretary\u2019s general authority to order appropriate \u201csanctions\u201d and \u201ccorrective actions.\u201d Back pay is the traditional remedy used in many contexts that is designed to \u201cmake whole\u201d the employee after wrongful discharge. <em>See Kentucky, supra, </em>704 F.2d at 296; <em>see also City of Chicago, supra, </em>737 F.2d at 1473. Prejudgment interest is a necessary part of the compensation, as it ensures that the timing of the award does not alter its adequacy and that aggrieved parties will not be forced to bear the cost of delay in the dispute-resolution process. Stated in another manner, the back-pay award is compensation for the initial injury and prejudgment interest is compensation for the delay in payment. There is no requirement of an explicit statutory authorization for interest awards, as they are an inherent component of the traditional \u201cmake whole\u201d remedy that back pay represents. Cf<em>. NLRB v. Central Illinois Public Service Co., </em>324 F.2d 916, 919-20 (7th Cir.1963) (upholding award of prejudgment interest under \u00a7 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">Thus, the Secretary has the power under \u00a7 816(d)(1) to order \u201csanctions\u201d and \u201ccorrective actions,\u201d which include back-pay awards for wrongful discharge, as well as prejudgment interest on those awards. The Secretary has delegated the authority to award interest to both the ALJ in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 676.91(c) (1983)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the Grant Officer in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 676.88(e) (1983).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The award in the instant case, therefore, was within the power of the ALJ and the Grant Officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">The petition for review is Denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-9\">. The ALJ concluded that the rate of interest should be determined according to the procedure set forth in 28 U.S.C; \u00a7 1961(a), which establishes the rate for prejudgment interest in civil actions in federal district court. Under \u00a7 1961(a), that rate is equal to \"the coupon issue yield equivalent (as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury) of the average accepted auction price for the last auction of fifty-two week United States Treasury bills settled immediately pri- or to the date of the judgment.\u201d The ALJ determined that, under the statute, the appropriate interest rate for November 1, 1983 was 9.86% a year and ordered that the interest rate be set accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">In their briefs filed with this court, petitioners have made no argument concerning the ALJ\u2019s use of \u00a7 1961 in determining the interest rate. It is axiomatic that issues of this kind, if not argued by petitioners or raised by cross-petition, are waived. <em>United States ex rel. Mitchell v. Fairman, </em>750 F.2d 806, at 807 (7th Cir.1984); <em>see also Hershinow v. Bonamarte, </em>735 F.2d 264, 266 (7th Cir.1984); <em>Carducci v. Regan, </em>714 F.2d 171, 177 (D.C.Cir.1983). As the issue is not properly before us, we express no opinion as to the propriety of the ALJ\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 1961, despite the fact that respondent addressed the question in its brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b693-16\">. The statutory source of our jurisdiction is 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 817(a) (Supp. II 1978). Under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 676.91(f) (1983), the decision of the ALJ became the final decision of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-17\">CETA was initially enacted in 1973 as Pub.L. No. 93-203, 87 Stat. 839 and was substantially amended in 1978 by Pub.L. No. 95-524, 92 Stat. 1909. The instant action arises under the 1978 amendments. CETA was replaced by the Job Training Partnership Act (\u201cJTPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 97-300, 96 Stat. 1322 (1982); however, under the JTPA \u00a7 181(e), 96 Stat. 1355, CETA still applies to cases pending on October 13, 1982 (the date of enactment for the JTPA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b693-18\">. In addition, petitioners now attempt to challenge the actual back-pay award given to Mr. Brown. Petitioners\u2019 Brief at 10-12. It is beyond dispute that an issue of this kind may not be raised for the first time before this court. <em>Franklin County Employment &amp; Training Admin. v. Donovan, </em>707 F.2d 41, 44-45 (2d Cir.1983) ; <em>Pierce County v. United States, </em>699 F.2d 1001, 1005 (9th Cir.1983); <em>see also Trotter v. Klincar, </em>748 F.2d 1177, at 1184 (7th Cir. Nov. 1984) . Thus, we will undertake no review of the actual award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b694-4\">. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 676.91(c) (1983) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\"><em>Contents of decisions </em>____ The [AU] shall have the full authority of the Secretary in ordering relief____ Orders for relief may ... contain such terms, <em>corrective action, </em>conditions, <em>sanctions (including awards of back pay), </em>reallocations, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and regulations issued thereunder____ (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b694-9\">. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 676.88(e) (1983) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-21\"><em>Final </em>determination____ [T]he Grant Officer shall ... provide each party with a final written notice ... that ... lists any <em>sanctions, </em>and required <em>corrective actions ... </em>intended by the Grant Officer____ (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-24\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 676.88(f) (1983) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-25\"><em>Request for </em>hearing____ Those provisions of the [final] determination not specified for hearing, or the entire [final] determination when no hearing [before the AU] has been requested, shall be considered resolved and not subject to further review.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
