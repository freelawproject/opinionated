A copy of this decree was annexed to the libel. The libel further set forth that the said last-mentioned decree remained in full force and unsatisfied; that neither the present respondent nor any of his property could be found within the jurisdiction of the circuit court for the southern district of New York, but that such property could he found within this district.

The only reason that courts of admiralty interfere to execute each other\u2019s decrees is to prevent a failure of justice; but this reason is inapplicable to the present case, because an action of debt could be brought upon the judgment at common law. The cases in which admiralty courts have executed foreign decrees are either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>proceedings <em>in rem, </em>where the <em>res </em>had come into another jurisdiction from that in which proceedings had been commenced, or cases where a sentence of imprisonment for contempt, against a party for non-compliance with a decree, was asked for, in neither of which cases could relief be obtained at common law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b635-4\"><em>Alfred Driver </em>and <em>J.
