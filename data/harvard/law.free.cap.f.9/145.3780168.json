By an indorsement on the writ the sheriff' was directed to attach the goods and chattels of defendant in tho possession of the Red Star Line, (Peter Wright &amp; Sons, agents,) tho Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and John F. Hartranft, collector of the port of Philadelphia. The sheriff returned that ho liad attached as commanded and summoned as garnishees the Red Star Lino, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and John F. Hartranft, collector of the port of Philadelphia. Subsequently, in tho same suit, the plaintiff filed a petition setting forth that under the writ of foreign attachment the sheriff had seized, on the wharf of the Rod Star Line, 14 casks of wine imported from Europe by, and consigned to, the defendant, subject to claims for duties payable to the United States; that the customs officers had taken possession of the wine and stored it in the bonded warehouse; that plaintiff, as attaching creditor, had tendered to John F. Hartranft, collector of the port of Philadelphia, the duties payable on said wine, and had requested him to receive the same and deliver up the goods to tho sheriff, but that he refused so to do. Plaintiff prayed for a rule on the collector to show cause why he should not receive the duties and surrender tho goods into the custody of the court. A rule having been granted in accordance with this prayer, John F. Hartranft, the collector, obtained a <em>certiorari </em>from the United States circuit court to remove the record to that court. The record was duly certified, whereupon plaintiff moved to remand, and the collector moved to quash the writ of attachment as to him.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b161-11\">These motions were argued before McKennan, C. J., and Butler, D. J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-12\"><em>Lewin W. Barringer, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-13\">This suit is not brought against the collector, and he is not a party defendant. As garnishee he is only collaterally interested, and cannot remove the suit. Part of a controversy only cannot be removed. <em>Hervey </em>v. <em>Railroad Co. </em>7 Biss. 103. The title to the property was in the consignee, and the pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>ority of the United States is only a \u201cpriority of payment, hut not of possession.\u201d It is in the nature of a lien or mortgage for the payment of the duties. <em>Conard </em>v. <em>Atlantic Ins.

The case of <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Dennie, </em>3 Pet. 292, relied on by the collector, has been overruled in <em>Conard </em>v. <em>Pacific Ins. Co. </em>6 Pet. 271. The property being in the custody of the court it had power to make the order asked for. <em>Buch </em>v. <em>Colbath, </em>3 Wall. 341. The duties having been tendered to the collector he has no longer any right to interfere.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b162-4\"><em>John K. </em>Valentine, U. S.
