Watkins was <em>appointed in his </em>place. In 1839 the administration was committed to Hancock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-10\">Mrs. Caroline M. R. Johnson died in 1849, having survived her husband who died in 1841. She made a will by which she disposed of the estate of Thomas 0. Taylor to Philip T. Hancock, an infant son of Higgison Hancock, provided neither he nor his heirs or executors should sue her heirs or executors: And a subject of controversy in this suit was the validity of that appointment. Another question was as to the liability of Mrs. Johnson\u2019s estate for certain lands and bonds disjiosed of by her in her lifetime; but neither of these questions was considered by the court, and need not be further noticed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-11\">After the death of Mrs. Johnson, Hancock the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>with the will annexed of Thomas 0. Taylor, in November 1849 filed his bill in the Circuit court of Powhatan county, for the purpose of having a construction of the will of Taylor, and directions as to his duties. He set out the provisions of the will, the will of Mrs. Johnson in execution of the power vested in her by the sixth clause of the will of Thomas O. Taylor, a statement of the property of Taylor at his death, and the sale of some of it by Mrs. Johnson. He stated that the slaves directly emancipated by the will of Taylor had been set free before his qualification: That those emancipated at the death of Mrs. Johnson were under his care, hired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>out for that year; and he submitted them and their rights, and his own duties in regard to them, to the decision of the court, seeking only to be protected against future complaint from any quarter: And he prayed to be advised what disposition to make of their hires for that year, and what to do with them thereafter. He did not know that there were any debts against the estate of Taylor, but could not admit that there were none. And he was advised that there were questions arising under the will of his testator, which should be settled by the judgment of the court: And he proceeds to state them, and among others, the question as to the effect of the will upon the slaves of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-4\">He further stated that Taylor died <em>unmarried; </em>that he was moreover the only child of his father, who had come to this country many years before, as was supposed, from Great Britain; but that the plaintiff was wholly ignorant as to who were the heirs and next of kin of his testator. And making Benjamin Watkins the former representative of Thomas 0. Taylor, and William M. Watkins the trustee, the heirs of Mrs. Johnson, and her devisees under her will disposing of her own property, the legatees under Taylor\u2019s will, and the slaves by name, parties defendants, he prayed that the matter of the bill might be fully settled, and such decrees made therein as should be agreeable to equity, and the nature of the case should require.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-5\">By an amended bill the next of kin of Thomas 0. Taylor on the part of his mother were made parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\">On the motion of the plaintiff, Kichard W. Flournoy was appointed guardian <em>ad litem </em>of the slaves, to defend them in this suit; and he filed an answer submitting their rights to the protection of the court. And the court made an order directing the plaintiff to collect the hires of the slaves for that year; and to hire them out from year to year until the further order of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>In 1851 many of the \u25a0 next of kin (for they were very numerous) answered the bill. They contested the validity of the appointment made by Mrs. Taylor; and they insisted that the slaves left to Mrs. Taylor for life were not emancipated by the will; there being, as they insisted, an illegal condition attached to the bequest of freedom which avoided it: And they insisted further, that even if the slaves who were alive at the death of Taylor were .emancipated, the provision in the will did not include those slaves who were born after the death of Taylor and during the lifetime of Mrs. Johnson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-9\">At the same term of the court the cause came on to be heard, when the court held that the slaves bequeathed to Mrs. Johnson for life became entitled to their freedom at her death; and that the provision authorizing them to choose masters was void; and decreed accordingly. And the plaintiff was directed to hire them out until the further order of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-10\">In December 1851 the cause came on to be again heard, when the court declared that according to the true construction of the will of Thomas 0. Taylor, Mrs. Johnson had power during her coverture to dispose of the lands of the testator by will; and that such disposition was not invalidated by her becoming discovert; and that the appointment in favor of Philip T. Hancock was valid. And the plaintiff was directed to hire out the slaves for four months from the 1st of January then next.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-11\">In the progress of the cause a commissioner made reports as to the hires of the slaves since they had been under the control of the court. These reports showed that of these hires there was deposited in bank by the plaintiff on the 81st of December 1851, seven hundred dollars, produced from the hires of that year; and that there was deposited in March 1852 the further sum of four hundred dollars; and there was in his hands on the 31st of May of that year a further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>sum of two hundred and nineteen dollars and seventy-two cents. A second report showed a further sum of one hundred and seventy-three dollars and two cents in the plaintiff\u2019s hands on the 31st of December 1852.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-4\">The cause came on to be finally heard in January 1853, when it appearing that the plaintiff\u2019s powers as administrator &amp;c. of Taylor had been revoked, and that the estate had been committed to Henry Gordon, sheriff of Powhatan, the court made a decree directing the plaintiff to deliver to Gordon the negroes in his hands belonging to the testator\u2019s estate; and that Gordon do cause them to be registered as free in the court of Powhatan county, and to be furnished with certificates thereof. And the said Gordon was authorized to divide the money deposited in the bank equally among the said negroes; and that the amount in the hands of the plaintiff, after defraying some charges mentioned in the decree, should be paid to those of the negroes who had earned it: such payments to be made when they respectively received their certificates of registry. Whereupon the next of kin of Thomas 0. Taylor obtained an appeal to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-5\"><em>Giles </em>and <em>C, Robinson, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-6\"><em>Day, </em>for Johnson\u2019s devisees.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-7\"><em>Davis, Rhodes </em>and <em>Patton, </em>for the administrator and the slaves.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b137-21\"> The act says: \u201c When slaves are emancipated by will, the net proceeds of the aggregate of their hires and profits, with which the personal representative of the testator is chargeable, or so much thereof as may not be required for the payment of debts, shall, unless inconsistent with the manifest intention of the testator, belong to the persons so emancipated, and be apportioned among them as a court of equity having cognizance of the case may deem just.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b145-8\">Samuels, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6Jh\">The appellants\u2019 counsel in the argument here insisted, that the slaves were improperly made parties in this ease, (referring to the case of <em>McCandlish </em>v. <em>Edloe, </em>3 Gratt. 330,) and that a decree of emancipation can be rendered only in a suit brought <em>in forma pauperis </em>for the recovery of freedom; and that, for these reasons, the Circuit court erred in deciding the question as to the condition of the slaves. In answer it may be said that Hancock having the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>slaves in liis possession, and being unwilling to decide the conflicting claims between them and Taylor\u2019s next of kin, might be allowed to file a bill in equity referring the subject to the adjudication of the court, and thereby relieve himself from the responsibility of making a decision. A bill of this nature, in its functions, is a bill of interpleader; the adverse claimants become actors; each, asserting a claim, is, in effect, a plaintiff. A claim to freedom, if merely equitable, has long since been held a proper subject for the cognizance of a court of equity. A mere question of property between adverse claimants could be passed on by a court in a case like this. A right to freedom claimed on one side, and a conflicting right of property claimed on the other, must stand on the same ground; and this especially where if either claim had been asserted in a separate suit, it would have been proper for the cognizance of the court. I am of opinion the slaves should be regarded as plaintiffs asserting their claim to freedom. The defect of the bill is. merely in form; the substance is sufficient, as it brings before the court the adverse claims of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">It may be further said that this suit was pending on and before the 1st July 1850, when the Code of 1849 took effect, and the answer of the appellants was filed after that day. It is therein provided, ch. 216, \u00a7 2, p. 800, that subsequent proceedings in pending suits shall conform as far as practicable to'the provisions of that act; and in ch. 171, \u00a7 19, p. 648, 649, it is enacted that when a bill shows on its face proper matter for the jurisdiction of the court, no exception for want of such jurisdiction shall be allowed, unless it'be taken by plea in abatement; and the plea shall not be received after the defendant has demurred, pleaded in bar or answered the bill. The bill in this case shows matter proper for the jurisdiction of the court, in this, that Hancock held slaves who claimed their freedom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>under an equitable title, and who are claimed as property by Taylor\u2019s next of kin, under an equitable title. Hancock had the right to invoke the aid of a court of equity to relieve him from the responsibility of making a decision upon these conflicting claims. The appellants have been content to assert their rights in the suit brought by Hancock, making no objection to the jurisdiction of'the court or to the competency of any party or parties; and they should not be permitted to make such objection for the first time in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">If however it be conceded that the slaves were not necessary or proper parties, then the case must be considered as if they had been omitted as such. If they had been thus omitted, the omission would not have precluded the court from decreeing their emancipation in a proper case in whicli the persons claiming them were parties. This was done in <em>Pleasants </em>v. <em>Pleasants, 2 </em>Call 270, (Tate\u2019s edition.) The bill in that case was filed against the claimants, but omitted to make the slaves parties; their emancipation was nevertheless decreed. In <em>Elder </em>v. <em>Elder\u2019s ex\u2019or, </em>4 Leigh 252, the bill was filed by a legatee against the executor, omitting the slaves as parties, yet the court decreed the freedom of the slaves.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The objection by the appellants, next in order is, that the slaves, or some of them, are not emancipated by Taylor\u2019s will; that even if such of them as were in being at his death were emancipated from and after Mrs. Johnson\u2019s death, yet that such of them as were bom after Taylor\u2019s death and before Mrs. Johnson\u2019s death, being the issue of mothers in the condition of slavery, are themselves slaves.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The first branch of this objection is insisted on, because, as is alleged, the slaves were left by the will in the condition of slavery at the death of Mrs. Johnson, with the capacity to become free upon their election to become so; and until the election shall be made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>they remain in . the condition of slavery: And we are referred to the case of <em>Elder </em>v. <em>Elder's ex'or, </em>above cited. This part of the objection is founded on a misapprehension of the will. The counsel construe the will as directing that the slaves shall remain such until they elect to become free; whereas the will, in a substantive clause, distinctly manumits them; and after-wards, in another clause, gives them the election to remain in the state of Virginia, in a condition intermediate <em>between </em>slavery and freedom. The latter alternative is against the settled policy of the law, and has no effect. <em>Forward's adm'r </em>v. <em>Thamer, </em>9 Gratt. 537. The bequest of freedom is in no wise impaired by the impracticable and repugnant alternative offered to the choice of the slaves., In regard to the issue of the female slaves born after the death of Taylor and before the death of Mrs. Johnson, it is insisted that they are slaves; that they remain in the condition of their mothers at the time of their several births: and the case of <em>Maria </em>v. <em>Surbaugh, 2 </em>Rand. 228, is referred to in support of this branch of the objection. If we concede to the case just cited all the effect which can be claimed for it in cases in which it applies, yet the rule thereby established does not govern a case like this. In our case the testator bequeaths his slaves by the general description, \u201cthe whole of my negroes not before disposed of or devised,\u201d in trust for Mrs. Johnson\u2019s benefit during her life; and declares, that \u201c at the death of Mrs. Johnson, it is my further will and direction that the slaves embraced in this item be emancipated.\u201d Such a general description has been frequently held to embrace not only the parent stock of slaves in being at the time of the testator\u2019s death, but all increase thereafter born, but born before the emancipation was fully perfected. In <em>Pleasants </em>v. Pleasants, 2 Call 270, (Tate\u2019s edition,) the testator said in his will, \u201cmy further desire is, respecting my poor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>slaves, all of them as I shall die possessed with shall be free,\u201d &amp;c. These terms were held to embrace all the slaves whenever born, and to emancipate them, as they arrived at the age fixed by the testator for the purpose. In <em>Elder </em>v. <em>Elder\u2019s ex\u2019or, </em>4 Leigh 252, the terms \u201c the remaining part of my negroes,\u201d were held to include the increase of the slaves born after the death of the testator but before the time for perfecting the emancipation directed by the will. In <em>Erskine </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>9 Leigh 188, the testator gave his slaves to a legatee foj life, (as in our case,) and at her death directed \u201c all his negroes to be free and at full liberty.\u201d These terms were held to include the increase of the slaves whilst they were in the hands of the life tenant. In <em>Anderson\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>11 Leigh 616, the testator directed his slaves to be retained in the condition of slavery for a time, but at certain periods, or on certain events, provided for their emancipation, describing them as \u201call\u201d his negroes. It was held that the issue born of a mother before the time for her emancipation were emancipated by the will. In <em>Binford\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Robin, </em>1 Gratt. 327, the terms used by the testatrix, \u201c that all my negroes be liberated,\u201d were-held to include not only slaves in possession, but also a reversionary interest in slaves depending upon a life estate; and this, although the life estate did not expire until after the death of the testatrix, and the portion falling to her estate was then for the- first time set apart upon partition with other parties interested. In <em>Lucy </em>v. <em>Cheminant\u2019s adm'r, </em>2 Gratt. 36, the testatrix bequeathed \u201c all the rest of her slaves\u201d to two for their lives, and to the survivor for life; and on the death of the survivor directed that \u201c said slaves be set free.\u201d It was held that all the slaves, including those born during the life estate, were emancipated. These cases establish the rule which must govern this case; and we must hold that all the slaves in being at Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Johnson\u2019s death, belonging to Taylor\u2019s estate, are emancipated by his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">It is said by the appellants\u2019 counsel, that although all the slaves in being at the time of Mrs. Johnson\u2019s death be emancipated from that time, yet they were held in slavery and hired out for some time after their right to freedom accrued; and that the appellants, the next of kin, are entitled to the hires as part of Taylor\u2019s estate not disposed of; there being no creditor to claim them or any part of them. To sustain this position we are referred to <em>Pleasants </em>v. <em>Pleasants, 2 </em>Call. <em>270; Paup's adm'r </em>v. <em>Mingo, </em>4 Leigh 163; <em>Peter </em>v. <em>Hargrave, </em>5 Gratt. 12. These cases settle the law as it formerly stood, against the right of freedmen to recover hires of a person holding them in slavery. The judges of this court, from time to time, whilst acquiescing in the decisions referred to, and admitting the expediency and policy on which they were founded, have nevertheless admitted that it would be but natural justice to allow hires to freemen wrongfully held in slavery. Eecognizing the cases cited as furnishing the rule in any case in which they apply, it must still be observed that the case before us presents features not found in any other case. In each one of the cases cited the hires claimed had accrued whilst the freemen were detained in slavery by the claimant, either in his own right or in <em>autre droit. </em>In o\u00fcr case the hires did not accrue whilst the slaves were held by the administrator, representing the estate. On the contrary, those hires accrued whilst the slaves themselves were under the control of the court, where they had been placed by the administrator. That court took upon itself the duty of executing the trust theretofore confided to the administrator; and although the administrator was directed by the court to perform the duty of hiring out the slaves, still, in obeying the order of the court, he was acting merely'as the officer of the court; liis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>official authority or responsibility as administrator was in no wise involved in the hiring of the slaves; the court had assumed his place and authority. In the progress of the suit it was ascertained that no cause had existed which should have prevented the administrator from setting the slaves at liberty upon the death of Mrs. Johnson. He should therefore have done so, and the freedmen would have enjoyed the fruits of their own labor. On general principles of equity it was the duty of the court, as far as practicable, to place every one in the condition in which he was intended to stand according to the true meaning of the will. Although the time for an exact execution of Taylor\u2019s will had passed, yet no reason can be shown why it should not be executed as nearly as practicable. To give the freedmen their hires accrued after they should have enjoyed their freedom will be clearly within the testator\u2019s meaning. By giving them freedom he gave the right to enjoy the fruits of their own labor. The court, by giving them the hires under its control will, to that extent, give effect to the will. Ho considerations of inexpediency or impolicy intervene to prevent this disposition of the fund. The next of kin have never had possession of the slaves, and have had no reason to rely upon the hires as a source of revenue. They have incurred no expense in rearing and supporting them. The difficulty of settling an account of expenses on the part of the owners or claimants and of hires on the part of the slaves does not exist. In fine, none of the reasons which led to the decisions in the cases cited, exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">If necessary for the decision of this case, it might be a question how far the assent to the legacy for life of the slaves to Mrs. Johnson enured to the benefit of the slaves who were to be manumitted at her death; whether the assent to the legacy for life should be regarded as an assent to the ulterior disposition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>property. See <em>Bishop's ex'or </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>2 Leigh 484; <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>3 Leigh 682; <em>Nicholas </em>v. <em>Burruss, </em>4 Leigh 289. In the opinion of a majority of the court, it is not necessary for the decision of this case to pass on the question. I content myself, therefore, with a reference to these cases on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Regarding the case as standing upon the law existing at the date of Taylor\u2019s will, I should have no hesitation in deciding that the freedmen, under the <em>circumstances of this ease, are </em>entitled <em>to </em>their own hires. The law since that time, however, has been so changed as to leave less room for doubt. The Code of 1849, ch. 106, \u00a7 8, p. 465, by giving a new capacity to freedmen improperly held as slaves under the circumstances of this case, has removed perhaps the only reason not yet considered, for the decisions heretofore made. In' <em>Pleasants </em>v. <em>Pleasants, </em>before cited, at the \u2022date of the will and at the death of the testator, manumission was not permitted by law: yet the testator, anticipating a change in the law, gave directions for the emancipation of his slaves when the law should permit it to be done. When, therefore, the law subsequently permitted freedom to be given by the master and accepted by the slave, it was held that the slaves were free. In our case, the will gives freedom, which contains in itself the right to enjoy the fruits of their own labor. The capacity of the freedman is a subject within the scope of legislative authority; and when that capacity is enlarged by subsequent laws, so as to give them a right to their own hires accrued whilst improperly held in servitude, we should do no more than was done in <em>Pleasants </em>v. <em>Pleasants, </em>if we carry the law into effect. In that case the incapacity prevented the slaves from receiving freedom at all; yet when it was removed, the grant became effectual. In our case, as is said, the incapacity was confined to the claim of profits only; this incapa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>city being removed, no reason exists to withhold the hires from the freedmen against the intention of the testator Taylor. I think the Circuit court did right in decreeing the freedom of the slaves, and in giving them their own hires.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">I am of opinion, moreover, that the .court should not have decided the question of succession to the residue of Taylor\u2019s estate, (other than slaves,) without having before it all parties who are interested in the question. That residue is claimed on behalf of Mrs. Johnson\u2019s estate, and it has, in part, been decreed to the estate; it is claimed by the appellants, the next of kin; and it appears in the record, that Philip T. Hancock has such interest, or color of interest, as to make him a necessary party; a part of the real estate having been decreed to him, although he is no party to the suit. The residuary legatees named at the foot of the sixth clause of Taylor\u2019s will, including the emancipated slaves, have also such interest or color of interest in the residue above mentioned, as to make it proper they should be parties to any proceeding for the final adjudication of the conflicting claims thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Thus I am of opinion to affirm so much of the decree as gives freedom to the slaves, and gives them their hires; and to reverse so much of the decree as disposes of any part of Taylor\u2019s estate, real or personal, (other than slaves,) with costs to the appellants against Mrs. Johnson\u2019s estate; and to remand the cause, with directions to allow the defendants or any of them to file a cross bill, if they shall be advised to do so, to bring more distinctly before the court the subject and questions in controversy, and to cause Philip T. Hancock to be made a party.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b153-6\">Lee, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYa\">concurred in the opinion of Samuels, J. except as to the hires of the negroes.

O. Taylor, nor in so much of the decree as gives to. the. emancipated slaves the hires accrued after the death, of Mrs. Johnson. It is therefore adjudged and ordered that to that extent the decree be affirmed. But the court is further of opinion that the Circuit court erred in deciding upon the rights of parties to the residue of Taylor\u2019s estate, real and personal, (other than slaves,) without having Philip T. Hancock as a party before the court, he having such interest, real or apparent, therein as to make him a necessary party. It is therefore adjudged, <em>&amp;c. </em>that so much of the decree as is declared to be erroneous be reversed and annulled, (with costs to the appellants against Mrs. Johnson\u2019s estate,) and cause remanded, with directions to cause Philip T. Hancock to be made a party, and to give leave to the defendants, or any of them, to file a cross bill, if they shall be advised to do so, for the purpose of bringing more distinctly before the court the nature and extent of the subjects in controversy, and for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
