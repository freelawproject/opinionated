Southall\u2019s administrator, upon a negotiable note for the sum of eight thousand eight hundred and sixty dollars, made by one Richard Coke, junior, and endorsed by Southall; and discounted by the Exchange Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-16\">At the August rules 1852, the declaration was filed, and a common order taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-17\">At the September rules, the defendant in the action appeared and filed a plea of payment of eight thou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>sand eight hundred dollars, parcel of the debt in the declaration mentioned, and gave a rule for replication: and at the same rules the plaintiff filed a replication to the plea; and an issue was made up upon it by the clerk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-4\">At the ensuing term, the defendant moved the court to correct the error alleged to have been committed by the clerk in failing to enter a discontinuance of the cause, upon the plaintiff\u2019s filing a general replication to the plea of the defendant: And thereupon, on the motion of the plaintiff, he had leave to withdraw his replication; and the cause was sent to rules for further proceedings. This was upon the 29th of September 1852.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-5\">At the October rules 1852, the record states that on the motion of the plaintiff, the common order entered against the defendant at the August rules was confirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-6\">At the November and December rules 1852, and at the January and February rules 1853, the entry was that the cause was continued for replication, on motion of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-7\">At the March rules 1853, the plaintiff filed a general replication to the plea; and took a confirmation of the common order for the part of the debt in the declaration mentioned not answered by the plea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-8\">At the following term, the defendant moved the court to send the cause back to rules, because the clerk had improperly entered a confirmation of the common order at the October rules; and because he had improperly received a replication to the plea at the March rules, and given judgment for that part of the debt not controverted by the plea. But the court being of opinion that the errors at rules might be corrected by the court, refused to remand the cause to rules, set aside the orders entered at the October and March rules, and gave the plaintiff leave to file his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>replication at that time. The replication was then filed) and an issue made up thereon: and at the same judgment was granted the plaintiff for that part bhe debt not answered by the plea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AA\">The court was also of opinion, that the case should be then tried unless the defendant showed he would be prejudiced thereby; which not being shown, the defendant pleaded <em>nil debet, </em>on which issue was joined: And a jury having been impanneled, a verdict was found, and final judgment rendered for four thousand one hundred and ninety-eight dollars and seventy-one cents, with interest and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-7\">To the opinion of the court refusing to send the cause back to rules, and giving leave to the plaintiff to reply to the plea in court, the defendant excepted.

The complaint is that irregularities have been committed in the proceedings which have resulted in the judgment; and for those irregularities it is said the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">According to the rule of pleading, if a plea profess to answer only part of the declaration, and is in truth but an answer to part, the plaintiff is entitled to \u201c sign\u201d judgment for the part not answered by the plea, and to demur or reply as to the part that is answered. If however he demur or reply to the plea without signing judgment for the part not answered, the whole action is discontinued. 1 Chit. PI. 453; Steph. PI. 232; 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Saund. 28, n 3. So that when the plea was filed at the September rules 1852, the plaintiff in the action should have caused the common order to be as to so much of the debt as the plea did not and did not profess to answer. The failure so to do, and filing a general replication, occasioned the technical tinuance of the action. And so at October rules after the cause had been remanded to rules at the previous term, the plaintiff, instead of confirming the common order generally, should have confirmed it as to the part not answered by the plea, and then filed his replication. Nor after such a general confirmation of the office judgment, could the irregularity be cured by the subsequent proceedings at the rules. The clerk I apprehend could not correct the error which had been committed at the October rules, by making the proper entry at the March rules following. By the general confirmation of the common order at the October rules, the proceedings at rules were closed; and the defendant could not be held to attend longer at the rules in the expectation that at a subsequent rule day the plaintiff would correct the error in his proceedings, and put him to a further pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">But though it was not competent for the clerk to correct the proceedings at rules, yet under the fifty-first section of chapter 172 of the Code, p. 653, the court, it is clear, had full authority so to do. By that section, control is expressly given to the court over all proceedings in the office during the previous vacation ; and it may reinstate any cause discontinued during such vacation, set aside any of the proceedings, correct any mistake therein, and make such order concerning the same as may be just. There can be no doubt then that the court might properly, as it did, set aside all the proceedings at rules after the cause had been remanded at the previous term, and permit the plaintiff to do then, in court, what he would and should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>done at the rules, to wit, file his replication and take judgment for the part not answered by the plea. No could be done by this to the defendant, as it \u00b0uly placed the cause exactly where it would have been but for the irregularities which had occurred at the rules. The whole matter then resolves itself into the question whether the case should have been tried at the same term. And here I do not hesitate to say that if the defendant had claimed a continuance of the cause as a matter of right and without showing any cause, he would have been clearly entitled to it. The plaintiff having only at that term placed himself <em>rectus in </em>curia, could not insist upon a trial at the same term. He was bound to submit to a continuance of the cause if the defendant had claimed it. But it does not appear that the defendant asked for a continuance, nor did he take any exception to the opinion of the court that the case might be tried at the same term. His motion was to send the cause back to rules, and his exception was to the refusal of the court to grant this motion, and to its giving the plaintiff leave to reply to the plea. If he had claimed a continuance of the cause and the court had refused it, and he had tendered a bill of exceptions,'the plaintiff might have yielded the point; and if otherwise, and the exception had been taken, I think it would have been error for which the judgment should have been reversed. But I do not think the court erred either in permitting the plaintiff to reply in court to the plea, and take judgment for the part unanswered by it, or in refusing to send the cause back to rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">I am of opinion therefore to affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of Lee, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
