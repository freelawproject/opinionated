On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence of his refusal to take a breath test. According to defendant, the police denied him a reasonable opportunity to consult privately with counsel before deciding whether to submit to the test, thereby violating his rights under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution. <em>State v. Durbin, </em>335 Or 183, 193-94, 63 P3d 576 (2003) (\u201c[A] driver arrested for DUII has, upon invoking the right to counsel, the right to a reasonable opportunity to consult privately with counsel before deciding whether to submit to a breath test.\u201d). The state concedes the point and acknowledges that the trial court\u2019s error requires reversal. We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession. <em>State v. Sawyer, </em>221 Or App 350, 354-55, 190 P3d 409 (2008); <em>State v.
