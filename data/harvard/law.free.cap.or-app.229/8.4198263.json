J.</author>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Plaintiff appeals following a jury verdict in defendant\u2019s favor in this action seeking damages for employment discrimination. Plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could consider his mental health expert\u2019s failure to turn over certain notes to defendant and in excluding evidence that he suffered a stress-related heart attack in 2006. We reject plaintiffs assertion that the trial court improperly excluded evidence relating to a heart attack that he had suffered nearly two years after the end of his employment with defendant. Our review of the record reveals that the trial court properly excluded the evidence pursuant to OEC 403.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We therefore write to address only plaintiffs first assignment of error. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed on appeal. From July 2000 until December 2004, plaintiff worked for the State of Oregon as a latent fingerprint examiner. For a period of time after he began working for the state, plaintiff received satisfactory performance reviews. However, in 2003 his work failed a quality assurance test; that failure led to the requirement that a coworker check plaintiffs work each day. Thereafter, plaintiff had difficulty performing his job functions, could not concentrate properly, and made many mistakes in his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Plaintiff began to see a therapist, Dr. Reiss, and had approximately 10 sessions with him. After he had seen plaintiff a number of times, Reiss wrote to plaintiffs supervisor to suggest that a change in work atmosphere would help plaintiffs work performance. However, in July 2004, defendant informed plaintiff that he had failed to meet performance standards and, in December 2004, terminated plaintiffs employment. Plaintiff then filed this action that, in relevant part, alleged that defendant had violated ORS 659A.112 when it failed to accommodate his mental condition and terminated his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Reiss testified as an expert witness at trial and opined that plaintiff suffered from a generalized anxiety disorder. During cross-examination, defense counsel asked Reiss whether he had any notes about what plaintiff had reported relating to his work. The following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-4\">\u201cA. Not with me so I\u2019m going to have to do it from memory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-5\">\u201cQ. But those notes exist?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">\u201cA. There is a problem with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">\u201cQ. And what is the problem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\">\u201cA. The problem is that we had all of our computers, even though it was data\u2014it was data locked so nobody can get them, we had our computers and our backup system stolen, and I informed [plaintiffs] attorney and [plaintiff] of that. And so instead I wrote\u2014my own notes, yeah, through memory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-9\">\u201cQ. So the answer to the question is, yes, the notes exist, you just don\u2019t want to give them up; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-10\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-11\">\u201cA. No. What exists is a summary of\u2014of what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-12\">&lt;&lt;**** *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-13\">\u201cQ. And you have not given that to us; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-14\">\u201cA. Uh, that is correct. Although I don\u2019t remember a request for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-15\">\u201cQ. That was the reason for Mr. Wilson [an attorney for defendant] writing you the letter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-16\">\u201cA. No. That letter was written previously. And at that point I said: I\u2019m not\u2014all I\u2019m going to give you is a summary which I wrote. However, when I discovered that the notes that\u2014that the notes were gone and\u2014in that particular program, what I then did for myself was write up everything that I could remember. But that was after you requested it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-17\">Thereafter, out of the presence of the jury, the court instructed plaintiff to provide defendant with the materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Reiss had discussed in the above testimony (the notes). However, defendant later informed the court that it had not received the notes. Plaintiff responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-4\">\u201cOh, I spoke to Dr. [Reiss] about that, the night of his testimony, and he said that they aren\u2019t notes. He understood the question to be did he write up anything after the computer [was stolen]. The answer is yes, he did write a summary, basically, of what his testimony would be and his understanding of the situation, to me. And I have that. And if that\u2019s what the Court wants, I\u2019ll produce it, but that is what he was talking about. He sent me an email to that effect the night after the ruling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Plaintiff was in possession of a report, dated October 2006, that he asserted was what Reiss had been referring to in his testimony. Defendant, on the other hand, argued to the trial court that Reiss had clearly testified that he had put together some notes and had failed to provide the materials as ordered. The court noted that it was \u201cconcerned with the representation that the witness made on the stand that he had made notes, and especially given his initial reluctance to provide those notes, or his initial refusal\u201d to do so. It then determined that it would give a jury instruction regarding Reiss\u2019s failure to comply with its order and to provide his notes. Accordingly, the court proposed to instruct the jury that \u201c[t]he Court ordered Dr. [Reiss] to turn over to the defendant certain counseling records. Dr. [Reiss] did not comply with the Court\u2019s order. The jury may take this into consideration when evaluating Dr. [Reiss\u2019s] testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Plaintiff objected to the giving of any instruction regarding Reiss\u2019s failure to provide the materials as ordered. In support of his objection, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">\u201cWell, the reason I feel strongly that this shouldn\u2019t be given, your Honor * * * is it was never identified in time when the burglary of his office occurred. And this report that was\u2014that he\u2019s identified to me as the notes he was referring to, is written in the format that a doctor would make notes. It\u2019s dated October of 2006. He didn\u2019t say, [m]y computers crashed in 2004 and 2005, and I sat down then and made notes. He said, I made notes afterwards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u201cAnd he has in fact, for the record, produced them. I have tendered them to counsel. Counsel has represented to me that he already has those.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">The court was then provided with the October 2006 report along with a December 2006 letter Reiss had sent to Wilson, who was referred to in Reiss\u2019s testimony. After having considered both documents along with the Reiss\u2019s testimony, the court adhered to its ruling and ordered that the instruction be given as a result of the expert witness\u2019s failure to comply with the court\u2019s prior order. The instruction was, in fact, given to the jury and after it was given, plaintiff did not take exception to the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">On appeal, plaintiff asserts that the trial court erred in giving the instruction for a number of reasons: (1) the instruction constituted factfinding by the trial court that Reiss had failed to comply with the court order, (2) the finding was made without testimony, (3) the court was wrong on the facts, (4) it was wrong to sanction plaintiff for Reiss\u2019s violation of a court order, and (5) the sanction was not authorized by the law. As is evident from the above discussion, the only assertion made by plaintiff to the trial court and, therefore, preserved for appeal under ORAP 5.45, is that the court\u2019s finding that Reiss had failed to comply with the court order was factually incorrect. However, even that objection was raised only before the instruction was given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\"> Pursuant to ORCP 59 H(l),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">\u201c[a] party may not obtain review on appeal of an asserted error by a trial court * * * in giving or refusing to give an instruction to a jury unless the party who seeks to appeal identified the asserted error to the trial court and made a notation of exception <em>immediately after the court instructed the jury.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">(Emphasis added.) Furthermore, ORCP 59 H(2) provides that \u201c[a] party shall state with particularity any point of exception to the trial judge. A party shall make notation of exception either orally on the record or in a writing filed with the court.\u201d Moreover, \u201c[a] party who disagrees with a proposed jury instruction must inform the court of the specific grounds for the exception. * * * An exception on one ground does not preserve an error on another ground.\u201d <em>Lane v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number><em>Brown, </em>328 Or 42, 45 n 1, 970 P2d 206 (1998). Plaintiffs argument to the trial court prior to the giving of the jury instruction that the conclusion underlying the court\u2019s decision to give the instruction was factually incorrect was insufficient pursuant to ORCP 59 H to preserve any of the arguments he now makes on appeal in support of his claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">ORCP 59 H is very clear in its requirement that, for this court to review on appeal any asserted error in a jury instruction, the party asserting the error must have taken exception to the instruction, either orally or in writing, immediately <em>after </em>the jury was instructed. <em>See also Peitsch v. Keizer, </em>219 Or App 114, 115, 180 P3d 1239 (2008) (applying ORCP 59 H after it was amended in 2004). Plaintiff failed to comply with the explicit requirements of the rule. For that reason, plaintiff failed to properly preserve any claim of error with respect to the jury instruction at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\"> OEC 403 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">\u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by consideration of undue delay or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
