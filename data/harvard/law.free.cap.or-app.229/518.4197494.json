On appeal,- he assigns error to the exclusion of evidence on relevance grounds under OEC 401 and to the trial court\u2019s refusal to merge his convictions. As discussed below, we affirm with regard to the trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence. As to the trial court\u2019s refusal to merge convictions, the state concedes error, and we accept the state\u2019s concession, <em>State v. Rodvelt, </em>187 Or App 128, 130, 66 P3d 577, <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 17 (2003), and we therefore remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Defendant was charged with striking, on April 24, 2006, the five-year-old son of a woman with whom defendant cohabited. Defendant maintained at trial that he had not struck the child. The child testified that he received the bruise that authorities observed on his cheek when defendant hit him several times with a closed hand. Defendant\u2019s counsel then told the trial court outside the presence of the jury that he intended to ask the child \u201cif he ever recalled being mistreated at all by his natural father[.]\u201d Counsel explained that he intended to impeach the child\u2019s testimony by proving that the child had been physically abused by his natural father and, as a result, that the child was confusing those events in his testimony with the accusation that he had made against defendant. Initially, defendant argued that some of the allegations that the child had made on a tape recording of an interview as part of a Child Abuse Response and Evaluation Services (CARES) evaluation were attributable to abuse by the child\u2019s father. The trial court ruled that, depending on what the child stated in the CARES interview, defendant \u201cmay be able to [recall the child] and [question him] about that.\u201d However, after the jury viewed the videotape of the CARES interview, defendant did not seek leave to recall the child and question him about any prior abuse attributable to his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Later in the trial, defense counsel indicated to the trial court that he wanted to offer evidence of abuse of the child by the child\u2019s father through the testimony of Hallyburton, an employee of the Department of Human Services (DHS). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Based on counsel\u2019s representations and the fact that the child\u2019s father had not had any contact with the child around the time that the child received the bruise, the court refused to allow defendant to examine Hallyburton on that issue. After the trial court ruled, defendant did not make an offer of proof regarding what Hallyburton would have testified. Defendant\u2019s failure to make an offer of proof effectively prevents him from claiming error on appeal regarding the trial court\u2019s ruling because, by failing to make an offer of proof, defendant failed to make an adequate record for appellate review. <em>State v. Bowen, </em>340 Or 487, 500-01, 135 P3d 272 (2006), <em>cert den, </em>549 US 1214 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The issue arose again during defendant\u2019s case when defendant presented testimony from the child\u2019s mother. Before her testimony, the state had called Pettitt, an employee of DHS, to testify. Pettitt\u2019s job was to transport foster children to meetings and appointments. Pettitt reported that, on one occasion when he was transporting the child, he heard the child talking about his natural father and defendant. According to Pettitt, the child told him that he \u201chas them both confused in his mind and isn\u2019t sure who was who.\u201d However, the context of the statement is not apparent from the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">After the state rested its case-in-chief, defendant called the child\u2019s mother to testify. She testified that she had not seen defendant strike the child and that the child had not told her that defendant had struck him. Defense counsel then obtained leave from the court to make an offer of proof through the testimony of the child\u2019s mother regarding what the child had told her about his father\u2019s abuse of him. During the offer of proof, the following questions and answers occurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] [Mother], I want to ask you, are you acquainted with [the child\u2019s father]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">\u201c[MOTHER:] Yes, I know him. Acquainted, I would\u2014 yes, I do know him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Is that your ex-husband?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">\u201c[MOTHER:] He\u2019s an ex-boyfriend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Now, did [the child] ever discuss with you things that were done to him by [his father]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">\u201c[MOTHER:] Yeah, he has.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Tell us about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">\u201c[MOTHER:] He\u2019s told me that\u2014that he\u2019s\u2014that he\u2019s suffocate\u2014you know, put his hands over his mouth so it\u2019s suffocating basically, so he\u2019d stop screaming because [the child] would have, you know\u2014like [the child] didn\u2019t like him, what he was doing, or I mean didn\u2019t want to do something, then he\u2019d have a tantrum\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] And how did\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">\u201c[MOTHER:] \u2014and he would be screaming.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] How did [the child] come by the term suffocate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">\u201c[MOTHER:] Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] How did [the child] come by the term suffocate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-12\">\u201c[MOTHER:] Probably because of me because that\u2019s what I threatened [the father] to do because he bitch-slapped [the child] so many times, and [the father] would be\u2014pass out all the time face down in the waterbed, and I said that no one would ever know, you could suffocate face down because you\u2019re passed out, and I would always push him over so that he would breathe, you know, start breathing again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-13\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Now, were there occasions when you saw [the father] cause physical injury to [the child]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-14\">\u201c[MOTHER:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-15\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Tell us about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-16\">\u201c[MOTHER:] He bitch-slapped [the child] so hard, I couldn\u2019t get him, I couldn\u2019t get to [the child], I was in the kitchen, and I don\u2019t know, to that door, and he hit him so hard [that the child] didn\u2019t know what happened, and he hit the floor, the wood floor, and he\u2019s screaming, and that\u2019s when I, you know, threatened [the father] again, and he\u2019d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>be always drunk, and I came home, I had to quit school Hi * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Later in her testimony, the mother testified that the child\u2019s father had had no contact with the child for about a year before the alleged incident with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Defendant concedes that the child\u2019s father could not have caused the injuries suffered by child on April 24, 2006. However, according to defendant, the child had difficulty in differentiating between his father and defendant in his thought processes. Thus, in defendant\u2019s view, the evidence of the past abuse of child by his father is relevant to demonstrate that the child was incorrectly attributing the injuries he had suffered on April 24,2006, to defendant. OEC 402 provides that all relevant evidence is admissible except as otherwise provided by the Oregon Evidence Code, Oregon statutory and decisional law, and the constitutions of the State of Oregon and the United States. OEC 401 defines \u201crelevant evidence\u201d as evidence \u201chaving any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d The question in this case, as properly framed, is whether the child\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony regarding the actions of the child\u2019s father toward the child has a tendency to make the child\u2019s testimony less credible. If so, then the evidence was properly admissible to impeach the child\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">We conclude that the mother\u2019s testimony\u2014that the child\u2019s father slapped him numerous times during a time period that ended a year before the incident occurred in this case\u2014was not relevant, under OEC 401, to impeach the child\u2019s testimony about who struck him on April 24,2006. We reach that conclusion because there is no evidence from which a rational factfinder could find or infer from mother\u2019s testimony and the child\u2019s statement to Pettitt that the child confused defendant with his father in his memory with respect to the source of his injuries that are subject of the charges against defendant. The fact that the child may have confused defendant with his father generally does not make the evidence of the father\u2019s past abuse probative of the child\u2019s credibility about who or what injured him on April 24, 2006, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>without additional evidence of a nexus in the child\u2019s thought processes or memory between those events and the injuries leading to defendant\u2019s convictions. It necessarily follows that the mother\u2019s excluded testimony had no tendency to make the existence of a fact of consequence\u2014the child\u2019s credibility concerning the identification of defendant\u2014more or less probable. <em>See State v. Hampton, </em>317 Or 251, 255, 855 P2d 621 (1993) (holding that, so long as the inference from a fact in evidence proposed by the proponent of the admissibility of the evidence is reasonable, the evidence is admissible under OEC 401). Consequently, the trial court did not err when it excluded the proffered testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
