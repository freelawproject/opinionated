J.</author>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">Defendant appeals following a trial to the court that resulted in defendant\u2019s conviction on two counts of robbery in the first degree. ORS 164.415. The trial court sentenced defendant to two consecutive terms of imprisonment based on the robbery convictions. On appeal, defendant contends that the court erred in concluding that, pursuant to ORS 161.067, the two convictions did not merge. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The following facts are not disputed. Defendant entered a Plaid Pantry store in Portland late one evening when one store employee and at least one customer were present. Defendant approached the counter where the employee and customer were standing, grabbed the customer by the shirt, pointed a knife at the employee, and demanded the money from the cash register. The employee opened the cash register, and defendant emptied it of money after moving the knife to the hand with which he was restraining the customer. Defendant then left the store with the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Based on the facts, the trial court concluded that defendant used a dangerous weapon and used force against both the employee and the customer and convicted him of two counts of first-degree robbery. The court also considered whether, in light of ORS 161.067(2), the two convictions should merge and concluded they should not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">\u201c161.067 does note that when the same conduct or criminal episode violating only one statutory provision involves two or more victims, there are as many separately punishable offenses as there are victims. And it specifically delineates, however, that * * * for someone owning a joint interest in a property that that\u2019s only one victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">\u201cSo in this case, there\u2014I am finding that the\u2014by requiring as a material element that the person used force on another in distinguishing that from the use of the weapon, that it is, as indicated previously, two victims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">In his sole assignment of error, defendant asserts that his two robbery convictions should have merged. He contends that there was only one victim of the robbery and that the customer was \u201cnot the \u2018victim\u2019 of the robbery; nothing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>demanded of her and nothing was taken from her.\u201d In defendant\u2019s view, because there was only one \u201ctaking of property\u201d in this case, there is only one punishable offense. The state responds that robbery is a crime that is perpetrated \u201cupon another person\u201d and that each person against whom force is used or threatened is a victim of the crime. For that reason, according to the state, the trial court properly concluded that the two convictions did not merge.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">ORS 161.067(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">\u201cWhen the same conduct or criminal episode, though violating only one statutory provision involves two or more victims, there are as many separately punishable offenses as there are victims. * * *\u2019,:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u201cORS 161.067(2) uses the term \u2018victims\u2019 to describe the category of persons who are victims within the meaning of the specific substantive statute defining the relevant offense.\u201d <em>State v. Glaspey, </em>337 Or 558, 563, 100 P3d 730 (2004). Accordingly, to resolve the issue presented by this case, we must determine what category of persons are victims within the meaning of the robbery statutes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the case of property-related crimes, the victim is considered to be the owner of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>property at issue. <em>State v. Luers, </em>211 Or App 34, 65-66, 153 P3d 688, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>213 Or App 389, 160 P3d 1013 (2007); <em>see also State v. Sanchez-Alfonso, </em>224 Or App 556, 563-64, 198 P3d 946 (2008) (burglary statutes are directed at protecting property rights and, therefore, the \u201cvictim\u201d of a burglary is the person whose property interest is violated). Where the crime at issue is a person crime, the victim is the person directly injured by the criminal conduct. <em>See Glaspey, </em>337 Or at 565-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">We first consider the text of the relevant statute, in context. <em>See State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171, 206 P3d 1042 (2009); <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). ORS 164.395<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> defines robbery as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of robbery * * * if in the course of committing or attempting to commit theft * * * the person uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force upon another person with the intent of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">\u201c(a) Preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property or to retention thereof immediately after the taking; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">\u201c(b) Compelling the owner of such property or another person to deliver the property or to engage in other conduct which might aid in the commission of the theft * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">The statute does not specifically address who is considered the victim of robbery. Furthermore, based on the text alone, the statute could be considered to be directed toward the protection of both property rights (theft or attempted theft) and persons (use or threat of physical force on another).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">A robbery offense is considered progressively more severe if the person committing the crime represents that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>is armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon, is aided by another person, is armed with a deadly weapon, uses or attempts to use a dangerous weapon, or causes or attempts to cause serious physical injury to another. ORS 164.405; ORS 164.415. Based on the elements of the crime viewed in context, the gravamen of the robbery statutes appears to be the use or threat of force against another person. There is no requirement that a theft of property actually be completed; a mere attempt suffices to fulfill that portion of the statute. However, without, at a minimum, the threat of force against another person, no robbery has occurred. Furthermore, the crime is considered greater in degree based not on the value or type of the property at issue, but on the threat or danger presented to another person. Thus, the text and context of the statute suggest that robbery is best characterized as a person crime. <em>See State v. Dillman, </em>34 Or App 937, 941, 580 P2d 567 (1978), <em>rev den, </em>285 Or 195 (1979) (\u201cThus, it appears that the legislature intended that the assault aspect of the crime of robbery be dominant and each person assaulted is the victim of the crime.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">That conclusion is consistent with our prior consideration of the same issue pursuant to a virtually identical anti-merger statute, where we held that \u201c[r]obbery is a person, not a property, crime, and it is subject to the rule that the number of crimes equals the number of victims.\u201d <em>State v. Green, </em>113 Or App 373, 376, 833 P2d 311 (1992) (applying <em>former </em>ORS 161.062, <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1999, ch 136, \u00a7 1); <em>see also State v. Spring, </em>172 Or App 508, 512 n 6, 21 P3d 657, <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 559 (2001) (imputing analysis of a case decided under <em>former </em>ORS 161.062, to a case under ORS 161.067 because both laws were drafted in 1985, began as identically worded proposals, and \u201cthe relevant text of the two statutes is identical\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Our classification of robbery as a person crime is consistent with the legislative history of the robbery statutes. <em>See Gaines, </em>360 Or at 171-72 (consideration of legislative history of statute permissible if it \u201cappears useful to the court\u2019s analysis\u201d). The robbery statutes were enacted in 1971 as part of a comprehensive revision of Oregon\u2019s criminal code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Or Laws 1971, ch 743, \u00a7\u00a7 148-50. The commentary to the code explains that the robbery statutes adopt \u201cthe view that the repression of violence is the principal reason for being guilty of robbery.\u201d Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 150,155 (July 1971). The commentary emphasizes that the \u201cprimary concern is with the physical danger to the victim\u201d and thus, \u201cthe actual taking of property [is] less important.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, heightening of \u201cthe terror in the victim\u2019s mind,\u201d \u201cincreased danger of an assault on the victim,\u201d and exacerbation of \u201cthreat to the victim\u201d are listed as the rationale for aggravating the degree of robbery based on representation or actual presence of a dangerous or deadly weapon, presence of an accomplice, or actual injury to the victim. <em>Id. </em>Based on that legislative history, we conclude that the legislature intended that robbery be a person crime and that those against whom physical force is used or who are threatened in the course of a robbery are the victims of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">In this case, the trial court found that, in the course of committing the theft of money from the Plaid Pantry store, in order to prevent resistance to the taking of property, defendant used physical force against both the employee and the customer. The trial court therefore properly concluded that there were two victims of the robbery for purposes of ORS 161.067. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in entering convictions and sentencing defendant on both counts of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\"> The remainder of that statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">\u201cHowever, two or more persons owning joint interests in real or personal property shall be considered a single victim for purposes of determining the number of separately punishable offenses if the property is the subject of one of the following crimes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">\u201c(a) Theft as defined in ORS 164.015.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">\u201c(b) Unauthorized use of a vehicle as defined in ORS 164.135.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">\u201c(c) Criminal possession of rented or leased personal property as defined in ORS 164.140.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-12\">\u201c(d) Criminal possession of a rented or leased motor vehicle as defined in ORS 164.138.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-13\">\u201c(e) Burglary as defined in ORS 164.215 or 164.225.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-14\">\u201c(f) Criminal trespass as defined in ORS 164.243, 164.245, 164.255, 164.265 or 164.278.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-15\">\u201c(g) Arson and related offenses as defined in ORS 164.315, 164.325 or 164.335.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-16\">\u201c(h) Forgery and related offenses as defined in ORS 165.002 and 165.070.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b108-17\"> <em>State v.
