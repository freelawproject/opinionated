J.</author>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Plaintiffs Beth and Tim Dewsnup appeal a judgment for defendant Farmers Insurance Company after the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 claims seeking coverage for water damage to their home under their homeowners insurance policy. We affirm, although on a ground different from the one on which the trial court relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The relevant facts are uncontested. Plaintiffs owned a house. They insured their house under a policy with defendant. Like so many insurance policies, plaintiffs\u2019 in this case was drafted in terms of what is covered, then what is excluded from coverage, followed by what is excepted from the exclusions, and concluding with\u2014stay with us here\u2014 what is excepted from the exclusions from the exceptions from coverage. We describe the precise terms of the policy later in this opinion. At this juncture, it suffices to say that the policy provides coverage for plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cdwelling.\u201d The policy does not define the term \u201cdwelling,\u201d but it does describe plaintiffs\u2019 property as a \u201cframe house\u201d with a \u201cwood shingle or shake\u201d roof type (it is apparently undisputed that the roof was actually shake).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The policy excludes \u201cwater damage.\u201d It then excepts from the water damage exclusion loss or damage to the interior of the dwelling or to personal property in the dwelling if the loss or damage is caused by a windstorm or a \u201cfalling object.\u201d It concludes by providing that the exception to the water damage exclusion applies only if the loss results from damage to the \u201croof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In 2006, the shake roof began to deteriorate. In June of that year, plaintiff Tim Dewsnup\u2014who happened to be a contractor\u2014undertook to replace the shakes. On the first day of work, he removed the old shakes down to the plywood sub-roof layer. He then covered the plywood with a sheet of polyethylene plastic, secured to the plywood with half-inch staples in the center and one-inch-by-two-inch bats nailed with eight penny nails on the sides. He did the work in a workmanlike manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>On the second day, a storm with high winds arose and ripped one sheet of plastic away, allowing rain to enter the house through the joints at the intersections of the plywood sheets. Tim went up onto the roof to repair the plastic sheet. While adding an additional sheet, he lost his footing and fell off the roof, ripping off all the sheets of plastic as he fell and injuring his back. Because of his injury, Tim was unable to return to the roof that day to replace the plastic sheets, and the rain continued to come in through the plywood joints, causing considerable damage to the interior of the house and to plaintiffs\u2019 personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Plaintiffs filed a claim under their homeowners insurance policy. Defendant denied the claim, contending that the loss was caused by water damage. Plaintiffs then initiated this action for breach of the insurance policy. Defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing that the undisputed facts show that the water damage exclusion applies. Plaintiffs responded that the water damage exclusion does not apply, because their loss or damage resulted from either a windstorm or a falling object\u2014Tim himself being the object. Defendant replied that the exceptions to the water damage exclusion do not apply, because both require that either the windstorm or the falling object damage the \u201croof,\u201d and a sheet of plastic is not a \u201croof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The trial court did not address any of the parties\u2019 contentions. Instead, the court concluded that the policy does not apply because, when plaintiffs took off the shake roof and replaced it with the temporary plastic covering, the structure ceased to be the \u201cdwelling\u201d that was insured under the policy. The house, the court explained, was no longer the \u201cdwelling\u201d that the parties had agreed to insure.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Plaintiffs appeal, arguing that the trial court erred in concluding that, merely because they altered the type of roofing material, their house suddenly ceased to be an insured \u201cdwelling\u201d under the policy. According to plaintiffs, the trial court should have concluded that, as a matter of law, their loss was caused by either a windstorm or a falling object, which would establish coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Defendant contends\u2014if briefly\u2014that the trial court correctly concluded that the removal of the shake roof transformed the house into something other than an insured \u201cdwelling\u201d under the policy. In the event we do not agree, however, defendant offers several alternative bases for affirming the trial court\u2019s bottom-line decision that plaintiffs\u2019 loss or damage is not covered under the policy. One of those bases is that both of the exceptions to the water damage exclusion\u2014for windstorms or falling objects\u2014apply only when there is damage to the \u201croof.\u201d According to defendant, the ordinary meaning of \u201croof\u2019 is an outside cover of a building consisting of \u201croofing\u201d material, which, in turn, refers to a covering that is a permanent part of the structure, usually made of slate, wood, or metal. A sheet of plastic stapled to the top of a house, defendant contends, is not a \u201croof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Plaintiffs reply that the plastic was secured in a way that made it \u201cfunctionally permanent.\u201d As a result, they contend, the damage to the plastic sheets did constitute damage to their \u201croof\u2019 within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\"> The parties\u2019 arguments concern the proper interpretation of an insurance policy, which is a question of law. <em>Hoffman Construction Co. v. Fred S. James &amp; Co., </em>313 Or 464, 469-71, 836 P2d 703 (1992). When we interpret an insurance policy, our goal is to ascertain the intention of the parties. <em>Holloway v. Republic Indemnity Co. of America, </em>341 Or 642, 649, 147 P3d 329 (2006). We determine the parties\u2019 intentions from the terms and conditions of the policy itself. <em>Groshong v. Mutual of Enumclaw Ins. Co., </em>329 Or 303, 307, 985 P2d 1284 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In the absence of a policy definition of relevant terms, we \u201cresort to various aids of interpretation to discern the parties\u2019 intended meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307-08. One such \u201caid\u201d is the determination whether the relevant terms have a \u201cplain meaning,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 308, determined by reference to the usual source of ordinary meaning, the dictionary, <em>Smith v. State Farm Ins., </em>144 Or App 442, 447, 927 P2d 111 (1996). If a term has a plain meaning\u2014that is, if it \u201cis susceptible to only one plausible interpretation,\u201d <em>Groshong, </em>329 Or at 308\u2014 we will apply that meaning and conduct no further analysis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>Id. </em>If, however, the term has more than one plausible interpretation, we will \u201cexamine the phrase in light of\u2018the particular context in which that [term] is used in the policy and the broader context of the policy as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312 (quoting <em>Hoffman Construction Co., </em>313 Or at 470). If a term remains ambiguous\u2014that is, if two or more plausible interpretations continue to be reasonable, <em>Hoffman Construction Co., </em>313 Or at 470\u2014we will interpret the provision against the insurance company and in favor of coverage. <em>North Pacific Ins. Co. v. Hamilton, </em>332 Or 20, 25, 22 P3d 739 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">We begin with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that, when plaintiffs tore off the shake roofing, their house ceased to be an insured \u201cdwelling\u201d within the meaning of the policy. The policy covers \u201c[t]he dwelling * * * on the residence premises used principally as your private residence.\u201d (Boldface in original.) The policy defines \u201cresident premises\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">\u201cthe one or two family dwelling and separate structures or that part of any other building where you reside, and which is shown in the Declarations. Under Section II\u2014Liability, residence premises includes the grounds on which the dwelling and separate structures are located.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">(Boldface in original.) The Declarations page, in turn, contains a description of the property: \u201cYear of Construction: 1980; Construction Type: Frame; Roof Type: Wood Shingle or Shake; Number of Units: 001; Occupancy: Owner.\u201d We note also that Policy Condition 10 provides: \u201cYou may make alterations, additions, and repairs to the residence premises and complete structures under construction.\u201d (Boldface in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The policy does not define the term \u201cdwelling.\u201d The ordinary meaning of the term is \u201ca building or construction used for residence.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>706 (unabridged ed 2002). There appears to be no dispute that plaintiffs\u2019 home was a building used for residence and that it was located on the \u201cresidence premises.\u201d Nothing in the record suggests that, by removing the deteriorating shake roofing, the building was any less a building, that it ceased to be used for residence, or that it no longer was located on the \u201cresidence premises.\u201d It would seem necessarily to follow that, even though plaintiffs removed the roofing material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>from their house, by doing so, they did not make that house any less a \u201cdwelling\u201d within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">As we understand it, the trial court\u2019s reasoning was not that taking the shakes off of the roof changed plaintiffs\u2019 house into something other than a \u201cdwelling\u201d; rather, it was that doing so changed the house into something other than <em>the </em>dwelling that was the subject of the insurance policy at issue, based on the fact that the policy described the house as having \u201cwood shingle or shake\u201d roofing. The fact that the policy <em>described </em>the premises as having certain features, however, does not necessarily mean that maintaining those features is a <em>condition of coverage. </em>If, for example, the policy happened to describe the house as having been painted white, the fact that the owners later decided to paint it yellow would not mean that the house would no longer be covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Treating the temporary removal of the shakes as transforming the house into something other than a covered \u201cdwelling\u201d is especially difficult to reconcile with the portion of the policy that expressly authorizes the policyholders to \u201cmake alterations, additions, and repairs to the residence premises and complete structures under construction.\u201d Nothing in the wording of that provision suggests that repairing a roof is not included among the \u201calterations, additions, and repairs\u201d that are expressly authorized. It is not immediately apparent to us how a roof repair is physically possible without removing some or all of the existing roof. Under the trial court\u2019s reading of the policy, doing precisely that transforms the house into an uninsured building, something other than the \u201cdwelling\u201d that it was before the repairs. Under the interpretive principles that we have described, a plausible reading of an insurance policy provision must make sense in light of \u201cthe broader context of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>Hoffman Construction Co., </em>313 Or at 470. The trial court\u2019s reading of the policy founders against that principle of interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">That does not necessarily mean that the trial court erred in granting defendant its motion for summary judgment. Defendant offers other bases for affirming the court\u2019s decision as a matter of law. We therefore turn our attention to one of those alternative bases, which we conclude does lead to an affirmance of the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>The policy excludes coverage for water damage, except for \u201closs or damage to the interior of any dwelling or separate structures, or the personal property inside the dwelling or separate structures caused by water damage, if the dwelling or separate structures first sustained loss or damage caused by\u201d certain perils listed in the policy under \u201cSECTION I\u2014LOSSES INSURED\u2014Coverage C\u2014Personal Property.\u201d Plaintiffs assert that their loss was caused by either one of two perils described in Coverage C. The first peril is \u201cWindstorm or hail.\u201d The policy states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-4\">\u201cThis peril does not include loss to the property contained in a building if the loss is caused by rain, snow, sleet, sand or dust <em>unless the direct force of wind or hail damages the building causing an opening in a roof or wall and the rain, snow, sleet, sand or dust enters through this opening.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">(Emphasis added.) The second peril is \u201cFalling Objects.\u201d The policy states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">\u201cThis peril does not include loss to property contained in a building unless the roof or an outside wall of the building is first damaged by a falling object.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The first peril requires that \u201cdirect force\u201d of wind or hail damage the building, causing an opening in a \u201croof.\u201d The second peril requires that a falling object damage the \u201croof\u2019 or outside wall of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Plaintiffs contend that both perils occurred in this case. According to plaintiffs, both wind and a falling object\u2014 plaintiff Tim Dewsnup being the \u201cobject\u201d\u2014caused an opening or other damage to the plastic sheets that covered the house, which plaintiffs insist constituted damage to the \u201croof.\u201d The plastic sheeting, plaintiffs argue, was itself the \u201croof\u2019 within the meaning of the policy. Defendant contends that what was in essence a plastic tarp is not a \u201croof\u2019 under any ordinary definition of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Resolving that dispute requires us to determine the meaning of the term \u201croof\u2019 under the policy. The policy itself does not define the term. The ordinary meaning of the term is \u201cthe outside cover of a building or structure including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>roofing and all materials and construction necessary to maintain the cover upon its walls or other support[.]\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1971. \u201cRoofing,\u201d in turn, means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\">\u201ca material used or suitable for the construction of a roof; specif: a material designed for application to a roof as protection from the weather &lt;slate ~&gt; &lt;aluminum ~&gt; mineral-surfaced -&gt;[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-5\"><em>Id. </em>As defined, \u201croofing\u201d is the outermost layer of the cover of a building and consists of materials that are suitable <em>for construction </em>and for application to a roof as protection from the weather. Nothing in the policy suggests that the term was intended to mean anything different from that ordinary, plain meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Under that definition of the term, a temporary, plastic sheet covering a plywood subroof is not, itself, a \u201croof\u2019 or part of the roof. And damage to that plastic sheet would not constitute damage to the \u201croof\u2019 of the house. Such plastic might be understood to cover the roof, but in no reasonable sense would the sheet of plastic constitute the roof itself. If someone attempted to sell a house that was covered by such a plastic sheet, we doubt that any reasonable buyer would believe that he or she was buying a house that had a \u201croof.\u201d (Most likely, the buyer would say, \u201cWhere\u2019s the roof?\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">We note that we are not the first appellate court to address this very issue and are not the first to come to the same conclusion. The policy provision is apparently fairly standard and has occasioned a number of appellate court decisions concerning its meaning. Nearly all\u2014all but one, as far as we can tell\u2014conclude that damage to a temporary plastic tarp covering a house is not damage to its \u201croof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">In <em>Diep v. California Fair Plan Ass\u2019n, </em>15 Cal App 4th 1205, 19 Cal Rptr 2d 591 (1993), for example, the question was whether damage to plastic sheeting that had been used to cover an exposed building top constituted damage to the building\u2019s \u201croof\u2019 within the meaning of an insurance policy. The California court answered the question in the negative, explaining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">\u201ca roof is commonly considered to be a permanent part of the structure it covers. \u2018Roof is not an ambiguous or vague <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>word. The plastic sheeting was used here because part of the roof had been removed. The breach in the roof was not caused by wind or hail, but by the workmen who removed that portion of the roof needing repair.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1208-09,19 Cal Rptr 2d at 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Similarly, in <em>Camden Fire Ins. Ass\u2019n v. New Buena Vista Hotel Co., </em>199 Miss 585, 24 So 2d 848 (1946), a rainstorm caused damage to some roofing felt that had been applied to a roof during repair. The damaged felt led to water damage to the interior of the building. Insurance coverage for the damage to the interior depended on whether the storm damaged the \u201croof\u2019 of the building. The court concluded that damage to the felt that had covered the roof was not damage to the roof itself. The court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">\u201ca reasonably prudent householder would [not] consider it, if left in that condition for a month or months, or longer, as adequate against all risks of wind and rain which could be reasonably anticipated as likely to happen according to the general and recurrent experiences of the past\u2014 but not including any extraordinary or unprecedented eventuality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 596-97, 24 So 2d at 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">More recently, and closer to home, in <em>Aginsky v. Farmers Insurance Exchange, </em>409 F Supp 2d 1230 (D Or 2005), the owner of an apartment building decided to install a new roof. The contractor removed the roof of the building, but the project then stalled. In the interim, a temporary tarp structure replaced the roof. A rainstorm followed, which penetrated the plastic tarp and damaged the building\u2019s interior. The owner claimed coverage based on a policy provision nearly identical to the one at issue in this case. The insurer denied the claim because there had been no damage to the \u201croof.\u201d The court agreed, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">\u201cA \u2018roof is a permanent structure, according to its commonly understood meaning, and is not an ambiguous term. A temporary structure consisting of wooden framing and a plastic tarp would not be considered a \u2018roof by any reasonable person. The policy language anticipates coverage of a completed, permanent roof, not one in the process of repair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>and temporarily covered awaiting completion of the repairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">In <em>Victory Peach Group, Inc. v. Greater New York Mutual Ins. Co., </em>310 NJ Super 82, 707 A2d 1383 (1998), a New Jersey appellate court reached a different conclusion as to whether wind-caused damage to a temporary plastic tarp covering a building\u2019s roof constitutes damage to the \u201croof\u2019 itself within the meaning of an insurance policy exclusion. The court acknowledged <em>Camden </em>and <em>Diep, </em>but distinguished them. The court explained that New Jersey rules pertaining to the interpretation of insurance policies require the courts to \u201cfavor broad reading of coverage provisions and narrow reading of exclusionary provisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89-90, 707 A2d at 1386. Oregon rules of interpretation, of course, are different, requiring construction against the insurer only in the case of an unresolvable ambiguity. <em>Hoffman Construction Co., </em>313 Or at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">We conclude that the term \u201croof\u2019 has an unambiguous meaning, and that it does not include the tarps that plaintiffs placed over the house while the shakes were being replaced. A plastic tarp stapled into place would not plausibly be considered a \u201croof\u2019 or even part of the construction of a roof. Accordingly, the tarps that were damaged or blown away by wind and as a result of plaintiff Tim Dewsnup\u2019s fall were not themselves the house\u2019s \u201croof.\u201d They were simply a temporary protective cover for the roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Plaintiffs do not contend that if the tarps were not a part of the roof they were otherwise a part of the building so as to be encompassed within the first peril. Because the tarps were not a part of the roof, damage to the tarps does not bring plaintiffs\u2019 loss within one of the two listed perils described in the policy as exceptions to the exclusion for water damage. For that reason, we conclude that the trial court did not err in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\"> Shakes and shingles are types of roofing material made of edge-grain cut wood.
