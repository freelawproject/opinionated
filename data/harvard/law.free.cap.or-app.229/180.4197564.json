ORS 426.005(l)(d)(A), (B). In the current proceeding, he was recommitted for a period not to exceed 90 days on the ground that he was still mentally ill and in need of further treatment. <em>See </em>ORS 426.301(1) (setting out grounds for recommitment). On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred in recommitting him, because the record does not contain clear and convincing evidence to support his recommitment. The state concedes the error and, on <em>de novo </em>review, we agree and accept the concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
