J.</author>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Defendant petitions for reconsideration of our decision in <em>State v. Sanders, </em>227 Or App 495, 206 P3d 274 (2009) <em>(Sanders II). </em>In our opinion, we explained that defendant had failed to designate an adequate record; we therefore affirmed. Defendant now argues that he has adequately supplemented the record for our review and that, accordingly, we should exercise our discretion to review his assignment of error regarding the trial court\u2019s imposition of durational departure sentences based on judicial factfinding. We allow reconsideration, withdraw our former opinion and disposition, and conclude that our exercise of discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991), in <em>State v. Sanders, </em>202 Or App 225, 120 P3d 1256 (2005) <em>(Sanders I), vac\u2019d and rem\u2019d for recons, </em>345 Or 316, 195 P3d 63 (2008), was correct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we again remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Defendant was convicted of first-degree assault, three counts of second-degree assault, and four counts of fourth-degree assault arising out of his attack on a young woman. The trial court imposed two 30-year \u201cdangerous offender\u201d durational departure sentences on the first-degree assault conviction and one of the second-degree assault convictions. ORS 161.725; ORS 161.737. The court also imposed a durational departure sentence of 72 months\u2019 imprisonment on another of the second-degree assault convictions. The court gave the following reasons for its imposition of the departure sentences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">\u201cI find that defendant is suffering from a severe personality disorder, indicating a propensity toward crimes that seriously endanger the life or safety of others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">\u201cAnd pursuant to the Dangerous Offender statute, I\u2019m imposing a sentence of 30 years prison on Count I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">\u201c* * * I find as substantial and compelling reasons for the durational departure: First, the Defendant\u2019s persistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>involvement in assaultive behavior, shown not only by his prior assault conviction, but the prior escape conviction, which was the apparent use of force or violence of the use of a weapon, a stapler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\">\u201cThose facts are likewise recited in the presentence investigation report as a separate and independent substantial and compelling reason supporting the departure. The Defendant was on probation at the time the offense was committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">\u201cA further separate reason for supporting departure, any one of these three, the Court would find sufficient to support the departures, the vulnerability of the victim in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">\u201cThis was not a fight with a dowel and a broken wrist between two well-matched opponents in a fight, and it arose out of circumstances in which the victim was not only physically vulnerable, but emotionally vulnerable to the attack and found it difficult because of her emotional vulnerability to break out of the relationship with the Defendant that made her subject to this assault.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The court reiterated those findings with regard to both dangerous offender sentences and the 72-month durational departure sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\"> Where, as here, defendant stood silent during sentencing but had not explicitly waived his right to a jury trial on at least one of the charged offenses, the imposition of a departure sentence by a court based on judicial findings of fact constitutes \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>205 Or App 113, 133 P3d 343, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>207 Or App 1, 139 P3d 981 (2006), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008). The question remains whether we should exercise our discretion to correct the error in this case. The state argues that we should decline to exercise our discretion, because there is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that a jury would have found the departure factors relied on by the trial court. <em>Cf. Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (if there is no legitimate debate about the existence of a sentence enhancement fact, the defendant\u2019s interest in a second sentencing hearing is minimal). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>As we explained in <em>State v. Shelters, </em>225 Or App 76, 80, 200 P3d 598 (2009),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">\u201c[t]he determination of an offender\u2019s \u2018dangerousness\u2019 is inherently qualitative. Rather than being a sentencing fact capable of conclusive establishment by facts adduced at trial, such as a victim\u2019s permanent injury or the presence of multiple victims, a dangerous offender sentence rests on the factfinder\u2019s synthesis of the characteristics of the offender <em>and </em>the determination that those characteristics warrant an extended period of incarceration. Unlike the sentencing fact at issue in Ramirez\u2014the victim\u2019s loss of an eye constituting a permanent injury\u2014we cannot conclude here that there is \u2018no legitimate debate\u2019 that a jury would have found defendant to be a \u2018dangerous offender.\u2019 <em>See [Ramirez, </em>343 Or at] 513-14.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">That reasoning compels the same conclusion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion and disposition withdrawn; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-9\"> In <em>Sanders I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed departure sentences based on judicial findings. 202 Or App at 226. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
