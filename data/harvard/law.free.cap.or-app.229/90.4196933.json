Trautwein, </em>217 Or App 429, 175 P3d 1028 (2008). In <em>Trautwein, </em>a state\u2019s appeal, the state argued that the trial court had erred in ruling that the imposition of consecutive sentences under ORS 137.123(5) would have violated defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We affirmed without opinion. The state now contends that, in light of <em>Oregon v. Ice, </em>555 US_, 129 S Ct 711, 172 L Ed 2d 517 (2009), our previous decision was incorrect. We agree and, accordingly, withdraw our former decision and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Reconsideration allowed; former disposition withdrawn; remanded for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
