J.</author>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for possession of methamphetamine, ORS 475.894, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress evidence that a police officer found in her purse in the course of an inventory of the contents of the car in which she was a passenger. We conclude that the trial court did not err and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Defendant was a passenger in a car lawfully stopped for traffic infractions by Portland Police Officer McDaniel. McDaniel took the driver of the car into custody after learning that his Oregon driving privileges had been suspended and that there were two outstanding warrants for his arrest. McDaniel impounded the vehicle and asked defendant to step out so that he could inventory its contents pursuant to Portland\u2019s inventory policy. McDaniel asked defendant if she wanted to go to a nearby restroom to fix her clothing, which had become disarranged. Defendant agreed, and, while she was gone, McDaniel saw a purse on the floor of the passenger side near where defendant had been sitting, but within the driver\u2019s \u201cimmediate reach.\u201d He decided to inventory the purse as an item potentially containing valuables. He unzipped the purse and found a small glass jar containing two bags of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">When defendant returned to the car, the purse was on the roof of the car, where McDaniel had placed it. McDaniel asked defendant if the purse was hers and if he could search it. After defendant gave him permission to search the purse, McDaniel told her that he had already looked inside it, and he asked her if that was all right with her. After hesitating, defendant answered, \u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d McDaniel took defendant into custody and removed the methamphetamine from the purse. Based on that evidence, defendant was charged with possession of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Defendant moved to suppress the contents of the purse, asserting that Portland\u2019s inventory policy does not allow the opening of the purse of a person who is not under arrest. The state maintained that the purse was subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>inventory because it was in the possession of the driver at the time of his arrest by virtue of his possession of the car and the close proximity of the purse to the driver. The trial court concluded that the purse was in the driver\u2019s possession at the time of arrest and denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained in the inventory of the purse. After a bench trial, defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">On appeal, defendant contends that the opening of the purse was an unlawful search that violated Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. The state contends that McDaniel examined the contents of defendant\u2019s purse pursuant to a valid administrative inventory policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"> Article I, section 9, prohibits unreasonable searches. A warrantless search is <em>per se </em>unreasonable unless it falls within a recognized exception to the warrant requirement. <em>State v. Snow, </em>337 Or 219, 223, 94 P3d 872 (2004). The inventory of a lawfully impounded vehicle, conducted pursuant to a properly authorized administrative program that limits police discretion, is one such exception. <em>State v. Atkinson, </em>298 Or 1, 7, 688 P2d 832 (1984). In this case, the state contends that the search of defendant\u2019s purse was justified by Portland\u2019s inventory policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The Portland City Code (PCC) includes two inventory provisions. PCC 14C. 10.030 relates to the inventory of the contents of an impounded vehicle and prohibits the opening of closed containers found in the vehicle. PCC 14C. 10.040 relates to the inventory of the personal property of a person who has been taken into custody and allows for the opening of closed containers in the arrested person\u2019s possession, if those containers are designed to carry valuables. PCC 14C.10.040(C)(3) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">\u201cA closed container in the possession of [a person taken into custody] will have its contents inventoried only when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">* * <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">\u201cc. The closed container is designed for carrying money and/or small valuables on or about the person including, but not limited to, closed purses, closed coin purses, closed wallets and closed fanny packs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Thus, under PCC 14C. 10.040(C)(3)(c), a purse or other small container designed for carrying valuables may be opened for the purpose of inventorying its contents if it is in the \u201cpossession\u201d of the arrested person.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">At issue in this case is whether defendant\u2019s purse was in the \u201cpossession\u201d of the driver when the police inventoried the contents of the driver\u2019s car pursuant to PCC 14C. 10.040(C)(3)(c). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>State v. Connolly, </em>339 Or 583, 591, 125 P3d 1254 (2005), whether an object is in an individual\u2019s \u201cpossession\u201d under an inventory policy presents two distinct questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">First, there is the question as to the meaning of the term \u201cpossession\u201d itself; that presents a question of law concerning the interpretation of the inventory policy or ordinance. <em>Id. </em>at 588. In <em>Connolly, </em>the court actually addressed the meaning of just that term as it is used in PCC 14C. 10.040. Citing <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1770 (unabridged ed 2002), the court concluded that the term means \u201cthe act or condition of having in or taking into one\u2019s control or holding at one\u2019s disposal.\u201d <em>Connolly, </em>339 Or at 591. The court then explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">\u201cThat definition is broad enough to include personal property within the suspect\u2019s immediate reach as well as property under the suspect\u2019s dominion and control, a conclusion that other parts of the ordinance support. Section 14C. 10.040 refers both to \u2018possession\u2019 and \u2018immediate possession.\u2019 <em>See </em>PCC 14C.10.040(C) (possession); PCC 14C. 10.040(C)(3)(a) (immediate possession). We understand the phrase \u2018immediate possession\u2019 to refer to personal property that is on the suspect\u2019s person or within his or her immediate reach and the term \u2018possession\u2019 to refer, in addition, to personal property under the suspect\u2019s dominion and control. * * * Put more succinctly, \u2018possession\u2019 includes both actual and constructive possession.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Second, there is the question whether an individual actually or constructively possessed an object at the time of the inventory. That presents a question of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">In this case, there is no dispute over the meaning of the term \u201cpossession\u201d as it is used in PCC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>14C.10.040(C)(3)(c); on that issue, <em>Connally </em>controls. The dispute is whether there is evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding of fact that the driver of the vehicle that was about to be impounded was in actual or constructive possession of defendant\u2019s purse at the time of the inventory. Defendant contends that there is no evidence in this case that the purse belonged to the driver, that the driver touched the purse, or that he took any other action that indicated he was exercising dominion or control over it. The state responds that the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding in that it shows that the purse was discovered in the driver\u2019s car, within his immediate reach, and after defendant had left it behind in the car when she went to the restroom. According to the state, that makes this case indistinguishable from <em>Connally.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">We agree with the state. In <em>Connally, </em>the police learned during the course of a stop that the defendant, the driver of a car, had an outstanding felony warrant. The police handcuffed the defendant, placed him under arrest, and\u2014 pursuant to Portland\u2019s inventory policy\u2014proceeded to inventory the contents of the car. In the course of the inventory, the police found a nylon bag for holding skis in the back seat where a passenger had been sitting. The police opened the bag and found a fanny pack that, in turn, contained baggies of methamphetamine. The defendant was charged with possession of a controlled substance. 339 Or at 585-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The defendant moved to suppress the evidence of the methamphetamine, arguing that, among other things, there was insufficient evidence that he actually or constructively possessed the drugs. The trial court denied the motion, and the Supreme Court affirmed. The court explained that, the \u201cdefendant drove the car and was standing next to it when the officers took him into custody. The trial court reasonably could infer from that evidence that [the] defendant exercised dominion and control over the fanny pack (and thus possessed it) when [the officer] placed him under arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594. Interestingly, in a footnote, the court noted that the defendant had not argued that there was insufficient evidence to show that the ski bag belonged to him rather than one of the passengers. The court then commented that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>\u201c[gliven defendant\u2019s apparent control over the car and its contents, such an argument would be difficult to mount.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594 n 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">In this case, the facts are materially indistinguishable from those in <em>Connally. </em>As in <em>Connally, </em>in this case, the driver had just been driving the car. And as in <em>Connally, </em>in this case, at the time of arrest, the driver was physically close to the evidence that was seized. In fact, if anything, the facts of this case offer even more evidence of dominion or control. While the defendant in <em>Connally </em>was standing outside of the car at the time of arrest, in this case, the driver was still in the car, where the purse was within his \u201cimmediate reach.\u201d If the facts in <em>Connally </em>were sufficient to support a finding that the driver actually or constructively possessed objects in the car, the record in this case certainly does.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Defendant insists that such a conclusion cannot be reconciled with cases holding that an individual\u2019s \u201cmere proximity\u201d to property, by itself, cannot support a finding that the individual exercises dominion or control over it. It is true that, as we noted in <em>State v. Sosa-Vasquez, </em>158 Or App 445, 448, 974 P2d 701 (1999), \u201cmere presence in the proximity of controlled substances is not sufficient to establish constructive possession\u201d of the drugs. Those cases, however, did not involve a motor vehicle and a driver\u2019s actual or constructive possession of property readily accessible to the driver of such a vehicle. <em>See, e.g., State v. Miller, </em>238 Or 411, 414, 395 P2d 159 (1964) (presence of weapons in glove compartment of car the defendant was driving held to be \u201cparticularly strong\u201d circumstantial evidence of driver\u2019s possession); <em>State v. Marsh, </em>78 Or App 290, 294, 716 P2d 261, <em>rev den, </em>301 Or 320 (1986) (that the defendant driver knew that a passenger had a gun in her purse and that the gun was \u201cavailable\u201d held sufficient to find that the defendant possessed it). In any event, even assuming that <em>Connally </em>stands in some tension with some other cases, it is, as we have noted, virtually indistinguishable from the facts of this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">It may also be argued (although defendant in this case does not do so) that <em>Connally </em>actually is not controlling, because this case involves the issue that the court noted in a footnote that it was not addressing, namely, whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>facts were sufficient to establish that the driver, <em>as opposed to the passengers, </em>possessed the drugs found in the car. In a sense, it could be argued, this case presents the issue that the defendant in <em>Connally </em>did not. The problem with such an argument, however, is the Supreme Court\u2019s comment that, \u201c[gliven defendant\u2019s apparent control over the car and its contents, such an argument would be difficult to mount.\u201d 339 Or at 594 n 8. The court\u2019s remark may be <em>dictum, </em>but, given the court\u2019s analysis of the adequacy of the evidence of the defendant\u2019s apparent control over the property at issue in <em>Connally, </em>we can discern no basis for arriving at a different conclusion in this case. Particularly given the fact that the driver in this case was even closer to the property at issue than was the defendant in <em>Connally, </em>and given further that defendant in this case walked away from the car and left the property behind, we must conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the driver possessed the purse. As a result, the police lawfully searched the contents of the purse in accordance with the city\u2019s inventory policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
