J.</author>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Defendant Multnomah County appeals a supplemental judgment, which awarded attorney fees, expenses, and costs to plaintiff Dorothy English after she obtained a general judgment for $1,150,000 in just compensation pursuant to ORS 197.352 (2005) (commonly known as Measure 37).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The central issue on appeal is whether ORS 197.352(6), the statute that governed attorney fees in Measure 37 cases, authorized the award of attorney fees in this case and, if it did, whether the trial court properly awarded a \u201ccustomary\u201d contingent fee. Because English\u2019s entitlement to fees, expenses, and costs depends on the correct interpretation of ORS 197.352, we review for errors of law, <em>see Cramblit v. Diamond B Constructors, </em>197 Or App 358, 370, 105 P3d 906 (2005), and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The material facts are essentially procedural and are not in dispute. However, because this appeal is only one of many involving the county and English, an understanding of the litigation concerning English\u2019s Measure 37 claim provides the necessary context for resolving the issues presented in this appeal. <em>See State ex rel English v. Multnomah County, </em>227 Or App 419, 206 P3d 224 (2009) <em>(English I). </em>Accordingly, we describe in some detail the litigation between the parties and our resolution of their other related appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In November 2004, in anticipation of the December 2004 effective date of Measure 37, English engaged the firm of Schwabe, Williamson &amp; Wyatt, P.C. (Schwabe) to make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Measure 37 claim on her behalf. In November 2004, Schwabe sent English a letter of engagement that described Schwabe\u2019s proposed fee agreement. English agreed to the terms of the fee agreement in which the scope of the representation was limited to \u201cmaking a claim under Measure 37.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Four aspects of that fee agreement are most pertinent to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><em>First, </em>the agreement provided that Schwabe would complete \u201cthe work required to prepare and file [English\u2019s] written demand on a <em>contingent fee basis.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Of significance, although the agreement indicated that work would be done on a \u201ccontingent fee basis,\u201d it did not include a provision indicating that Schwabe\u2019s fee would be based on any particular percentage of any eventual recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\"><em>Second, </em>the agreement provided that Schwabe would \u201ckeep track of the time expended by the various lawyers and paralegal staff involved and record the time at our regular hourly rates\u201d and would apply a nine percent standard interest charge for deferred payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\"><em>Third, </em>the agreement stated that Schwabe\u2019s total fee would be based on the hourly rates and interest charges described above or \u201can amount the [c]ourt should award, whichever is highe[r]\u201d because \u201ccourts often award fees on contingent matters at a higher rate than if they were on a regular hourly arrangement\u201d and that, if Schwabe never obtained \u201ca court-awarded fee that can be collected from the government, [English] would pay only the regular hourly amounts including the regular deferred payment charge for the work done at this initial phase.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\"><em>Fourth, </em>the agreement stated that English would pay Schwabe\u2019s bill only if it \u201csucceeded] in obtaining relief for [English] under Measure 37 * * According to Schwabe,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">\u201c[flor purposes of this engagement, we would consider that we will have successfully obtained relief for you if either (a) you are compensated for the diminution in the value of your property by reason of the land-use restrictions, (b) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>government waives enforcement of the land-use restrictions to enable you to create and sell off a discrete parcel of the land where you currently reside. If the relief is in the form of monetary compensation, we would take our contingent fee from those proceeds. If we get you relief in the form of a government release of the land-use restrictions, we would collect our fee from the proceeds of a sale that realizes that benefit. We understand that you do desire to divide the property into 6 discrete parcels and sell 5 of them. We would be paid from the proceeds of the first sale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">In December 2004, English filed a written demand with the county for $1,150,000 in just compensation pursuant to Measure 37. Thereafter, in May 2006, dissatisfied with the county\u2019s resulting waiver, English filed her complaint for just compensation in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">After the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court granted English\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to all liability issues and denied the county\u2019s cross-motion. The parties then stipulated to the amount of just compensation, and, in late December 2006, the trial court entered a judgment providing, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\"><em>\u201c1. </em>That [English] ha[s] judgment against [the county] for just compensation pursuant to the provisions of ORS 197.352 in the sum of $1,150,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\"><em>\u201c2. </em>That English ha[s] judgment for her reasonable attorney fees, expenses, costs and other disbursements reasonably incurred pursuant to [ORS] 197.352, ORCP 68 and Supplemental Judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">In January 2007, the county appealed the compensation judgment to this court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In February, the county filed a motion to dismiss its appeal, and we subsequently granted the county\u2019s motion and, consequently, issued an appellate judgment terminating that appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">Meanwhile, also in January 2007, English filed her statement for attorney fees and cost bill in the trial court, asserting that she was \u201centitled to reasonable attorney fees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>expenses, costs and disbursements incurred under ORS 197.352.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, English requested $414,151.22, which was itemized as follows: (1) $383,000 in attorney fees for services rendered in the matter, which \u201cexceed[ed] the total sum of the charged rates multiplied by the hours worked due to the contingent nature of the fee arrangement\u201d; (2) $27,260.49 in expert witness fee expenses; and (3) $3,890.73 in costs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> English asserted that the fee was reasonable in light of numerous factors, including the nature of the fee\u2014that is, whether the fee is fixed or contingent.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">The county objected, asserting that ORS 197.352(6) authorized fees \u201creasonably incurred to <em>collect </em>compensation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In the county\u2019s characterization, the fees and expenses that English sought had been incurred in establishing an entitlement to compensation, not in \u201ccollecting\u201d compensation, and, thus, she was not entitled to an award of fees and costs. Further, the county asserted that Schwabe had no basis to request a \u201cpercentage fee\u201d because \u201c[tjhat\u2019s not their arrangement with their client.\u201d Alternatively, the county contended that, if the statute authorized an award in this case, the fees and costs that English sought were not reasonable for a variety of reasons, including that they were sought for tasks unrelated to English\u2019s Measure 37 claim and the prosecution of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">English responded to the county\u2019s objections, arguing that the fees and costs were statutorily authorized under ORS 197.352 and were reasonable. Although English noted that the county had correctly identified a \u201cfew unintentional erroneous entries that should not have been included in [English\u2019s] petition\u201d and requested the removal of those entries from the petition,\u201d English\u2019s basic position remained constant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">\u201cGiven the <em>contingent </em>nature of this fee arrangement, removal of that effort and amount from the fee petition should not reduce the fee award at all. Even if all of the [county\u2019s] objections about the amount of time spent or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>sufficiency of the entries were valid (and they are not), the contingent percentage of one-third of the judgment is well within reason.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing concerning attorney fees, the trial court made extensive oral findings on the record. In addition to concluding that English was entitled to recover expert witness fees, the trial court determined that English was entitled to recover attorney fees, because ORS 197.352(6) \u201cprovide[d] a right to recover attorney fees under the circumstances of this case, not just in the post-judgment enforcement of judgment process but in the process of getting to judgment through the course of litigation.\u201d Ultimately, the court awarded English attorney fees commensurate with one-third of the amount awarded in the compensation judgment\u2014that is, approximately $383,000\u2014which the court described as the \u201cusual and customary fee in cases of a contingent nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">In explaining its reasoning, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">\u201cI\u2019m persuaded to follow the rationale that\u2019s been offered by [English\u2019s] experts regarding coming to a determination of reasonableness of * * * fees based upon what the contingent fee would be if applied to the judgment on * * * a one-third contingency basis which results in $383,000.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Referring to the analytical approach endorsed by one of English\u2019s experts, Maloney, <em>see </em>229 Or App at 21-22 n 6, the trial court \u201clooked at, in fact, what the amount of time * * * that was spent, the reasonableness of the rates of counsel and the objections that were made by the [c]ounty, some of which I think were * * * well founded[.]\u201d The trial court indicated that, even assuming that it discounted various entries in the petition to which the county objected, a calculation of a reasonable hourly rate would result in a fee of \u201cover $200,000\u201d and that it would then be appropriate to double that amount. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\">\u201cIf I did that, we\u2019d be talking about $400,000. <em>So * * * that\u2019s another way of my analyzing whether or not the contingent fee amount that was proposed by both of the plaintiffs experts is a * * * reasonable fee for this case, </em>and I * * * believe that it is for that reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">\u201cSo rather than * * * trying to go through and come up with mathematical exactness on the lodestar formula, and then doubling the rate and coming to a number, * * * I\u2019m satisfied that the contingent fee amount is a reasonable amount, given my analysis of what would normally be the hourly rate times the * * * total hours.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">When the county sought clarification, the trial court reaffirmed its conclusion that it was awarding a customary one-third contingent fee in the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">\u201c[THE COUNTY]: So the exact amount of the attorney fee award is what was petitioned for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-10\">* <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-11\">\u201c[THE COUNTY]: Based on a one-third contingency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq_\">\u201cTHE COURT: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>\u201c[THE COUNTY]: But you\u2019re also saying that * * * with no reductions despite the fact that the [c]ourt found there was some that were\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: Correct. Because all that did was\u2014 that analysis supports my view that the one-third contingency is a reasonable number.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Ultimately, in April 2007, the trial court issued a supplemental judgment that awarded English (1) \u201can attorney fee of $383,333.33, or one-third of the General Judgment\u201d\u2014that is, the compensation judgment; (2) \u201cexpenses, costs, and other disbursements, including expert witness fees in the underlying case in the amount totaling $37,058.73\u201d; and (3) \u201ccosts, expenses and expert witness fees expended for the hearing on attorney fees, in the amount of $17,850.\u201d The county appealed that judgment, which is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Thereafter, in June 2007, while this appeal concerning attorney fees was pending, English sought satisfaction of the money award in the compensation judgment pursuant to ORS 30.390. When the county refused to pay, English sought a writ of mandamus. The trial court granted the county\u2019s motion to dismiss the alternative writ of mandamus on the ground that, under ORS 197.352, the county had complete discretion as to whether to satisfy the judgment. <em>English I, </em>227 Or App at 425. English appealed the judgment in the mandamus proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 421. In <em>English I, </em>we reversed that judgment and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to issue a peremptory writ of mandamus directing the county to pay the judgment of $1,150,000 in just compensation. <em>Id. </em>at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">We turn to the parties\u2019 arguments in this appeal concerning the supplemental judgment that awarded English attorney fees, expenses, and costs. The county makes four basic arguments. <em>First, </em>the county contends that this appeal is moot, because of the passage of Measure 49.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Second, </em>with regard to the award of attorney fees, the county contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>that, because English has not collected the monetary award adjudicated in the compensation judgment, she is not entitled to attorney fees in this case under ORS 197.352(6), which authorized an award of attorney fees \u201cincurred to <em>collect </em>the compensation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Third, </em>the county asserts that the trial court either erred in awarding a customary contingent fee or abused its discretion by awarding fees that were unreasonable. <em>Fourth, </em>with regard to the award of expert witness fees, the county contends that the undefined reference to \u201cexpenses\u201d in ORS 197.352(6) did not entitle plaintiff to recover expert witness fees in this case and, alternatively, that, if those fees were authorized, they were not necessary for the prosecution of English\u2019s Measure 37 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">English responds, in turn, with four counterarguments. <em>First, </em>English asserts that the passage of Measure 49 did not cause this appeal to become moot. <em>Second, </em>with regard to the attorney fee award, English asserts that the plain language of ORS 197.352(6), supported by pertinent legislative history, provided that she is entitled to attorney fees for pursuing her Measure 37 claim for just compensation. <em>Third, </em>she contends that, regardless of whether the trial court properly awarded a customary contingent fee, it properly based its attorney fee award on the alternative ground that the award was reasonable in light of the hours expended and the rates charged. <em>Fourth, </em>English asserts that the plain language of ORS 197.352(6) authorized the award of expert witness fees and that those fees were necessary in the prosecution of her Measure 37 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Because it implicates our jurisdiction, we begin by addressing the county\u2019s contention that this appeal is moot. An appeal is moot if \u201cresolving the merits of a claim will have no practical effect on the rights of the parties[.]\u201d <em>Corey v. DLCD, </em>344 Or 457, 464, 184 P3d 1109 (2008). In this appeal, the county raises essentially the same mootness arguments that it raised, and that we rejected, in <em>English I. </em>Specifically, we understand the county to assert, by its reference to <em>Corey, </em>that, because Measure 49 applies to all Measure 37 claims, the supplemental judgment that awarded English attorney fees and costs under Measure 37 is deprived of continuing viability. Thus, in the county\u2019s view, any decision concerning English\u2019s entitlement to fees, expenses, and costs and the reasonableness of the award in the supplemental judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>will have no effect on the parties, and, as a consequence, the appeal is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">The county is, of course, correct that this appeal differs from <em>English I </em>in that it implicates the continued viability of the supplemental judgment for attorney fees. Nevertheless, with respect to the effect of Measure 49, that is, ultimately, a distinction without a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">As previously noted, 229 Or App at 23, in <em>English I, </em>we reversed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of English\u2019s alternative writ of mandamus and remanded with instructions that the trial court issue a peremptory writ of mandamus directing the county to pay the judgment of $1,150,000 in just compensation. As here, the county in <em>English I </em>contended that the appeal concerning the judgment entered in the mandamus proceeding was moot because of the passage of Measure 49. 227 Or App at 426. In rejecting that contention, we began by summarizing the cases addressing the impact of the intervening enactment of Measure 49 on the justiciability of pending appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">\u201cIn <em>Corey, </em>the Supreme Court examined the text and context of Measure 49 and determined that \u2018Measure 49 pertains to <em>all </em>Measure 37 claims, successful or not, and regardless of where they are in the Measure 37 process.\u2019 344 Or at 465 (emphasis in original). The court ultimately held that \u2018Measure 49 by its terms deprives Measure 37 waivers\u2014and <em>all </em>orders disposing of Measure 37 claims\u2014of any continuing viability.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 466-67 (emphasis in original). Thus, because DLCD\u2019s order in that case had no continuing viability, a decision by the Supreme Court as to whether this court or a circuit court had jurisdiction to review the order could have had no practical effect on the parties and the case was moot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">\u201cWe recently applied <em>Corey </em>in <em>Cyrus v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>226 Or App 1, 202 P3d 274 (2009). In <em>Cyrus, </em>the petitioners appealed a circuit court judgment essentially affirming an order of the Deschutes County Board of Commissioners that waived particular land use regulations. While the appeal was pending, Measure 49 became effective, and, like the Supreme Court in <em>Corey, </em>we were faced with determining whether the appeal was moot. The petitioners in <em>Cyrus </em>argued that our determination of the validity of the Measure 37 waiver would have a practical effect on the parties because it was a predicate to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>argument that the waiver had vested under Measure 49. 226 Or App at 8. However, we concluded that the appeal was moot because, as the Supreme Court held in <em>Corey, </em>Measure 49 deprived all orders disposing of Measure 37 claims of continued viability, and the validity of the waiver could be litigated in a Measure 49 proceeding. <em>Cyrus, </em>226 Or App at 13.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><em>English I, </em>227 Or App at 426-27. Based on those cases, we reasoned in <em>English I </em>that, when the county dismissed its appeal from the compensation judgment over nine months before the effective date of Measure 49 and we issued an appellate judgment, the county had exhausted its opportunities for appellate review. Accordingly, in that context, there was a final judgment conclusively adjudicating the Measure 37 claim for compensation, and, although English\u2019s \u201cMeasure 37 claim for just compensation was extinguished,\u201d she \u201cwas left, by way of the consequent \u2018merger\u2019 and \u2018substitution\u2019 with a final judgment and the right to enforce <em>it.\u201d English </em>1,227 Or App at 428 (citation omitted). Ultimately, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\">\u201cThis appeal arose from English\u2019s enforcement activities\u2014that is, English\u2019s attempts to compel the county to satisfy the compensation judgment by seeking a writ of mandamus. This is not an appeal concerning an existing Measure 37 claim. For that reason, our determination whether the county must pay the compensation judgment will have a practical effect on the rights of the parties. Consequently, the appeal is not moot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The foundation of our holding in <em>English I </em>was a basic principle derived from <em>Corey </em>and <em>Cyrus: </em>When the dispute involving a predicate Measure 37 claim for just compensation is ongoing (whether in another forum or on appeal), Measure 49 supersedes the Measure 37 claim and requires the parties to proceed under the new standards in Measure 49 to determine their rights. Applying that principle to the circumstances of this appeal, we reach the same conclusion that we did in <em>English </em>I\u2014that is, that the appeal is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">As we have already indicated, in February 2007, when the county dismissed its appeal from the compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>judgment over nine months before the effective date of Measure 49 and we issued an appellate judgment, the county had exhausted its opportunities for appellate review. Consequently, there was a final judgment conclusively adjudicating the Measure 37 claim for just compensation and that claim was extinguished. By that point, there was no ongoing dispute concerning English\u2019s Measure 37 claim for just compensation\u2014the claim that was the predicate for English\u2019s fee entitlement. Thus, because this appeal does not involve an ongoing dispute concerning English\u2019s Measure 37 claim for just compensation, which Measure 49 would otherwise obviate, our resolution of English\u2019s entitlement to fees and costs pursuant to ORS 197.352(6) will have a practical effect on the parties. Accordingly, this appeal is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Having determined that the appeal is justiciable, we turn to the propriety of the attorney fee award in this case. Specifically, we address (1) whether English was entitled to recover any fees, expenses, and costs\u2014that is, whether at least some of the amount sought was \u201creasonably incurred to collect the compensation\u201d under ORS 197.352(6); and (2) if so, whether the trial court erred in awarding fees in the amount of one-third of the compensation judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u201cGenerally, a party is not entitled to an award of attorney fees unless such an award is authorized by statute or by a specific contractual provision.\u201d <em>Wilkes v. Zurlinden, </em>328 Or 626, 631, 984 P2d 261 (1999). As noted, 229 Or App at 17 n 1, Measure 37 was enacted through the initiative process in 2004 and ultimately codified as ORS 197.352. Thus, in construing ORS 197.352(6), we attempt to discern the voters\u2019 intent by examining the text and context of the statutory provision, which is the \u201cbest evidence\u201d of that intent, <em>Oregon State Denturist Assn. v. Board of Dentistry, </em>172 Or App 693, 700, 19 P3d 986 (2001), as well as any pertinent legislative history proffered by a party, <em>see State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009) (when interpreting a statute, to determine legislative intent, a court examines the text and context of the statute as well as pertinent legislative history proffered by a party). Relevant history includes the ballot title and explanatory statement in the voters\u2019 pamphlet. <em>See Shilo Inn v. Multnomah County, </em>333 Or 101, 129-30, 36 P3d 954 (2001), <em>modified on recons, </em>334 Or 11, 45 P3d 107 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>With those principles in mind, we turn to the text of the statute that governed entitlement to attorney fees in Measure 37 cases. ORS 197.352(6) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\">\u201cIf a land use regulation continues to apply to the subject property more than 180 days after the present owner of the property has made written demand for compensation under this section, the present owner of the property, or any interest therein, shall have a cause of action for compensation under this section in the circuit court in which the real property is located, and the present owner of the real property <em>shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees, expenses, costs, and other disbursements reasonably incurred to collect the compensation.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Our examination of that statute focuses on the phrase \u201creasonably incurred to collect the compensation,\u201d and, more specifically, begins with the plain and ordinary meanings of the pertinent words in that phrase\u2014that is, the words \u201cincurred\u201d and \u201ccollect.\u201d \u201cIncur\u201d means to \u201cbecome liable or subject to.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1146 (unabridged ed 2002). <em>See also White v. Jubitz Corp., </em>219 Or App 62, 67, 182 P3d 215, <em>rev allowed, </em>345 Or 175 (2008) (reasoning that, based on the common definition of \u201cincur,\u201d the \u201cphrase \u2018reasonable charges necessarily incurred\u2019 is most sensibly understood to mean charges to which an injured party becomes <em>subject </em>at the time that the party receives care necessary to treat the party\u2019s injuries\u201d (emphasis in original)); <em>Anderson v. Wheeler, </em>214 Or App 318, 322, 164 P3d 1194 (2007) (reasoning that, in the context of ORS 36.425(4)(b), which provides an entitlement to \u201cattorney fees * * * incurred\u201d in certain arbitration proceedings, \u201cthe term \u2018incurred\u2019 takes on its ordinary meaning\u201d and \u201cmeans that attorney fees are recoverable only if a party has incurred them\u2014that is, has become liable to pay them\u201d). In turn, \u201ccollect,\u201d in this context, means \u201cto present as due and receive payment for.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 444. Thus, our examination of the text of ORS 197.352(6) demonstrates that a landowner with a cause of action for compensation has a corresponding entitlement to attorney fees, expenses, and costs incurred to collect it\u2014that is, attorney fees, expenses, and costs that the landowner becomes liable to pay in pursuing the cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>That understanding is confirmed by the statement in Measure 37\u2019s ballot title that the measure \u201c[c]reates [a] civil right of action including attorney fees.\u201d Official Voters\u2019 Pamphlet, General Election, Nov 2, 2004, 103. That statement indicates that a landowner is entitled to an award for attorney fees that the landowner becomes liable to pay as a result of pursuing the cause of action and that such an award is not limited to fees incurred only in a post-judgment enforcement proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">In light of the text of the statute and its pertinent history, the county\u2019s assertions that English is not entitled to a fee under the statute because she \u201chas not collected any compensation; she simply has liquidated the amount of her claim for compensation\u201d is clearly untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">We note, moreover, the county\u2019s assertion that English had no entitlement to attorney fees is also predicated on two propositions that we rejected in <em>English I. </em>Specifically, here, as in <em>English I, </em>the county posits that (1) English\u2019s cause of action for compensation merely served to liquidate the amount of her Measure 37 just compensation claim and did not establish the county\u2019s liability to pay just compensation; and (2) the county had complete discretion to pay the compensation judgment such that English would never be entitled to \u201ccollect\u201d the just compensation awarded in the compensation judgment. Our analysis and disposition in <em>English I </em>foreclose those contentions. <em>See </em>227 Or App at 430 (reasoning that, in the compensation proceeding, the county had the opportunity to litigate whether it was in fact liable to pay just compensation; thus, claim preclusion principles barred them from litigating those issues in the mandamus proceeding). In sum, pursuant to ORS 197.352(6), English is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees that she became liable to pay as a result of pursuing her cause of action for just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Given that determination, we turn to whether the trial court erred in the amount of attorney fees, expenses, and costs that it awarded. Although ORS 197.352(6) created an entitlement to a recovery of attorney fees, that statutory entitlement is explicitly, textually limited to the amount the property owner \u201cincurred\u201d\u2014that is, \u201cbecame liable or subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>to\u201d\u2014in prosecuting the just compensation litigation. Thus, it is the fee agreement between English and Schwabe, which prescribes the fees for which English would be liable to pay Schwabe, that circumscribes English\u2019s statutory fee entitlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">As noted, that agreement stated that Schwabe would work on a \u201ccontingent fee basis.\u201d However, it did not specify that English was obligated to pay Schwabe a particular percentage\u2014much less one-third\u2014of any eventual recovery.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather, the agreement stated only that, if certain objectives were achieved, English would be obligated to pay Schwabe\u2019s hourly rate for the hours expended as well as certain interest charges. Thus, as of the time that the trial court awarded attorney fees, English had \u201cincurred\u201d\u2014that is, was obligated to pay Schwabe\u2014fees based only on the hours her attorneys spent prosecuting this matter multiplied by their hourly billing rates plus interest. Nothing more, nothing less.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consequently, the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees based on a one-third contingency must be reversed because it did not comport with ORS 197.352(6) in that it awarded a fee that English had not incurred under the terms of the fee agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">English asserts, however, that such a disposition is unnecessary because the trial court\u2019s award was based on an alternative theory\u2014that is, that the court\u2019s award was based on an analysis of the hours expended and the rates charged. We disagree that the court based its award on that alternative rationale. The court clearly indicated that it was awarding a customary one-third contingent fee and that its examination of the hours expended and the rates charged merely supported its view that \u201cthe one-third contingency is a reasonable number.\u201d Accordingly, although English is entitled to an award of attorney fees pursuant to ORS 197.352(6), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the trial court erred in its determination of the amount awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">We then turn to the remaining issue on appeal\u2014that is, whether the undefined reference to \u201cexpenses\u201d in ORS 197.352(6) entitled plaintiff to recover expert witness fees in this case and, if it did, whether the fees were necessary to the prosecution of English\u2019s Measure 37 claim. As previously noted, ORS 197.352(6) authorized an award of \u201creasonable attorney fees, <em>expenses, </em>costs, and other disbursements * * (Emphasis added.) The term \u201cexpenses\u201d was not defined in the statute. For that reason, the county contends that the default definition of costs and disbursements in ORCP 68 controls, and, because expert witness fees are not recoverable under ORCP 68, they are not recoverable pursuant to ORS 197.352(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">In support of its position, the county cites <em>Malot v. Hadley, </em>102 Or App 336, 794 P2d 833 (1990). In that case, the plaintiffs sought attorney fees and costs under a provision of a promissory note that provided that, \u201c \u2018[i]f this note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection, we, jointly and severally, agree to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such attorney * * *.\u2019 <em>\u201d Id. </em>at 340. In its award of costs and disbursements, the trial court, in <em>Malot, </em>included a $248.21 payment to a court reporter for deposition services. <em>Id. </em>at 342. The defendant asserted that that award was improper. We reasoned that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">\u201c[i]n the promissory note, defendants agreed to pay \u2018the reasonable * * * expenses\u2019 of the noteholders\u2019 attorney. The proper analysis is to determine what the parties intended by the term \u2018expenses.\u2019 In the absence of language evidencing a contrary intent, we think it reasonable to conclude that the parties intended the undefined contractual term \u2018expenses\u2019 to mean those costs and disbursements provided for by statute or rule at the time the cost bill was submitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-7\"><em>Id. </em>(omission in original). Accordingly, because ORCP 68 A(2) did not define \u201ccosts and disbursements\u201d to include deposition charges, and because the parties cited no other rule or statute that would permit recovery of those charges, we held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>that the trial court erred when it included the deposition costs in its award. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Notwithstanding the county\u2019s invocation of <em>Malot, </em>our opinion there is not conclusive here. The terms of the promissory note at issue in <em>Malot </em>referred to the \u201creasonable fees and expenses\u201d of the attorney into whose hands the note was placed for collection. Under that circumstance, we concluded that the parties to the agreement intended the term \u201cexpenses\u201d to mean costs and disbursements, which was not referenced in the agreement. <em>Malot, </em>102 Or App at 342. In this case, unlike in <em>Malot, </em>ORS 197.352(6) referred to \u201creasonable attorney fees, expenses, costs, and other disbursements * * *.\u201d Because the statute already provided for an award of \u201ccosts\u201d and \u201cother disbursements,\u201d the inclusion of the term \u201cexpenses\u201d indicates that the voters intended a landowner to recover litigation-related expenditures beyond \u201ccosts and disbursements\u201d as defined in ORCP 68 A. To conclude otherwise would render the inclusion of the term \u201cexpenses\u201d in ORS 197.352(6) meaningless. <em>See </em>ORS 174.010 (providing that, in construing a statute, the court is not \u201cto omit what has been inserted\u201d); <em>State v. Mayes, </em>220 Or App 385, 389, 186 P3d 293 (2008) (reasoning that, when interpreting a statute, we \u201cgive effect to all relevant provisions\u201d and assume that \u201cthe legislature did not intend any portion of its enactments * * * to be meaningless surplusage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">To avoid that result, we look to the meaning of the term \u201cexpenses\u201d in the context of similar statutes. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993) (reasoning that the court may consider \u201cthe context of the statutory provision at issue, which includes other provisions of the same statute and other related statutes\u201d). English asserts that the definition of the term \u201cexpenses\u201d as used in ORS 35.335 is useful context for our interpretation of the term \u201cexpenses\u201d in this case. We agree. ORS 35.335(1) provides that, after the abandonment of a condemnation action by a condemnor, a defendant shall recover the \u201ccosts and disbursements in the action\u201d and \u201creasonable attorney fees and reasonable expenses as determined by the court.\u201d In turn, ORS 35.335(2) defines \u201cexpenses\u201d as the \u201ccosts of appraisals and fees for experts incurred in preparing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>conducting the defense to the action.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, we agree with the trial court that the term \u201cexpenses\u201d in the statute permits English to recover her expert witness fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Finally, the county asserts that certain witness fees were unnecessary. Specifically, the county argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">\u201cIn the proceeding below, [English] put forth no basis in fact or law to seek recovery of these development costs and expert fees. Instead, plaintiff simply identified any possible expense associated to her Measure 37 claim, and then passed those expenses on to Multnomah County. Those expenses were not limited solely to actual witnesses, but to the costs for tasks performed on the property itself. For example, plaintiff sought, and the court ultimately awarded recovery for surveys, traffic counts, septic permit fees, excavation on the property, and engineering services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">(Footnote omitted.) In its response to the county\u2019s objections in the trial court, English countered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">\u201cIn order to prosecute her claim for compensation under Measure 37, [English] needed to demonstrate the reduction in the value of her property caused by the regulations. This necessitated comparing the fair market value of the property both with and without the regulations. In order to determine fair market value of the property without the regulations, [English] needed to demonstrate what could feasibly be developed on the property in the absence of the regulations. Market value of the property is driven by what can feasibly be developed on the property given market conditions, topography and other such factors, and [English] reasonably incurred expert witness fees of engineers, developers, and appraisers to build its case on these issues. In addition, the [county] has changed its position regarding the regulations that it would or would not waive on several occasions, both in settlement discussions and in its formal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Board Orders. Each such change has necessitated review of the impacts of the [c]ounty\u2019s changes by [English\u2019s] experts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">We agree with English that the expert witness fees that she requested were necessary in the evolving context of the litigation surrounding her Measure 37 claim. Accordingly, we agree with the trial court that English was entitled to the expert witness fees that she sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">In sum, although English is entitled to an award of attorney fees under ORS 197.352(6), the trial court erred in fixing that fee as one-third of the amount awarded in compensation judgment because, as of the time the court awarded fees, English was not liable to pay that amount. For that reason, although we affirm the trial court\u2019s award of expenses, costs, and other disbursements, which included expert witness fees, incurred in the underlying case and in litigating English\u2019s attorney fee petition, we reverse the award of attorney fees and remand to the trial court for reconsideration.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Supplemental judgment reversed and remanded for reconsideration of attorney fee award; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b43-7\"> As context for our discussion, Ballot Measure 37 (2004), which was enacted through the initiative process and codified as <em>former </em>ORS 197.352 (2005), <em>amended by </em>Oregon Laws 2007, chapter 424, section 4, <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 195.305 (2007), provided, in a nutshell, that public entities that enacted or enforced land use regulations that affected the fair market value of a claimant\u2019s property either had to pay just compensation or waive the offending regulations.
