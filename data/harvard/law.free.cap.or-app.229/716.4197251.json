In a petition for post-conviction relief, petitioner argued that his sentences, which included an upward departure sentence based on judicial factfinding, violated his right to a jury trial under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution as set forth in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000). The post-conviction court dismissed the petition as untimely and successive under ORS 138.550(3), and petitioner appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">On appeal, petitioner argues that the trial court erred in dismissing his petition because <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>apply retroactively on collateral review. Petitioner concedes that the Oregon Supreme Court has previously held to the contrary. <em>Miller v. Lampert, </em>340 Or 1, 125 P3d 1260 (2006) (adhering to its conclusion in <em>Page v. Palmateer, </em>336 Or 379, 84 P3d 133 (2004), that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively). Nonetheless, he contends that <em>Miller </em>was wrongly decided in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Danforth v. Minnesota, </em>552 US 264, 128 S Ct 1029, 169 L Ed 2d 859 (2008). In petitioner\u2019s view, <em>Danforth </em>specifically calls into question the reasoning in <em>Miller </em>and <em>Page. See Danforth, </em>128 S Ct at 1039 n 14 (describing the decision in <em>Page </em>as \u201cmisguided\u201d). Whatever the merits of petitioner\u2019s argument, it is properly addressed to the Oregon Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
