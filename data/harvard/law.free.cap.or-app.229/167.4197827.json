Plaintiff prevailed in the appeal and seeks attorney fees and costs under ORS 192.490(3). We deny the petition for attorney fees and allow costs in the amount of $520.98, to abide by the outcome on remand under ORAP 13.05(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Plaintiff was successful in obtaining a remand of a decision denying him access to defendant medical examiner\u2019s autopsy and laboratory test reports. We determined that the records were not exempt from disclosure by defendant under ORS 192.502(9)(a), which allows nondisclosure of records that are privileged or confidential under Oregon law. We remanded the case for further proceedings to determine whether another exemption to the obligation to disclose the records might apply. <em>Colby v. Gunson, </em>224 Or App 666, 199 P3d 350 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Plaintiff seeks an award of attorney fees and costs under ORS 192.490(3). That statute applies to suits filed under provisions of the Oregon Public Records Law and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">\u201cIf a person seeking the right to inspect or to receive a copy of a public record prevails in the suit, the person shall be awarded costs and disbursements and reasonable attorney fees at trial and on appeal. If the person prevails in part, the court may in its discretion award the person costs and disbursements and reasonable attorney fees at trial and on appeal, or an appropriate portion thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Plaintiff argues that he is entitled to attorney fees and costs under ORS 192.490(3) because he is a \u201cperson seeking the right to inspect\u201d public records, and he prevailed in the appeal. Defendant contends that the statutory reference to \u201cattorney fees\u201d includes only fees that are charged to a client under a contractual commitment between an attorney and client and not the value of the time invested in the case by a self-represented client. Our determination of the intended meaning of the term \u201cattorney fees\u201d in ORS 192.490(3) is governed by the method described in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>1143 (1993), as recently modified by <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009) (examination of the text and context of the statute, and legislative history of the enactment when that history appears useful to the court\u2019s analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">We recently decided whether a different attorney fee statute allowed an award of fees in similar circumstances. In <em>Anderson v. Wheeler, </em>214 Or App 318, 164 P3d 1194 (2007), a self-represented attorney sought fees under ORS 36.425(4)(b), which required the taxing of \u201creasonable attorney fees and costs * * * incurred\u201d by the successful party under the particulars of that case. We concluded that the fees were not \u201cincurred\u201d by the self-represented attorney because there was no liability to pay those fees. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">\u201cIn this case, the record does not show that plaintiff \u2018incurred\u2019 attorney fees in the ordinary sense of that term. The statement that plaintiff submitted shows, in some detail, the amount of time that he spent on various tasks in the course of the litigation. It also shows the value of that time, had the time been billed. But it also plainly states that all of plaintiffs time was, in fact, \u2018unbilled.\u2019 Plaintiff did not state in his affidavit that he was liable to pay any expenses for his own representation. On this record, therefore, there is simply no basis on which we could conclude that plaintiff was liable for the payment of any attorney fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\"><em>Anderson, </em>214 Or App at 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">ORS 192.409(3) does not require that the attorney fees be \u201cincurred.\u201d The statutory construction issue in this case, then, is whether the bare term \u201cattorney fees\u201d implies that same contractual dynamic\u2014a charge by an attorney that a separate entity is obligated to pay. We determine the legislative intent in the use of particular statutory wording by giving words their plain, natural, and ordinary meaning. <em>Haynes v. Tri-County Metro., </em>337 Or 659, 663, 103 P3d 101 (2004). In common parlance, \u201cattorney fee\u201d connotes a charge for an attorney\u2019s professional services. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>833 (unabridged ed 2002) defines \u201cfee\u201d to include \u201ccompensation often in the form of a fixed charge for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>professional service or for special and requested exercise of talent or of skill (as by an artist) (a doctor\u2019s ~) (a lawyer\u2019s retainer -).\u201d Similarly, <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>139 (8th ed 2004) defines \u201cattorney fee\u201d as \u201c[t]he charge to a client for services performed for the client, such as an hourly fee, a flat fee, or a contingent fee.\u201d A \u201ccharge,\u201d in turn, arises in a transaction between two persons. <em>Webster\u2019s </em>defines \u201ccharge\u201d to mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-4\">\u201c5 a: expenditure or incurred expenses diving at the ~ of his brothers as (1) payment of costs : money paid out (2) : a pecuniary liability (as rents or taxes) against property, a person, or an organization * * * b: the price demanded for a thing or service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-5\"><em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The ordinary meaning of \u201cattorney fee,\u201d then, is the price demanded by an attorney for services rendered to a separate client entity. We find nothing in the text or context of ORS 192.490(3) to suggest a different meaning for that statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties do not supply a legislative history of the statute indicating that an unordinary meaning was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Our understanding of the ordinary meaning of \u201cattorney fees\u201d is reinforced by decisions from other jurisdictions interpreting similarly worded attorney fee provisions in public records disclosure laws. For example, the District of Columbia\u2019s public records disclosure law provides that, \u201c[i]f a person seeking the right to inspect or to receive a copy of a public record prevails in whole or in part in such suit, he or she may be awarded reasonable attorney fees and other costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>of litigation.\u201d DC Code \u00a7 l-1527(c) (1992 Repl). In <em>McReady v. Dept. of Consumer &amp; Regulatory Affairs, </em>618 A2d 609, 612 (DC 1992), the court interpreted that statute and followed the federal rule that no fees could be awarded to a <em>pro se </em>litigant, citing the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Kay v. Ehrler, </em>499 US 432, 111 S Ct 1435, 113 L Ed 2d 486 (1991) (precluding awards of fees in section 1983 cases to persons who appear <em>pro se, </em>whether or not they are attorneys).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Similarly, an analogous Illinois fee provision in its public records disclosure law provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">\u201cIf a person seeking the right to inspect or receive a copy of a public record substantially prevails in a proceeding under this Section, the court may award such person reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees but only if the court finds that the record or records in question were of clearly significant interest to the general public and that the public body lacked any rational basis in law for withholding the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Ill Rev Stat 1987, ch 116, \u00b6 211(h), <em>renumbered as </em>5 ILCS 140/11. Illinois courts construe the statute to deny <em>pro se </em>attorney fees. The court said that \u201cthe most effective way to deter potential abusive fee generation is to deny fees to lawyers representing themselves. * * * [W]e hold that an attorney proceeding <em>pro se </em>in an action brought under the Illinois FOIA is not entitled to an award of fees under that statute.\u201d <em>Hamer v. Lentz, </em>132 Ill 2d 49, 62-63, 547 NE 2d 191 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">We conclude that the allowance of \u201cattorney fees\u201d by ORS 192.490(3) includes only a charge by an attorney that a separate entity is obligated to pay. It does not include the hypothetical compensation that a self-represented attorney might have been paid by another person. Plaintiff is not entitled to an award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">ORS 192.490(3) requires an award of costs and disbursements if plaintiff \u201cprevails in the suit.\u201d Plaintiff petitioned for costs for the appeal in the amount of $520.98. Defendant did not object to that amount. ORAP 13.05(4) states that, \u201c[w]hen a party prevails on appeal or on review and the case is remanded for further proceedings in which the party who ultimately will prevail remains to be determined, the court may allow costs to abide the outcome of the case.\u201d We award costs in the amount of $520.98, depending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>on whether plaintiff prevails in the inspection of public records in the case on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Petition for attorney fees denied; costs allowed in the amount of $520.98 to abide outcome on remand.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-8\"> ORS 20.075(2) sets out factors to be considered by a court in determining the amount of an attorney fee award when an award is authorized by statute. Those factors assume separate attorney and client entities. <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 20.075(2)(b) (\u201c[t]he likelihood, <em>if apparent to the client, </em>that the acceptance of the particular employment by the attorney would preclude the attorney from taking other cases\u201d (emphasis added)); ORS 20.075(2)(e) (\u201c[t]he time limitations <em>imposed by the client </em>or the circumstances of the case\u201d) (emphasis added); ORS 20.075(2)(f) (\u201c[t]he nature and length of the attorney\u2019s professional <em>relationship with the client\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). ORS 20.075(2) reinforces the conclusion that the ordinary meaning of \u201cattorney fee\u201d is a charge by an attorney that a separate entity is obligated to pay. In plaintiffs fee petition, applying the ORS 20.075(2) factors, he notes that the \u201cnature and length of the attorney's professional relationship with the client\u201d is \u201cvery tight.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
