Karp, </em>220 Or App 299, 185 P3d 553 (2008). In <em>Karp, </em>we affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions but remanded for resentencing. The state now contends that, in light of <em>Oregon v. Ice, </em>555 US_, 129 S Ct 711, 172 L Ed 2d 517 (2009), we erred in concluding that the imposition of consecutive sentences under ORS 137.123(5) requires findings by a jury rather than a judge. We agree and, accordingly, modify our opinion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AHE\">Reconsideration allowed; former disposition withdrawn; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified; affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
