It seeks review of an order of the Secretary of State assessing a civil penalty of $11,550 for petitioner\u2019s failure to report the value of the use of a large sign structure as a political contribution on its pre-election and post-election contribution and expenditure (C&amp;E) reports for the 2004 primary and general elections. We review the Secretary of State\u2019s order for substantial evidence and errors of law, ORS 183.482(8)(a), (c), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">We state the undisputed facts. Howard Dietrich owns land and a business on S.E. McLoughlin Boulevard in Portland. The property has two large double-sided sign structures on it. Both sign structures are maintained by a sign company. The parties refer to the signs as \u201cbillboards,\u201d although they are smaller in size than many billboards. Dietrich uses one of the billboards for his own business and personal purposes. Before and after the election, Dietrich displayed an American flag on one side of the sign and driving directions to his business on the other side. Dietrich supported Bernard\u2019s bid for election. He offered to post a \u201cJim Bernard for County Commissioner\u201d display on the American flag side of his personal use billboard. Petitioner welcomed the offer. Dietrich had a poster made, donated it to the campaign, and displayed it on the billboard during the primary and general election campaign seasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Just before the due date for the first pre-election C&amp;E report, petitioner\u2019s treasurer spoke with an Elections Division employee about how to report the committee\u2019s use of the billboard sign structure as a campaign contribution on the C&amp;E report. Based on that conversation, petitioner determined that it should report the value of the services to compose the poster or sign copy, but that it did not need to report the value of the use of the sign structure itself on the C&amp;E report. Petitioner reported as a contribution the $125 value of the artwork displayed on the billboard, but did not disclose any expenditure or in-kind contribution for the use of the billboard structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>In response to a formal complaint, the Elections Division investigated petitioner\u2019s C&amp;E reports for the 2004 primary and general elections and determined that petitioner\u2019s failure to report an in-kind contribution for the fair market value of the use of the billboard structure was a violation of the reporting requirements. The Elections Division notified petitioner that it should file an amended C&amp;E report reflecting the fair market value of the use of the billboard structure. Petitioner refused, explaining that the use of the billboard structure had no fair market value because Dietrich did not use it for commercial purposes and that, in any event, petitioner had followed the advice of an Elections Division employee in making its C&amp;E reports. The Elections Division issued a notice of a proposed civil penalty. After a contested case hearing, the Secretary of State determined that the donated use of the billboard structure was an in-kind contribution that had a fair market value that petitioner should have reported on its C&amp;E reports as a contribution and an expenditure. The Secretary of State\u2019s final order assessed a civil penalty of $11,550.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Petitioner seeks judicial review of that order and advances six assignments of error. Before addressing those claims, a review of the legal context of the dispute is in order. We recently examined the campaign contribution reporting requirements in <em>State v. Moyer, </em>225 Or App 81, 200 P3d 619, <em>rev allowed, </em>346 Or 157 (2009), and noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">\u201cORS 260.055(1) provides that all political candidates and treasurers for political committees must \u2018keep detailed accounts\u2019 of contributions received and expenditures made by or on behalf of the candidate or the political committee. At various points during an election cycle, the candidates and political committees are required to file statements of such contributions and expenditures with the appropriate \u2018filing officer.\u2019 <em>E.g., </em>ORS 260.058 (statements of candidates and principal campaign committees for elections other than general elections); ORS 260.063 (statements of political committees other than principal campaign committees for elections other than general elections); ORS 260.068 (statements of candidates and principal campaign committees for general elections); ORS 260.073 (statements of political committees other than principal campaign committees for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>general elections); ORS 260.076 (statements of legislative officials or candidates for legislative office).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">\u201cAny contribution from a person or campaign committee \u2018that contributed an aggregate amount of more than $50\u2019 must be listed in the statement individually, along with the contributor\u2019s name, address, and occupation. ORS 260.083(l)(a). \u2018The statement may list as a single item the total amount of other contributions, but shall specify how those contributions were obtained.\u2019 <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">\u201cThe filing officer is required to review the statements of contributions and expenditures and notify candidates or committees who have failed to file statements as required or who have failed to file statements that comply with all statutory requirements. ORS 260.205; ORS 260.215. Failure to file a proper statement of contributions and expenditures can lead to a court order compelling such a proper filing, ORS 260.225(1); imposition of civil penalties, ORS 260.232; and removal of the candidate or measure from the ballot, ORS 260.241(2).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">225 Or App at 86.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">In its first, second, and fifth assignments of error, petitioner asserts that several of the Secretary of State\u2019s findings in the order under review are not supported by substantial evidence. ORS 183.482(8)(c) requires that we set aside an agency order in a contested case if we determine \u201cthat the order is not supported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence exists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d ORS 183.482(7) cautions that a reviewing court \u201cshall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to any issue of fact or agency discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Petitioner challenges a finding that it contends incorrectly implies that Dietrich did not have full ownership and control of the billboard. Although the finding itself is ambiguous in part, there is no dispute that Dietrich had full control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>of the billboard copy and use of the billboard structure. The Secretary of State\u2019s finding that Dietrich\u2019s relationship with the sign company \u201callows Mr. Dietrich to put whatever he wishes on the billboard\u201d is the dispositive finding for purposes of this dispute. Petitioner also challenges the Secretary of State\u2019s findings that the billboard is similar in size to billboards in the area that are commercially leased for advertising and that the fair rental value of the billboard is $1,500 per month, when it is in fact smaller. Based on a review of the entire record, in light of countervailing as well as supporting evidence, we conclude that the disputed findings are supported by substantial evidence in the whole record. <em>See Garcia v. Boise Cascade Corp., </em>309 Or 292, 295, 787 P2d 884 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">In its third assignment of error, petitioner contends that the Secretary of State erred in treating Dietrich\u2019s use of his own billboard structure in support of Bernard\u2019s campaign as an in-kind contribution. Petitioner argues the use of the sign structure is not a \u201cthing of value\u201d under the relevant definition of \u201ccontribution,\u201d because the sign structure is not otherwise put to commercial use.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">For purposes of the election campaign finance statutes, ORS 260.005(3)(a)(A) defines a \u201ccontribution\u201d as \u201c[t]he payment, loan, gift, forgiving of indebtedness, or furnishing without equivalent compensation or consideration, of money, services other than personal services for which no compensation is asked or given, supplies, equipment or any other thing of value.\u201d At the relevant time, the Secretary of State\u2019s <em>2004 Campaign Finance Manual </em>set forth the procedures and guidelines for compliance with the campaign finance laws. OAR 165-012-0005. The manual requires the reporting of \u201cin-kind\u201d contributions, and defines those contributions as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">\u201c[a] good or service, other than money, having monetary value. The value of this contribution is based on the fair market value of the good or service!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">There is no dispute that, if the use of the billboard is properly treated as a campaign contribution, it is subject to reporting as an \u201cin-kind\u201d contribution. The question is whether, when Dietrich posted a display on his billboard in support of Bernard\u2019s candidacy, he made a contribution to the campaign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>by \u201cfurnishing\u201d a \u201cthing of value\u201d within the meaning of the statute and the manual.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">We reject petitioner\u2019s suggestion that, because Dietrich chose not to lease out his billboard structure, it had no fair market value. Fair market value is an objective concept, representing the price that a hypothetical willing buyer would pay a hypothetical willing seller. <em>See PGF Care Center, Inc. v. Wolfe, </em>208 Or App 145, 153, 144 P3d 983 (2006); <em>Tofte and Tofte, </em>134 Or App 449, 457, 895 P2d 1387 (1995). Dietrich\u2019s personal decision not to lease the billboard is not relevant. In order to establish a fair market value of the use of the billboard space, the Elections Division needed only to establish that there was a market for billboard space and that there was a price in that market that a hypothetical willing buyer would pay a hypothetical willing seller. As previously held, substantial evidence supports the Secretary of State\u2019s findings as to both of those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The remaining question is whether, in applying the campaign message to the billboard, Dietrich \u201cfurnished\u201d a thing of value to the campaign. We agree with the secretary\u2019s conclusion that he did. The statute does not define the term \u201cfurnishing.\u201d To \u201cfurnish\u201d means \u201cto make a gift of (something needed or desirable) : CONTRIBUTE!.]\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>923 (unabridged ed 2002). It is undisputed that Dietrich commissioned the sign copy. He donated that artwork to the campaign. Petitioner reported the value of the poster on its C&amp;E reports as an in-kind contribution. Dietrich then displayed the poster on his own billboard. In light of the facts that the poster itself had been donated to petitioner, and in light of our conclusion that substantial evidence supports the secretary\u2019s finding that the billboard space has a fair market value, we conclude that Dietrich \u201cfurnished\u201d to the campaign the use of the billboard on which to display the poster. Thus, he made an in-kind contribution to the campaign that should have been reported on the C&amp;E reports. We conclude that substantial evidence supports the Secretary of State\u2019s finding that the use of the billboard structure had monetary value, and we conclude therefore that it was a \u201cthing of value,\u201d as provided in the ORS 260.005(3)(a)(A) definition of \u201ccontribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>In its fourth assignment of error, petitioner contends that Dietrich\u2019s use of his own billboard for political expression is protected speech and that the free speech protections of the state and federal constitutions therefore require that any rules governing the reporting of campaign contributions be strictly and narrowly construed so as not to place an unnecessary burden on the exercise of speech. When so construed, petitioner contends, the statutes and rules governing campaign contributions must not recognize as an in-kind campaign contribution a citizen\u2019s display of a political statement on his or her own property.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">We reject petitioner\u2019s contention that our construction of the meaning of \u201ccontribution\u201d under ORS 260.005(3)(a)(A) places an unnecessary burden on Dietrich\u2019s speech. The requirement that the campaign report Dietrich\u2019s contribution does not burden his speech at all. After all, it is not the value of Dietrich\u2019s support for Bernard that is required to be reported, but the value of the donated medium of communication\u2014the rental value of the sign structure. In <em>Moyer, </em>we distinguished between regulations of campaign contributions themselves and regulations \u201csuch as disclosure requirements\u201d that are \u201cdistinct from contribution or expenditure limitations\u201d and that do not offend constitutional speech protections \u201cunless they are overbroad.\u201d 225 Or App at 90 (quoting <em>Vannatta v. Keisling, </em>324 Or 514, 523, 931 P2d 770 (1997)). Petitioner makes no claim of overbreadth. We also reject without discussion petitioner\u2019s equal privileges and immunities and equal protection arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-9\"> Unless noted otherwise, all references to ORS chapter 260 in this opinion are to the 2003 version of the chapter, which is the version that applies in this case.
