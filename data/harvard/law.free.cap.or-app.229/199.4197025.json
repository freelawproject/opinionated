J.</author>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction for one count of criminal mistreatment in the second degree, ORS 163.200(l)(a), assigning error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion for a judgment of acquittal (MJOA). Defendant asserts that the state failed to present legally sufficient evidence that she \u201cwith[held] necessary and adequate * * * physical care or medical attention\u201d from the victim. <em>Id. </em>As explained below, we conclude that defendant\u2019s conduct in moving the victim to the home of her friend without the victim\u2019s prescription medications constituted \u201cwithhold[ing] necessary and adequate * * * medical attention\u201d within the meaning of the criminal mistreatment statute because it precluded the victim from receiving those medications at the prescribed time. Consequently, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">We review the denial of an MJOA to determine whether, after viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the state, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>320 Or 47, 63, 880 P2d 431 (1994), <em>cert den, </em>514 US 1005 (1995). Although defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s evidence, we consider the whole record to determine whether there is sufficient corroborative evidence. <em>See State v. Lamphere, </em>233 Or 330, 332, 378 P2d 706 (1963) (when error is assigned to the denial of an MJOA, appellate courts consider the whole record to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support a conviction). Consistently with that standard of review, the operative facts are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">In May 2000, Willy Lackey contacted his nephews, Ray and Mark Lackey, and requested that they help care for him because he was elderly and could no longer live alone.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Willy suffered from congestive heart failure, blood pressure problems, depression, anxiety, and prostate cancer, and was experiencing signs of early dementia. Willy also had chronic edema\u2014retention of fluids and swelling\u2014in his lower <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>extremities. The nephews moved Willy from Montana to Mark\u2019s house in Redmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">In August 2000, Willy was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and his physician referred him to hospice for care. In September 2000, Mark hired defendant as Willy\u2019s caregiver. Shortly thereafter, defendant moved into Mark\u2019s home to provide Willy with 24-hour care.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Defendant was responsible for, among other duties, administering Willy\u2019s medications. Willy took two diuretics to remove extra fluids\u2014one in the morning and one twice a day\u2014plus a blood pressure or heart medication once a day. Willy also took two \u201cp.r.n.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (as necessary) medications: an antianxiety medication and morphine. The morphine was prescribed for Willy\u2019s \u201cpain from his cancer\u201d and \u201cdecrease[d] the work that [Willy\u2019s] heart ha[d] to do in congestive heart failure.\u201d Willy was on morphine, which could be dispensed up to once every hour, \u201cmultiple times a day.\u201d Although Willy\u2019s mobility was impaired and he could not leave the house independently, he was lucid and able to communicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In December 2000, defendant began to have problems and disagreements with Mark regarding Willy\u2019s care. Those disagreements culminated in an incident in January 2001 in which Willy became upset and unhappy with Mark and sided with defendant. Sometime thereafter, Willy began expressing a strong desire to return to Montana. Defendant, along with Brookshire, a high school friend of Mark\u2019s, made a plan to take Willy back to Montana. Brookshire purchased a motor home for the trip in late January.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Willy\u2019s family was not informed of that plan. Although hospice nurses were aware that Willy wanted to go to Montana and had discussed options with Willy, defendant did not involve hospice in her plan. Willy\u2019s physician also was not informed of defendant\u2019s plan and testified at trial that it would not have been in Willy\u2019s best interests to travel to Montana without first checking in with either the physician or hospice.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>On the morning of January 31, 2001, defendant moved Willy to the home of a friend, Harvey, where defendant was renting an additional room. Defendant then went to the bank where Willy had a joint checking account with his nephews. Defendant attempted to close out the account, using a power of attorney that defendant had helped Willy execute in her favor. Defendant informed the bank teller that Willy wanted to go to Montana and that she was withdrawing the funds for that purpose. The teller became <em>\u201ca </em>little nervous\u201d and, after speaking to her supervisor, informed defendant that it would take some time before she could give defendant the funds. The teller then called Mark, who notified Ray about the situation, and Ray called the police to report that Willy was possibly being \u201ckidnapped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Redmond Police Officer Dickson, joined by another officer, Ludwig, went to Harvey\u2019s home to investigate the possible kidnapping. Upon their arrival, defendant informed the officers that she was caring for Willy, that Willy was there at the home with her, and that he was fine. Defendant led the officers to a back bedroom, where Willy was sitting on the bed. Willy was smiling and in \u201cgood spirits,\u201d but, consistently with his chronic edema, his lower extremities were swollen. Ludwig then asked defendant to step out of the bedroom and into the living room, while Dickson stayed with Willy to question him alone. Willy was alert and able to answer Dickson\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">At some point during Ludwig\u2019s questioning of defendant in the living room, she abruptly turned and, hurriedly, walked into the back bedroom where Dickson was questioning Willy. The officers repeatedly ordered defendant to leave the bedroom, but she refused and became uncooperative. The officers ultimately arrested defendant for resisting arrest and interfering with a police officer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">After defendant\u2019s arrest, the officers contacted Oregon Senior and Disabled Services (SDS). Lockridge, an Adult Protective Services investigator from SDS, arrived to find Willy in good spirits. At some point, Willy informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Lockridge that he needed to have his medications. Lockridge searched the house, the motor home, and defendant\u2019s car for Willy\u2019s medications, but could not find them. Neither the officers nor Lockridge attempted to ask defendant if Willy\u2019s medications were in any of those locations. Willy also informed Dickson that he needed some medications \u201cat that time.\u201d Dickson believed that \u2018Willy was apparently overdue on medication and should have had some.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Lockridge then called hospice, and hospice sent a nurse, Schwing, to Harvey\u2019s residence to assist in Willy\u2019s care. When Schwing arrived, Willy was lying down in the back bedroom and was \u201cclear,\u201d \u201clucid,\u201d \u201cknew where he was,\u201d and \u201cknew what the plan was.\u201d Schwing called pharmacies and obtained refills of all of Willy\u2019s medications and arranged transportation for Willy to a nearby care center.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The next day, police seized defendant\u2019s car and the motor home pursuant to a warrant and later searched them, but they found no medications. Based on those events, a grand jury charged defendant with, <em>inter alia, </em>criminal mistreatment in the second degree,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ORS 163.200(l)(a) (Count 4). That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">\u201cA person commits the crime of criminal mistreatment in the second degree if, with criminal negligence and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">\u201c(a) In violation of a legal duty to provide care for another person, the person withholds necessary and adequate * * * physical care or medical attention from that person!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Criminal negligence, in turn, is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">\u201c \u2018Criminal negligence\u2019 or \u2018criminally negligent,\u2019 when used with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense, means that a person fails to be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that the failure to be aware of it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">ORS 161.085(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">As relevant here, the indictment alleged that defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">\u201cdid, with criminal negligence and in violation of a legal duty to provide care for WILLIAM LACKEY, unlawfully withhold necessary physical or medical attention from said WILLIAM LACKEY.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">At the close of the state\u2019s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal with respect to Count 4.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant did not challenge the sufficiency of the state\u2019s proof with respect to the requisite \u201ccriminally negligent\u201d mental state. Rather, defendant argued solely that the state had failed to establish that defendant had \u201cwith[held] necessary and adequate * * * physical care or medical attention\u201d from Willy. ORS 163.200(l)(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">The state countered that, based on evidence of the events of January 31, defendant was culpable in either of two ways. <em>First, </em>the state contended that defendant had violated the statute by undertaking to move Willy to Montana without first taking the proper medical steps, including obtaining the advice and involvement of either hospice or his doctor. <em>Second, </em>the state contended that, because none of Willy\u2019s prescribed medications could be found inside Harvey\u2019s home, the motor home, or defendant\u2019s car, defendant had withheld necessary and adequate physical care or medical attention because Willy did not have his medications on site and \u201c[t]hose items were necessary for Willyt\u2019s] * * * care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Defendant responded that she \u201cwas never in a position to provide or withhold * * * the medications after she was taken into custody\u201d and, because the officers never asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>her about medications, she did not have the opportunity to inform them where the medications were. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s MJOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Subsequently, during the defense case, defendant testified that Willy\u2019s medications were present on site but that they had fallen between the bed and the oxygen condenser during her altercation with police officers. Defendant introduced as evidence medications that she contended she had found in that location four days later when she had returned to Harvey\u2019s residence upon being released from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">During closing arguments, counsel for defendant argued that the medications were on site but that Lockridge and Dickson did not find them because they conducted only a \u201ccursory search\u201d of Harvey\u2019s home. Counsel further argued that, if someone had only asked defendant where the medications were, she could have told them where she had seen them last. The jury ultimately returned a guilty verdict on the second-degree criminal mistreatment count.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying her MJOA on Count 4, reiterating that the state failed to prove that defendant \u201cwithlheld] necessary and adequate * * * physical care or medical attention.\u201d As explained below, we conclude that the state presented legally sufficient evidence that defendant\u2019s conduct effected a withholding of \u201cnecessary and adequate * * * medical attention\u201d from Willy. Specifically, other care providers were not able to administer medications, as prescribed, because of defendant\u2019s criminally negligent failure to have those medications readily available.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">As noted, ORS 163.200(l)(a) provides that a person commits the crime of second-degree criminal mistreatment if the person, \u201cwith criminal negligence,\u201d and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\u201c[i]n violation of a legal duty to provide care for another person, * * * withholds necessary and adequate * * * medical attention from that person[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">We previously construed the phrase \u201cwithholds necessary and adequate * * * medical attention\u201d in <em>State v. Bordeaux, </em>220 Or App 165, 185 P3d 524 (2008). In <em>Bordeaux, </em>the issue was whether the defendant\u2019s conduct in lying to emergency room personnel about the cause of his son\u2019s injuries\u2014namely, that they had been inflicted by the defendant\u2014constituted \u201cwithholding] necessary and adequate * * * medical attention\u201d within the meaning of the first-degree criminal mistreatment statute, ORS 163.205(l)(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 220 Or App at 167. We concluded that, because a construction of the statute criminalizing such conduct would essentially require a person to confess to one crime (criminal mistreatment for causing physical injury) to avoid being guilty of another (criminal mistreatment for withholding medical attention), the legislature did not intend the statute to encompass the failure to disclose to medical personnel inculpatory information about the cause of a child\u2019s injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 175-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Although our interpretation and application of ORS 163.205(l)(a) in <em>Bordeaux </em>ultimately pertained to the particular\u2014and, indeed, somewhat idiosyncratic\u2014circumstances presented there, our discussion of the operative statutory terms \u201cmedical attention\u201d and \u201cwithholds\u201d informs our analysis in this case. Although we did not determine the ultimate contours of the term \u201cmedical attention\u201d in <em>Bordeaux, </em>implicit in our analysis was that that term encompasses at least \u201cmedical care.\u201d <em>See generally </em>220 Or App at 172-73. As pertinent to the circumstances of this case, the administration of prescription medication is \u201cmedical care\u201d and, thus, constitutes \u201cmedical attention\u201d for purposes of ORS 163.200(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>In <em>Bordeaux, </em>we also addressed the meaning of \u201cwithhold\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\">\u201c \u2018Withhold\u2019 is defined in pertinent part to mean, T: hold back : keep from action : CHECK, RESTRAIN * * * 2: to desist or refrain from granting, giving or allowing: keep in one\u2019s possession or control : keep back * * <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2627 (unabridged ed 2002).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">220 Or App at 171 (omissions in <em>Bordeaux-, </em>boldface in <em>Webster\u2019s). </em>Consistently with that definition, and subject to the \u201cprovision of self-inculpatory information\u201d exception adopted in <em>Bordeaux, </em>an operative \u201cwithholding]\u201d occurs when the defendant\u2014a person with a \u201clegal duty to provide care,\u201d ORS 163.200(l)(a)\u2014has engaged in conduct that prevents the victim from actually receiving necessary and adequate medical attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">We return to the evidence in this case, again viewed most favorably to the state. Based on that evidence, a jury could find that defendant failed to have Willy\u2019s prescription medications readily available for administration as required. Notwithstanding extensive efforts by Lockridge, the SDS investigator, and, later, by police officers, none of Willy\u2019s medications was ever found in Harvey\u2019s home, the motor home, or in defendant\u2019s car. The jury could further find that, at a time when the medications were not available on site, an actual need for administration of Willy\u2019s prescription medications arose. Willy informed Lockridge that he needed to have his medications and informed Dickson that \u201csome medications were needed at that time.\u201d Dickson testified that \u2018Willy was apparently overdue on medication and should have had some.\u201d Finally, the jury could find that, because of defendant\u2019s criminally negligent failure to have Willy\u2019s prescribed medications readily available on site, Willy was unable to receive his prescription medications as required.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Defendant argues nevertheless that she cannot be liable for \u201cwithholding\u201d under the statute because she had been arrested and the officers never asked where the drugs were.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s argument misses the mark. The premise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>of defendant\u2019s contention is that the, medications were on site\u2014and that, if she had been asked, she could have informed the officers where they were. However, as noted, the state presented evidence from which the jury could find that the medications were not, in fact, present in Harvey\u2019s residence or readily available nearby (viz., in defendant\u2019s car or the motor home). Thus, the fact that the officers did not ask defendant where the medications were is immaterial. Defendant\u2019s predicate conduct in failing to have the medications readily available so that they could be administered when actually required effected the operative withholding.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\"> To avoid confusion, we refer to Willy, Mark, and Ray Lackey by their first names.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\"> A \u201cp.r.n.\u201d <em>(pro re nata) </em>medication is taken \u201cas the occasion arises; when necessary.\u201d <em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary </em>1445 (27th ed 2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\"> That conduct was charged and tried separately from the charge at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b236-10\"> Defendant was also charged with four counts of first-degree criminal mistreatment (Counts 1 to 3 and 8), three counts of first-degree theft (Counts 5 to 7), and one count of second-degree theft (Count 9).

Again, defendant\u2019s consistent position was that the medications were on site, but that Lockridge and the officers failed to locate them because they engaged in merely a \u201ccursory search\u201d of Harvey\u2019s residence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
