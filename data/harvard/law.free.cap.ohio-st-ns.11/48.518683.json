Held, that it was an implied stipulation of the contract, that said boilers should be free from all such defects of material and workmanship, whether latent or otherwise, as would render them unfit for the usual purposes of such boilers.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-6\">Error to the superior court of Cincinnati.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-7\">The plaintiffs in error, who were also plaintiffs below, by their petition in the original action allege, that about the 1st of September, 1853, the plaintiffs and defendants entered into an agreement by which the defendants, in consideration of the plaintiffs having agreed to pay a reasonable price therefor, undertook and agreed to manufacture and make for the plaintiffs, in a reasonable time, and out of good and suitable materials, three steam boilers (of certain dimensions, particularly specified), to be made of good boiler iron, one fourth of an inch thick, to be used in plaintiffs rolling mills, in Ironton, Lawrence county, Ohio.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-8\">They further say that defendants made said boilers, of the dimensions agreed upon, and delivered them to the plaintiffs, in Cincinnati, about the 1st of January, 1854, and that plaintiffs paid defendants the amount charged therefor, viz : $1,415, but they say that said boilers were not made of good and suitable materials, but of poor boiler iron, totally unfit and improper to be used in the manufacture of boilers, and that in consequence of such defect in the material, and of unskillfulness in their manufacture, the said boilers, after being set up and used by the plaintiffs for about one month, in their mills, became leaky, their joints separated, and they became and were totally useless, and had to be thrown aside, etc., and for this breach of contract they claimed damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-9\">The defendants, by their answer, do not deny the terms of the contract as stated in the petition; admit the making and delivery of the boilers; and aver that they were made of good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>and suitable materials, fit and proper to be used in the manufacture of boilers; that said boilers were well and faithfully put together, and made without defect either in the workmanship or materials.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-5\">The case was tried, upon submission of the issues joined' to a jury, and evidence was offered by the plaintiffs tending to prove that they made a contract with the defendants, for a stipulated price, for three steam boilers, to place in plaintiffs\u2019 rolling mill at Ironton; that the boilers were made, etc., and upon trial were found to be leaky, and worthless, and that they were made of defective iron. Defendants offered evidence tending to prove that the boilers were well made, and of good materials; and that if the iron was defective, such defects were inherent defects that could not be discovered by the most careful examination of the material while being manufactured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-6\">The plaintiffs thereupon asked the court to charge the jury,, that \u201c if they were satisfied that the defendants engaged, for a reasonable or valid consideration, to build them three boilers, to run the engines for their rolling mill, and agreed to build them, they, the defendants, impliedly agreed that the boilem should be built of good materials, and good workmanship, so as to answer the usual purposes of such boilers.\u201d This charge the court refused to give, but did charge the jury on that subject as follows: \u201cWhen an article is ordered from the manufacturer, and the purpose for which it is intended is known to both parties, there is an implied agreement on the part of the manufacturer that it is suited to the purpose, and if it proves defective in workmanship or material, the manufacturer will be responsible for all the legal consequences. Provided, however, that the defect in the material was known to the manufacturer at the time he supplied the article, or he could have discovered it by the use of the ordinary means by which such defects could be discovered by skillful workmen. That the manufacturer is not the absolute insurer of the quality of the materials used; he is bound to select the proper materials, and exercise the best skill, which should be competent skill, for the purpose of discovering any defect in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>material; and, if after careful examination, and the aid of all the appropriate means, he can not discover any defect, he has performed his duty. Any hidden, accidental defect, will not impose a liability on the manufacturer to respond in damages.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-5\">The plaintiffs excepted to the refusal of the court to charge as requested, and also to the charge as given; and a verdict having been rendered for the defendants, judgment was entered thereon, and affirmed by the court, upon error, at the general term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-6\">Plaintiffs now seek to reverse this judgment of affirmance, on the alleged ground of error in the charge of the court, and in refusing to charge as requested.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-7\"><em>Fox &amp; Fox </em>for plaintiffs, argued\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-8\">1. That the law implies, on the facts supposed in the instructions asked, a warranty that the article is fit for the purpose for which it was bought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-9\">2. If such a warranty is implied, then it is immaterial from what cause the defect arises, if the boilers are defective, either in material or workmanship, the warranty is broken, and the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-10\">3. If the thing is defective, and the warranty therefore broken, it is immaterial whether it was from a <em>secret </em>defect or not; on the contrary, if we are governed by analogy, the very fact, that the defect was secret and could not be discovered, is the reason why the purchaser has a right to rely upon his warranty, as in the case of the warranty of a horse, if the defects are hidden, the warranty is good because they are hidden ; if the defects are palpable to every one, the warranty does not cover them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-11\">We refer the court to the following authorities, which, we think, fully sustain these positions: <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Bright, </em>5 Bing 533; Story on Contracts, secs. 835, 837; 4 Barn. &amp; Cress. 108; 9 Wend. 28; <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Hoevy, </em>23 Wend. 351; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Edginton, </em>2 Man. &amp; Gra. 279 (110 E. C. L. 371); <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Pyber, </em>3 Man. &amp; Gra. 867 (42 E. C. L. <em>452); Walton </em>v. <em>Cody, </em>1 Wisconsin Rep. 430; <em>Gatey </em>v. <em>Bountree, </em>2 Chandler, 38; 3 E. D. Smith, 58; <em>Brenton v. Davis, </em>8 Blackf. 317; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>20 Conn. 271; 27 Verm. 230; 3 Kernan, 24; <em>Budd </em>v. <em>Faermiance, </em>8 Bing. 440; <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Waring, </em>9 Wend. 28.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-5\">The court, therefore ought to have given the charge as asked, for it is founded upon the well settled cases in the books.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-6\">But, we claim the court equally erred in the charge which was given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-7\">If the law implies a warranty, it is certainly very clear that it is immaterial whether the defendants did or did not know of the defect. That question might be very important in an action on the case for deceit; but has no application when applied to a contract of warranty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-8\">We claim, the manufacturer is an insurer of the quality of the materials, as much as he is the insurer of the workmanship, as we think the above authorities show.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-9\">If the action had been brought against the party for deceit, or if he could only be made liable on the ground of negligence, the charge would not be objectionable; but the court has entirely misconceived the foundation of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, when it applies the same law to a case of contract, which would have applied to a case of negligence or deceit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-10\">The only claim of the plaintiffs, was on the contract of warranty. They did not claim the defendants were guilty of personal neglect, or of deceit. If there was no implied warranty, the plaintiffs had no case, and the defendants ought to have demurred. But if the law implies a warranty in such case, then it was perfectly immaterial whether the defendants did or did not know of the defect, and by putting such an issue to the jury the latter were misled. No such issue was raised in the pleadings, and no such question should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-11\">Again: the charge directs the jury, that the defendants are not liable for any hidden defect. This part of the charge overrules the whole law of warranty. For, if there is any efficacy in a warranty at all, it is the protection afforded against hidden defect. We claim, therefore, the judgment ought to be reversed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b60-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number><em>Taft &amp; Perry </em>for defendants, argued\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-6\">That where a manufacturer of steam boilers contracts to-build three boilers for a rolling mill, he is \u201cbound to furnish a good article; provided, however, that the defect in the material was known to the manufacturer at the time he supplied the article, or he could have discovered it by the use of the ordinary means by which such defects could be discovered by skillful workmen. That the manufacturer is not the absolute insurer of the quality of the materials used; he is bound to select the proper materials, and exercise the best skill (which should be competent skill) for the purpose of discovering any defect in the material; and, if after careful examination and the aid of all the appropriate means, he can not discover any defect, he has performed his duty. Any hidden, accidental defect will not impose a liability on the manufacturer to respond in damages.\u201d 1 Parsons on Contracts, 460; <em>Bluett </em>v. Osborne, 1 Starkie, N. P. C. 384, referred to in Story on Contracts, p. 715, note 1; <em>Hart </em>v. Wright, 17 Wend. 267, 18 Wend. 449; <em>Gihon </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>2 Duer Rep. 176; <em>Moses </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>1 Denio, 378; <em>Hargous </em>v. <em>Stone, 1 </em>Selden, 73; <em>Beirne </em>v. <em>Dodd, </em>1 Selden, 95; <em>Hotchkiss </em>v. <em>Gage, </em>26 Barb. 141; <em>Kirk </em>v. <em>Nice, </em>2 Watts, 367.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-7\">We find no cases in Ohio bearing on the point. We think the tendency of modern decisions is to hold the old common law rule, <em>caveat emptor, </em>without exception, when there is no express warranty, and no fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-8\">There was nothing in the contract between these parties indicating anything peculiar in the purpose to which the boilers were to be \u00e1pplied. That they were to be used in a rolling mill, was no specific and peculiar use, calling for, or implying, as between these parties, any special qualities in the-boilers. They were to be boilers of stipulated dimensions and form, all which was complied with as stated by the petition. It seems to us that the court stated the law correctly.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b60-9\">Scott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayr\">No issue seems to have been raised by the pleadings in this case, in regard to the terms and stipulations, whether express or implied, of the contract on which suit was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>brought. The defendants, by not denying, admitted the contract to be as claimed by the plaintiffs; and any evidence on that subject was outside of the issue. If the boilers were proved, to the satisfaction of the jury, to be defective, as claimed by the plaintiffs, they would have been entitled to a verdict in their favor. But the plaintiffs themselves offered evidence in relation to the terms of the contract, without requiring an amendment of the answer, and asked to have the jury instructed as to its implied stipulations, and having thus, in fact, submitted an issue not presented by the pleadings, they would have no right to complain, if the law governing that subject was correctly given in charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">We proceed, then, to the consideration of the question, whether the court below erred in refusing to give the instruction asked, and in the instructions actually given.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The general rule of the common law undoubtedly is, that upon an executed sale of specific goods, the vendor will not be held liable for any defects in the quality of the articles sold, in the absence of fraud, or express warranty. Where the purchaser is not deceived by any fraudulent representations, and demands no warranty, the law presumes that he depends on his own judgment, in the transaction, and applies the maxim \u201c <em>caveat </em>emptor.\u201d But to this general rule the requirements of manifest justice have introduced sundry exceptions, of which some are as well settled as the rule itself, while as to others, the authorities can not be easily reconciled. We do'not propose an investigation of the subject further than is demanded by the case before us. The principal, if not the sole exceptions to the rule, are found in cases where it is evident that the purchaser did not rely on his own judgment of the quality of the article purchased; the circumstances showing that no examination was possible on his part, or the contract being such as to show that the obligation and responsibility of ascertaining and judging of the quality was thrawn upon the vendor, as where he agrees to furnish an article for a particular purpose or use. Thus, it is said by Mr. Story, \u201c when an examination of goods is, from their nature or situation at the time of the sale, impracticable, a war <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>ranty will be implied that they are merchantable. Thus, if goods be at sea, or not arrived; or if they fill the hold of a ship so that nothing but the surface can be seen; or if they be in bales, so that an examination of the center can not be made without tearing each bale to pieces; the seller will be understood to warrant them merchantable, and of the quality demanded and expected by the buyers.\u201d Story on Contracts, sec. 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">It is true that the warranty of merchantable quality has, in several cases, been held to be limited to cases where the examination is impracticable, and not merely inconvenient. <em>Hyatt </em>v. <em>Boyle, </em>5 Gill &amp; Johns. 110; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>17 Wend. 267. So also the implication of warranty is said not to extend to cases where an examination, though practicable, would be fruitless, on account of the latent character of the defects; but only to those cases in which there can be no examination. 1 Parsons on Contracts, 466. The same writer, however, says : \u201c One exception to the rule of caveat emptor springs from the rule itself. For a requirement that the purchaser should \u2018 beware,\u2019 or should take care to ascertain for himself the quality of the thing he buys, becomes utterly unreasonable, under circumstances which make such care impossible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The vendor\u2019s liability on an implied warranty, in the case of articles sold for a particular purpose, is illustrated by the cases of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Bright, </em>5 Bingham, 533; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Edgington, </em>2 M. &amp; G. 279; <em>Beals </em>v. <em>Olmstead, </em>24 Vermont, 114; <em>Brenton </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>8 Blackford, 317. Other cases have imposed proper limitations on this doctrine, as in the cases of <em>Chanter </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>4 M. &amp; W. 399, and <em>Olivant </em>v. <em>Bayley, </em>5 Q. B. 288. In these cases it was held that where a \u201c known and ascertained article \u201d is ordered and furnished, though intended for a particular use, the liability of the maker and vendor extends only to defects in the materials and workmanship, and not to such as arise from the principle or mode of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">With respect to the doctrine that a sale made for a particular purpose, implies a warranty that the thing sold shall be fit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>for that purpose, it is said in 1 Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, 250, that \u201c the sounder view seems to be that no engagement of this sort 'can be implied against the vendor, save where the contract is partially or wholly <em>executory; </em>and that, in this case it is not in the nature of a warranty but of an implied stipulation, forming part of the substance of the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">And a marked distinction will be found to pervade all the authorities, between an <em>executed </em>sale, where the property passes <em>in presenti, </em>and an <em>executory </em>contract for the delivery on a future day, of an article not specifically defined or selected at the time. In the latter case, it makes no difference whether the vendor have an article of the kind \u2022 on hand, or it is afterward to be procured or manufactured. In neither case can the promisee be compelled to rest satisfied with an inferior article. Though, in the absence of express stipulation, he can not insist that the article shall be of any special degree of fineness, yet he has a right to insist that it shall be of medium quality or goodness, free from such defects as would render it unmerchantable, or unfit for the purpose for which it is ordinarily used. <em>Howard </em>v. Hoey, 23 Wend. 351; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Sayles, </em>27 Vermont, 227; Story on Contracts, sec. 834; Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 614. The doctrine is thus stated by the writer last referred to : \u201c Where an agreement is for a specific chattel -in its <em>then state, </em>there is no implied warranty of its fitness or merchantable quality; but if a person is employed to <em>make </em>a specific chattel, there the law implies a contract on his part, that it shall be fit for the purpose for which it is ordinarily used.\u201d Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">It but remains to apply the principles of these authorities to the case under review. The contract sued upon was <em>executory </em>in its character. It was for the making and delivery to the plaintiffs, at a future day, of three steam boilers, to be used in running the engines of their rolling mill. It must be clear that the rule of <em>caveat emptor </em>can apply in no such case, whether the contract be made with a manufacturer, or other person; for the purchaser <em>can </em>exercise no judgment in regard to the quality of a thing not <em>in esse, </em>or which is indeter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>m\u00ednate, and to be thereafter selected or procured by the exercise of the vendor\u2019s sole judgment, discretion and will. Any rule must be unreasonable which would impute to a purchaser an intention to rely on his own judgment as to the quality of an article, where the circumstances of the case render it simply impossible for him to exercise any judgment whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">This is, perhaps, not the case of an article agreed to be furnished for a special purpose. It does not appear that the plaintiffs\u2019 mills required boilers of a peculiar quality, and that this was known to the defendants. But they did know that the boilers were intended to be used for the purpose to which they are ordinarily applied; that is, to the generation of steam, to be used as a motive power; and they contracted to build them with reference to this their usual purpose and use. Whether they were large enough to generate sufficient power for the use of the plaintiffs\u2019 mills, at Ironton, was a question upon which the plaintiffs might judge for themselves. They did so, and specified the dimensions ; and for any defect in their judgment the defendants are not liable. But the selection and procuring of the materials, and the manufacture of the boilers, the defendants took upon themselves, and over their action in these matters, the contract of the parties gave the plaintiffs no right of supervision, and no power of control. Under these circumstances, the defendants must be regarded as having agreed to procure such materials, and apply such workmanship as would furnish to the plaintiffs steam boilers free from all such defects, latent or otherwise, as would render them unfit for the ordinary uses contemplated by the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The question is, then, not one of fraud, hut of the performance of the implied stipulations of a contract. It was well known by the defendants, at the time of making the contract, that the plaintiffs desired to procure steam boilers, fit, both in material and workmanship, for the use to which such boilers are ordinarily applied. They agreed to supply the plaintiffs demand in this behalf; and the question is, have they performed their contract? If they have failed, through defect of material procured hy themselves, or of workmanship, their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>contract is broken, whether such defects be latent or visible, and however honest their intentions may have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">It has been suggested that the law has been recently held otherwise, by the court of appeals, in New York, in the case of <em>Hoe </em>v. <em>Sanborn, </em>8 Am. Law Reg. 740\u2014754. But a reference to that case will show, that whatever the terms of the contract before the court may have been, it had been <em>pleaded </em>as an <em>executed </em>sale, not as an <em>executory </em>contract. Under the pleadings, therefore, that case was properly regarded by the court as raising only a question as to the extent of the manufacturer\u2019s implied warranty, in the case of an <em>executed sale </em>of <em>specific goods. </em>Indeed, the court fully recognized the distinction between the case then before them, and the case of executory contracts, and said, what is evidently true, that the rule of <em>caveat emptor </em>was wholly inapplicable to the latter class. of cases. This authority, therefore, confirms, instead of conflicting with, the conclusion we have arrived at in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">To a majority of the court it seems clear, that the instruction asked by the plaintiff in the court below should have been given, and that the court erred in the limitation and exception specified in the charge given.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The judgment is therefore reversed, and the case remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b65-8\">Brinkerhoff, C.J., and Sutliff, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b65-9\">Peck and Gholson, JJ.,</author>\n<p id=\"A4\">dissented, on the ground that the facts of the case brought it within the rule stated as applicable to the order of goods from a manufacturer, in a recent decision by the court of appeals in New York, <em>Hoe </em>v. <em>Sanborn, </em>8 Am. Law Reg. 740-754: \u201cThe vendor is liable in such cases for any latent defect not disclosed to the purchaser, arising from the manner in which the article was manufactured, or if he <em>knowingly </em>used improper materials, he is liable for that also, but not for any <em>latent </em>defect in the material, which he is not shown, and can not be presumed to have known.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
