Neither the pleadings nor the evidence raise any question as to the good' faith of the defendant. That is unquestioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-8\">H. The only questions are, whether a guaranty was, given \u2014 and if so, whether the cashier had authority to give it. The brief for the plaintiff is confined to these points, and we need not look beyond them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-9\">HI. Was a guaranty given?</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-10\">(1.) \"A guaranty is a promise to answer for the payment of some debt, or the performance of some duty in case of the failure of another person, who is himself, in the first instance, liable to such payment or performance.\u201d Smith\u2019s Merc. Law (3d ed.), 563.</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-11\">(2.) \u201c Warranty and guaranty, being derivatives from the same root, are identical in signification and effect; the one usually, but not always, denoting a covenant in a conveyance, and the other a parol promise.\u201d Per Gibson, C.J., <em>Ayres </em>v. <em>Findlay, </em>1 Barr, 501.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-12\">(3.) \u201c The answer of the seller to the question of the buyer, whether the horse was sound? does not amount to a warranty. It must be express. It will not be implied by the mere affirmation of the quality or kind of the article sold, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>nor by a mere affirmation of the value, nor where the subject is of dubious quality, on which common judgment might be deceived; and the reason is, <em>that as a warranty renders the party subject to all losses arising from the failure of it, however innocent he may be, courts of law are careful of creating an obligation of such extent</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-5\">\u201c To make an affirmation at the time of the sale a warranty, it must appear by the evidence to be so <em>intended, </em>and not to have been mere matter of judgment and opinion.\u201d <em>Erwin </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>3 Murphy L. and Eq. 241.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-6\">(4.) \u201c The law will subject a man having no interest in the-transaction, to pay the debt of another <em>only when his undertalcing manifests a clear intention to bind himself for the </em>debt. It is the duty of the individual who contracts with one man on the credit of another, not to trust to ambiguous phrases and strained constructions, but to require an explicit and plain-declaration of the obligation he is about to assume.\u201d <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Clark\u2019s ex\u2019rs, </em>7 Cranch, 90.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-7\">(5.) \u201cAn assertion by the vendor to the vendee, at the-time of selling a mare, that he is sure she is safe and kind and gentle in harness, amounts merely to a representation, and does not constitute a warranty or express promise that she is so.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Wetherill, </em>8 S. &amp; R. 480.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-8\">(6.) \u201c The true doctrine is, that an innocent misrepresentation, not being fraudulent, furnishes no cause of action and no sufficient ground for rescinding a contract.\u201d <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>3 Dana, 481.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-9\">(7.) \u201c No implied warranty arises from the unfounded affirmation of soundness in the sale of a chattel, but for a deceitful representation of it, the remedy is by an action <em>ex delicto.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-10\">\u201cA naked affirmation is not a warranty nor evidence of it, and though it may, in connection with other circumstances, be competent to show that the vendor had agreed to be responsible for the truth of it; yet the effect of oral words in constituting an express warranty, is determinable, not by the court but by the jury. <em>McFarland </em>v. <em>Needham, </em>9 Watts, 55.</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-11\">(8.) \u201c When a purchaser of property, in payment therefor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>transferred, to the vendor notes upon third persons, and upon being requested to indorse the notes, for the purpose of enabling the vendor to sue in his own name, refused to do so, but said '<em>they were good,\u2019 </em>it was held that the words ' they were good,\u2019 used in the manner they were, did not furnish any evidence of' a promise to make the notes good.\u201d <em>Carpenter v.

R. 22, 23.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-7\">(11.) The correspondence between the parties shows conclusively that the defendant did not intend to guaranty the bill in question, and that the plaintiffs understood distinctly that no such guaranty had been given. The transaction was a <em>swap </em>of broken bank paper for the bill in question, \u201c <em>without </em>recourse.\u201d If the cashier intended a guaranty, why did he not put it on the bill? If the plaintiffs intended a guaranty, why did they not require it to be put on the bill?</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-8\">(12.) If the intention and understanding of the parties were that there was to be no guaranty, it is decisive. <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Fincher, </em>10 Blackf. 10; <em>Duffee </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>3 Cowan, 25; <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>3 Washb. 176.</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-9\">IV. Had the cashier authority to give such a guaranty?</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-10\">(1.)

There is no proof of such usage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-12\">(3.) There was no authority from the board of directors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-13\">\u2018\u201cAn agreement by the president and cashier of the Bank of the United States, that the indorser of a promissory note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>shall not be liable on his indorsement, does not bind the bank.\u201d <em>Bank U.

Most banks, it is believed, pass through the whole term of their corporate existence without the occurrence of a single instance of such a transaction. When a bill is <em>indorsed, </em>the law requires prompt notice, and the matter is speedily brought to a close. Where a guaranty is given, no such promptitude is required. The transaction may remain open for years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-9\">It would be dangerous to hold that such an act may be done by a cashier without <em>special authority, </em>and that it is \u201c within the ordinary course of his duties.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-10\">See, also, upon this point, in addition to the authorities above cited, <em>Hoyt </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>1 Selden, 320, and <em>Kirk </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>12 Eng. Law and Eq. 385.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b174-11\">Suture, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASX\">Two questions are presented in this case for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\"><bracketnum>1.</bracketnum> Does the state of facts shown by the correspondence amount to an undertaking, or contract, upon which a right of action in law could arise in favor of the plaintiffs ? and,</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> If so, does the proof show such undertaking or contract to be obligatory upon the defendant ?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">Each of these propositions is denied by the defense. And it is evident that they must both be sustained by the plaintiffs in order to entitle them to recover. Eor, if a valid undertaking, sufficient to give a right of action, was made by the cashier, professing to act as the agent of the defendant, and duly authorized, when in fact he had no authority, and his act, as such agent, was not recognized, but repudiated by the bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>for whom he assumed to so act, the Bank of Cireleville would not, and the cashier alone would be liable upon such unauthorized undertaking by him so made.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">It may, therefore, be well to consider, first in order, the last proposition \u2014 does the proof show the undertaking, negotiation or arrangement so made by the cashier of the bank with the plaintiffs, according to its terms, obligatory upon the bank?</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">It is not denied that the acts of the cashier of the bank in the exercise of all of his powers and the discharge of all of his duties, <em>as </em>cashier, would be obligatory upon the bank, as the acts of an authorized agent; and would require no ratification or assent on the part of the bank to give them validity as against the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The charter of this bank provides that \u201c it shall be lawful for said bank to loan money, buy, sell and negotiate bills of exchange, checks and promissory notes,\u201d etc. O. L. L., Yol. 32, p. 344. But these acts can only be done on the part of the corporation by its agents. And corporations are subject to the same laws in relation to the acts of their agents, which are applied to individual persons in regard to the acts of their agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">It is not claimed that the respective duties of the board of directors, president and cashier, in the exercise of the franchises of the bank, are prescribed by the charter. So far, therefore, as the limitation of the appropriate duties of the cashier depend upon his office, we can only have respect to the ordinary and well understood duties of that officer in determining his powers. A cashier is defined to be one who has charge of money, or who superintends the hooks, payments, and receipts of a bank or moneyed institution. His actual powers and duties, like those of all other agents, may be more or less qualified, restricted or enlarged by the corporation, institution or party for whom he acts. But in this case, there being nothing to show any restriction or qualification of his powers in that regard, the duties of the cashier may reasonably be understood to extend to the buying and selling, and negotiating bills of exchange, checks and promissory notes, as well as to that of borrowing money, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>agent of the bank. In the discharge of his duty, he is supposed to be instructed and directed, either generally or specially, by the bank, either through its board of directors or president, as the case may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">It is not denied that if the cashier had purchased or sold a bill of exchange, the property in the same might, by the \u25a0cashier, have been acquired by or transferred from the bank; but it is said that he had not the power, by virtue of his office and as such agent, to impose any liability upon the bank, further than to transfer title to and from his principal. If this be so, it would follow that in case the cashier could sell a bill of exchange at par by not guarantying it, and for a large premium by doing so, that although he knew the bill to be unquestionably good, it would not only be his duty to indorse the same without recourse, and sell at par, but that if he should guaranty the same and sell at a premium, such guaranty would be void. But this could not be claimed on the part of the principal, even in the absence of authority on the part of the agent, after retaining the proceeds of the sale and-ratifying the act. In the case before us, there is no evidence that the correspondence was not approved and assented to by the bank at the time, or that the transaction on the part of the cashier was, at any time after, repudiated or even disapproved by the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">We have no doubt, therefore, that the acts of the cashier in the transaction are to be regarded as they were by the parties at the time, as the acts of the bank by its agent, and as obligatory upon the principal as if done by itself through any other regularly constituted agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">There remains, then, to be considered the other question \u2014 \u25a0 does the agreed statement of facts show an undertaking or contract on the part of the defendant upon which a right of action could arise in favor of the plaintiffs ?</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\"><em>A guaranty, </em>in its strict legal and commercial sense, is said to be \u201c an undertaking by one person to be answerable for the payment of some debt, or the due performance of some contract or duty by another person, who himself remains liable to pay or perform the same.\u201d . . . \u201c Originally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>the words <em>warranty </em>and <em>guaranty </em>were the same, the letter <em>g, </em>\u25a0of the Norman French, being convertible with the <em>w </em>of the German and English, as in the name William or Guillaume. They are now sometimes used indiscriminately; but in gen eral, <em>warranty </em>is applied to a contract as to the title, quality or quantity of a thing sold; and <em>guaranty </em>is held to be the contract by which one person is bound to another for the fulfillment of a promise or engagement of a third party.\u201d 1 Parsons on Contracts, 493. Each is, alike, an undertaking by one party to another to indemnify or make good the party \u2022assured against some possible default or defect, in the contemplation of the parties. A guaranty is, perhaps, always understood, in its strict legal and commercial sense, as a collateral warranty, and often as a conditional one, against some default or event in <em>future. </em>The term warranty, on the other hand, is generally understood as an absolute undertaking <em>in ..present\u00ed, </em>as well as <em>in futuro, </em>against the defect, or for the quantity or quality contemplated by the parties in the subject matter of the contract. But this contract of warranty, whether qualified and collateral, as applied to the performance of a duty, payment of a debt, or happening of an <em>event, </em>when denominated a <em>guaranty; </em>or unqualified and absolute, \u25a0as in cases of warranty when applied to the quality or title of things, has alike, in either case, all the characteristics of a contract or undertaking. It must be supported by a sufficient consideration; it must appear to be an agreement of the minds of the two contracting parties to the proposition constituting the contract. The same remark is also equally applicable to each \u2014 that no particular form of words is required \u25a0\u25a0to express the contract. Any form of words expressing an undertaking, upon a consideration, to insure the other party against the nonpayment or delinquency of a third party, may constitute a <em>guaranty. </em>And any affirmation or words, sustained by a consideration, showing an undertaking that the quality or title of the thing sold is such as represented, may \u2022amount to a <em>warranty. </em>The consideration in each case may arise out of the transaction. In the case of a guaranty that -it was operative to cause the negotiation or acceptance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>paper; and in that of a warranty that the affirmation or undertaking was operative in causing the purchase, would in each case he a sufficient consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">What, then, is the state of facts before us upon the single point to which these general principles apply ?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">On the 11th day of November, 1854, the plaintiffs submitted to the defendant a written proposition to purchase a certain bill of exchange held by the defendant against Buckingham &amp; Co., on Adams &amp; Buckingham, for $5000, paying therefor principal, interest and exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The defendant replies on the 15th of November, that the defendant does not then hold that bill, but returns a proposition to sell to the plaintiffs similar bills drawn by Buckingham &amp; Co., of Toledo, for the same amount, on like terms, due November 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">On the 21st of November, the plaintiffs accept this proposition of defendant, and forward the money in compliance on their part.</p>\n<p id=\"AzT\">Thus far, it is evident that both the parties regarded the negotiation as being for a \u201c perfectly good \u201d bill; and principal, interest and exchange were to be paid as the agreed-price. The defendant barely mentions the names of the parties to the bill, and the plaintiffs accept the proposition upon their own knowledge, without question as to the responsibility of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">But the defendant accepts the plaintiffs compliance with-their proposition, retain the full price paid to them, and on-the 4th of December, by letter acknowledges the receipt of principal, interest and exchange, and attempts a performance-on its part of its own proposition \u2014 not by sending the bill which defendant had proposed to sell, and for which defendant had so received the price ; nor by returning the money, or offering to do so, and opening a negotiation for the sale of some other bill. But the defendant sends another bill made by entire strangers to the plaintiffs, indorsed by a stranger, and that \u201c without recourse,\u201d and impart to it full credit on the part of plaintiffs, by an attendant written assurance or affirmation, that it <em>\u201c is perfectly safe.\u201d </em>This is the language; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>of the defendant\u2019s letter containing the bill sent to the plaintiffs, upon the subject: \u201c The Buckingham bills I proposed to give you are gone, but this bill is perfectly safe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">And upon receipt of the bill and the assurance of its quality by the defendant, the plaintiffs reply: \u201c Your favor of the 4th inst., with stated inclosure, is received, and is very satisfactory.\u201d This consummated the contract, as understood by the parties. But <em>how </em>was it consummated ? The defendant proposed to sell the Buckingham bills, and it was those only which the plaintiffs agreed to buy, and for which payment was made by plaintiffs, and received and retained by the defendant. Yery true, says the defendant; but the plaintiffs, by their letter of December 7th, just referred to, express their assent to accept the bill of Jefferson Fulton, instead of the Buckingham bills of like amount. There is nothing in the letter, I think, to authorize such a conclusion. The plaintiffs did not say, and there is nothing to induce the supposition that they would have said, that the bill sent them <em>was of itself a satisfactory </em>equivalent for the one withheld, and for which they had paid. All the circumstances going to show that the plaintiffs were unacquainted with the parties to the bill, it is not to be presumed that the defendant would have sent, or the plaintiffs have accepted the bill in place of the Buckingham bills, <em>without an assurance </em>of its being of the <em>same </em>value. But we are not left to conjecture upon this point. The defendant did not presume to s,end the Fulton bill as a compliance of the contract on its part, <em>without </em>an accompanying written assurance; and the plaintiffs only accepted it <em>with such assurance. </em>\u201c Yourffavor,\u201d . . (say they,) \u201cwith <em>stated </em>inclosure, is received* and is very satisfactory.\u201d What was the <em>stated </em>inclosure? The Fulton bill, by the bank stated or vouched to be \u201c perfectly safe.\u201d That favor simply credited plaintiffs the full price of the Buckingham bills, told them those bills were gone, and added, \u201c but <em>this bill </em>is <em>perfectly safe.\u201d </em>And this favor, meaning obviously this explanation, and <em>their assurance </em>of the goodness of the bill, forwarded with the bill, the plaintiffs say \u201cis very satisfactory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Here, then, is a positive affirmation on the part of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>fendant, in relation to a bill of exchange offered to the plaintiffs, that it <em>is perfectly safe. </em>On the strength of that representation, defendant asks, and the plaintiffs pay for the bill of $5000, the sum of $5050.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">It is admitted that after the exercise of all due diligence on the part of the purchasers, the plaintiffs, the bill has proved to be defective of the quality for which it was sold. It was not such a bill as the defendant assured, or affirmed to the plaintiffs at the time of the sale. Now, if a like representation had been made and acted upon in the sale and purchase of a personal chattel, I apprehend there would be no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that the representation so made by the vendor was clearly a warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">But the distinction already alluded to, between a guaranty and warranty, renders the application of the term <em>guaranty, </em>in its strict legal and commercial sense, perhaps inapplicable to this case. For, although hills of exchange are bought and sold like personal property, and the word warranty might be applied not improperly to the <em>title </em>of the holder, the warranty accompanying their transfer, as to their quality, generally has respect merely to the <em>payment </em>of the <em>debt </em>which the bill or note evidences, and is called a guaranty. These facts, however, are apparent in the case. The defendant offered to sell the bill and at a premium price, under a positive affirmation that it was <em>\u201cperfectly safe; </em>\u201d and on that representation of its quality, the plaintiffs, in full confidence, having no other means at hand to know, bought the bill, and paid such premium price; and this representation so made and received, has proved untrue. It matters nothing, I apprehend, that the defendant honestly regarded the bill safe. The defendant affirmed it to be so, and it is not admissible.for it to now qualify that undertaking. And although this representation is not in the strict language or form of a <em>guaranty, </em>it is difficult for me to perceive how it does not substantially comprehend at least an assurance of the collectibility of the bill. . The term perfectly safe, when applied to commercial paper, must at least mean that the paper is collectible. Short of this, it can not properly be said to possess the quality of being <em>\u201c </em>perfectly safe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Having respect, therefore, to the substance of the transaction between the parties, and the common and well understood meaning of the language used by the defendant and accepted by the plaintiffs, a majority of the court are clearly of the opinion that the same constituted an undertaking on the part of defendant, upon which a right of action in law has accrued to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">It is not material whether this undertaking be called a warranty, or whether we term the affirmation of the defendant a representation in the nature of a guaranty; the substance of the transaction is the same.' In either case, it was an undertaking which the defendant had a right to make, and the plaintiffs to accept and rely upon. And we think sound principles of law, as well as good morals, require that the same should be held obligatory between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Nor can this undertaking be invalidated by the doubts which seem to have been expressed afterward by the plaintiffs, whether the same could be enforced in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Judgment must, therefore, be entered for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b181-8\">Brinkerhoff, C.J., and Scott, J., concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b181-9\">Peck and Gholson, JJ., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
