Snowden and wife, on the third day of February, 1854, executed to the defendants, Lambert &amp; Co., a mortgage upon certain real estate therein described, to secure the payment of three promissory notes, made by Richard EL Snowden to the defendants, Lambert &amp; Co., all dated January 24,1854: one for $1707.92, payable nine months from date; one for $1774.25, payable eighteen months from date, and one for $1821.28, payable two years from date; that on the 1st of January, 1855, Lambert &amp; Co. sold and assigned to plaintiff the note due eighteen months from date; that plaintiff still holds the same, and that a partial payment has been made thereon by Richard EL Snowden; that Lambert &amp; Co. still hold the note due two years from date, upon which also Richard EE.

A copy of the mortgage to Lambert &amp; Co. is attached to the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-5\">None of the defendants have answered, except Mrs. Snow-den.

Snowden, her husband, was in debt. The mortgages set out in the petition were prepared beforehand. Her husband came with said Smith, a notary public, to the room where this defendant was sitting with her mother, and requested this defendant to sign said instruments, with others, which she did. This defendant was then about nineteen years of age, and had been married about one year, and was ignorant in matters of business, and unacquainted with executing papers and making contracts of any kind. That said instruments were not read to her, nor did she know what they were, nor what was intended by them. That she was not examined, in respect to them, by said Smith, or any one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>else, either in the presence of, or separate from her husband; nor did the said Smith, or any one else make known to her -oe contents of said instruments, or any part thereof; nor nad she the slightest intimation, from any source, that said instruments in any way affected her own property \u2014 in fact, she did not know anything what they were or what they were designed for. She put confidence in her husband, and signed the papers because he requested her to do so, but not supposing that they had any reference at all to her property. She received no money or other consideration therefor. The debt for which said mortgages were given was the sole debt of her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-5\">\u201c This defendant, until afterward, did not know that said Smith was a notary public; nor did he disclose to this defendant what his business was; and this defendant, at the time, had no other idea but that he was transacting some private business with her husband. And' the fact that said instruments were mortgages was kept entirely secret from this defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-6\">\u201c Wherefore she insists that said instruments are void as to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-7\">\u201c III.

Nor is it charged that there was any fraud or intentional deception practiced upon the wife by her husband, nor is there any denial that she had previously consented that her property should be mortgaged, to procure time for her husband in the payment of his debts. The <em>pith </em>of her answer is, that she did not, at the <em>time </em>of the execution of the instruments, know what they contained, or to what they related. All that is alleged is consistent with a <em>previous </em>understanding that her property should be incumbered in this way for his benefit. And that understanding may have been the reason why she did not inquire as to the object and contents of the papers.

Because it was never delivered by her, and</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">2. Because it was obtained by imposition and in fraud of her rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">We propose, first to consider the latter branch of the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">The facts which constitute the alleged fraud and imposition, are fully and minutely stated in the answer, and directly impeach the truth of the notary\u2019s certificate of acknowledgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">The answer does not charge the mortgagee, or his assignee, with any participation in, or knowledge of the fraud alleged to have been practiced on the respondent. Nor does it directly impugn the good faith of the notary, otherwise than by averring that he did not, as he has certified, make known to her the contents of the mortgage deed. She does not even charge her husband with any misrepresentation, or intentional deception. It is true, she says, that the fact that the instruments which she signed were mortgages, was kept entirely secret from her, but this, when taken in connection with the facts stated, can not be understood as importing more than an averment, that she was not informed of their character. She complains of no artifice, no act done, or word spoken, either by her husband or the notary, calculated to deceive her. Her allegations of fraud are evidently a mere inference, which she draws from the facts stated. And yet those facts are entirely consistent with honesty of purpose, both on the part of the notary and her husband. When asked, by her husband, to sign the papers which had been prepared for the purpose, she did so without question or hesitation. She did so, because she had full confidence in her husband. If, in the fullness of conjugal affection, she was willing to abide by the judgment, and conform to the wishes \u25a0of her husband, without asking any questions, it would seem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>unreasonable that she should now seek to relieve herself from the consequences of that confidence, at the expense of others who were less confiding, and guilty of no fault. Her ready compliance with her husband\u2019s wishes in signing the mortgage in the notary\u2019s presence, without inquiry or objection, would naturally impress him with the conviction that she was fully apprised of the contents of the instrument which she was executing. Under such circumstances, the averments of the answer can not be understood as importing a charge of intentional or actual fraud, on the part of the notary. How soon after the execution of the mortgage, she learned its true character, is not shown by the answer; but it may be fairly presumed, in the absence of any averment to the contrary, that under the influence of the caution given by her mother, who witnessed its execution, she soon made the proper inquiries, and was fully informed as to what she had done. Yet no intimation appears to have been given of any dissatisfaction, on her part, until her husband had obtained the full benefit of the time given by his creditors, on the faith of the mortgage, and they, thereupon, proceeded to enforce their lien. But, be this as it may, and supposing her husband to have been guilty of fraud, in not disclosing to her the character and effect of the deed which she signed without inquiry, yet the notary is charged with no complicity in this fraud, or with any intentional deception. And there is no suggestion that the mortgagee was in any way privy to, or cognizant of any imposition. Can she, under these circumstances, impeach the certificate of the officer ? If so, then such certificate is, at most, but prima facie evidence of the facts which it purports to verify. But this, we think, would contravene the policy of the law. The title to real estate would generally be insecure, if the official certificate of a magistrate, authorized by statute to examine, as to the execution of a deed, and to certify the acknowledgment of the grantors, could not be relied on as conclusive. The certificate of acknowledgment is an essential part of the conveyance, and without it the title can not pass. And we think it can no more be contradicted by parol, than any other part of the deed. It is true, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the deed may be impeached and set aside for fraud. But that fraud must be something more than a breach of the confidence reposed by one of the grantors in the other. Where the grantee does not participate in the fraud, and is not cognizant of it, nor of any circumstances which would put an honest and prudent man upon inquiry, and has acted on the faith of the conveyance, we apprehend it can not be set aside on the ground of fraud. Thus in <em>Schrader </em>v. <em>Decker, </em>9 Barr 14, it was held that \u201c the acknowledgment of a deed, by husband and wife, for the wife\u2019s land, may be shown to have been obtained by fraud and duress of the wife, and thus avoided as to volunteers, or purchasers with notice, <em>aliter as to Iona fide purchasers without </em>notice.\u201d So, in <em>Louden </em>v. <em>Blythe, </em>16 Penn. Rep. 532, and 27 Penn. Rep. 22, where it was held that \u201cthe certificate of the magistrate is conclusive in favor of one who accepted it in good faith, and paid his money, without knowing or having reason to suspect it to be untrue. But, that if the certificate be false in fact, and the mortgagee knew it, or knew of circumstances which would put an honest and prudent man upon inquiry, then it may be contradicted by parol evidence.\u201d In the case last cited, the mortgage was set aside, not simply because the magistrate taking the acknowledgment knew that the wife\u2019s acknowledgment was induced by undue influence, on the part of the husband, but because the mortgagee was also present, and knew enough to put him upon inquiry. In <em>Hartley </em>v. <em>Frosh, </em>6 Tex. 208, it is said that \u201c where the certificate of the privy examination of a married woman is in due form, in order to impeach its veracity, it is not sufficient to allege that there was no privy examination, that the contents were not made known to her, etc.; <em>the certificate is conclusive in the absence of an allegation of fraud or imposition </em>\u2014 as, for instance, that there was a fraudulent combination between the notary' and the parties interested.\u201d We doubt whether a case can be found where the certificate of the magistrate has been allowed to-be impeached, on the ground of fraud, without evidence charging the grantee with notice of the fraud, or the officer taking it with complicity therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>We are satisfied, therefore, that the facts stated in the \u25a0answer in this case would not warrant the introduction of .parol evidence to contradict the certificate of the notary.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">But the respondent further avers that she never delivered, \u25a0nor authorized her husband to deliver the mortgage deed, upon which suit is brought. She does not deny the fact that it was signed and sealed by her; nor that it was delivered by her husband; and if she is conclusively bound by the \u2022certificate of acknowledgment, which shows her knowledge \u25a0of its contents, and the purpose for which it was intended; and if, with this knowledge, she permitted her husband, without objection or inquiry, to take and use it according to his own judgment, then she has no right to complain that he delivered it in accordance with its terms and manifest purpose. Under such circumstances, a delivery by him must bind her, as well as himself. The grantee may properly regard her. \u2022execution and acknowledgment of the instrument as evidence of her consent to its delivery; and if, without notice of her dissent, it is delivered by the husband, she can not afterward be -permitted to question his right to do so, without allowing a fraud to be practiced against the grantee. Were it otherwise, a large majority .of all the deeds executed by husband .and wife, within this State, have never been delivered by the wife, and would not bind her.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">It is quite true that a deed of conveyance is inoperative till delivered, and that if a conveyance of the wife\u2019s land, executed by husband and wife, be not delivered till after the wife\u2019s death, when her estate is vested in her heirs, their estate can not then be divested by a delivery by the husband, without their consent. Such is the doctrine of the case of <em>Shoenberger </em>v. <em>Zook et ux. </em>34 Penn. Rep. 24, cited by counsel. That decision was, no doubt, correct, but does not touch the present case. One much more nearly in point, is that of <em>Ackert </em>v. <em>Pultz, </em>7 Barb. 386, in which it was held that, \u201c where husband and wife execute a deed, and deposit it as an escrow, to be delivered on the execution of a bond and mortgage, the husband\u2019s consent to the delivery of the deed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the grantee without a performance of the condition will bind the wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Many authorities might be referred to, bearing more or less directly on the several defenses set up in this answer, and sustaining the views we have expressed. 17 Alabama Rep. 89; <em>James </em>v. <em>Fisk, </em>9 Sm. &amp; Mar. 145; <em>Aiken et al. </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>2 Barb. C. R. 140; <em>Jamison </em>v. <em>Jamison, </em>3 Wharton, 469; <em>McNeely </em>v. <em>Rucker, </em>6 Blackf. 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">We think that the demurrer to the answer must be sustained, and the case remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b222-7\">Brinkerhoee, C.J., and Sutliee, Peck, and Gholson, JJ. concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
