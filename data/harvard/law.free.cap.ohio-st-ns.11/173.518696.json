The word <em>\u201c </em>descendant,\u201d in the <em>\u201c </em>act to restrict the entailment of real estate \u201d (S. &amp; C.\u2019s Stat. 550), means any person or persons upon whom a descent would be <em>immediately </em>cast by our <em>statutes </em>of descents, upon the death of any person or persons \u201c in being at the time of making such deed or will.\u201d My clients above named come within this description. Fanny Turley, their grandmother, was a person in being when the will was made. When she died, they were among her \u201c <em>descendants,\u201d </em>upon whom the statute of descents <em>immediately </em>cast all estate of inheritance of which she was seized. They were, therefore, \u201cimmediate descendants,\u201d within the meaning of the act restricting entails, of a person in being (Fanny Turley, their grandmother), at the time the will was made; and consequently, the testator could well limit an estate to them. Statutes of Conn. 389, secs. 4 and 5; <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Hempstead, </em>3 Day, 332, 339; <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Olcott, </em>Kirby, 118; Swan\u2019s St., old ed. 999, sec. 47; S. &amp; C.\u2019s Stat. 1626, sec. 53.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-9\">2. If the case falls within the operation of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, then Fanny Turley took a fee simple; and as she died intestate, my clients <em>inherit from </em>her, under the statutes of descent. <em>McFeeley\u2019s lessee </em>v. <em>Moore\u2019s heirs, </em>5 Ohio Rep. 464; <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Zane\u2019s heirs, </em>12 Id. 287; <em>King\u2019s heirs </em>v. <em>King\u2019s adm\u2019r, </em>Ib. 390; S.

If Fanny Turley took an estate tail, and the rule in Shelley\u2019s case does not apply, then, by force of the last clause of the act relating to entails, she being the first donee in tail, her issue took the fee simple. But the word \u201c issue \u201d includes grandchildren (whose parents are dead), as well as children and hence my clients take. 2 Jarman on Wills, 328; 6 Jac. Law. Dic. 165; 4 Kent. Com. 10, 11, 12; 1 Swift\u2019s Dig. 78; 15 Pick. 104, 114; 3 Day, 332; 1 Dallas, 47; 1 Penn. 291; 5 Call. 439; 2 H. &amp; J. 369; 2 U. S.

The words are, <em>\u201c </em>and at either of their (the testator\u2019s children\u2019s) deaths, his or her share (I devise) to his or her child or children (then) living, and the descendants of those who may be dead, equally, to be divided per stirpes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">It appears from the agreed statement, that two of Mrs. Turley\u2019s children, born after the making of the will \u2014 Catharine (Turley) Cunningham and Susan (Turley) Johnson \u2014 died before their mother, each leaving two children, who were living when Mrs. Turley died, and it is obvious that if the declared intent of the testator is to prevail, these great-grandchildren of the testator, upon the decease of Mrs. Turley, took the portions of the estate devised, which their respective mothers would have taken if they had survived her.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">It is said, hoAvever, that this plain and obvious intent of the testator, that upon the death of his daughter, Fanny, her portion of the estate should, in a certain event, pass to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>living descendants of her children born after the will was made and dying during her lifetime, can not be carried out because it is in direct conflict with the \u201c act to restrict the entailment of real estate,\u201d passed February 17, 1811 (Swan <em>&amp; </em>Critchfield\u201ds Stat. 550), which reads as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u201c That from and after the taking effect of this act, no estate in fee simple, fee tail, or any lesser estate in lands or tenements, lying within this State, shall be given or granted, by deed or will, to any person or persons, <em>but such as are in being, or to the immediate issue or descendants of such as are in being, at the time of making such deed or will; </em>and that all estates given in tail, shall be and remain an absolute estate in fee simple, in the issue of the first donee in tail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">What is to be understood by the terms, \u201c immediate issue,\u201d and \u201c immediate descendants,\u201d as employed in the above recited act ?</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The counsel for the plaintiff insists that both terms indicate only one and the same class of persons, that is, <em>living children of Mrs. Turley, </em>and that neither include living children of <em>her pre-deceased children.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The presumption always is, that every word in a statute is designed to have <em>some </em>effect, and hence the rule that, \u201cin putting a construction upon any statute, every part shall be regarded, and it shall be so expounded, if practicable, as to give some effect to <em>every part of it. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alger, </em>7 Cushing, 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">The word \u201c issue,\u201d without the qualifying word, \u201c immediate,\u201d would, undoubtedly, include grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the person to whose issue the bequest is made. 2 Williams on Ex. 252; 2 Jarman on Wills, 255, note. But we incline to the opinion that the qualifying word, \u201c immediate,\u201d prefixed to it in the clause referred to, limits the phrase to the children merely of the person in being, etc.; and we do this the more readily, as we are satisfied that the remoter lineal descendants, if living at the death of the person in being when \u2018 the will was. made, are included in the phrase, \u201c immediate descendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">In order to determine whether the words, \u201c issue,\u201d and \u201c de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>scendants,\u201d used in the act, refer only to one and the same, class of persons, or whether the one is more extensive than the other, we may very properly look to the entire law and its title, as well as the mischief or defect it was designed to remedy; and also to the other statutes in relation to the inheritance and transmission of estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">As it was said by Lord Ch. J. Tindall, in the dukedom of Sussex case, 8 Lond. Jur. 795, \u201c If any doubts arise from the language employed by the legislature, it has always been held as a safe means of collecting the intention, to call in aid the <em>ground and cause of malcing the </em>statute, and to have recourse to the preamble, which, according to Chief Justice Dyer, is a key to open the minds of the makers of the act, and the mischiefs they intended to redress.\u201d Sedgwick on Stat. Law, 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The statute is a restraining, and not an enabling act. The power to devise real and personal estate, with the formula to be observed and the legitimate subjects of a testamentary disposition, are all defined and prescribed in the general act \u201c relating to wills,\u201d and cognate enactments, and the only object of the act of February 17, 1811, was to prevent the creation of perpetuities and impolitic clogs upon the <em>jus disponendi </em>of real estate. To this end, it prohibits a devise of an interest in land to any one but a person or persons in being a.t the time of making the will, or to the immediate issue or descendants of such persons. It does not affect to define, and much less to alter, the rules of inheritance or descent. The will of George Harness, Jr., viewed in the light of the statute of descents, is nothing more than a devise to Fanny Harness for life, with remainder in fee to her heirs at law. It is \u201c to her for life, and at her death to her child or children then living, and the descendants of such as may be dead, equally, to be divided <em>per </em>stirpes.\u201d If this will tends to create a perpetuity, the statute of descents is alike obnoxious to the charge, and in conflict with the act of February 17,1811.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The devise of George Harness, Jr., then, of the remainder upon the death of his daughter, to the living descendants of such as had pre-deceased, created no greater perpetuity than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\u25a0the general act \u201c regulating descents and distributions \u201d itself authorized, and is not therefore within the evils which the act \u2022of February 17, 1811, was intended to remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">But there is a plain and broad distinction between the terms \u201c children\u201d and \u201c descendants,\u201d the one indicating only lineal descendants, while the other includes both lineal and collateral relations \u2014 all, in short, that would then take the estate under the statute of descents, if George Harness had died intestate. All such persons may not be <em>in fact, </em>but they are <em>in law, </em>the descendants of the person from whom they receive the estate. Upon the same principle, it has repeatedly been held in Ohio, that the term \u201c ancestor,\u201d as used in the statute of descents and distribution, means him from whom the estate was inherited \u2014 whether father, uncle, nephew, younger or elder brother, and the like. <em>Lessee of Pritchett </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>3 Ohio St. Rep. 397; <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Benedict, </em>14 Ohio Rep. 385. So a devise \u201cto my relations,\u201d is in construction limited to such relations as would be entitled to take under the statute of distributions. 5 Yesey, 529; 2 Williams Ex. 956, and cases cited. The superadded word \u201c immediate,\u201d merely requires that the person entitled to take must be one to whom, in case of intestacy, the estate would <em>immediately descend, </em>and this a statute designed to prevent perpetuity should very properly require. If the terms had been used <em>disjunctively, </em>and the superadded words \u201c of those who may be dead, equally, to be divided <em>per </em>stirpes,\u201d omitted, the word <em>\u201c </em>descendants \u201d might possibly have been regarded as substitutional, and as such not entitled to take except upon a failure of living children ; but we think the intention of the testator clear and incontrovertible, that the children of Mrs. Cunningham and Mrs. Johnson are to take the shares of the lands embraced in \u25a0the petition, which their respective mothers would have taken if they had survived Mrs. Turley, and that the devise to them is not in conflict with the act to restrain the entailment of real estate. The devise is in perfect harmony with the statute and with the principles of public policy which gave rise to it Immediately upon the termination of the life estate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>the entire inheritance is thereby cast upon persons in full life, and legally capable of receiving and transmitting the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">This view of the case renders it unnecessary to examine the other point made by the counsel for the defendant, viz.: that the rule in Shelley\u2019s case is applicable to this devise, it having been made long before the statutory abrogation of that rule, in A. D. 1840, and that Mrs. Turley, under that rule, became and was the first donee in tail of the estate, so that by the operation of the' last clause of the act of February 17, 1811, the same became an absolute estate in fee simple in her \u201c <em>issue </em>\u201d generally, including in that term the children of Mrs. Cunningham and Mrs. Johnson.. The rule in Shelley\u2019s case is at best an artificial one, which in its practical application often defeats the real intention of the testator, and would not be applied in the country from which it was borrowed to a case like the present, where a life estate is expressly given, and the remainder limited to the <em>\"</em>children,\u201d and not to the \u201c heirs.\u201d It is true that the law of primogeniture, which prevents its application in England to a devise to children, does not obtain here; but the rule itself finds but little favor in this country, and ought not to be extended. In <em>King </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>15 Ohio Rep. 559, it was held that a devise to C. for life, with remainder to his heirs in fee, did not create a fee in C., because it was inferred from the will that' the testator intended he should take no more than a life estate. If the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, <em>thus modified, </em>were applied to the devise to Fanny Harness, she would not, in our opinion, take an estate tail, but only a life estate. The express devise to her for life, and the employment of descriptive words, which \u2022 are peculiarly words of <em>purchase </em>and not of <em>limitation, </em>to indicate the recipients of the fee, added to the special reference made to the descendants of pre-deceased children, clearly evince an intention on the part of the testator to create a life estate only in his daughter, and to make the children and their descendants the <em>primary donees </em>of the remainder in fee. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the children of Mrs. Cunningham and Mrs. Johnson named in the agreed case, are entitled, under the will of George Harness, Jr., to the shares <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>in the lands specified in the petition, to which their respective mothers would have been entitled if they had survived Mrs. Turley; and the cause is therefore remanded to the district court of Scioto county for further proceedings in accordance with the construction we have given of the will of George Harness, Jr., deceased.</p>\n<judges id=\"b191-5\">Brinkerhoee, C.J., and Scott, .
