Hall\u2019s power of attorney from Skinner was irrevocable; acknowledged the ownership of the fire alarm telegraph to be in Hall, and provided: \u201c The</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-6\">purpose of this instrument being to authorize and empower the said Hall, at any tipie he may deem proper, without notice of any kind, to take possession and control of said property and all my rights under said contract, and for me and in my name, place and stead, to continue to carry out the same, for the city of Galveston, and I hereby release and relinquish to said Hall, at his option, all my rights therein.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-7\">When Hall took possession of the fire alarm system, he executed a bond to the city to carry out the provisions of Skinner\u2019s contract. The appellant, Sonnenthiel, knew, before his purchase of the written instruments above set forth, of the contract between Skinner and the city, and of its'provisions. By the terms of Skinner\u2019s contract, he bound himself to keep and maintain the fire alarm system in good repair for five years. Hall\u2019s power of .attorney was recorded, and the chief contest seems to have been as to whether the instruments above set forth were negotiable. It should be stated that the city clerk, Buckley, testified that he had no authority to issue the certificate of indebtedness set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-8\">The record in this case is filled with much immaterial matter relating to things not referred to in the opinion, and therefore not necessary to be referred to here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-9\">The court rendered judgment against Skinner and Schultz for plaintiff, to which Schultz excepted; that plaintiff take nothing as against the city; in favor of the city against plaintiff for its costs, to which plaintiff excepted; and in favor of Hall, intervener, against the city for fifteen hundred dollars, to which also plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b474-10\"><em>Labatt &amp; Nobles </em>and <em>F.

Whether the facts existed which authorized Hall to take possession of the fire alarm system was passed on by the court below, and there is no assignment of error which calls for a revision of the finding on that point. The power conferred on Hall by Skinner, through the contract between them, and the power of attorney given by the latter to the former, was very broad, and from an examination of the record we see no reason to doubt that Hall had the right to assume control of the fire alarm system.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Hall seems to have been the owner of the subject matter of contract between the city of Galveston and Skinner, which, however, he subsequently agreed to sell to the latter on terms agreed upon. The city agreed to pay Skinner the sum of seven thousand five hundred dollars for &gt;the system, as it was, and as Skinner contracted to make it, the same to be paid in five equal annual installments. It further agreed to pay to Skinner a like sum, in equal monthly installments, for his services and material and other things to be by him supplied and used in keeping the system in good order during a period of five years. The first annual payment was made to him, and all the monthly payments were made to him which became due before December 1, 1886.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Prior to that time, Hall took possession of the fire alarm system under the power given to him by Skinner, and under the contract between them, and from that time operated the system; and under this state of facts it is now contended that Skinner was entitled to receive such proportion of the second year\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>annual payment as the time he operated the fire alarm system during that year bears to the second year, and that the appellant is entitled to this by reason of the assignment under which he claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">If such was the right of Skinner, it would seem that such would be the equitable right of appellant; but we are of the opinion that, under the agreements between Hall and Sk'inner, the former became entitled to whatever rights the latter had under his contract with the city, in so far as settlement had not been made between the city and Skinner prior to the time Hall took possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">There may have been equities between Hall and Skinner growing out of the contracts between them, of which, had they been properly asserted in this case, the appellant might have had the benefit. If so, such equities were not asserted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">We find no error in the judgment, and it will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Opinion delivered March 1, 1887.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
