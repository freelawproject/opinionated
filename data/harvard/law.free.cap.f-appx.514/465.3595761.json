He appeals the denial of a motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Levine argues that the district court erred in determining that his status as a career offender made him ineligible for a reduction of sentence pursuant to the Fair Sentencing Act and Guidelines Amendment 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-21\">The district court correctly determined that Levine was sentenced as a career offender. As a career offender, Levine is not eligible for relief under Amendment 750. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b487-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
