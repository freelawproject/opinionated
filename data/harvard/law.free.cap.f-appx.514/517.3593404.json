In his petition for review, Davis argues that the BIA erred as a matter of law in concluding that his conviction under Florida Statute \u00a7 893.13(1)(a)(2) constituted a felony under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). He renews his argument that he could have been convicted of simply possessing a small quantity of marijuana for distribution without remuneration, which would be only a misdemeanor under federal law. Davis also argues that the IJ committed error by denying him the opportunity to apply for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Whether an offense is an aggravated felony is a question of law which we review de novo. <em>Andrade v. Gonzales, </em>459 F.3d 538, 544 (5th Cir.2006). Drug trafficking crimes are considered aggravated felonies and include any felony punishable under the CSA. <em>Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>662 F.3d 387, 390 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. granted, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1857, 182 L.Ed.2d 642 (2012). Under Florida Statute \u00a7 893.13(1)(a)(2), it is a felony of the third degree \u201cto sell, manufacture, or deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, a controlled substance.\u201d A person convicted of a third degree felony under \u00a7 893.13(1)(a)(2) faces a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years. Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 775.082(3)(d). Because this state felony is punishable by more than one year in prison, it would be considered a felony under federal law. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-16\">Moreover, because the state court charging documents show that Davis was convicted of selling or delivering marijuana for consideration, the BIA correctly concluded that his Florida conviction does not fit within the misdemeanor exception of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(4). Instead, the record establishes that Davis committed an \u201caggravated felony\u201d that rendered him removable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). That being so, Davis cannot show any error as to the determination that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-17\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b540-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
