On appeal, Ennis argues that (1) the district court erroneously entered a default judgment against him; (2) the district court and the plaintiffs harassed him by not using his religious names; and (3) the district court erred in finding him liable for damages, fines, and attorney\u2019s fees. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-17\">On December 21, 2010, Maus initiated a civil action against Ennis, and he later added Ornstein as a plaintiff. Subsequently, the plaintiffs filed a motion for sanctions, alleging that Ennis had sent them harassing e-mails, published a defamatory internet article, and refused to communicate with their counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>Before the court ruled on the motion for sanctions, Maus and Ornstein filed a second amended complaint, alleging: (1) violations of the ACPA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(d) (\u201cCount One\u201d); (2) invasion of privacy (\u201cCount Three\u201d); and (3) violations of the CPI, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 8131 (\u201cCount Four\u201d). In Count Two, the plaintiffs requested injunc-tive relief. Ennis filed an answer and a counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">After the plaintiffs submitted their amended complaint, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for sanctions be granted, in part, and denied, in part. Specifically, Ennis had exhibited conduct that was \u201creprehensible,\u201d and he had \u201cacted intentionally, in bad faith, and for oppressive reasons.\u201d Thus, the court should admonish Ennis for his conduct and advise him that \u201cany future rudeness or disrespect to counsel or the [cjourt\u201d would result in more severe sanctions. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Subsequently, the plaintiffs filed a motion to compel Ennis to respond to discovery requests, and the district court granted the motion. The plaintiffs then filed a second motion for sanctions, including an entry of default judgment and dismissal of Ennis\u2019s counterclaim, alleging that Ennis had submitted inadequate and incomplete responses to their discovery requests. The magistrate issued a report and recommendation that the court grant the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Over Ennis\u2019s objections, on December 16, 2011, the district court adopted the report and recommendation, and granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for sanctions. The court instructed the plaintiffs that they must file a motion for entry of default judgment and, on January 6, 2012, the plaintiffs filed such a motion, requesting reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and statutory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">After an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate issued a report and recommendation that the district court grant the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for entry of a default judgment as to the ACPA claim (Maus only) and the CPI claim (both plaintiffs), and deny it as to the remaining claims. Further, considering the egregiousness of Ennis\u2019s conduct, an award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees was appropriate, and the court should reserve jurisdiction to award those fees and costs upon a motion by the plaintiffs. On April 13, 2012, the district court adopted the report and recommendation, granting, in part, and denying, in part, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">On April 27, 2012, Maus and Ornstein filed the instant post-judgment motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The district court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for $545 in costs, but denied without prejudice their request for attorney\u2019s fees because they failed to provide an itemized billing statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">Subsequently, the plaintiffs filed an amended motion for attorney\u2019s fees, alleging that they had incurred $48,226.50 in attorney\u2019s fees. In support, they submitted an itemized billing statement showing that they had been billed a total of $49,553.25 by their attorneys and an affidavit from a Florida attorney declaring that, in his opinion, $49,000 was a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">On June 14, 2012, the district court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees, finding that most of the fees were billed at $210 per hour, which was \u201cwell within the zone of reasonableness for federal trial lawyers in Central Florida.\u201d Further, the time expended by the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys was also reasonable under the circumstances, as the progress of the case was thwarted by Ennis\u2019s conduct. Thus, the court ordered the entry of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>money judgment against Ennis in the amount of $545 in costs and $48,226.50 in attorney\u2019s fees. On July 16, 2012, Ennis filed the instant notice of appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">\u201cWe review an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Shannon v. Bellsouth Telecommunications, Inc., </em>292 F.3d 712, 717 (11th Cir. 2002). Under an abuse-of-discretion standard, we must affirm unless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment, or has applied the wrong legal standard. <em>Norelus v. Denny\u2019s, Inc., </em>628 F.3d 1270, 1280 (11th Cir.2010). Pursuant to the CPI statute, a district court has discretion to award costs and attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 8131(2). However, issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008). Generally, in a civil case, a notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from. Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1)(A). In civil cases, the timely filing of a notice of appeal is a mandatory prerequisite to the exercise of appellate jurisdiction. <em>Rinaldo v. Corbett, </em>256 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">As an initial matter, in the instant appeal, we lack jurisdiction to consider the district court\u2019s December 16, 2011, order, imposing sanctions against Ennis or its April 13, 2012, order, entering a partial default judgment against him, including a determination that he was liable for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Specifically, Ennis\u2019s instant notice of appeal was filed on July 16, 2012, more than 90 days after the April 2012 order, and as such, he may not challenge issues that were resolved in that order or in any prior orders. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App.P. 4(a)(1)(A); <em>Rinaldo, </em>256 F.3d at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">Here, our jurisdiction is limited to a review of the district court\u2019s June 15, 2012, order granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for $545 in costs and $48,226.50 in attorney\u2019s fees. On appeal, Ennis has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s determination regarding the appropriate amount of attorney\u2019s fees and costs because he fails to raise any arguments related to that issue on appeal. <em>Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874. Instead, Ennis\u2019s brief focuses exclusively on the district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions, its entry of a default judgment against him, and the district court judge\u2019s failure to address him by certain religious names. Although he made passing references to attorney\u2019s fees and costs in challenging the merits of the default judgment, he does not argue that the district court abused its discretion in determining that $48,771.50 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">Regardless, even if Ennis had not abandoned any challenge to the amount of the award, the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the plaintiffs $545 in costs and $48,226.50 in attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Shannon, </em>292 F.3d at 717. Specifically, Ellis\u2019s liability for costs and attorney\u2019s fees had already been determined in a prior order and, before awarding a specific amount, the district court required the plaintiffs to submit an itemized billing statement. The billing statement verified that the plaintiffs had been billed a total of $49,553.25 by their attorneys. Further, an affidavit from a Florida attorney declared that the amount charged was reasonable for this case. Thus, the district court\u2019s determination as to the appropriate amount of costs and attorney\u2019s fees was supported by the record and did not constitute a clear error in judgment. <em>See Norelus, </em>628 F.3d at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
