The district court denied Guidry leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, and Gui-dry seeks leave to proceed IFP on appeal from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-21\">We may authorize an appellant to proceed IFP on appeal if the appeal is taken in good faith, i.e., if the appeal presents a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1); <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). The inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-22\">Guidry filed his notice of appeal on March 29, 2012, 56 days after the district court denied his motions on February 2, 2012. Thus, if the proceedings in the district court were criminal in nature, Gui-dry\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely, and if the proceeding were civil in nature, Gui-dry\u2019s notice of appeal was timely. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), (b)(1)(A). Gui-dry\u2019s argument that his notice of appeal was timely presents a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. <em>See United States v. Pugh, </em>426 Fed.Appx. 876, 876 n. 1 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1725, 182 L.Ed.2d 263 (2012). However, the merits of Guidry\u2019s appeal do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-25\">Section 3600 of Title 18 provides individuals under a federal sentence of impris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>onment with an opportunity to move for post-conviction DNA testing. The court that entered the defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction is to order DNA testing of specified evidence if 10 prerequisites are met. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3600(a)(1)-(10). One of the prerequisites provides that the applicant must show that \u201c[t]he proposed DNA testing of the specific evidence may produce new material evidence that would ... raise a reasonable probability that the applicant did not commit the offense.\u201d \u00a7 3600(a)(8). Section 14132(b)(3)(C) of Title 42 provides that the federal DNA index shall include records only from entities including federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies that store DNA information and allow release of DNA information only for limited purposes including \u201cfor criminal defense purposes, to a defendant, who shall have access to samples and analyses performed in connection with the case in which such defendant is charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Guidry asserts that the DNA testing he requested may produce new evidence that would raise a reasonable probability that he did not sexually assault Denise Lim\u00f3n. He maintains that the unknown DNA on Limon\u2019s clothing was from spermatozoa and that learning the identity of the person who was the source of that DNA would prove that Lim\u00f3n had lied when she testified that she had sex only with her fianc\u00e9 and her assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Contrary to Guidry\u2019s assertion, the record shows that the DNA from the unknown individuals was not from sperm. Thus, it is not reasonably probable that determining the identity of the unknown persons whose DNA was on Limon\u2019s clothing and in the patrol car would lead to the discovery of a person who had sex with Lim\u00f3n and would contradict Limon\u2019s testimony. The presence of the DNA from unknown individuals was raised at trial, and Guidry has not shown that any additional probative evidence would result from learning the identities of the unknown individuals. The record shows that Guidry has not shown grounds for obtaining DNA testing, and his appeal presents no substantive nonfrivolous issues. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220; <em>United States v. Martin, </em>377 Fed.Appx. 395, 396 (5th Cir. 2010). Accordingly, Guidry\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IFP ON APPEAL DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b449-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
