Trimble pleaded guilty to one count of distributing crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). The presentence investigation report concluded that Trimble was responsible for 120.5 grams of crack cocaine, resulting in a base offense level of 32. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(4) (Nov. 2004). The PSI also noted that Trimble had not completed high school and that his employment history was minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">The PSI further detailed Trimble\u2019s criminal history, which began at a young age. Trimble was 25 years old when the PSI was prepared, and he already had convictions for (1) intentional battery on a police officer and resisting arrest, (2) attempted burglary of an occupied dwelling, and (3) driving with a suspended license and giving false information to a police officer. The PSI also indicated that Trimble had been arrested for (1) battery of a school employee, for which no action was taken; (2) possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, for which he was acquitted by a jury; and (3) carrying a concealed weapon and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, for which the charges were dismissed. Trimble\u2019s resulting criminal history category was III. Combined with an offense level of 32, Trimble\u2019s guidelines range was 151 to 188 months imprisonment. He was also subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">At Trimble\u2019s 2004 sentence hearing neither party objected to the factual findings or guidelines calculations in the PSI, and the court adopted those findings and calculations. The court sentenced Trimble to 176 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-12\">In 2008 Trimble filed a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 706 to the sentencing guidelines. The district court recognized that Amendment 706 reduced his base offense level from 32 to 30, resulting in an amended guidelines range of 121 to 151 months imprisonment. The court granted Trimble\u2019s motion and reduced his sentence to 151 months imprisonment. The court stated that it was \u201cnot persuaded that the defendant should reap any benefit, but ever mindful of the guidelines, the Court should offer some consensus on sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>In 2011 Trimble filed the present \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 750 to the sentencing guidelines. The district court recognized that Amendment 750 reduced his base offense level from 30 to 28. Combined with a criminal history category of III, Trimble\u2019s amended guidelines range ordinarily would have been 97 to 121 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, pt. A (Nov. 2011). But because Trimble was subject to a mandatory minimum term of 10 years, his amended guidelines range became 120 to 121 months imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5G1.1(c)(2) (Nov.2001). Although Trim-ble\u2019s guidelines range was lowered by Amendment 750, the district court denied his motion and did not reduce his 151-month sentence. This is Trimble\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">In considering a motion for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court must engage in a two-part analysis. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, \u201cthe court must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, if the defendant\u2019s guidelines range is reduced, the court must \u201cdecide whether, in its discretion, it will elect to impose the newly calculated sentence under the amended guidelines or retain the original sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781. The parties agree that the district court correctly recalculated Trimble\u2019s sentence under the amended guidelines, so the only question is whether the court abused its discretion in denying a sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cOnce it is established that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 applies, a district-court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">In denying Trimble\u2019s motion, the district court reasoned that Trimble had \u201ca very egregious criminal history, which began at a young age, as well as a limited education and a minimal work history.\u201d The court also noted that while it \u201cdid see fit to reduce [Trimblej\u2019s sentence in 2008, the 151-month sentence he is presently serving best addresses the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">Trimble contends that the district court abused its discretion by relying on \u201cimpermissible factors\u201d \u2014 his education and work background \u2014 in denying a sentence reduction. Relying on <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 95, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2045, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996), Trimble argues that \u201ceducation and vocational skills are discouraged factors that should be bases for departure only in exceptional cases.\u201d While that might be true, this is not a case involving a departure under Chapter 5 of the sentencing guidelines; instead, the district court refused to reduce Trimble\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). And in deciding whether to reduce that sentence, the district court was required to consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. Because one of those factors is the history and characteristics of the defendant, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), the district court did not abuse its discretion by considering Trim-ble\u2019s education and work history.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">Trimble also contends that the district court declined to reduce his sentence based on its consideration of his rehabilitative needs, which he claims was improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>under <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011). <em>Tapia, </em>however, held only that the text of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a) prevents a sentencing court from \u201cimposing] or lengthening] a prison sentence to enable an offender to complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2393. Here, the district court neither imposed a new sentence nor lengthened Trimble\u2019s sentence\u2014it merely refused to reduce it. Moreover, there is no indication that the district court refused to reduce Trimble\u2019s sentence so that he could complete a treatment program or to otherwise promote rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">Trimble further contends that the district court gave too much weight to his criminal history. That criminal history, however, goes to several of the factors that the court is required to consider under \u00a7 3553(a), including the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for adequate deterrence of criminal conduct, and protection of the public from further crimes of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). And \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Langston, </em>590 F.3d 1226, 1237 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). Given Trimble\u2019s steady record of arrests and convictions, the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding that Trimble\u2019s current sentence of 151 months \u201cbest addresses the factors set forth\u201d in \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">Trimble also claims that the district court relied on \u201cnew\u201d information to deny his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion without giving him an opportunity to respond to that new information. <em>See United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1245 (11th Cir.2010) (noting that \u201ceach party must be given notice of and an opportunity to contest new information relied on by the district court in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding\u201d). The district court, however, did not rely on any new information in denying Trimble\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. All of the information about his criminal history and educational and work background was contained in the PSI adopted by the court at the original sentence hearing, which Trim-ble never objected to.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">Finally, Trimble contends that the district court was required by the law of the case doctrine to grant his second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because it granted the first, knowing the same facts about his criminal history, limited education, and minimal work experience. The law of the case doctrine only prevents relitigation of a sentencing issue that has already been decided at an earlier stage of the case. <em>See United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1520 (11th Cir.1996). In granting Trimble\u2019s first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion under Amendment 706, the court made no specific statements about Trimble\u2019s education, work history, or criminal history. In fact, the court said that it was \u201cnot persuaded that [Trimble] should reap any benefit,\u201d but concluded that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, particularly the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, permitted a sentence of 151 months. Because Trimble now seeks to have his sentenced further reduced based on a different amendment to the guidelines, Trimble raises an issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>not decided in the first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. Accordingly, the law of the ease doctrine does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-7\">. Trimble asserts that he satisfied the district court's concern about his lack of education by getting his GED while in prison. Although the court might have considered that post-sentencing conduct, it was not required to do so. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(B)(iii) (stating that the court \"may\u201d consider post-sentencing conduct in deciding whether a reduction in sentence is warranted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b938-7\">. Trimble also argues that the court may not consider a prior arrest record alone in denying a motion for a sentence reduction. But Trimble\u2019s criminal history consisted of more than just arrests\u2014he also had multiple convictions. There is no indication that the court relied on only the arrests and not the convictions in refusing to reduce Trimble\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
