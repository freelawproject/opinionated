Bolles contends his sentence should be reversed and his case remanded for new sentencing because the district court erred by applying a two-level leadership-role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c) based on his direction and control over his personal driver, Franciscus Hartanto, whom Bolles claims was not a participant in the offense within the meaning of the Guidelines. Because we agree that the government failed to establish that Hartanto was a participant in the charged conspiracy when he acted as Bolles\u2019s driver, we conclude that the district court erred in applying the enhancement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">To qualify for the leadership-role enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1(c), the commentary to the Guidelines states that \u201cthe defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one of more other participants.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 2. \u201cParticipant\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 1. Although we review a sentencing court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in a crime for clear error, <em>United States v. Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d 1270, 1304 (11th Cir. 2006), \u201c[t]he district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 3B1.1 to determine that a person is a \u201cparticipant\u201d is a question of law that we review <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Williams, </em>527 F.3d 1235, 1249 (11th Cir. 2008). Here although Bolles exercised control over Hartanto to the extent of directing Hartanto where to drive him, the question before us is whether Hartanto\u2019s conduct as Bolles\u2019s chauffeur made him criminally responsible for the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">To be criminally responsible as a participant in a conspiracy, there must be \u201c(1) an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime, and (2) the [participant\u2019s] knowing and voluntary participation in the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Ohayon, </em>483 F.3d 1281, 1292 (11th Cir. 2007). The record here fails to demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>strate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that when Hartanto chauffeured Bolles there was either an agreement to transport drugs or that Hartanto knowingly and voluntarily participated in transporting drugs. <em>See United States v. Lawrence, </em>47 F.3d 1559, 1566 (11th Cir.1995) (holding that when a defendant challenges one of the factual bases of his sentence the Government has the burden to establish the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Bolles maintained that he hired Hartan-to simply because he did not have a license and needed someone to drive him from place to place, including for his legitimate business affairs. He admitted that while sometimes he would engage in drug transactions while Hartanto was driving him, Hartanto was not his \u201ccourier\u201d because Bolles exerted no control or influence over Hartanto in connection with these drug transactions. To rebut Bolles\u2019s explanation, the government called the lead agent on the case, who testified that Hartanto reported that he had been hired by Bolles because Bolles did not have a driver\u2019s license, and that although Hartanto \u201csuspected\u201d that drugs were involved in a number of his trips with Bolles, that Hartanto never saw any drugs himself. This testimony, without more, is insufficient to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Hartanto knowingly agreed to transport drugs as part of the conspiracy such that he was criminally responsible for the commission of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">We therefore vacate and remand for resentencing. Additionally, the district court\u2019s written judgment incorrectly reflects that Bolles was convicted of a cocaine offense, as well as MDMA. On remand, the district court should correct the clerical error in the judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-10\">. Bolles also contends that his sentence must be reversed because of constitutional and statutory error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). As we reverse Bolles's sentence as a result of the enhancement error, we need not resolve this claim because Bolles will have the full benefit of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the advisory nature of the sentencing guidelines upon resentencing. <em>Pepper v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 1251, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011) (noting that \"an appellate court when reversing one part of a defendant\u2019s sentence may vacate the entire sentence ... so that, on remand, the trial court can reconfigure the sentencing plan ... to satisfy the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b974-6\">. The final written judgment reflects Bolles\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of a mixture or substance containing cocaine and a quantity of MDMA, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)(ii), (b)(1)(C), and 846, when he was actually convicted only of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute an undisclosed quantity of MDMA, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C), and 846. We may <em>sua sponte </em>raise the issue of clerical errors in the judgment and remand with instructions to the district court to correct the errors. <em>United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 822 (11th Cir.2006), and we do so here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
