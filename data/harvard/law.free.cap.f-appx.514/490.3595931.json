He claims that the district court plainly erred in imposing a 16-level enhancement for committing a crime of violence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), based on Campos-Contreras\u2019s Texas convictions for burglary of a habitation with intent to commit theft. He contends that because his convictions fall under Texas\u2019s unique \u201cgreater right to possession\u201d theory, they do not constitute generic burglary convictions under <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), and therefore were not convictions for burglary of a dwelling under \u00a7 2L1.2. As Campos-Contreras did not raise this objection in the district court, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497-99 (5th Cir. 2012); <em>see also Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">We recently rejected this same contention in <em>United States v. Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d 410 (5th Cir.2013) (affirming a 16-level sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) based on a Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation under \u00a7 30.02(a)). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s 16-level enhancement in this case was not error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b513-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
