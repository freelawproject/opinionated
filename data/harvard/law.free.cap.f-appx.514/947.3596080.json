California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Joseph\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-18\">Nevertheless, because Joseph\u2019s criminal judgment contains two scrivener\u2019s errors, we issue a LIMITED REMAND for the district court to correct those errors, which will require the court to (1) alter the description of the offense in Count Two from \u201cDelivering a firearm for shipment to a common carrier with notice\u201d to \u201cDelivering a firearm for shipment to a common carrier without notice;\u201d and (2) correct a typographical error in Count Three, specifically, delete the additional \u201ct\u201d in the word \u201cthe.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
