During the removal proceedings, Mr. Marin testified that he was ridiculed in Transnistria because he was from Moldova, and that in Moldova, he was ridiculed because he had developed a Russian accent, which led Moldovans to perceive him as a Transnist-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>rian. He presented evidence of the hostilities between Moldovans and Transnistri-ans and described how he was frequently mocked and harassed because of his accent and ethnicity. Although the IJ found Mr. Marin to be a credible witness, he ultimately denied relief after concluding that the incidents described by Mr. Marin did not constitute past persecution. The IJ also concluded that Mr. Marin failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution. The BIA dismissed Mr. Marin\u2019s appeal after independently determining that he had not suffered past persecution and adopting the IJ\u2019s conclusions regarding future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">On appeal, Mr. Marin contends that the BIA erred in failing to adequately consider the aggregate effects of a \u201clifetime of marginalization, harassment, and discrimination.\u201d He also asserts that he established a well-founded fear of future persecution based on the violence that still exists in the region and the tension between Moldovans and Transnistrians.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After review, we disagree and deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision, and we must also examine the IJ\u2019s decision to the extent that it was expressly adopted by the BIA. <em>See Mohammed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>547 F.3d 1340, 1344 (11th Cir.2008). Findings of fact will not be disturbed if there is substantial evidence to support them, <em>see id., </em>and we give considerable deference to such findings, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision. <em>See Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">The Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security may grant asylum to an applicant who qualifies as a refugee. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-10\">[A]ny person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To prove past persecution, an asylum applicant must show that he was persecuted on account of a protected ground. <em>See Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir. 2006). Persecution has been defined as \u201can extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive [and] requires more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, unaccompanied by any physical punishment, infliction of harm, or significant deprivation of liberty.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Minor physical abuse, for example, does not amount to persecution. <em>See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 577 </em>F.3d 1341, 1353 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">We find no error in the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Marin suffered nothing more than discrimination and harassment which \u2014 though regrettable \u2014 do not amount to past persecution. The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>indicates that Mr. Marin was kicked and thrown in a canal by his fellow students, but these isolated incidents of minor physical abuse do not rise to the level of persecution. Even in the aggregate, the incidents described by Mr. Marin do not compel the conclusion that he suffered past persecution. <em>See Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1239 (\u201c[0]nly in a rare case does the record compel the conclusion that an applicant for asylum suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Similarly, Mr. Marin failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution. Generalized conditions in a country are insufficient to establish persecution. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 n. 7 (11th Cir.2005). Although the record indicates general civil unrest in the region, Mr. Marin has not shown specific facts indicating that he will be persecuted in Moldova because of his Russian accent or any perceived affiliation with Transnistria. Accordingly, we deny Mr. Marin\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Petition Denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b970-16\">. The Immigration Judge also denied Mr. Marin's request for withholding of removal and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16-1208.18. Mr. Marin does not challenge the denial of CAT relief on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b971-8\">. To the extent that Mr. Marin seeks review of the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal, we do not have jurisdiction over that claim because he did not raise it in his notice of appeal to the BIA, <em>see </em>Notice of Appeal from a Decision of an Immigration Judge, \u00b6 6 [A.R. at 63-64] (assigning error to the IJ's finding on past and future persecution), and his brief before the BIA offered no substantive argument on the issue. <em>See Seek v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>663 F.3d 1356, 1367 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
