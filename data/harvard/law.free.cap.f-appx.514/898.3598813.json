On appeal, Baird argues that: (1) the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to prove that he possessed a firearm; (2) \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional in light of <em>District of Columbia v. Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008); (3) the district court should have recognized an affirmative \u201csafekeeping\u201d defense to \u00a7 922(g); (4) the district court erred in finding that his prior convictions for second-degree burglary and third-degree burglary were \u201cviolent felonies\u201d within the meaning of the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (\u201cACCA\u201d); and (5) the ACCA\u2019s residual clause is unconstitutionally vague. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal on sufficiency of evidence grounds. <em>United States v. Friske, </em>640 F.3d 1288, 1290 (11th Cir.2011). We review the constitutionality of statutes <em>de novo. United States v. Reynolds, </em>215 F.3d 1210, 1212 (11th Cir.2000). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s ruling that a conviction qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>466 F.3d 1271, 1273 (11th Cir.2006). However, issues not raised at trial are reviewed only for plain error. <em>United States v. Swatzie, </em>228 F.3d 1278, 1281 (11th Cir. 2000). To establish plain error, a defendant must show that there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) affects substantial rights, and (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn error is plain if it is obvious and clear under current law.\u201d <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 948 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">First, we reject Baird\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he possessed a firearm. In ruling on a sufficiency of evidence claim, we consider \u201cthe evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in the Government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Friske, </em>640 F.3d at 1290-91 (quotation omitted). The evidence need not be inconsistent with every reasonable hypothesis except that of a defendant\u2019s guilt, and the jury is free to choose among the reasonable conclusions drawn from the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1291. Credibility questions are answered by the jury, and we will assume that the jury answered them all in a manner that supports the verdict. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>473 F.3d 1137, 1142 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">For a violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1), the government must prove \u201c(1) that the defendant was a convicted felon, (2) that the defendant was in knowing possession of a firearm, and (3) that the firearm was in or affecting interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Deleveaux, </em>205 F.3d 1292, 1296-97 (11th Cir.2000). To establish the knowing-possession element \u201c[t]he prosecution need show only that the defendant consciously possessed what he knew to be a firearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1298. Actual or constructive possession is sufficient to support a conviction for unlawful possession under \u00a7 922(g). <em>United States v. Pedro, </em>999 F.2d 497, 500 (11th Cir.1993). \u201cA defendant has constructive possession if he exercises ownership, dominion, or control over the firearm.\u201d <em>United States v. Gunn, </em>369 F.3d 1229, 1235 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cA defendant also has constructive possession if he has the power and intention to exercise dominion or control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A defendant\u2019s presence in the vicinity of a firearm or mere association with another who pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>sesses a firearm is insufficient to constitute constructive possession, but the firearm need not be on or near the defendant to amount to knowing possession. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>661 F.3d 568, 576 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1943, 182 L.Ed.2d 799 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">In this appeal, Baird\u2019s possession of a firearm is the only element in dispute. As the record shows, sufficient evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the government, established Baird\u2019s knowing, constructive possession of the firearms: (1) Baird provided a written statement providing that he removed his father\u2019s guns in 2008; (2) Baird moved into the second level of the house in 2009; (3) Baird moved into the basement in December 2010; (4) Baird offered to sell Edwards the firearms \u201ctwo or three weeks\u201d after moving to the basement; and (5) the firearms were plainly visible in the basement on February 6, 2011. This evidence allowed the jury to reasonably infer that Baird exercised dominion and control over the firearms in 2008, when he removed them from his father, in 2009 or 2010, when he moved them to the basement, and in 2010, when he offered to sell the firearms to Matthew Edwards. And it certainly showed more than his mere presence in the area of the firearms. Thus, the jury reasonably could have inferred that Baird had not ceased to exercise such control over the firearms on February 6, 2011, and that he was guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm under \u00a7 922(g)(1). <em>See Friske, </em>640 F.3d at 1290-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">As for Baird\u2019s argument that the firearms were not plainly visible, that Matthew Bales never saw the firearms, and that there was no testimony that he was in area of the basement where the firearms were stored, the testimony of Deputy Jared Hopper and Edwards testimony contradicts those arguments, especially when viewed in a light most favorable to the verdict. To the extent Baird challenges the credibility of Edwards or the deputies, the jury answers credibility questions, and we assume the jury answered them in a way that supports the verdict. <em>Thompson, </em>473 F.3d at 1142. Because a reasonable juror could have found Baird\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, sufficient evidence supports his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">Next, we find no merit in Baird\u2019s claim that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional. The Second Amendment states that \u201c[a] well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. II. In <em>Heller, </em>the Supreme Court interpreted this language to \u201cguarantee [an] individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.\u201d 554 U.S. at 592, 128 S.Ct. 2783. The <em>Heller </em>Court held that the District of Columbia\u2019s ban on handgun possession in the home by law-abiding citizens violated the Second Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 635, 128 S.Ct. 2783. The Court qualified the right to bear arms, stating that \u201c[l]ike most rights, [it] is not unlimited,\u201d and that \u201cnothing in <em>[Heller </em>] should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 626, 128 S.Ct. 2783. In a footnote, the Court clarified that the enumerated \u201cpresumptively lawful regulatory measures [are] only [] examples; [this] list does not purport to be exhaustive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 627 n. 26, 128 S.Ct. 2783.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">After <em>Heller, </em>we held that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is a \u201cconstitutional avenue to restrict the Second Amendment right of\u2019 convicted felons. <em>United States v. Rozier, </em>598 F.3d 768, 771 (11th Cir.2010). Noting that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number><em>Heller </em>Court specifically disclaimed any erosion of the \u201clongstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons,\u201d we said that \u201cstatutes disqualifying felons from possessing a firearm under any and all circumstances do not offend the Second Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We are bound by prior panel decisions unless or until they are overruled by the Supreme Court or by us sitting <em>en banc. United States v. Jordan, </em>635 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 356, 181 L.Ed.2d 225 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Here, the district court did not err in convicting Baird of violating \u00a7 922(g)(1). Since <em>Heller, </em>we have held that \u00a7 922(g)(1) does not violate the Second Amendment, and that decision has not been overruled by us sitting en banc or by the Supreme Court. <em>See Jordan, </em>635 F.3d at 1189; <em>Rozier, </em>598 F.3d at 771. Baird\u2019s argument is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Third, we are unpersuaded by Baird\u2019s claim that the district court plainly erred in failing to recognize an affirmative \u201csafekeeping\u201d defense to \u00a7 922(g). For starters, we review this issue for plain error because even though Baird explained to the district court that he only possessed the firearms to take them away from his father at the advice of his father\u2019s physician, he did not argue that the district court should adopt an affirmative safekeeping defense to cover such conduct. In this Court, Baird acknowledges that we\u2019ve never held that there is an affirmative defense for safekeeping. Because Baird cites no authority establishing that the district court erred in failing to <em>sua sponte </em>recognize an affirmative safekeeping defense to \u00a7 922(g), the error could not be plain, and Baird\u2019s claim fails. <em>See Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d at 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">Fourth, we disagree with Baird\u2019s claim that his prior convictions for second-degree burglary and third-degree burglary do not constitute \u201cviolent felonies\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. The Alabama second-degree burglary statute in effect at the time of Baird\u2019s prior convictions provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-10\">(a) A person commits [second-degree burglary] if he knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit theft or a felony therein and, if in effecting entry or while in the building or in immediate flight therefrom, the person or another participant in the crime:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-11\">(1) Is armed with explosives or a deadly weapon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-12\">(2) Causes physical injury to any person who is not a participant in the crime; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-13\">(3) Uses or threatens the immediate use of a dangerous instrument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-14\">(b) In the alternative to subsection (a) of this section, a person commits [second-degree burglary] if he unlawfully enters a lawfully occupied dwelling-house with intent to commit a theft or a felony therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-15\">Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-7-6(a), (b) (1975). Third-degree burglary in Alabama at the time of Baird\u2019s prior convictions required a person to knowingly enter and remain unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 13A-7-7(a). The Alabama code defined \u201cbuilding\u201d for the purposes of burglary offenses to include, inter alia, any \u201cvehicle, aircraft or watercraft\u201d used for lodging or business purposes. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 13A-7-1(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-16\">Under the ACCA, a defendant is subject to a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence if he violates \u00a7 922(g) and has 3 distinct prior convictions for a violent felony, serious drug offense, or both. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The ACCA defines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>[A]ny crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-5\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-6\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-7\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii). The ACCA provides that a \u201cburglary\u201d that is punishable by more than a year in prison is a violent felony. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Alabama law makes second-degree burglary a Class B felony, which is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 13A-7-6(c), 13A-5-6(a)(2) (1975). In <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), the Supreme Court held that a person has been convicted of burglary for purposes of the ACCA if he is convicted of any crime, regardless of its exact definition or label, having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime. The Supreme Court also noted that some burglary statutes define burglary more broadly than generic burglary, such as by including boats or cars among property that may be burglarized. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">A conviction under a non-generic burglary statute still qualifies as a \u201cburglary\u201d under the ACCA if the defendant was actually found guilty of the elements of generic burglary. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143. In determining whether a conviction under a non-generic burglary statute qualifies as generic burglary, courts employ the \u201cmodified categorical approach,\u201d which allows the court to determine which statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction by consulting the trial records, including charging documents. <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>United States v. Sneed, </em>600 F.3d 1326, 1330-32 (11th Cir.2010). We have held that a defendant\u2019s previous third-degree burglary convictions in Alabama counted for ACCA purposes because the indictments charged the defendant with burglary of the \u201cbuilding of Richie\u2019s Shoe Store, Inc.\u201d and \u201cbuilding of, to wit: Whiddon\u2019s Gulf Service Station,\u201d which, as a shoe store and service station, respectively, were places that generally fell within the scope of generic burglary. <em>United States v. Rainer, </em>616 F.3d 1212, 1216 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">Under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause, a crime that \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d also is a violent felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). If we cannot determine from the record whether a conviction under a non-generic burglary statute was a burglary of a building, we consider whether the conviction satisfies the residual clause. <em>See Matthews, </em>466 F.3d at 1274-75 (holding that a defendant who was not convicted of generic burglary was nevertheless convicted of violent crimes under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause). Burglary is dangerous because it can end in a confrontation or violence. <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 2273, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011). Offenses that are not strict liability, negligence, or recklessness crimes qualify as crimes of violence under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause if they categorically pose a serious potential risk of physical injury similar to the risk posed by an enumerated crime. <em>United States v. Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d 971, 979 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">Here, the parties agree that Alabama\u2019s second-degree and third-degree burglary statutes are non-generic burglary statutes, since the Code broadly defines the term \u201cbuilding\u201d to include vehicles. Ala.Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>\u00a7 13A-7-1(2) (1975). However, Baird\u2019s burglary convictions could still qualify as a \u201cburglary\u201d within the meaning of the ACCA if he was guilty of the elements of generic burglary, as demonstrated by the proper <em>Shepard </em>documents. <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254; <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143. To the extent Baird argues that no such <em>Shepard </em>documents were introduced, the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) referred to the underlying indictment for each predicate offense, and charging documents are acceptable under <em>Shepard. </em>Thus, as in <em>Rainer, </em>the district court here was permitted to conclude that Baird\u2019s burglary of \u201cEl Gringo\u2019s Mexican Restaurant\u201d was a burglary of a building, and, in turn, qualified as generic burglary. <em>Rainer, </em>616 F.3d at 1216. On this record, we ascertain no error in the court\u2019s determination determined that one of Baird\u2019s third-degree burglary convictions qualified as \u201cburglary\u201d for purposes of the ACCA enhancement. <em>See Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">As for whether the district court erred in determining that Baird\u2019s nine second-degree burglary convictions fell under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause, second-degree burglary is similar in kind to the risk posed by the most similar enumerated offense in the ACCA, namely, generic burglary. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>608 F.3d 1222, 1227 (11th Cir.2010). Generic burglary poses a risk of physical injury due to the potential for a violent confrontation. <em>See Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2273. Baird\u2019s prior second-degree burglary convictions carried a risk of physical injury equal to, or greater than, generic burglary because each offense involved possession of a firearm by Baird or a codefendant. Although the relevant Alabama second-degree burglary statute could have included burglary of vehicles used for lodging or business \u2014 suggesting that the risk of a confrontation could be diminished \u2014 there is still some potential for a confrontation. Indeed, because the statute requires, <em>inter alia, </em>that the defendant be armed with explosives or a deadly weapon, the risk of such a confrontation involving a deadly weapon is greater than in a generic burglary. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 13A-7-1(2), 13A-7-6(a)(1) (1975). Accordingly, the district court did not err in finding that Baird\u2019s nine convictions for second-degree burglary fell under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause and qualified as predicate offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Finally, Baird argues that the ACCA\u2019s residual clause is unconstitutionally vague. However, we have just rejected that argument, in binding precedent. <em>See United States v. Gandy, </em>710 F.3d 1234, 1238-39 (11th Cir.2013). Accordingly, Baird\u2019s claim has no merit, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
