In case number 12-11538, Defendants/Appellants Wall Street Equity Group, Inc. and Steven S. West (collectively \u201cAppellants\u201d) challenge the district court\u2019s order denying their motion for attorney\u2019s fees and granting Plaintiff/Appellee Richard B. Mayer\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees. In case number 12-14411, Appellants challenge the district court\u2019s order granting in part Mayer\u2019s supplemental motion for fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">The underlying case involves Mayer\u2019s complaint against Appellants for overtime pay pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d). Mayer and his employer, West, had, as a magistrate judge describes it, \u201ca falling out.\u201d [R. 63 at 2.] Mayer believed that he was entitled to unpaid overtime compensation, so he sought out Attorney Robert S. Norell and asked him to file suit against West, which Norell did promptly. Appellants answered Mayer\u2019s complaint, twice admitting that Mayer \u201cmay be due some overtime,\u201d [R. 5 at 2-3, \u00b6\u00b6 12,17], although Appellants later denied that Mayer was entitled to overtime pay. At some point, West, without his attorney\u2019s assistance, contacted Mayer \u2014 not Norell\u2014 to negotiate a settlement. Norell was not invited to the discussion, and Mayer accepted a settlement from Appellants without any consideration of Norell\u2019s fees and costs. The settlement agreement provides that Mayer should instruct Norell to \u201cwithdraw the lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d [R. 22-1 at 1, 117.] Upon notice of the settlement, the district court dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Norell filed a motion, on behalf of his former client, for fees and costs pursuant to the FLSA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b) (entitling a prevailing plaintiff to attorney\u2019s fees and costs). Appellants opposed Mayer\u2019s motion, arguing that Mayer was not a prevailing party. They also filed their own motion for attorney\u2019s fees, alleging that Norell brought Mayer\u2019s complaint in bad faith and that he unreasonably and vexatiously multiplied case proceedings. Attached to Appellants\u2019 fee motion was an Affidavit from Mayer, now restored in his relationship with West, alleging, among other things, that Norell failed to consider Mayer\u2019s best interests before hastily suing Appellants and that Norell was a \u201cgreedy attorney\u201d who \u201cruin[ed] [Mayer\u2019s] life.\u201d [R. 20-2 at 5, \u00b6\u00b6 10,12.]</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">Initially, the district court denied Appellants\u2019 fee motion without an explanation while Mayer\u2019s fee motion remained pending. The court likewise denied without explanation Appellants\u2019 motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Later, a magistrate judge held an evidentiary hearing, heard the testimony of Norell, Mayer, and West, and entered a report and recommendation that Mayer\u2019s fee motion be granted, that he be awarded $6,755 in fees and $400 in costs, and that Appellants\u2019 motion for fees be denied. The magistrate judge found that Mayer\u2019s testimony against Norell, crucial to Appellants\u2019 fee motion, was \u201cinconsistent at best,\u201d and that Mayer \u201chad a financial interest in supporting [Appellants]\u201d in the fee dispute. [R. 63 at 3.] The court further found that Mayer\u2019s motion was due to be granted because Appellants and Mayer attempted to deprive Norell of his fees and costs. After reviewing Appellants\u2019 objections to the recommendation <em>de novo, </em>the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, granted Mayer\u2019s motion, and denied Appellants\u2019 motion. Appellants brought their timely appeal in case number 12-11538.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">A month later, Norell filed a supplemental motion for attorney\u2019s fees and reasonable expenses of litigation. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>court referred that motion to a different magistrate judge. Appellants opposed the motion. The magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant Mayer\u2019s supplemental attorney\u2019s fees motion in part to compensate him for his litigation of his entitlement to fees. Appellants filed objections. The district court reviewed the objections <em>de novo </em>before overruling the same, adopting the recommendation, and awarding Mayer an additional $13,055 in attorney\u2019s fees. Appellants brought their timely appeal in case number 12-14411.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-3\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">\u201cWe review the award of attorneys\u2019 fees for abuse of discretion, but closely scrutinize questions of law decided by the district court in reaching the fee award.\u201d <em>Hollis v. Roberts, </em>984 F.2d 1159, 1160 (11th Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWhen employing an abuse-of-discretion standard, we must affirm unless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment, or has applied the wrong legal standard.\u201d <em>Amlong &amp; Amlong, P.A. v. Denny\u2019s, Inc., </em>500 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">Whether a plaintiff is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d is a question of law which we review <em>de novo. Dionne v. Floormasters Enters., Inc., </em>667 F.3d 1199, 1203 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">Although there are some statutory exceptions, litigants ordinarily are expected to bear their own attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to the \u201cAmerican Rule.\u201d <em>Dionne, </em>667 F.3d at 1205. In this case, however, both sides contend that the other is responsible for their attorney\u2019s fees. We first consider the propriety of the district court\u2019s denial of Appellants\u2019 fee motion, and then the grant of Mayer\u2019s original fee motion and supplemental fee motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">A. <em>Appellants\u2019fee motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">Appellants allege that the district court abused its discretion in denying their fee motion. As a fundamental criticism, Appellants assert that the district court failed to give an explanation for its denial of Appellants\u2019 fee motion. We require that district courts articulate principled reasons supporting their decisions to award or deny fees so that we can conduct meaningful review. <em>See Am. Civil Liberties Union of Ga. v. Barnes, </em>168 F.3d 423, 427 (11th Cir.1999). But contrary to Appellants\u2019 assertion, the district court\u2019s adoption of the first magistrate judge\u2019s reasoned report and recommendation supplies us with the district court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">Appellants are correct that in exceptional circumstances a defendant can recover attorney\u2019s fees when the plaintiff brings a suit in bad faith. <em>See Turlington v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., </em>135 F.3d 1428, 1437 (11th Cir.1998) (noting that \u201cthis court has held that the FLSA entitles a prevailing defendant to attorney\u2019s fees only where the district court finds that the plaintiff litigated in bad faith\u201d). However, Appellants\u2019 allegations of bad faith depend heavily upon the veracity of Mayer\u2019s self-contradictory and self-serving testimony against Norell, and the district court rejected Mayer\u2019s testimony as unreliable. As for Appellants\u2019 contention that they are entitled to fees because Norell vexatiously multiplied case proceedings by initiating a frivolous suit, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, Appellants have not credibly and substantially demonstrated conduct \u201cso egregious that it is tantamount to bad faith.\u201d <em>Amlong &amp; Amlong, P.A., </em>500 F.3d at 1239 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Appellants cannot show that the district court abused its discretion in finding that Norell did not litigate in bad faith, we affirm the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>district court\u2019s denial of Appellants\u2019 fee motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">B. <em>Mayer\u2019s fee motion and supplemental fee motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Appellants also argue that the district court abused its discretion in granting Mayer\u2019s original and supplemental fee motions because Mayer was not a prevailing party entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees under the FLSA. Appellants allege that their settlement with Mayer is not evidence that Mayer prevailed because, after investigating further, Appellants and Mayer agreed that Mayer was not actually entitled to overtime pay. Thus, they contend that neither (1) the settlement agreement, which states that \u201c[Appellants] will determine how much overtime [Mayer was] entitled to and how much overpayment [Mayer] had, and [Appellants] will give [Mayer] a check for payment in full,\u201d [R. 22-1 at 1, \u00b6 2], nor (2) their pleading admitting that Mayer might have been owed some overtime pay, are indicative that Mayer actually prevailed. The record shows that Mayer received as his settlement \u201csomewhere around $900.\u201d [R. 62 at 12-13.] But Appellants insist that the payment was not for unpaid overtime; rather, it represented resolution of the parties\u2019 \u201cnon-overtime differences.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 19, case number 12-11538.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">Appellants also challenge the district court\u2019s legal basis for the fee awards, and on this point they raise an issue that requires <em>de novo </em>review. The magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation on the original fee motion framed the issue of whether Norell could collect his fees as being a question of \u201cwhether or not [Appellants and Mayer] made an agreement that deprives [Norell] of his fees and costs.\u201d [R. 63 at 2.] In concluding that the parties cooperated to deprive Norell of his fees, the recommendation cites <em>Brown v. Vermont Mutual Insurance Co., </em>614 So.2d 574, 579-80 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.1993), for the proposition that a Florida plaintiffs acceptance of a settlement does not relieve a defendant of a statutory obligation to pay the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fee. <em>Brown </em>discusses not the FLSA, but Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.428, a statute entitling an insured to attorney\u2019s fees upon entry of a judgment against an insurer. Thus, Appellants argue, in their first appeal, that <em>Brown </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">While <em>Brown, </em>like the instant case, involved a defendant and plaintiff settling their dispute without plaintiffs counsel\u2019s notice or knowledge, and while we agree that Florida law is clear that such a settlement \u201coperates as a fraud upon the [plaintiffs] attorney,\u201d <em>Brown, </em>614 So.2d at 580, <em>Brown </em>does not answer the more foundational question of whether Mayer is actually a prevailing party under the FLSA entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">In the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation on Mayer\u2019s supplemental motion for fees, the court did address meaningfully the prevailing party issue and concluded that \u201cMayer is the prevailing party in this FLSA case by virtue of the Court\u2019s Final Order of Dismissal dismissing the case in accordance with the parties\u2019 settlement agreement and reserving ruling on attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d [R. 83 at 7.] The recommendation on the supplemental fee motion cites <em>Goss v. Killian Oaks House of Learning, </em>248 F.Supp.2d 1162, 1167 (S.D.Fla.2003), for its holding that \u201ca <em>court\u2019s approval of a settlement </em>or retention of jurisdiction to enforce a settlement is a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1167 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Am. Disability Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Chmielarz, </em>289 F.3d 1315, 1320 (11th Cir.2002)). In the appeal of the order granting Mayer\u2019s supplemental fee motion, Appellants do not criticize <em>Goss, </em>but they generally renew their past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>objections that Mayer is not entitled to fees in this case. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. at 9-10, case number 12-14411.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">The FLSA instructs that, <em>\u201cin addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff,\u201d </em>for unpaid overtime compensation, the court <em>\u201cshall ... </em>allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to be paid by the defendant, and costs of the action.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b) (emphasis added). Construing this statute according to its ordinary meaning, we have said that \u201c[t]he FLSA plainly requires that the plaintiff receive <em>a judgment in his favor </em>to be entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d <em>Dionne, </em>667 F.3d at 1205 (emphasis added). Likewise, the Supreme Court, considering the fee-shifting provisions of two federal statutes<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> allowing courts to award attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party, has recognized that a plaintiff is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d only when he obtains either (1) a judgment on the merits, or (2) a settlement agreement <em>\u201cenforced through a consent </em>decree.\u201d <em>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep\u2019t. of Health and Human Res., </em>532 U.S. 598, 603-604, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 1839-40, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001) (emphasis added), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds, </em>Open Government Act of 2007, Pub.L. No. 110-175, 121 Stat. 2524. The <em>Buckhannon </em>Court reasoned that a prevailing party needs a judgment or consent decree to prove that there has been an \u201calteration in the legal relationship of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605, 121 S.Ct. at 1840. Thus, in the absence of a judgment on the merits, to be a prevailing party, the FLSA plaintiff needs a stipulated or consent judgment from the district court evincing the court\u2019s determination that the settlement \u201cis a fair and reasonable res[o]lution of a bona fide dispute over FLSA provisions.\u201d <em>Lynn\u2019s Food Stores, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Labor, </em>679 F.2d 1350, 1355 (11th Cir.1982); <em>see also Dionne, </em>667 F.3d at 1205 (requiring a judgment in the plaintiffs favor and reasoning that a district court\u2019s \u201cminimal participation in [a] case is insufficient to give the case the \u2018judicial <em>imprimatur\u2019 </em>necessary for a party to prevail\u201d (quoting <em>Buckhannon </em>532 U.S. at 605, 121 S.Ct. at 1840)). We have also held that if the district court \u201ceither incorporates the terms of [the parties\u2019] settlement into its final order of dismissal or expressly retains jurisdiction to enforce [the] settlement,\u201d these judicial actions serve as the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a consent decree in compliance with <em>Buckhannon. Chmielarz, </em>289 F.3d at 1320.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">Norell contends that the district court\u2019s dismissal order satisfies <em>Buckhannon. </em>Although Mayer\u2019s motion requests that the court \u201capprove the parties\u2019 settlement, deem [Mayer] to be the prevailing party, and retain jurisdiction to determine the amount of [Mayer]\u2019s reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and litigation expenses,\u201d [R. 12 at 5], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>the district court\u2019s \u201cFINAL ORDER OF DISMISSAL,\u201d does not \u201cgrant\u201d the motion, identify Mayer as the prevailing party, or officially sanction the terms of the parties\u2019 settlement. Neither does it incorporate the settlement\u2019s terms or retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement. <em>See Chmielarz, </em>289 F.3d at 1320. Rather, it states: \u201cIt is ADJUDGED that in light of the parties settling this actionf,] this case is DISMISSED in accordance with the settlement agreement. The Court reserves ruling to address the entitlement and amount of attorney\u2019s fees until such time as a motion on both issues is before the Court.\u201d [R. 13 at 1.] The second magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, citing <em>Goss, </em>viewed the district court\u2019s order as being sufficient to confer prevailing party status upon Mayer. However, even if we assume that <em>Goss </em>is an accurate application of <em>Buckhannon, Goss </em>is distinguishable from the case proceedings in this case. The district court in <em>Goss </em>\u201centered the order submitted by Plaintiffs counsel ... which <em>approved </em>the settlement.\u201d <em>Goss, </em>248 F.Supp.2d at 1165 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the instant case, there was no approval of the settlement. At best, it could be said that the court was <em>aware of </em>the terms of the parties\u2019 settlement. But the Supreme Court has said that \u201c[a] judge\u2019s mere awareness and approval of the terms of [a] settlement agreement do not suffice to make [the terms] part of his order[,]\u201d thereby giving the court \u201cancillary jurisdiction to enforce an agreement.\u201d <em>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>511 U.S. 375, 381, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 1677, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Although it does not appear that the district court intended or appreciated the deficiency in its order dismissing the case, we must conclude that the order does not satisfy the FLSA\u2019s general \u201cjudgment\u201d requirement, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b), or our specific requirement of a stipulated judgment or consent decree enforcing a settlement, <em>see Lynn\u2019s Food Stores, </em>679 F.2d at 1353, 1355. Moreover, the district court\u2019s reliance on <em>Brown, </em>in its adoption of the first magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, was misplaced. The unusual circumstances surrounding Mayer\u2019s negotiation and acceptance of a settlement do not, by themselves, entitle Norell to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the FLSA. Therefore, because Mayer is not an FLSA prevailing party, the district court erred in granting Mayer\u2019s original and supplemental fee motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">Although Appellants further argue that Mayer\u2019s motions were due to be denied because Norell litigated in bad faith, we again reject those arguments and defer to the credibility determinations of the district court expressed in the first magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. And because we hold that Mayer was not a prevailing party, we do not reach Appellants\u2019 arguments in case number 12-14411 concerning the excessiveness or unreasonableness of the fees claimed in Mayer\u2019s supplemental fee motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">In summary, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellants\u2019 fee motion. No extraordinary circumstances entitle Appellants to recover their attorney\u2019s fees. However, the district court erred in granting Mayer\u2019s original and supplemental fee motions when Mayer was not a prevailing FLSA plaintiff. Accordingly, in case number 12-11538, we affirm in part and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>verse in part the district court\u2019s order adopting the first magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. In case number 12-14411, we reverse the district court\u2019s order adopting the second magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-6\">. For the sake of clarity with respect to the alignment of the original parties, we refer to Norell\u2019s requests for fees as <em>Mayer's </em>fee motions, although the motions could also be characterized as Norell\u2019s fee motions, because Mayer is no longer his client and has, for purposes of the fee dispute, allied himself with Appellants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b953-11\">. Appellants sought our review of the first order denying their fee motion and the order denying reconsideration. We dismissed their appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Mayer\u2019s motion remained pending. <em>See Mayer v. Wall St. Equity Grp., Inc., </em>672 F.3d 1222, 1224 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b956-5\">. <em>Buckhannon </em>discusses the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b956-6\">. While we are unaware of any other circuit opinions applying <em>Buckhannon </em>to FLSA attorney\u2019s fees questions, other circuits are in accord in their application of <em>Buckhannon </em>to fee requests brought pursuant to other federal fee-shifting statutes such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act. <em>See, e.g., Bill M. ex rel.
