The presentence investigation report concluded that Beauvais was responsible for 50.9 grams of crack cocaine. Based on that quantity, the PSR assigned a base offense level of 32, which became his total offense level because no other adjustments applied. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2D1.1(e)(4) (Nov.2001). Be-auvais\u2019 criminal history category was I, resulting in a guidelines range of 121 to 151 months imprisonment. Beauvais was also subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 240 months because he had a prior drug conviction. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2001). Because the statutory mandatory minimum sentence was greater than the otherwise applicable guidelines range, the statutory mandatory minimum of 240 months became Beauvais\u2019 guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(2). In 2002 the district court sentenced him to the mandatory minimum term of 240 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-23\">In 2011 Beauvais, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed a motion to reduce his sentence under 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), contending that Amendment 750 to the sentencing guidelines and the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 had reduced his guidelines range. The district court denied that motion, concluding that Beauvais was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because he was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 240 months. This is Beauvais\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Beauvais contends that Amendment 750 lowered his base offense level and that under the Fair Sentencing Act, he would be subject to a mandatory minimum of only 120 months instead of 240 months. But even if the Fair Sentencing Act would lower the mandatory minimum sentence applicable to him, that Act does not apply retroactively to defendants like Beauvais who were sentenced before its enactment in 2010. <em>See United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, No. 11-15933, 2013 WL 978695, at *5 (11th Cir.2013). \u201c[Wjhen a defendant\u2019s sentence is based on a statutory mandatory minimum under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) that is above the applicable guidelines range, Amendment 750 does not lower that guidelines sentence, and the defendant is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540, 2013 WL 978695, at *3 (quotation marks omitted). Because Beauvais\u2019 sentence of 240 months was based on the statutory mandatory minimum under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), which is above the otherwise applicable guidelines range, Amendment 750 did not lower Beauvais\u2019 guidelines range and he is not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
