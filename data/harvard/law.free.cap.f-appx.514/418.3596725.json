The district court found that Trigg was not eligible for a reduction because he had been sentenced pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 rather than U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary reduction of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the applicable sentencing range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). A district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, and its interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). Because the district court\u2019s denial of Trigg\u2019s motion was based on its determination that Trigg was not eligible for a reduction, review is de novo. <em>See Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-19\">Trigg was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm (count one), possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute (count two), and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime (count three). The district court grouped counts one and two together pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(c). The guideline provision applicable to count one, \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), rather than the guideline provision applicable to count two, \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(10), produced the highest offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.3(a). The district court therefore relied soley on \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) to determine Trigg\u2019s advisory guidelines range of imprisonment for counts one and two. Accordingly, Trigg \u201cwas not sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 &amp; n. 8 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court was correct in concluding that Trigg was not eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See id. </em>at 790-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
