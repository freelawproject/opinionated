By-moving to proceed IFP, Johnson challenges the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o).\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, while the court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Johnson\u2019s argument that the district court engaged in impermissible \u201cdouble counting\u201d by considering factors that it had considered at his initial sentencing hearing and which were considered by the Sentencing Commission in reducing the guidelines range is unavailing because the district court must \u201cconsider any applicable [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determine whether, in its discretion,\u201d any reduction is warranted under the particular facts of the case. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). To the extent that Johnson relies on the law of the case doctrine, \u201c[t]he law of the case doctrine posits that ordinarily an issue of fact or law decided on appeal may not be reexamined either by the district court on remand or by the appellate court on subsequent appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 320 (5th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Johnson has not identified any issue of fact or law decided by this court on appeal and reexamined by the district court on remand, his law-of-the-case argument also is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-16\">Because the district court considered Johnson\u2019s motion and applied the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in its determination that a sentence reduction was not warranted, Johnson has not demonstrated that he will present a nonfrivolous issue with respect to the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2691-92; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). His request for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b480-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
