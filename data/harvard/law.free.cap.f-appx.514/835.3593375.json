Because we conclude that the district court lacked jurisdiction over Bailey\u2019s motion, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">In 1997, Bailey was convicted of two counts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base. Because Bailey had pri- or convictions, the government filed an information and notice under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 to seek enhanced penalties. The court ultimately sentenced Bailey to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. This court affirmed the convictions and sentences on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Thereafter, Bailey filed numerous unsuccessful post-conviction motions. He then filed the instant motion entitled \u201cNunc Pro Tunc Motion for Correction of an Issue Required Now That Was Required Then (Being Time of Sentence) as the Court Lacked Jurisdiction to Impose the Sentence.\u201d In this motion, as in previous motions, Bailey challenged the propriety of the \u00a7 851 notice and the district court\u2019s jurisdiction to sentence him based on an enhanced penalty. The district court denied the motion. Bailey now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court properly exercised jurisdiction over a claim. <em>United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1315 (11th Cir.2002). Where a district court lacked jurisdiction, we have jurisdiction only for the limited purpose of correcting the district court\u2019s error in entertaining the claim. <em>See Williams v. Chatman, </em>510 F.3d 1290, 1294-95 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), the district court has jurisdiction to modify an imposed term of imprisonment only under specific circumstances. <em>Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d at 1315-16. For example, a federal prisoner seeking relief from his conviction or confinement may file, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, a motion to vacate in the district court. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). A prisoner may not, however, file a second or successive petition under \u00a7 2255 unless and until we grant certification. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h); <em>Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d at 1316. Absent such permission, the district court lacks jurisdiction to address the petition and must dismiss it. <em>United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1175 (11th Cir.2005). We will look beyond the label of a prisoner\u2019s post-conviction motion to determine if he is, in substance, seeking relief under \u00a7 2255. <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1323 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">To obtain a sentencing enhancement based upon a defendant\u2019s prior conviction, the government must comply with the notice requirements set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1). <em>Perez v. United States, </em>249 F.3d 1261, 1264 (11th Cir.2001). But \u00a7 851 does not itself provide a mechanism for a collateral attack upon a sentence, nor does it grant the district court power to alter a sentence. <em>See generally </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. Rather, a prisoner\u2019s claim that his sentence was imposed in violation of \u00a7 851(a) is cognizable under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Harris v. United States, </em>149 F.3d 1304, 1307 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">To the extent Bailey\u2019s motions challenged the validity of his 360-month sentence based upon the jurisdictional adequacy of the \u00a7 851 enhancement, it should have been construed by the district court as a \u00a7 2255 motion. Because Bailey has filed previous unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motions, he was required to seek our permission before filing a successive application. He failed to do so. Therefore, to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>Bailey raised claims that should have been raised in his first \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court should have dismissed those claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as opposed to denying them. But we construe the district court\u2019s denial on the merits as a dismissal and affirm because this is a distinction that makes no difference in this case. See <em>Cani v. United States, </em>331 F.3d 1210, 1216 (11th Cir.2003) (construing district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction as denial on the merits and affirming because the distinction between denial and dismissal makes no significant difference).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
