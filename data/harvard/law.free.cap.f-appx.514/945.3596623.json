Ms. Rodriguez\u2019s sole contention in this appeal is that she received ineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations, which caused her to plead guilty pursuant to a written agreement that contained an appeal waiver when she otherwise may not have. As the basis for her ineffective assistance claim, Ms. Rodriguez contends her trial counsel gave her incorrect information that \u201cinduced\u201d her to sign the plea agreement. Specifically, she argues that counsel told her she was subject to a statutory minimum sentence when she was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">While some evidence exists that could support Ms. Rodriguez\u2019s claim, we decline to address it. The claim is better suited for resolution on a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion because the record, which contains no details about what trial counsel actually communicated to Ms. Rodriguez, is not developed enough at this stage for us to assess his effectiveness. <em>See, e.g., Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1694, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003) (\u201c[I]n most cases a motion brought under \u00a7 2255 is preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective assistance.\u201d); <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201cWe will not generally consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel raised on direct appeal where the district court did not entertain the claim nor develop a factual record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">We note also that Ms. Rodriguez advances only an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in this appeal, and does not challenge her convictions or her sentence directly. We therefore affirm her convictions and sentence, but we do so without prejudice to Ms. Rodriguez filing a motion to vacate under \u00a7 2255. We express no view on what effect, if any, the plea agreement\u2019s collateral attack waiver will have in a future \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>See, e.g., Williams v. United States, </em>396 F.3d 1340, 1342 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (declining to address whether collateral attack waiver would extend to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel \u201cin entering or negotiating\u201d a plea); <em>Patel v. United States, </em>252 Fed.Appx 970, 975 (11th Cir.2007) (concluding, in an unpublished opinion, that collateral attack waiver did not bar \u00a7 2255 challenge to \u201cvalidity of ... guilty plea\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b968-10\">. We also express no view on whether Ms. Rodriguez \u2014 who conceded in her briefs that even with \"proper counsel\u201d she \"would have pled guilty,\u201d just \"without a plea agreement\u201d \u2014 will be able, in a future \u00a7 2255 proceeding, to show the prejudice required under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>See, e.g., Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 370, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985) (\"[T]o satisfy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>dle \u2018prejudice\u2019 requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, [s]he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d). <em>Cf. United States v. Brown, </em>586 F.3d 1342, 1345 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
