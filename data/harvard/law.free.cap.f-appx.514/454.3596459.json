As the defendant\u2019s brief noted in its statement regarding oral argument, the case is likely to be resolved by the appeal in <em>United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324 (5th Cir.2012), and indeed it is. Defendant raises on appeal for the first time whether the trial court should have explained why it was imposing supervised release notwithstanding the hortatory language in recent official Commentary to the Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.1, comment, (n. 5) (Nov. 1, 2011). Defendant argues that the imposition of a putative three year term of supervised release on him is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. For the same reasons that motivated the court in <em>Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>and our even more recent opinion in <em>United States v. Garcia-Lemus, </em>509 Fed. Appx. 324 (5th Cir.2013)(unpublished), we find no plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
