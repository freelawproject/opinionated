Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), announced a new rule, which does not apply retroactively on collateral review. The district court answered that question in the affirmative and denied Chapa\u2019s motion to vacate his conviction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Chapa argued that counsel was ineffective, under <em>Padilla, </em>for misadvising him that his plea of guilty would not subject him to deportation. Chapa contends that <em>Padilla </em>applies retroactively to invalidate his guilty plea. But the Supreme Court held recently in <em>Chaidez v. United States, </em>568 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1103, 1105, 185 L.Ed.2d 149 (2013), that <em>Padilla </em>announced a new rule, which \u201cunder the principles set out in <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), <em>Padilla </em>does not have retroactive effect.\u201d Because Chapa cannot benefit from the new rule in <em>Padilla, </em>we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-24\">Chapa pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine in exchange for the dismissal of two other drug charges. At his sentencing hearing, Chapa acknowledged that he had reviewed his presen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>tence investigation report, which provided that he was a citizen of Mexico and faced the possibility of removal or deportation as a result of his conviction. Chapa objected to an enhancement to his sentence, but the district court overruled Chapa\u2019s objection. The district court sentenced Chapa to 148 months of imprisonment and advised him that, after completing his sentence of imprisonment, he would be transported to an \u201cimmigration official for appropriate removal proceedings from the United States.\u201d Chapa did not move to withdraw his plea of guilty. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Chapa appealed his sentence. On the motion of the government, we dismissed Chapa\u2019s appeal based on the waiver in his plea agreement of a right to appeal or collaterally attack his sentence. <em>United States v. Chapa, </em>No. 08-16176 (11th Cir. Dec. 8, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Chapa filed a motion to reduce his sentence, which he later amended to add a claim for relief under <em>Padilla. </em>Chapa alleged that he would not have pleaded guilty, but for counsel\u2019s assurances that Chapa would remain in the United States following his conviction. The district court construed Chapa\u2019s filing as a motion to vacate his conviction, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and Chapa did not oppose the reclassification of his motion, <em>see Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 377, 124 S.Ct. 786, 789, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). The United States responded that Chapa\u2019s postconviction motion was also barred by the waiver in his plea agreement and, alternatively, that in <em>Padilla </em>the Supreme Court announced a new rule, which does not apply on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">A magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny Chapa\u2019s motion to vacate. The magistrate judge reasoned that <em>\u201cPadilla </em>announced a new rule because not only was its conclusion not <em>dictated </em>by precedent existing at the time [Chapa\u2019s] conviction became final, its conclusion <em>had been, rejected </em>by existing precedent in the Eleventh Circuit and by virtually every other court to address the issue.\u201d And the magistrate judge agreed with the United States that <em>\u201cPadilla </em>resolved the \u2018more complex and novel question of whether the Sixth Amendment applies at all\u2019 to ineffective assistance claims\u201d and that the \u201cresolution of that antecedent question conflict[ed] with the lower courts\u2019 resolution of it and ... further indicate[d] that <em>Padilla </em>announced a new rule.\u201d The magistrate judge concluded that Chapa could not benefit from the holding in <em>Padilla </em>because it did not fall within either of the two exceptions to the general prohibition against retroactive application of a new rule. <em>See Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 311-12, 109 S.Ct. at 1075-76. The magistrate judge also concluded that Chapa\u2019s argument about the ineffectiveness of counsel failed under the law in effect at the time of Chapa\u2019s guilty plea. <em>See Downs-Morgan v. United States, </em>765 F.2d 1534, 1540-41 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">The district court adopted the recommendation of the magistrate judge and denied Chapa\u2019s motion to vacate. The district court recognized that a \u201csplit of authority ... [had] developed in the state and federal courts in the year since <em>Padilla </em>[had been] decided\u201d and issued a certificate of appealability to resolve \u201cwhether <em>Padilla </em>... announced a new rule of criminal procedure that is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">The decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Chaidez v. United States </em>resolves the question presented for our review. In <em>Chaidez, </em>the Court concluded that <em>Padilla </em>announced a new rule that does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. 133 S.Ct. at 1108, 1113. That decision forecloses Chapa\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>The district court correctly denied Cha-pa\u2019s motion to vacate his sentence. Cha-pa\u2019s arguments for postconviction relief are foreclosed by <em>Chaidez. </em>\u201cUnder <em>Teag-ue, </em>[Chapa\u2019s] ... conviction[ ] became final prior to <em>Padilla[,\\ </em>... [and he] therefore cannot benefit from its holding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">We AFFIRM the denial of Chapa\u2019s motion to vacate his sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
