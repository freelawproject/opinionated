An immigration judge denied Jiang\u2019s application for asylum as untimely and found him not credible, and the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed. We dismiss in part and deny in part Jiang\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-19\">Jiang argues that he is eligible for asylum and relief under the Convention, but we lack jurisdiction to consider his arguments. Jiang argues that he testified credibly about filing his application for asylum within one year of entering the United States, but \u201cregardless of whether [Jiang\u2019s] application was timely ... it is not within this Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review a denial of asylum on [that] ground[ ].\u201d <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). Jiang also argues that he is eligible for relief under the Convention, but Jiang failed to make that argument in his appeal to the Board. <em>See Alim v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 1239, 1253 (11th Cir.2006). \u201c[Ajbsent a cognizable excuse or exception, we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the [Board].\u201d <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Jiang also argues that he is \u201cmore likely than not ... to be subject to a forced sterilization procedure ... if [he] returns to China,\u201d but Jiang did not mention forced sterilization in his application for asylum or in his appeal to the Board. <em>See Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>555 F.3d 1310, 1317 n. 5 (11th Cir.2009) (declining to consider a new argument in support of asylum for the first time on appeal). We dismiss Jiang\u2019s petition for review of the denial of his applications for asylum and relief under the Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-20\">Jiang challenges the denial of his application for withholding of removal, but substantial evidence supports the finding that Jiang was not credible. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir. 2001). Jiang based his claim of persecution primarily on his arrest by local police, but there were inconsistencies between Jiang\u2019s application, his testimony, and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>corroborating evidence. Jiang alleged in his application and testified during his hearing that he was arrested for distributing leaflets, but an affidavit prepared by Jiang\u2019s cousin living in Florida stated that Jiang had been arrested for \u201cdistributing Bibles.\u201d Jiang alleged in his application that he had been \u201charshly interrogated,\u201d \u201cverbally abused,\u201d deprived of food and water, and threatened with \u201csevere mistreatment\u201d following his arrest, but Jiang testified that he was beaten brutally after his arrest. Jiang did not mention in his application that another person was arrested for church activities, but Jiang testified at his hearing that another church member was arrested after he fled China. The record does not \u201ccompel a reasonable fact finder\u201d to credit Jiang\u2019s testimony. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1233 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Jiang argues that the immigration judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in considering his application, but we disagree. The immigration judge considered declarations submitted by Jiang\u2019s mother and Jiang\u2019s friend, but gave those declarations \u201cvery little weight\u201d because they had been prepared recently by interested parties. The immigration judge also considered a Certificate of Detention from the Station of Public Security in ChangLe City, but the immigration judge gave the unauthenticated certificate \u201clittle weight\u201d because of information in the Country Profile that documents from China were subject to widespread fabrication. The immigration judge was entitled to discredit Jiang\u2019s corroborating evidence based on its questionable reliability. <em>See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1353 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">We DISMISS Jiang\u2019s petition for review of the denial of asylum and relief under the Convention and DENY his petition for review of the denial of withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
