By moving to proceed IFP, Cobb is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">The district court recognized that Amendment 750 lowered Cobb\u2019s guidelines range to 188 to 235 months of imprisonment. However, the district court reasoned that a reduction to Cobb\u2019s sentence should not be awarded after his sentence had been reduced pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 and that Cobb\u2019s 300-month imprisonment term was appropriate considering the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error; its interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo; and its decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Cobb contends that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based in part on his receipt of a prior reduction pursuant to Rule 35. According to Cobb, the district court also failed to properly assess the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and to consider his favorable post-sentencing conduct. Cobb further contends, for the first time, that the denial of his instant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion violated his due process and equal protection rights because his case compared favorably to three other defendants convicted of crack cocaine offenses who were granted reduced sentences under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">These arguments do not present a non-frivolous issue for appeal. The district court was permitted to reduce Cobb\u2019s sentence but was not compelled to do so. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 297 (5th Cir.2009). Its order reflects that it was aware of its authority to reduce Cobb\u2019s sentence even after the prior reduction in his sentence under Rule 35 but that it decided, based on a number of troubling facts unique to Cobb\u2019s case, that a further reduction was not warranted after consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court\u2019s decision did not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673 &amp; n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">Cobb also argues that the district court violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny by relying on factual findings which were made pursuant to the preponderance of the evidence standard and which were based on the testimony of an unreliable witness. This argument fails, as the principles of <em>Booker </em>and its progeny do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2690-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Furthermore, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not full resen-tencings, and Cobb\u2019s attempt to relitigate the facts underlying his original sentencing exceeds the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>645 F.3d 709, 712 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">In his final argument, Cobb contends that his sentence should be reduced pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>ant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0. This argument also fails, as \u00a7 3582(c)(2) permits a sentence reduction only within the narrow bounds established in \u00a7 1B1.10 and does not authorize the application of \u00a7 5K2.0. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(a)(3), (b)(1); <em>Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2694.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Cobb has failed to demonstrate a non-frivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
