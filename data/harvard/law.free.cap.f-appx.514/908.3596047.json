After pleading guilty in 2005 to distributing crack cocaine, Gilmore was sentenced as a career offender to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Gilmore argues that he is entitled to a sentence reduction pursuant to <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), and Amendment 750 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d). After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-25\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Amendment 750 revised the crack cocaine quantity tables to conform to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which amended certain statutory minimum sentences for crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750. It was made retroactive by Amendment 759, effective November 1, 2011. <em>See id., </em>Amend. 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-26\">A reduction is not consistent with the Guidelines\u2019 policy statement if the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). A reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized where the applicable amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28. This includes situations in which the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range is calculated through the application of the career offender guideline. <em>Id. </em>at 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\"><em>Moore </em>remains binding precedent in this Circuit. <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012). In <em>Lawson, </em>we expressly rejected the argument that <em>Freeman </em>overruled <em>Moore. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. Therefore, a defendant who was convicted of a crack cocaine offense but sentenced as a career offender remains ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction under Amendment 750. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Here, the district sentenced Gilmore for his crack cocaine offense as a career offender. He does not, and has not, contested that he was properly designated as a career offender. Gilmore\u2019s argument that he is entitled to a \u00a7 3582 reduction, despite his status as a career offender, is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Lawson.

Further, because we do not address arguments raised for the first time in a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s reply brief, we do not address any that Gilmore has raised there. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
