The district court revoked Rios\u2019s supervised release because he (1) traveled outside of the judicial district without permission, (2) associated with a convicted felon, (3) failed to allow his probation officer to conduct an employment visit, and (4) failed to notify his probation officer that Rios had been questioned by police. He argues only that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he violated the conditions of his supervised release by not allowing his probation officer to conduct an employment visit; Rios does not challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s revocation based on the additional violations. Rios appears to argue that if the evidence was insufficient, then the district court\u2019s reasons for the revocation were likewise insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-20\">Because Rios has failed to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis in connection with the revocation on the remaining three violations, it is the same as if he had not appealed these issues. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987). Each of the additional \u25a0violations provides an adequate ground for revocation, and Rios has failed to address them on appeal; thus, Rios has not established that the court committed error, plain or otherwise, in revoking his supervised release. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b504-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
