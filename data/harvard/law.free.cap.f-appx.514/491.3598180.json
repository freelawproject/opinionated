Vicharelly argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">A defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea but, rather, bears the burden of showing that \u201ca fair and just reason\u201d warrants the withdrawal. <em>United States v. Powell, </em>354 F.3d 362, 370 (5th Cir.2003). We review the denial of a motion to withdraw for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>In light of the record evidence, the parties\u2019 arguments, and the relevant, non-exclusive factors originally set forth in <em>United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.1984), we conclude that Vichar-elly, who admitted to detailed facts of his guilt while under oath over four months before he filed the motion to withdraw, fails to show an abuse of discretion by the district court. <em>See Powell, </em>354 F.3d at 370; <em>United States v. Lampazianie, </em>251 F.3d 519, 524-25 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b514-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
