For the reasons which follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-20\">The sole argument made by Mr. Anderson-Ruiz is that the district court erred in not sua sponte holding an eviden-tiary hearing on his speedy trial claim. We find no abuse of discretion, much less plain error. The district court, in denying Mr. Anderson-Ruiz\u2019s motion, assumed that his factual allegations were true. <em>See </em>Docket Entry 13 at 2-3. Because Mr. Anderson-Ruiz does not challenge the district court\u2019s decision on the merits, an evidentiary hearing would not have helped Mr. Anderson-Ruiz in any material way. As we have said before, a district court need not hold an evidentiary hearing where the movant\u2019s allegations, even if true, do not warrant the relief requested. <em>See, e.g., Chavez v. Sec\u2019y Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>647 F.3d 1057, 1072-73 (11th Cir. 2011); <em>United States v. Massey, </em>89 F.3d 1433, 1443 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
