He argues that he was subject to a maximum revocation sentence of only 36 months, but the district court sentenced him to 48 months of imprisonment. Because Garza argues that his revocation sentence exceeds the statutory maximum and is illegal, our review is de novo. <em>See United States v. Vera, </em>542 F.3d 457, 459 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The statutory maximum revocation sentence is based on the classification of the underlying offense that resulted in the imposition of the term of supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Unless the underlying offense of conviction specifies a particular classification, this classification is based on the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment authorized\u201d for that underlying offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a). In the instant case, Garza was convicted for a drug conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(b)(1)(B), which ordinarily would carry a statutory maximum sentence of 40 years of imprisonment. However, because the Government provided notice of his earlier felony drug conviction as required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, his \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment authorized\u201d under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) increased to life. Therefore, Garza\u2019s underlying offense qualified as a Class A felony, and his applicable statutory maximum revocation sentence was five years. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3559(a)(1); \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Thus, his 48-month revocation sentence is not illegal because it does not exceed the applicable five year statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
