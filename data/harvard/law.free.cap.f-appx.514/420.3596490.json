The district court denied Morgan\u2019s IFP motion, certifying, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3), that the appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-21\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Morgan is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). His motion must thus \u201cbe directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To obtain permission to proceed IFP, Morgan must show that he is a pauper and that he will present a nonfrivo-lous appellate issue. <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-22\">Morgan does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that his grievance failed to include the information required to provide prison officials with a fair opportunity to address the problems that later formed the basis of his \u00a7 1983 action. <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 516-17 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 93, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006). Accordingly, he has abandoned any challenge to that determination, <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987), and has thus failed to demonstrate that his \u201cappeal involves legal points arguable on their merits\u201d as to the dismissal of his \u00a7 1988 action based on his failure to exhaust. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Morgan has not shown that his appeal involves a nonfrivolous issue, we deny his motion to proceed IFP on appeal and dismiss his appeal as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The dismissal of Morgan\u2019s appeal counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Morgan is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g) he will not be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
