These stores sell and lease residential and office furniture, consumer electronics, and home appliances. In January 2002, Herkel hired Tony Faircloth as the Macon store Customer Account Manager, responsible for collecting past-due rent from customers and assisting the store\u2019s General Manager, Sharon Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">By the summer of 2002, Faircloth and Thompson had entered into a consensual sexual relationship that lasted for a year, until the summer of 2003. Shortly thereafter, Herkel promoted Faircloth to General Manager of the Warner Robbins store and to District Manager, with supervision of the stores in Savannah, Rome, and Dalton. In 2004, Faircloth and Thompson resumed their sexual relationship; it continued until 2007. Faircloth described the relationship as \u201cfriends with benefits.\u201d Faircloth also described it as \u201cnonconsen-sual,\u201d that he was sexually involved with Thompson so that she didn\u2019t cause him as many problems at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-15\">In early 2008, Herkel removed Faircloth from his District Manager position. Chris LaPerchia, Herkel\u2019s president, told him that it was not a demotion; rather, it was the result of the Warner Robbins\u2019s store\u2019s declining economic performance. About that time, the exact month Faircloth could not recall, Faircloth told LaPerchia that he wanted to a file sexual harassment charge against Thompson. He told LaPerchia that Thompson and Herkel were discriminating against black employees on account of their race. He said that Thompson once referred to a black employee using the \u201cN-word,\u201d and that Herkel mistreated black employees in allowing time off.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-16\">On October 20, 2008, Herkel terminated Faircloth\u2019s employment, and, at the same time, eliminated the position of General Manager at the Warner Robbins store. Thompson assumed Faircloth\u2019s duties at that store, while continuing to function as General Manager of the Macon store.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-17\">On December 10, 2008, Faircloth filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \u201cEEOC\u201d) in which he stated that he had been subjected to sexual harassment, discriminated against because of his sex and retaliated against because he opposed Herkel acts made unlawful under Title VII.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Faircloth asserted that his sexual relationship with Thompson was unwelcome, that the only way to stop her from making his life difficult at work was to continue to have sexual relations with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-18\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-19\">Faircloth brought this action against Herkel pursuant to Title VII of the Civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1) and 8(a). Following discovery, Herkel moved the District Court for summary judgment. The court granted the motion for summary judgment, concluding that: (1) Faircloth\u2019s sexual harassment claim was time-barred; (2) he failed to show that the reason Herkel gave for terminating him \u2014 that it was eliminating his positions as District Manager and General Manager of the Warner Robins store \u2014 was a pretext for sex discrimination; and (3) he did failed to establish a <em>prima, facie </em>case of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Faircloth appeals the court\u2019s judgment. In his brief on appeal, he does not expressly address the District Court\u2019s conclusion that his sexual harassment claim was time-barred. Instead, he argues that he made out a claim for sexual harassment because he continued an unwelcome sexual relationship with Thompson, because she did not bother him when he did so. He argues that summary judgment was inappropriate on his sex discrimination and retaliation claims because material issues of fact remain to be litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n of Jefferson Cnty., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1161-62 (11th Cir. 2006). Summary judgment is appropriate if the movant shows that no genuine issue of material fact exists, and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ. P. 56(a). A \u201cmere scintilla\u201d of evidence supporting the opposing party\u2019s position will not suffice. <em>Brooks, </em>446 F.3d at 1162. With these standards in hand, we address Faircloth\u2019s three Title VII claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">To prosecute a Title VII claim, the plaintiff must first exhaust his administrative remedies, beginning with the filing of a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. <em>Wilkerson v. Grinnell Corp., </em>270 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2001). In Georgia, a plaintiff must file the charge of discrimination within 180 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred. <em>Id. </em>In determining whether a claim was timely filed, it is irrelevant that some of the acts making up the claim occurred outside the statutory time period; if at least one act contributing to the claim occurred within the filing period, all of the acts may be considered for purposes of determining liability. <em>See Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 117, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 2074, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">Assuming that Faircloth\u2019s brief challenged the District Court\u2019s determination that his sexual harassment claim was time-barred, we conclude that the determination was proper. Faircloth filed his EEOC charge on December 10, 2008. To avoid being time-barred, he had the burden of showing that some incident of harassment occurred on or after June 10, 2008. <em>Wilkerson, </em>270 F.3d at 1317. He failed to do so; hence, the court properly granted Herkel summary judgment on his sexual harassment claim. <em>See Jackson v. Seaboard Coast Line R.R. Co., </em>678 F.2d 992, 1010 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">Title VII prohibits an employer from discharging any individual, or otherwise discriminating against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of his sex. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). If a Title VII plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of sex discrimination, and the employer articulates \u201csome legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u201d for the adverse em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>ployment action, the plaintiff may then show that the employer\u2019s proffered reason was a pretext for discrimination. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824-25, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). \u201c[A] reason cannot ... be \u2018a pretext <em>for discrimination </em>\u2019 unless it is shown <em>both </em>that the reason was false, <em>and </em>that discrimination was the real reason.\u201d <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2752, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">A plaintiff may establish pretext by demonstrating that the employer offered inconsistent reasons for the challenged employment action. <em>Tidwell v. Carter Products, </em>135 F.3d 1422, 1428 (11th Cir. 1998). However, the fact that the employer offers an additional, and not necessarily inconsistent, reason for an employment decision does not necessarily suggest pretext if both of the employer\u2019s reasons are consistent. <em>Id. </em>We have found insufficient evidence of pretext where an employer simply offered additional reasons for its decision, without disclaiming any previous reasons it provided. <em>See id. </em>at 1424-28 (employer disclaimed a reliance on performance and asserted it terminated employee based on a reduction in workforce, but later contended that it also considered performance); <em>Zaben v. Air Prod. &amp; Chem., Inc., </em>129 F.3d 1453, 1454, 1458-59 (11th Cir.1997) (employer disclaimed reliance on seniority and asserted it terminated employee based on a reduction in workforce, but later contended it also relied on seniority when all electricians were equally qualified).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Here, the court did not err in concluding that Faircloth failed to present evidence from which a jury could conclude that Herkel\u2019s real reason for firing him was sex discrimination. First, the fact that LaPerchia stated that Herkel fired him for economic reasons and later provided the EEOC with an additional reason for terminating him <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did not, by itself, establish pretext. While the identification of inconsistencies in an employer\u2019s testimony can be evidence of pretext, Herkel\u2019s reasons for terminating Faircloth were not necessarily inconsistent, because both the economy and his poor performance could have contributed towards his termination. <em>See Zaben, </em>129 F.3d at 1458 (finding no pretext when employer gave different, but not necessarily inconsistent, reasons for employee\u2019s discharge).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">Evidence that Faircloth may have been a good employee also did not establish pretext because whether or not he was a good employee was irrelevant to whether his position was terminated due to economic reasons. Finally, even if evidence showing that Herkel attempted to find replacements for Faircloth as General Manager of the Warner Robins store and District Manager is accepted as true, that did not show pretext because it did not necessarily suggest that the real reason for his termination was his sex. <em>See Hicks, </em>509 U.S. at 515, 113 S.Ct. at 2752 (holding that showing that employer\u2019s nondiscriminatory reason was false does not compel a finding of pretext).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">The only evidence tending to show that sex discrimination was the real reason for his firing was that Thompson took over some of his duties as General Manager of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>the Warner Robins store. At best, this evidence constituted a scintilla, and was insufficient to enable a reasonable jury to find that Herkel terminated Faircloth because of his sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to retaliate against an employee because he has opposed an unlawful employment practice. Faircloth identifies three separate actions he took in opposing Herkel\u2019s employment practices as discriminatory: (1) his complaint to LaPerchia about Thompson\u2019s sexual harassment; (2) his EEOC charge; and (3) his complaint to LaPerchia about Thompson\u2019s use of the \u201cN-word\u201d in referring to black employees and her discrimination against them in permitting time off. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Faircloth had the burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation. <em>Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2001). To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, he could show \u201c(1) that he engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) he suffered a materially adverse action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the [materially] adverse action.\u201d <em>Howard v. Walgreen Co., </em>605 F.3d 1239, 1244 (11th Cir.2010) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">The third prong, causation, is construed broadly so that a plaintiff merely has to prove that the protected activity and the negative employment action were not completely unrelated. <em>Pennington, </em>261 F.3d at 1266. The length of time between the protected activity and the adverse action is considered in this analysis. <em>Maniccia v. Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (11th Cir. 1999). A period as long as one month between a protected activity and an adverse action is not too protracted to infer causation based on temporal proximity; a three-month period between a protected activity and an adverse action, though, cannot alone establish causation. <em>See Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, </em>141 F.3d 1453, 1457 (11th Cir.1998) (one-month period sufficient); <em>Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007) (three-month period insufficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">Faircloth\u2019s complaint about Thompson\u2019s sexual harassment does not establish causation, in part because he was unable to provide the date or even the month he complained to LaPerchia about her acts of harassment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As such, he failed to demonstrate that there was a less than three-month gap between his complaint and his termination and, therefore, cannot establish causation based on temporal proximity. <em>See Thomas, </em>506 F.3d at 1364 (deeming a three to four month gap between the statutorily protected expression and the adverse employment action insufficient to infer causation based on temporal proximity). Nor could Faircloth demonstrate causation between the date of his filing of the EEOC charge and the date of his termination, for he was fired <em>before </em>he filed the EEOC charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">In sum, summary judgment was appropriate on Faircloth\u2019s retaliation claim; a jury could not reasonably find causation based on temporal proximity.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-13\">.
