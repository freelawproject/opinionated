Marshall, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Marshall contends that even though he has already been denied post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, he is entitled to it under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). He argues that his current claim \u2014 that he is innocent of aggravated identity theft because he did not know that an altered social security number he unlawfully used belonged to an actual person \u2014 was foreclosed by applicable circuit precedent dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>ing his direct appeal and his initial \u00a7 2255 proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1280 (11th Cir.2006). Section 2255(e) bars a \u00a7 2241 petition if the prisoner has failed to seek or has already been denied relief on a \u00a7 2255 motion, as Marshall has, \u201cunless it also appears that the remedy by [\u00a7 2255] motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>see also Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1352 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[A] \u00a7 2255 motion is the exclusive remedy for a federal prisoner to collaterally attack his conviction and sentence, except in the rare cases where it is inadequate to do so.\u201d). The narrow exception to the \u00a7 2255(e) bar on \u00a7 2241 petitions is called the savings clause. <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1305-06 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">If a petitioner files a \u00a7 2255 motion and it is denied, he may not circumvent the restriction on second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>Antonelli, </em>542 F.3d at 1351. It is the petitioner\u2019s burden to establish the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">This Court has endorsed a three-part test that can be used to determine whether \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of a prisoner\u2019s detention under \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause. <em>See Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). The <em>Wofford </em>test requires a petitioner to show that: (1) his claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense; and (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed his claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised during his trial, direct appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The merits of a petitioner\u2019s claim cannot be considered unless he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by showing that the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) applies. <em>Id. </em>at 1244 n. 3. After he satisfies all three requirements of the <em>Wofford </em>test, he still must establish that he is actually innocent of the crime for which he has been convicted. <em>Id. </em>at 1244 &amp; n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>Marshall contends that he could not have brought his current claim in his direct appeal or in his first \u00a7 2255 motion because Eighth Circuit precedent foreclosed it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In March 2008 the Eighth Circuit held that in order to convict a defendant of aggravated identity theft under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(1) the government was not required to prove that the defendant knew that the \u201cmeans of identification\u201d he unlawfully transferred, possessed, or used actually belonged to another person. <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Gonzalez, </em>520 F.3d 912, 915-16 (8th Cir.2008), <em>vacated, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2377, 173 L.Ed.2d 1289 (2009).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Flores-Figueroa, </em>the 2009 Supreme Court decision that Marshall relies on, the Court held that to convict a defendant of aggravated identity theft under \u00a7 1028A(a)(1) the government does have to show that the defendant knew that the \u201cmeans of identification\u201d he unlawfully transferred, possessed, or used actually belonged to another person. <em>Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 646, 647, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 1888, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009). In May 2009 the Supreme Court granted certiorari and vacated the Eighth Circuit\u2019s judgment in <em>Mendozar-Gonzalez, </em>remanding for further consideration in light of its <em>Flores-Figueroa </em>decision. Men<em>doza-Gonzalez v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2377, 173 L.Ed.2d 1289 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">Applying the three-part <em>Wofford </em>test, the district court concluded that Marshall\u2019s claim did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause. The parties agree that Marshall has met the first two requirements of the test, placing at issue only the third one. Until 2008, when the Eighth Circuit issued its <em>Mendozar-Gonza-lez </em>decision, that court\u2019s precedent did not squarely foreclose Marshall\u2019s claim that he did not commit aggravated identity theft because he did not know that the social security number he had unlawfully used belonged to an actual person. Marshall had the opportunity to make that argument in his direct appeal and in his initial \u00a7 2255 motion, both of which pre-dated 2008. Because his claim was not foreclosed at the times when he could have asserted it, he cannot satisfy the third <em>Wofford </em>requirement. As a result he has failed to \u201copen the portal,\u201d which is the threshold requirement for entitlement to \u00a7 2241 relief. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244 &amp; n. 3. The district court did not err by denying Marshall\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b959-7\">. The government did not seek to enforce Marshall\u2019s plea agreement waiver of his right to collaterally attack his conviction and sentence, and instead addressed Marshall's claim on the merits. For purposes of this appeal only, we will ignore the waiver and consider the merits of Marshall\u2019s claim. <em>But see Williams v. United States, </em>396 F.3d 1340, 1342 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that, because his plea agreement's plain language expressly informed him that he was waiving his right to bring a collateral attack, the petitioner waived his right to bring \u00a7 2255 motion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b959-8\">. In <em>Bonner </em>v. <em>City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b959-9\">. In our en banc <em>Gilbert </em>opinion, we explained that when the <em>Wofford </em>panel \"stated that the savings clause would permit a prisoner to bring a \u00a7 2241 petition claiming that a retroactively applicable, circuit law-busting decision of the Supreme Court established that he had been convicted of a nonexistent crime[,]\u201d that was \"only dicta because all Wofford's claims were sentencing claims.\u201d <em>Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1319. In the present case, however, Marshall claims that he was convicted of a non-existent crime, and we use <em>Wofford </em>test to determine whether his claim is saved by the savings clause. <em>See Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1364 (11th Cir.2003) (\"Because we hold that Sawyer was not convicted of a nonexistent offense, and thus, did not meet the second prong of the <em>Wofford </em>test, his <em>Richardson </em>claim does not fall within the purview of the savings clause.\u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b960-8\">. Marshall was originally convicted in a Missouri federal court, where he brought his direct appeal and his first \u00a7 2255 motion, so Eighth Circuit precedent is the circuit law that that determines whether \"circuit law squarely foreclosed [Marshall\u2019s current] claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised.\u201d <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b960-9\">. The Eighth Circuit noted that it had addressed a similar issue in an earlier decision, but that decision did not directly address the specific issue, and until its <em>Mendoza Gonzalez </em>decision the court had never \"explicitly state[d] that the Government need not prove that a defendant knew the means of identification was that of an actual person.... \u201d <em>Mendoza-Gonzalez, </em>520 F.3d at 916 (citing <em>United States v. Hines, </em>472 F.3d 1038, 1039-40 (8th Cir.2007)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
