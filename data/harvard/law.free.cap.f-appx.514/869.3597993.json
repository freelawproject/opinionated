After pleading guilty to conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C), and 846, Givens was found responsible for 1.49 grams of crack cocaine. Because of his criminal history, Givens was deemed a career offender, with a guideline range of 151 to 188 months, factoring in his acceptance of responsibility. The district court concluded, however, that the career offender designation overstated Givens\u2019s criminal history and the seriousness of the offense, and varied downward, sentencing Givens to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Givens claims that the district court erred by denying his subsequent \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the sentencing court had varied downward from the career offender guideline range so his sentence was at least in part \u201cbased on\u201d the crack guidelines. He also says that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>(2011), abrogated our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir. 2008), in which we concluded that career offenders were not eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1326. The district court is required to use the version of the policy statement included at \u00a7 1B1.10 that is in effect on the date that the court decides the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Once pronounced, the district court\u2019s authority to modify a sentence of imprisonment is narrowly limited by statute. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2010). Nevertheless, a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where the defendant was sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). When evaluating whether a defendant is eligible for a reduced sentence, a district court should determine what new sentence, if any, applies, \u201cby substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). In \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, a district court must leave <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations ... unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781 (emphasis in original). Then, the district court determines whether, in its discretion, it will impose the newly calculated sentence under the amended guidelines or retain the original sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Where an amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief is inappropriate. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). The 2012 Commentary to the Guidelines expressly provides that the applicable guideline range is \u201cthe guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.1(a), which is determined before consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)). The Supreme Court has held that a Commentary provision \u201cwhich functions to interpret a guideline or explain how it is to be applied\u201d is binding as long as the Commentary does not conflict with the Constitution, a federal statute, or the guideline at issue. <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 42-43, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993) (quotations and alterations omitted). The Court also indicated that the Sentencing Commission could adopt commentary that would overrule prior judicial constructions of a particular provision of the Guidelines, so long as the amended commentary met the above standard. <em>Id. </em>at 46, 113 S.Ct. 1913.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">Amendment 750 altered the base offense levels for certain amounts of crack cocaine. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 748, 750. Previously, a defendant found responsible for at least 1 but less than 2 grams of cocaine base received a base offense level of 16. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(12) (2008). Under the current Guidelines and after Amendment 750, a defendant responsible for at least 1.4 but less than 2.8 grams of cocaine base has a base offense level of 14. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">In <em>Moore, </em>we explained that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only authorizes reductions to sentences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>that were \u201cbased on\u201d sentencing ranges that were subsequently lowered. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327. Since Amendment 706 did not lower the career offender offense levels, we concluded that it did not lower the sentencing range upon which a career offender\u2019s sentence had been based. <em>Id. </em>We also noted that the Commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10(a) \u201cma[de] clear\u201d that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction was not authorized where an amendment lowered a defendant\u2019s base offense level for the offense of conviction, but not the career offender sentencing range under which the defendant was sentenced. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n.1 (A)) (noting that, for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief, the amendment must lower the applicable guideline range, and specifically explaining that an amendment may be applicable to a defendant without lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision). In so doing, we distinguished the facts before us from two out of circuit district court decisions in which the defendants had received downward departures from the career offender guideline range to the otherwise applicable crack cocaine guideline range, after the court determined under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 that their criminal histories were substantially overrepresented. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1329-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">In <em>Freeman, </em>a four justice plurality ruled that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief is available to a defendant sentenced under a Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement that includes an agreed-upon sentence expressly based on a guideline range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Freeman, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2690. In her concurring opinion, Justice Sotoma-yor said that sentences imposed pursuant to a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement are based on the agreement itself and not the applicable guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 2696 (Sotomayor, J., concurring). In <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012), we held that, after <em>Freeman, Moore </em>remains binding precedent in this Circuit. <em>Lawson </em>explained that, in <em>Freeman, </em>neither the plurality nor Justice Sotomayor \u201caddressed defendants who were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, a defendant convicted of a crack cocaine offense but sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 was still not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction under Amendment 750. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Here, the district court did not err by denying Givens\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. We explicitly rejected Givens\u2019s argument about the impact of <em>Freeman </em>on <em>Moore </em>in <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. Because Givens was sentenced as a career offender, <em>Moore </em>dictates that Givens is not eligible for a reduced sentence under \u00a7 3852(c)(2). <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28. Additionally, the amended Commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 clearly provides that the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d is the range determined before consideration of any departure provision or any variance. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)). The Commentary provision, therefore, completely forecloses Givens\u2019s argument, especially since the Supreme Court has held that a Commentary provision that explains how a guideline is to be applied is binding so long as the Commentary does not conflict with the Constitution, a federal statute, or the guideline at issue. <em>See Stinson, </em>508 U.S. at 42-43, 45, 113 S.Ct. 1913. Further, Givens\u2019s argument that the Commentary interprets a statute rather than a guideline provision is misplaced, since the Commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 explains how to calculate the relevant offense level and \u201capplicable guideline range.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (nn.1-6).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>Moreover, even if not completely foreclosed by <em>Moore </em>and the Commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10, Givens\u2019s argument fails because there is no indication in the record that the district court sentenced him \u201cbased on\u201d the crack cocaine provisions. Although the district court noted what Givens\u2019s sentence would have been under the crack guidelines at sentencing, the district court did not sentence him in accordance with that range (24 to 30 months). Rather, he was sentenced to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the sizable difference between Givens\u2019s sentence and the range based on the crack provisions is sufficient to indicate that Givens\u2019s sentence was not based on the crack provisions. In addition, although the court explained that the career offender range really overstated Given\u2019s criminal history and the seriousness of the offense and varied downward as a result, there was no indication that it chose the sentence that it did, 108 months, based on the crack guidelines in \u00a7 2D1.1. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
