Hewitt, master of the bark <em>Reindeer, </em>belonging to W. A. Sale &amp; Co. of Hew York, an order on said Sale &amp; Co. for the payment to the plaintiff of $&gt;176.33J, balance of wages due one John H. Hanson, as mate of said bark, which order the plaintiff subsequently sent to the defendants, with a direction to Sale &amp; Co. to pay said amount to the defendants, written thereon and signed by the plaintiff, and which the defendants received, and coll\u00e9cted of Sale &amp; Co. the amount of money therein mentioned, and gave a receipt therefor, and placed it to the plaintiff\u2019s credit, and acknowledged to the plaintiff that they had received it. Some two or three months after said payment to the defendants, a woman calling herself Mrs. John H. Hanson, and claiming to be the widow of said Hanson, came to Sale &amp; Co. and claimed that she was entitled to said money; whereupon William A. Sale, of said firm of Sale &amp; Co., went to the defendants, and they paid the money back to him, and he paid it to her. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Said woman presented no letters of administration, or other evidence of her authority to collect said money, other than her own declarations, and those of a woman with her whom she called her mother. Said William A. Sale had never seen either of these women, until they came and claimed this money. There was no evidence in the case, of the death of said Hanson. Some time in April, 1863, a demand of said sum of money was made of the defendants, on behalf of the plaintiff, and payment thereof refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-5\">On the foregoing facts, the court directed the jury to find a verdict for the defendants, and the plaintiff appealed from the judgment entered on said verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b491-6\"><em>J. H. &amp; B. F. Watson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-7\">I. The defendants received the money in question as the agents of the plaintiff, and therefore had no right to set up the adverse title of a third party thereto; and their payment thereof to Sale &amp; Co. amounted to a conversion thereof. <em>(Story on Agency, </em>\u00a7 217. <em>Story on Bailm. </em>\u00a7 110. <em>Holl </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>10 <em>Bing. </em>246. <em>Harman </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>2 <em>Camp. </em>243. <em>Stonard </em>v. <em>Dunkin, Id. </em>344. <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Hamond, </em>2 <em>B. &amp; Ald. </em>310. <em>Gosling </em>v. <em>Birnie, </em>7 <em>Bing. </em>339. <em>White </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>9 <em>id. </em>378. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Ogilby, </em>9 <em>Price, </em>269. <em>Hardman </em>v. <em>Willcock, </em>9 <em>Bing. </em>378, <em>n.

The only exception is when the principal has obtained the property fraudulently or tortiously from such third person, <em>(Hardman </em>v. <em>Willcock, </em>9 <em>Bing. </em>378, <em>n; Taylor </em>v. <em>Plumer, </em>3 <em>M. &amp; Selw. </em>562;) and that is not shown, or attempted to be shown, in this case. The person by whom the money was claimed in this case, and to whom it was paid by Sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>&amp; Co., after they received it back from the defendants, showed no authority whatever to receive it. There is no evidence whatever that she was the widow of Hanson, and it was not even shown that Hanson was dead. Again; even assuming that she was the widow of Hanson, y'et there is no evidence that she was authorized to administer on his estate. She produced no letters of administration ; consequently her right could not have been superior or equal to that of the plaintiff, who was in the constructive possession. At common law, the real estate of an intestate goes to his heirs; the personal to his administrators. <em>(Coke 2 Inst. </em>398. 1 <em>Bouv. Law Dic. p. </em>83, <em>Administration. 2 Black. Com. </em>494. 1 <em>Williams\u2019 Ex. </em>330.) She could not \" have sued to recover this money. <em>(Dayton on Surrogates, </em>251-253.)</p>\n<court data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b492-8\">[First Department, General Term, at New York,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AgI\">February 7, 1871.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-5\"><em>Beebe, Deane &amp; Donohue, </em>for the respondents</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b492-6\"><em>By the Court, </em>Cardozo, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGD\">The money for which this action was brought was collected by Gomez, Wallis &amp; Co., by authority of, and as agents for, the plaintiff, and they acknowledged that they had so collected it, both by their accounts rendered, and by their letter to the plaintiff of October 7,1862.

They cannot dispute the title of their principal, by setting up an adverse title in a stranger. <em>(Murray </em>v. <em>Vanderbilt, </em>39 <em>Barb. </em>140. <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Curtiss, </em>31 <em>N.
