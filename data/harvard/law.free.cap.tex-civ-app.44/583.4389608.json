The court charged the jury that if the agent of the defendant, who procured the execution of the release, as an inducement to plaintiff to sign the same, fraudulently concealed from plaintiff the contents of the same, without disclosing the contents of said instrument, and plaintiff was ignorant of the contents, etc., that the plaintiff could recover. Held, the charge was not warranted by the evidence. The mere concealment of the contents of the instrument could not have induced the plaintiff to sign the same, there being no evidence that said agent fraudulently concealed the contents, or in any manner prevented plaintiff from learning the contents.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b611-13\">2. \u2014Written Release\u2014Ignorance of Contents.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b611-14\">The mere ignorance of a party as to the contents of a written instrument will not avoid it. There must be fraud, accident or mistake in its execution, and the party seeking to avoid it must appear to be free from negligence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b611-15\">3. \u2014Reasonable Value of Services\u2014Incompetent Testimony.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b611-16\">It was error to permit a witness, who had never practiced medicine or surgery, and whose only qualification as an expert was that he had paid some doctor\u2019s hills and two surgical bills, to testify as to the reasonable value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>medical services. <em>A </em>witness on this subject need not be a physician, but he must be in some way sufficiently informed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b612-3\">4. \u2014Mental Capacity\u2014Issue\u2014Special Charge.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b612-4\">Where the only issue raised by the evidence was as to the mental capacity of the plaintiff to execute the release in question, it was error to refuse a special charge submitting such issue.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-5\">Appeal from the District Court of Grayson County.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEa\">Tried below before Hon.

The mere concealment of the contents of the instrument could not have operated as an inducement for him to sign the release, and the evidence fails to show that said agents fraudulently concealed the contents or prevented plaintiff from reading the same bjr mailing any false statement or doing any act that induced plaintiff to sign said instrument without knowing the contents thereof. The testimony of plaintiff in reference to the signing of said release is in effect that he does not remember signing said release and that it was not read over to him, nor did he read it. He states that by reason of the injury he was shocked and dazed and not mentally in a condition to understand what he was doing. This mental condition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>if it existed, was sufficient for plaintiff to avoid the release. The evidence indicates that appellant\u2019s agents were anxious to secure a settlement and release from plaintiff, and while it is true fraud may be shown by circumstances, the circumstances, as shown by the evidence in this case, are not of such probative force as to have warranted the court in submitting the question of fraudulent concealment on the part of defendant\u2019s agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The eases cited by appellee to sustain this paragraph of the court\u2019s charge a.re based upon evidence of false representations and statements made which the court held were sufficient for the jury to determine whether or not such representations induced the signing of the release. The evidence being different here said cases do not govern.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In the sixth paragraph of its charge 'the court instructed the jury that the burden of proof was on plaintiff to show by a preponderance of the evidence, \u201cif you find he executed the release in question, that at the time he did so, he was ignorant of the contents, or that he was in such a mental condition at the time that he did not know or understand what he was doing.\u201d It is complained that this charge is erroneous in that it tells the jury that the release could be avoided by showing that plaintiff \u201cwas ignorant of the contents of it\u201d (release). This was calculated to impress the jury that ignorance alone of the contents of the instrument at the .time of signing it was sufficient to avoid it. The mere ignorance of a party as to the contents of an instrument will not avoid it. There - must be fraud, accident or mistake in its execution, and the one seeking to avoid it must appear to be free from negligence in the matter. (Williams v. Rand, 9 Texas Civ. App., 631.)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">We are of the opinion that the court erred in admitting the testimony of Alonzo C. Craig as to the reasonable value of services rendered by physicians and surgeons to the plaintiff, as he was not shown to be qualified to speak on the subject. He was a plasterer by trade, had never practiced medicine or surgery. Had paid some doctor\u2019s bills and two surgical bills. The payment of these bills is what he based his opinion on. When asked, \"You don\u2019t know whether the charges were reasonable or not?\u201d he answered, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know; it seems to be customary.\u201d This we think shows that the witness was not sufficiently informed on this matter as to make him an expert. We do not wish to be understood as holding that it was necessary for him to be a surgeon or physician to make him competent to testify, but he must be sufficiently informed as to the reasonable value of such services to be qualified to testify thereto. This is said in view of another trial, as the judgment would be reformed by eliminating the amount of physicians\u2019 fees, were the admission .of this testimony the only error.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The court erred in refusing to give the following special charge, asked by appellant, to wit: \u201cIn this case you are instructed that as a defense defendant pleads a settlement and release made with the plaintiff and in avoidance of such settlement and release the plaintiff claims that when such settlement was made and such release executed he did not have the mental capacity to do such things, and you are instructed to return a verdict for the defendant unless you believe from the evidence that at the time plaintiff made such settlement and executed such release he was mentally incapable of understanding the nature and effect of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>settlement and release.\u201d This charge embraces the only issue raised by the evidence and it should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">We have considered the other assignments presented, but do not think them well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">For the errors stated the judgment is reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
