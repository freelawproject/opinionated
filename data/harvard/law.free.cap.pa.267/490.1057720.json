H. Youngman filed an injunction bill, \u201con Ms own behalf and on behalf of any persons or corporations, resident of the Borough of Wesleyyille, Erie County, who may see proper to join as party plaintiff,\u201d praying that certain water \u201crates, rules and conditions\u201d be declared \u201cexcessive and discriminatory,\u201d and that defendants \u201cbe required to apply to their business outside the limits of the City of Erie the same rules, rates and- conditions they apply and enforce within the limits of the said city.\u201d On demurrer, the bill was dismissed and plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The court below, in its opinion disposing of the case, recites the essential facts, taken from the bill, substantially as follows: Plaintiff is \u00e1 resident of and property holder in Wesley ville (about four miles from the City of Erie, the latter, a municipal corporation of the third class, being named as defendant); the \u201cCommissioners of Water Works,\u201d the other defendant, is a quasi-municipal corporation in the City of Erie, organized under the Act of April 4, 1867, P. L. 768, \u201cfor the purpose of supplying water to the inhabitants of the said city\u201d; they are empowered, by Act of June 13, 1913, P. L. 507, to extend the public service, under their charge, beyond the city limits; in pursuance of such authority, the municipal water works in question carried its pipes into the Borough of Wesley ville, and now furnishes water \u201cto the citizens of said municipality\u201d; this service is tendered subject to certain rules, rates and conditions adopted by the \u201cjoint action of the councils of the City of Erie and the Commissioners of Water Works,\u201d under authority of law; these regulations provide that users of water, residing beyond the limits of the City of Erie, must pay an advance of twenty-five per cent over the city rates and, in addition, the actual cost of the extension of the service into their respective properties, which latter charge is not made against patrons within the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>After the foregoing narration of plaintiff\u2019s averments of fact, the court below properly concluded, that, since defendants represent a municipal water works (Saltsman v. Olds, 215 Pa. 336, 337, 342), they are not subject to the Public Service Commission (Barnes Laundry Co. v. Pittsburgh, 266 Pa. 24, 30, 38); but, although the chancellor dismissed the bill on ample legal grounds, hereinafter referred to, he nevertheless expressed some uncertainty as to his authority in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\">Had plaintiff sufficiently averred the actual infringement of a legal right, as in Barnes Laundry Co. v. Pittsburgh, supra, there could be no room for doubt as to the jurisdiction of equity to afford relief; but the averments of the present bill show no such condition. While, in one of the prayers, the chancellor is asked to decree the rates in question \u201cexcessive and discriminatory,\u201d yet plaintiff fails, by any of his averments, so to charge; furthermore, when the facts depended upon to show undue discrimination, and the circumstances that defendants\u2019 works were built and paid for by the residents of the City of Erie, are taken into consideration, the conclusion reached by the court below \u2014 that the differentiation, between users \u00a9f water within and those residing without the city limits, is not illegal \u2014 appears entirely warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Proper classification of patrons by a water corporation, municipal or otherwise, is permitted (Barnes Laundry Co. v. Pittsburgh, supra, p. 41), and the classification here attacked is justifiable. Moreover, it is to be noted that no discrimination exists, or is charged to exist, between patrons living outside the city limits, all of them being treated alike; and, as stated by the chancellor, \u201cThere is no allegation in the bill that plaintiff ever made an application to the water commissioners designating the property to which he wished water furnished,\u201d or that such an \u201capplication had been refused by them.\u201d Finally, there is nothing to indicate that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>rates under discussion are in any sense excessive or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">We do not deem it necessary to pass specifically upon tbe numerous assignments of error, or to discuss tbe many interesting questions wbicb certain of them seek to raise; for, since we agree with tbe court below that \u201ctbe rates, rules and conditions\u201d bere attacked are not discriminatory in any unlawful sense, this in itself is sufficient to sustain tbe order we are about to enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Tbe decree is affirmed at cost of appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
