The mere fact of a runaway does not imply negligence. If a team without fault of the driver is running away, and he is confronted with a sudden emergency which offers two equally dangerous courses, in selecting either one of them he is not to he convicted of negligence even if the one selected is an error of judgment from which an injury follows; hut, when the emergency is created because of his own unusual conduct amounting to negligence, the owner will be liable for injuries following the selection of one of two dangerous courses whether the selection is through an error of judgment or not.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b365-10\">2. In an action against the owner of a team to recover damages for personal injuries plaintiff\u2019s statement charged negligent and reckless driving and nothing more. Plaintiff\u2019s case showed that while she was walking on the south 'side of a street running east and west she noticed the team coming towards her along a dead-end street which terminated at the street on which she was walking. The horses were \u201crunning wild\u201d and the driver was whipping them. The team was driven on to the sidewalls and she was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>jured. Defendant\u2019s case showed that the team was hauling a wagon containing several thousand pounds of ice. It consisted of two horses, one, recently purchased, roadworthy, and not green, accustomed to work in harness, but not \u201ccity broke,\u201d without having shown any disposition to run away. The other was considered safe, with a record of having been driven in the city for two or three years. The new horse was high spirited, but both left the stable at a walk. Before they had gone far, the new horse started prancing, and as the team turned into the dead-end street they were on a run and could not be held in by their experienced driver, nor Stopped by two stable men who attempted to do so. To prevent a collision with an automobile at the turn into the street along which plaintiff was walking, and to check the team, it was directed to a pole on the south side of the street and the wagon crashed into the pole, with the result that plaintiff was injured. Held, that, as defendant\u2019s proof set up a clear case of runaway and denied that the horse was abused, it was reversible error for the trial judge to refuse to charge in effect as follows: \u201cAs there was no evidence of prior bad traits, and if this was a runaway (in the manner) as testified to by defendant, the defendant in the exercise of ordinary care did all that was necessary for it to do to avoid the accident.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b366-4\">3. Such instructions did not destroy plaintiff\u2019s theory of the case, nor call for binding directions. It presented defendant\u2019s theory, and when the jury found the horse ran away \u201cas testified to,\u201d they must consider plaintiff\u2019s evidence, and her view of the case; but, if defendant\u2019s testimony was believed, and it could be believed only if the horse \u201cran away\u201d as \u201ctestified to,\u201d then the point correctly stated the law as to the duty imposed.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b366-5\">4. To hold defendant for negligence in permitting the team to go out of the stable with a new high spirited, but not green, horse, working with a horse considered safe, it must appear that the horse, or team, had a propensity to run away, which the defendant knew, or had good reason to believe.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b366-6\">5. In such a case where it is not averred by the statement of claim, nor shown by plaintiff\u2019s proofs that there was any want of care on the part of the defendant in permitting the new horse to go out with the other horse, or that the new horse was not properly harnessed, or that a curb bit was necessary, it is reversible error for the court to submit such matters to the jury as bearing upon defendant\u2019s negligence.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b366-7\">Argued January 16, 1920.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3-\">Appeal, No. 65, Jan.

Justice Kephart,</author>\n<p id=\"b369-3\">Hutchinson street, in the City of Philadelphia, ends at Poplar street; it is a dead-end street. Plaintiff\u2019s case shows that while walking on the south side of Poplar street she noticed defendant\u2019s team coming towards her, on Hutchinson street, the horses \u201crunning wild,\u201d the driver whipping the horses as they ran. Efforts by bystanders to stop the team were unsuccessful, and the driver, to check it, drove on the south side of Poplar street into a pole, one horse striking and injuring the plaintiff. Plaintiff\u2019s evidence covered the circumstances from a point about 100 to 200 feet from the place of the accident. Defendant\u2019s case shows a team of horses hauling a wagon containing several thousand pounds of ice from stables, located some four or five blocks from the accident. One of the horses was new, recently purchased, but roadworthy; it had been driven before and exhibited no disposition to run away. It was not a green horse, in that it was accustomed to harness and work, but was not \u201ccity broke,\u201d and had been standing in the stable a couple days before this trip. The other horse had been driven for two or three years in the city, and was considered safe. The new horse was high spirited, but both horses left the stable at a walk. Before they had gone far, the new horse started a prancing trot; as the team turned into Hutchinson street, a short distance from the stables, it developed into a run. It became evident to the people connected with the stable, who were watching the horses leave, the team was getting away from a driver of thirty years\u2019 experience. Two of the stablemen ran forward and caught up with the horses, holding them by the bridles and hanging to them for two squares. Notwithstanding the efforts of these men it was impossible to stop the team and the stablemen, for their own safety, released their hold. The driver kept his horses on Hutchinson street to Poplar, avoiding several side streets because of the dangers to be encountered there. To prevent a collision with an auto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>mobile at the turn on Poplar street, and to check the team so as to escape further difficulties, it was directed towards a pole immediately in front, standing on the south side of Poplar street. Plaintiff was not injured by the team when the wagon crashed into the pole, but, being scared, in an effort to flee, fell backwards over a step. Whether plaintiff was struck by the horses, or fell backwards, is immaterial if defendant was negligent. The horses were not whipped and no whip was in the driver\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The negligence complained of, and for the jury\u2019s consideration, was that the man in charge of the team did not drive with the skill and caution ordinarily used, but by whipping a young horse, unaccustomed to city life, caused it to get into an uncontrollable condition, or by whipping horses in the act of running away, caused them to become so unmanageable that in either case they could not be stopped, except by the extraordinary means adopted; having by his own unusual conduct created this condition, his act in driving into a pole on the pavement would not excuse him, as it was his fault that made it necessary to adopt the course he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Having denied the horses were abused in any way and having set up a clear case of a runaway, defendant requested the court to charge the jury, in its 7th point, substantially as follows: As there was no evidence of prior bad traits, and if this was a runaway (in the manner) as testified to by defendant, the defendant in the exercise of ordinary care did all that was necessary for it to do to avoid the accident. While the point was not artistically drawn, its clear import was as here stated. The point was refused. It should have been affirmed. It did not destroy plaintiff\u2019s theory of the case, nor call for a binding direction. It, however, presented defendant\u2019s theory, and, when they found a runaway horse \u201cas testified to,\u201d they must consider plaintiff\u2019s evidence and her view of the case. But, if defendant\u2019s testimony was believed, and it could be believed only if the horse \u201cran <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>away\u201d as \u201ctestified to,\u201d then the point correctly stated the law as to the duty imposed. It was proper for the jury\u2019s consideration, guiding them in their deliberations. The jury, to reach defendant\u2019s theory, must, of course, have disbelieved plaintiff\u2019s evidence as to the abuse of the horses. To hold defendant for negligence in permitting the team to go out as it did, it must appear th\u00e1t the horse, or team, had a propensity to run away, which the owner knew, or had good reason to believe: Benoit v. T. &amp; L. R. R., 154 N. Y. 226, 227; Hamilton v. Hopkins, 247 Pa. 499; Creamer v. McIlvain, 89 Md. 343. The mere fact of a runaway does not imply negligence: Coller v. Knox, 222 Pa. 362; Erickson v. Sutherland, 69 Pa. Superior Ct. 516, 520. If the team, without fault of defendant, was running away, and he was confronted with a sudden emergency which offered two equally dangerous courses, in selecting either one of them he is not to be convicted of negligence, even if the one selected was an error of judgment from which an injury followed: Benoit v. T. &amp; L. R. R., supra. But when the emergency was created because of his own unusual conduct, amounting to negligence, the owner will be liable for injuries following the selection of one of two dangerous courses, whether the selection was through an error of judgment or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\">In addition to this, the court qualified defendant\u2019s first point by matters clearly not in the record. There was not a scintilla of evidence that there was any want of care on the part of defendant in permitting the new horse, in company with the other horse, to leave for the purposes mentioned on the day of the accident. Plaintiff, in her pleadings and evidence, did not charge any such neglect, and the evidence erroneously brought on the record did not create any such condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The same may be said of the answers to defendant\u2019s 4th and 5th points. There was no evidence in the case that the horse was not properly harnessed, nor that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>curb bit was necessary, and plaintiff did not charge or rely on such negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The difficulty in this case arises from the injection of a theory of negligence not averred in the pleadings, nor sustained by the evidence. The statement set up negligent or reckless driving and no more. Had the new' matter been immaterial, it might be regarded as harmless, but the charge of the court was based solely on these erroneous theories of negligence, while plaintiff\u2019s charge of neglect was not considered, and the answers to defendant\u2019s points were modified by these same erroneous theories; it is evident appellant was harmed by the answers to its points and the charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">It is not necessary to further consider the assignments of error in detail. What has been above said sufficiently points out the error which ran throughout the trial, and for those reasons the judgment is reversed and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
