The general rule is that a gift of the income of land without interposition of a trustee, and with no gift in remainder, is a gift of the land itself. If, however, a testator intends a spendthrift trust to attach to property given to a daughter for life under an earlier clause, this intent necessarily cuts down the legal estate to an equitable one subject to the trust created by the later clause of the will.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b507-7\">2. Where a testator gives to his daughter for life \u201cthe net rents, issues and profits\u201d of real estate, subject to necessary expenditure for taxes, water rents, insurance and repairs, and also a money legacy of $10,000, and after making other devises and bequests to children and grandchildren named, as well as to third persons, directs that the income, legacies and devises so given \u201cfor the benefit\u201d of his daughter and other persons mentioned, \u201care to be for their separate respective and exclusive use and benefit,\u201d so that they shall not be sold or parted with by way of anticipation, nor subject to judgments, debts or liabilities of the beneficiaries, the daughter takes an equitable estate for life with the legal estate vested in the trustees.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b507-8\">3. In such ease, where the daughter takes an appeal from a decree against her, she cannot on the appeal raise an objection to the jurisdiction of the orphans\u2019 court for the first time, on the ground that the account under consideration did not include items of rents and profits from the real estate devised to her, and therefore that the construction of such clause was not properly before the court.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b507-9\">Argued April 19, 1920.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ADQ3\">Appeal, No. 149, Jan.

The contention of the daughter is that the first paragraph of the will gave her a life estate, entitling her to the income free from any trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Appellant questions the jurisdiction of the auditor and the court below to pass on the construction of the will, in so far as the interest of the daughter under the foregoing provisions is concerned, on the ground that the account under consideration did not include items of rents or profits devised by the clause in question, and, therefore, the construction of such clause was not properly before the court. Appellant excepted in the court below to the conclusion of the auditor and there argued the case on its merits without raising the question of jurisdiction. Having done so, and the court having passed upon the questions raised by the exceptions as if the case were properly before it, the objection to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>jurisdiction cannot be raised for the first time in this court: Hurt v. Fuller Canneries Co., 263 Pa. 238, 241, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The remaining question is whether the court below erred in holding appellant\u2019s life estate was merely equitable and not subject to the spendthrift trust. The general rule is that a gift of the income of land without interposition of a trustee and with no gift in remainder is a gift of the land itself. If, however, testator intended the spendthrift trust to attach to the property given to the daughter for life under the former clause, this intent necessarily cuts down the legal estate to an equitable one subject to the trust created by the latter clause in the will. That such was testator\u2019s intention does not seem to admit of serious doubt. The original gift was not of the gross income, but merely the \u201cnet\u201d revenue after all carrying charges and incidental expenses were deducted. This situation distinguishes the case from the ordinary one of a life estate in the property itself created by a gift of all income therefrom: Deniston v. Deniston, 263 Pa. 224, 229-30. The appointment of trustees and the subsequent provision that the income, legacies and devises \u201cof every kind and description\u201d given \u201cheretofore and herein\u201d for the benefit of testator\u2019s daughter, and the further provision creating a spendthrift trust as to all such property, make it clear that testator intended to give, not an absolute life estate in the property, but merely the net income subject to an active trust intended for the daughter\u2019s benefit: Wolfinger, Exr., v. Fell, 195 Pa. 12; Deniston v. Deniston, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The decree of the court below is affirmed and appeal dismissed at costs of appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
