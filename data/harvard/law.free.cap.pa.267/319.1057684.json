She elected to take against bis will and claimed such interest in bis real and personal estate as would have passed to ber if be bad died intestate. Her claim, disallowed by tbe court below, was for $5,000 out of ber husband\u2019s real or personal estate, in addition to tbe exemption allowed ber by law. It was disallowed, because section 2, clause (a), of tbe Act of June 7,1917, P. L. 429, as amended by tbe Act of July 11, 1917, P. L. 755, provides tbe \u201cclause as to said five thousand dollars in value shall apply only to cases of actual intestacy of husband or wife.\u201d On this appeal tbe sole contention of tbe appellant' is that tbe amending act is unconstitutional, in that it violates section 3 and section 7, clause 16, of article III, of tbe Constitution. It is entitled, \u201cAn act to amend section two, clause (a), of tbe Intestate Act of one thousand nine hundred and seventeen, approved June seventh, one thousand nine hundred and seventeen, by inserting in tbe proviso to said clause tbe words As to said five thousand dollars in value.\u2019\u201d This title contains but one subject, which is \u201cclearly expressed,\u201d and tbe act is a general law, not a local or special one, \u201cchanging tbe law of descent or succession.\u201d This is too plain for discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Appeals dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
