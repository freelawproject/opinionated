In support of his claim for habeas relief, Petitioner argues that the district court committed error under <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en banc), </em>by failing to address his claim that the Florida Department of Corrections (\u201cFDOC\u201d) violated his due process rights by retroactively canceling his basic gain-time credits. After careful review, we vacate and remand for the district court to address Petitioner\u2019s due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">A. State Criminal Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"b293-16\">In August 1995, a Florida jury convicted Petitioner of 238 offenses involving racketeering, conspiracy to commit racketeering, and grand theft. The offenses, which all related to Petitioner\u2019s involvement in a Ponzi scheme, were committed between June 3, 1989, and April 13, 1994. Following the jury\u2019s verdict, the Florida court sentenced Petitioner to a total of 45 years\u2019 imprisonment and 25 years\u2019 probation. Petitioner was taken into custody by the FDOC on August 22,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-17\">During the course of Petitioner\u2019s criminal enterprise, the Florida legislature enacted a statute that provided that basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>gain-time<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> could only be applied to sentences for offenses committed on or after July 1, 1978, and before January 1, 1994. See Fla. Stat. \u00a7 944.275(6)(a). The FDOC initially applied basic gain-time to Petitioner\u2019s sentences for racketeering and conspiracy to commit racketeering based on its determination that the date of his offenses for basic gain-time purposes was the date' he commenced the offenses\u2014\u2022 June 3,1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">However, in 2002, the Florida Supreme Court issued the opinion in <em>Young v. Moore, </em>820 So.2d 901 (Fla.2002), which stated that, for purposes of gain-time, the date of commission for a continuing felony should be the date of the last overt act in furtherance of the felony. <em>See id. </em>at 903 n. 4. On September 16, 2005, the FDOC audited Petitioner\u2019s sentences in light of <em>Young, </em>and determined that his racketeering offenses were committed on the date the offenses ended\u2014April 3, 1994. Because Petitioner\u2019s racketeering offenses continued after January 1, 1994, the FDOC determined that he was not entitled to basic gain-time. As a result, the FDOC canceled his basic gain-time credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">B. State Mandamus Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In 2010, Petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandamus in the Florida court, challenging the FDOC\u2019s cancellation of his 15 years of basic gain-time credits. Specifically, he contended that the FDOC\u2019s calculation of his basic gain-time in 1995 was correct, and that the retroactive application of the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Young </em>violated his due process rights and the Ex Post Facto Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The Florida court denied his petition, concluding that the cancellation of Petitioner\u2019s basic gain-time did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. The Florida court explained that, because the date of Petitioner\u2019s offenses was after January 1,1994, he was not eligible for basic gain-time at the time when the FDOC mistakenly awarded it to him. Given that Petitioner was never entitled to the basic gain-time credits, the FDOC\u2019s cancellation of those credits did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. The Florida appellate court subsequently denied Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">C. Habeas Corpus Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">In June 2012, Petitioner filed the present \u00a7 2254 petition, raising one claim for relief. He alleged that the FDOC singled him out for a \u201cre-audit\u201d and retroactively cancelled his basic gain-time credits in violation of the \u201cEx Post Facto and Equal Protection Clauses of the U.S; Constitution.\u201d He further asserted in a single sentence that \u201cit should go without saying\u201d that he had a \u201cliberty interest\u201d under the Fourteenth Amendment and <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), in the basic gain-time credits that he was correctly awarded in 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">The district court denied the \u00a7 2254 petition, concluding that the cancellation of Petitioner\u2019s basic gain-time credits did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. The district court explained that the revision to the basic gain-time statute\u2014which eliminated basic gain-time for offenses committed after January 1, 1994\u2014was not retroactively applied to Petitioner because the statute was revised before Petitioner\u2019s offenses ended. Because Petitioner was not legally entitled to accrue basic gain-time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>he did not have any legally enforceable right based on the FDOC\u2019s initial error in awarding him those credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Petitioner appealed and we subsequently granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">Whether the district court committed error in violation of <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en </em>banc), by failing to address [Petitioner\u2019s] claim that the [FDOC] violated the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution when it retroactively cancelled his basic gain-time based on the Florida Supreme Court opinion <em>Young v. Moore, </em>820 So.2d 901, 903 n. 4 (Fla.2002)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition under \u00a7 2254. <em>Madison v. Comm\u2019r, Ala. Dep't of Corrs., </em>761 F.3d 1240, 1245 (11th Cir.2014). We also review <em>de novo </em>legal issues presented in a certificate of appealability. <em>Dupree v. Warden, </em>715 F.3d 1295, 1298 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\"><em>Clisby </em>requires the district court to resolve all claims for relief raised by a habe-as petitioner, regardless of whether the district court grants or denies relief. <em>See Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 936. Thus, if the district court fails to address all claims raised by a petitioner, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">For purposes of <em>Clisby, </em>a claim for relief \u201cis any allegation of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936. Although we liberally construe habeas petitions filed <em>pro se, </em>we require a habeas petitioner to \u201cpresent a claim in clear and simple language such that the district court may not misunderstand it.\u201d <em>Dupree, </em>715 F.3d at 1299; <em>Smith v. Sec\u2019y, Dept. of Corrs., </em>572 F.3d 1327, 1352 (11th Cir.2009) (stating that a claim must be adequately presented to the district court). In <em>Smith, </em>we determined that a petitioner did not adequately present a claim to the district court where he mentioned it in one sentence in his 116-page habeas petition without any citation to authority, and also failed to reference it in his combined 123-page supporting mem-oranda of law. <em>Smith, </em>572 F.3d at 1352. Conversely, in <em>Dupree, </em>we concluded that two sentences within a 15-page supporting memorandum of law were sufficient to raise an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, where the petitioner stated in his habeas petition that his ineffective-assistance claims were raised in his supporting memorandum of law. <em>Dupree, </em>715 F.3d at 1299.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">Here, we conclude that the district court violated <em>Clisby </em>by failing to address Petitioner\u2019s claim that the FDOC\u2019s cancellation of his basic gain-time violated his due process rights. In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Petitioner stated that he had a \u201cliberty interest\u201d in his basic gain-time credit under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wolff. </em>Although Petitioner did not explicitly state that he was raising a due process claim\u2014as he did with his claims under the Equal Protection and Ex Post Facto Clauses\u2014construing his petition liberally, his statement adequately presented a claim that the cancellation of his basic gain-time credits violated his due process rights. <em>See Dupree, </em>715 F.3d at 1299; <em>see also Wolff, </em>418 U.S. at 542-43, 553-58, 94 S.Ct. 2963 (considering a due process challenge to prison disciplinary proceedings for loss of good-time credit raised in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint); <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) (referring to the \u201cliberty\u201d language of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">Moreover, Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was only 14 pages long, was filed on the habeas petition form, and included just seven short paragraphs describing his pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>posed ground for relief. He also did not file any supporting memoranda of law. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s one-sentence reference to his \u201cliberty interest\u201d in his gain-time credits was far more like the claim we considered adequately presented in <em>Du-pree, </em>than the one we concluded was not adequately presented in <em>Smith. See Dupree, </em>715 F.3d at 1299; <em>Smith, </em>572 F.3d at 1352. In sum, Petitioner\u2019s statement regarding his \u201cliberty interest\u201d in his gain-time credits presented the claim in a way that the district court could understand it. <em>See Dupree, </em>715 F.3d at 1299. Indeed, in its response to Petitioner\u2019s habeas petition, the Respondent asserted that Petitioner was raising a claim under the Due Process and Ex Post Facto Clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Because the district court did not resolve this claim, it erred under <em>Clisby. See Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 936. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment without prejudice and remand the case to the district court to consider Petitioner\u2019s due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\">. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 944.275, the FDOC is authorized to grant deductions in prisoners' sentences in the form of gain-time. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 944.275(1). The statute provides that the FDOC \"shall grant basic gain-time at the rate of 10 days for each month of each sentence imposed on a prisoner.\u201d See <em>id. </em>\u00a7 944.275(4)(a),</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
