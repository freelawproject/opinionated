He appeals his sentence, arguing that his 2010 Georgia battery conviction does not qualify as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of an 8-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), and that the district court therefore erred when it used that conviction to apply the enhancement. Mr. Yanes-Cruz also contends that his 16-month sentence\u2014imposed as a variance below his 18-24 month advisory guideline range\u2014is excessive, and thus, substantively unreasonable, in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-19\">Upon review of the parties\u2019 brief and record, we conclude that the district court did not err in either respect. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b270-21\">Mr.' Yanes-Cruz, a citizen of Mexico, was arrested in Gwinnett County, Georgia in July of 2010 on two counts of aggravated assault, two counts of battery, two counts of cruelty to children, and one count of second degree criminal damage to property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was convicted of battery under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Georgia Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-23.1(a) and of second-degree criminal damage to property. In January of 2011, he was physically removed from the United States based on the reinstatement of a previously issued order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In May of 2014, Mr. Yanes-Cruz was arrested in Clayton County, Georgia, for various traffic offenses. He was subsequently taken to Gwinnett County, Georgia, on an outstanding probation violation warrant. There, he met with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials because his immigration record revealed that he had been ordered removed from the United States on two prior occasions and had reentered the United States without permission. He eventually pled guilty to illegal reentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Mr. Yanes-Cruz had a base offense level of 8 for illegal reentry pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), and received an 8-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) because he had previously been deported after being convicted of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d\u2014the 2010 Georgia battery conviction. Mr. Yanes-Cruz objected to the enhancement, arguing that the battery conviction did not meet the definition of an aggravated felony under \u00a7 2L1,2(b)(1)(C). The district court, however, overruled the objection. Mr. Yanes-Cruz\u2019s total offense level was reduced by 3 levels for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 13 and a criminal history category of III, which in turn yielded an advisory guideline range of 18-24 months. <em>See </em>D.E. 47 at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Mr. Yanes-Cruz asked the district court to impose a sentence of time served by way of a departure or a variance based on the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court stated that, based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it had to consider not only the nature and circumstances of the offense, but also the deterrence impact of the sentence. <em>Id, </em>at 40. The court also stated that it could not overlook the fact that Mr. Yanes-Cruz had illegally reentered the United States on three separate occasions. <em>Id. </em>The district court further stated that, although it did not believe Mr. Yanes-Cruz was entitled to credit for time served while in the custody of Gwinnett County officials, it did agree that crediting him for time served in ICE custody was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 40-41. Consequently, the court varied downward and sentenced Mr. Yanes-Cruz to 16 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 41,44.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a prior conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony for purposes of an enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C). <em>See United States v. Ayala-Gomez, </em>255 F.3d 1314, 1316 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">In relevant part \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) states that, \u201c[i]f the defendant previously was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>deported, ... <em>after </em>... a conviction for an aggravated felony, [the offense level] increase[s] by 8 levels.\u201d The commentary defines an \u201caggravated felony\u201d by using the definition set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) of the Immigration- and Nationality Act. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, emt. (n.3(A)). The INA includes in its definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). A \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d in turn, is defined in \u00a7 16 as \u201can offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">To determine whether a conviction qualifies as a \u201ccrime .of violence\u201d under \u00a7 16 (and therefore an \u201can aggravated felony\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2), we analyze the statute of conviction under the categorical approach. <em>United States v. Estrella, </em>758 F.3d 1239, 1244 (11th Cir.2014). \u201cUnder this approach, we look no further than the statute and judgment of conviction, and compare only the elements of the statute forming the basis of the defendant\u2019s conviction and the generic definition of a crime of violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We apply \u00a7 2L1.2 \u201cif the statute on its face \u2018requires the government to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt and without exception,\u2019 an element involving the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against a person for every charge brought under the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Donawa v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>735 F.3d 1275, 1281 (11th Cir.2013)). \u201c[T]he categorical approach focuses on whether in every case a conviction under the statute <em>necessarily </em>involves proof of the element.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In Georgia, \u201c[a] person commits the offense of battery [by] intentionally caus[ing] substantial physical harm or visible bodily harm to another.\u201d O.G.C.A. \u00a7 16-5-23.1(a). Visible bodily harm is defined as \u201cbodily harm capable of being perceived by a person other than the victim and may include, but is not limited to, substantially blackened eyes, substantially swollen lips or other facial or body parts, or substantial bruises to body parts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 16-5-23.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">In <em>Hernandez v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336 (11th Cir.2008), we analyzed whether Georgia\u2019s simple battery statute, Ga.Code. Ann. \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2), which makes it a crime to \u201cintentionally eause[ ] physical harm to another,\u201d constitutes a crime of violence under 18 U.S\u00a1C. \u00a7 16(a). We explained that a conviction under \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2) \u201crequire[s] more than simple physical contact with the victim; it require[s] intentionally causing <em>physical harm </em>to the victim through physical contact.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>513 F.3d at 1338. (emphasis in original). We held that \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2) constitutes a crime of violence because Georgia courts have interpreted the language of the statute to require \u201cactual physical contact that inflicts pain or injury.\u201d' <em>Id. </em>at 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">We explained in <em>Hernandez </em>why <em>United States v. Griffith, </em>455 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir.2006), is relevant in the \u00a7 16(a) context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au3\">Although not an immigration case, <em>Griffith </em>is relevant here because a \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9) is defined to include an offense, ... that \u201c... has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force.\u201d ... This is essentially the same definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)[.] In <em>Griffith, </em>this Court discussed whether physical contact necessarily involves physical force and held that \u201c[a] person cannot make physical contact\u2014particularly of an insulting or provoking na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>ture\u2014with another without exerting some level of physical force.\u201d ... In so holding, the <em>Griffith </em>Court expressly declined to insert the requirement of \u201cviolent\u201d force before the words \u2018physical force\u2019 in the statutory definition of \u2018crime of violence\u2019 and concluded that the simple physical contact made illegal by \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(l) satisfied the \u2018use of physical force\u2019 definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">513 F.3d at 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Logic dictates that the Georgia battery statute at issue here, \u00a7 16-5-23.1(a), which makes it a crime to \u201cintentionally cause substantial physical harm or visible bodily harm,\u201d has as an element the use of physical force. This conclusion is supported by <em>Hernandez </em>and <em>Griffith. </em>As the government points out, if the simple battery statute at issue in <em>Hernandez, </em>which requires intentionally causing physical harm, satisfies \u00a7 16(a)\u2019s definition of a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d then the statute at issue in this case, which requires \u201csubstantial physical harm\u201d or \u201cvisible bodily harm ... capable of being perceived by a person other than the victim,\u201d also satisfies \u00a7 16(a), as it necessarily requires a greater quantum of harm. <em>Cf. United States v. Lockley, </em>632 F.3d 1238, 1245 (11th Cir.2011) (finding it \u201cinconceivable that an act which causes the victim to fear death or great bodily harm would not involve the use of physical force\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Mr. Yanes-Cruz contends that the prec-edential scope of <em>Hernandez </em>and <em>Griffith </em>have been eroded by two Supreme Court cases: <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), and <em>United States v. Castleman, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1405, 188 L.Ed.2d 426 (2014). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court held that Florida\u2019s battery statute, which includes as an element \u201cactually and intentionally touching another person,\u201d \u201cno matter how slight,\u201d does not constitute a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), because it does not have \u201cas an element the use ... of physical force against the person of another.\u201d <em>See </em>559 U.S. at 138-40, 130 S.Ct. 1265,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court explained that, in the \u201ccontext of a statutory definition of <em>\u2018violent </em>felony,\u2019 the phrase \u2018physical force\u2019 means <em>violent </em>force\u2014that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140, 130 S.Ct. 1265 (emphasis original). This suggests \u201ca degree of power that would not be satisfied by the merest touching.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139, 130 S.Ct. 1265. <em>See also United States v. Diaz-Calderone, </em>716 F.3d 1345, 1349 (11th Cir.2013) (explaining that \u201cin <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court held that even a slight touching, such as an unwanted tap on the shoulder, could satisfy the elements of Florida simple battery, and that therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Florida simple battery did not require the use of physical force[ ]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Unlike the simple battery statute at issue in <em>Johnson, </em>which someone can violate by merely touching another person, the Georgia statute at issue here requires \u201csubstantial physical harm or visible bodily harm.\u201d Such harm simply cannot be caused without the application of physical force\u2014i.e., force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person. <em>Johnson, </em>therefore, does not help Mr. Yanes-Cruz.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In <em>Castleman, </em>134 S.Ct. at 1413, the Supreme Court held that the Tennessee offense of \u201cintentionally or knowingly causing] bodily injury\u201d to another qualifies as a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9). In making this determination, the Court concluded that \u201c\u2018physical force\u2019 is satisfied, for purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(9), by the degree of force that supports a common-law battery conviction[, i.e., offensive touching].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1413. Thus, <em>Castleman </em>actually supports the reasoning in <em>Hernandez </em>and <em>Griffith </em>by holding, albeit in a different context, that the physical force element applicable to \u00a7 922(g)(9) is satisfied by a common-law battery conviction, which generally does not require violent force.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Based on <em>Hernandez </em>and <em>Griffith, </em>we hold that battery under Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-23.1(a) qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not err by enhancing Mr. Yanes-Cruz\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) based on his conviction under \u00a7 16-5-23.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">Mr. Yanes-Cruz also argues that his sentence is unreasonably harsh in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1165 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). \u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, </em>626 F.3d 566, 573 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">We will not vacate a sentence as substantively unreasonable unless we are left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court clearly erred in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and imposed a sentence outside the range of reasonable sentences. <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although a district court is required to evaluate all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it is permitted to assign different weight to each of the relevant factors. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). And a district court is. not required to discuss all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[W]e would not expect the district court in every case to conduct an accounting of every \u00a7 3553(a) factor[.]\u201d); <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that a district court does not commit \u201creversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applicability\u2014if any\u2014of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court[ ]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Mr. Yanes-Cruz has failed to carry his burden of showing that his 16-month sentence\u2014imposed below the advisory guideline range\u2014is substantively unreasonable. After hearing from both parties\u2014including Mr. Yanes-Cruz\u2019s statements in mitigation and letters from his family\u2014the district court noted that, based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it had to consider not only the nature and circumstances of the offense, but other factors as well. <em>See </em>D.E. 47 at 40. In addition, the court took into account that Mr. Yanes-Cruz had illegally reentered the country on three occasions. <em>See </em>D.E. 47 at 40. Although Mr. Yanes-Cruz argues that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors support a substantially lower sentence, the district court was permitted to attach greater weight to the need for deterrence. <em>Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1237. In sum, the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Mr. Yanes-Cruz\u2019s to 16-months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">We affirm Mr. Yanes-Cruz\u2019s sentence. In so doing, we hold that Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-23.1(a) qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, and therefore, constitutes an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-13\">. According to the pre-sentence report, Mr. Yanes-Cruz was arrested after an incident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>involving Ana Garcia, a woman with whom he had a previous relationship, and Juan Pineda-Serrano. PSR at 11. Ms. Garcia reported that Mr. Yanes-Cruz confronted her via text message after seeing Mr. Pineda-Serrano\u2019s truck at her house. Mr, Pineda-Serrano called Mr. Yanes-Cruz, and an argument ensued.
