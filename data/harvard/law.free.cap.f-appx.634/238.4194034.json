The district court dismissed the relator\u2019s complaint with prejudice and without leave to amend for failing to plead with particularity as required under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). On appeal, Britton argues that: (1) the district court erred in dismissing his claims under the False Claims Act; and (2) the district court erred in denying Britton\u2019s request to file an amended complaint. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district' court\u2019s order to dismiss a ease for failing to state a claim. <em>Coventry First, LLC v. McCarty, </em>605 F.3d 865, 868-69 (11th Cir.2010). We accept as true the facts as alleged in the complaint. <em>United States ex rel. Clausen v. Lab. Corp. of Am., Inc., </em>290 F.3d 1301, 1303 n. 2 (11th Cir.2002). The district court\u2019s denial of a motion for leave to amend is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>SFM Holdings, Ltd. v. Banc of Am. Sec., LLC, </em>600 F.3d 1334, 1336 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">The relevant facts are these. The relator, Willie Britton, was employed as a delivery person for defendant Lineare. Britton delivered nebulizers to Lineare patients, explained the doctor\u2019s prescription, and demonstrated proper breathing technique while operating the nebulizer. Lincare\u2019s internal guidelines, however, provide that these explanations and demonstrations are to be performed by a \u201cclinician only.\u201d Britton has no respiratory training or certification to credential him as a clinician. The assistance he provided, Britton claims, should have been performed by a \u201cHealth Care Specialist,\u201d such as a Licensed Practical Nurse, Registered Respiratory Therapist, or Certified Respiratory Therapist. Britton says that Lineare is forced to rely on delivery personnel like him to complete these educational tasks because its one Licensed Healthcare Representative in the Birmingham area is unable to serve all of Lincare\u2019s clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">Britton\u2019s complaint alleges \u201c[u]pon information and belief\u2019 that Lineare bills Medicare for the patient education services Britton performs, and \u201c[t]o the extent\u201d Lineare bills Medicaid for patient education services, Britton performs those services. The complaint claims a violation of \u00a7 3729(a)(1), alleging that Lineare knowingly presented or caused to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by the United States by concealing material information as to who was performing \u201cclinician only\u201d tasks. The complaint also claims a violation of \u00a7 3729(a)(2), alleging that Lineare knowingly made, used, or caused to be made or used, false or fraudulent statements and certifications to get a false or fraudulent claim paid by the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">On March 30, 2015, the district court granted Lincare\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court said Britton\u2019s complaint contained only \u201ca bare, conclusory recitation of the elements,\u201d and Britton \u201cfail[ed] to plead the actual submission of a false or fraudulent claim sufficiently.\u201d The dismissal was with prejudice and without leave to amend because, to the extent Britton moved for an opportunity to amend, he did not attach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>a copy or otherwise set forth the substance of a proposed amended complaint. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">First, we are unpersuaded by Brit-ton\u2019s claim that the district court erred in dismissing his False Claims Act causes of action. The False Claims Act subjects to civil liability any person who \u201cknowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to ... the United States Government .,, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval,\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1) (1994), or who \u201cknowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3729(a)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Actions brought under the False Claims Act must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. <em>See Clausen, </em>290 F.3d at 1309-11 (applying the Rule 9(b) pleading standard of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure). The plaintiff must plead \u201cfacts as to time, place, and substance of the defendant\u2019s alleged fraud,\u201d including \u201cthe details of the defendant[']s allegedly fraudulent acts, when they occurred, and who engaged in them.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Fla., Inc., </em>19 F.3d 562, 567-68 (11th Cir.1994). The plaintiff is not permitted \u201cmerely to describe a private scheme in detail but then to allege simply and without any stated reason for his belief that claims requesting illegal payments must have been submitted, were likely submitted or should have been submitted to the Government.\u201d <em>Clausen, </em>290 F.3d at 1311.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">We affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal in <em>Clausen </em>where the relator failed to identify the dates or amounts of fraudulent claims, provide a copy of a single bill or payment, or describe even secondhand information about the defendant medical company\u2019s billing practices. <em>Id. </em>at 1312. Similarly, in <em>Corsello v. Lincare, Inc., 428 </em>F.3d 1008, 1013 (11th Cir.2005), we affirmed the dismissal where a Lineare employee\u2019s complaint \u201cfailed to provide a factual basis to conclude fraudulent claims were ever actually submitted to the government in violation of the False Claims Act.\u201d \u201cIn short,\u201d we said, \u201cCorsello provided the \u2018who,\u2019 \u2018what,\u2019 \u2018where,\u2019 \u2018when,\u2019 and \u2018how' of improper practices, but he failed to allege the \u2018who,\u2019 \u2018what,\u2019 \u2018where,\u2019 \u2018when,\u2019 and \u2018how\u2019 of fraudulent submissions to the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1014. And in <em>United States ex rel. Atkins v. McInteer, </em>470 F.3d 1350, 1359 (11th Cir.2006), we affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal where the relator cited patients, dates, and services that were not eligible for government reimbursement, but lacked firsthand knowledge of the defendants\u2019 actual submission of false claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">Here, Britton\u2019s complaint alleges that he performed services that Lineare\u2019s internal documents reserved for clinicians. However, \u201c[t]he False Claims Act does not create liability merely for a health care provider\u2019s disregard of Government regulations or improper internal policies unless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>as a result of such acts, the provider knowingly asks the Government to pay amounts it does not owe.\u201d <em>Clausen, </em>290 F.3d at 1311. Britton is unable to muster any facts tending to show that Lineare asked the Government to pay amounts it does not owe. He disclaims any knowledge of Lincare\u2019s billing practices, and does not allege the \u201cwho,\u201d \u201cwhat,\u201d \u201cwhere,\u201d \u201cwhen,\u201d and \u201chow\u201d of fraudulent submissions to the government. Nor does Britton allege that the United States actually paid a false claim, or that Lineare intended for the government to rely on false statements in deciding whether to pay a false claim. <em>See Hopper, </em>588 F.3d at 1329-30 (holding that actual payment of a claim is an element of \u00a7 3729(a)(2), and dismissing the relator\u2019s action because even if actual payment need not be pled with particularity, the complaint failed to allege that the defendants intended for the government to rely on their false statements in deciding whether to pay a false claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">In sum, Britton claims \u201c[u]pon information and belief\u201d that Lineare wrongfully billed Medicare for his services, and \u201cto the extent\u201d Lineare billed Medicaid for his services he is entitled to relief. But absent facts demonstrating the actual submission of false claims, this kind of speculation is insufficient to satisfy the pleading standard set by Rule 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">We also find no merit to Britton\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion by failing to provide him an opportunity to submit an amended complaint prior to dismissal. In <em>Atkins </em>we explained that if a plaintiff wants to amend his complaint he \u201cmust either attach a copy of the proposed amendment to the motion or set forth the substance thereof.\u201d 470 F.3d at 1362; <em>see also Urquilla-Diaz v. Kaplan Univ., </em>780 F.3d 1039, 1057 n. 14 (11th Cir.2015) (\u201cDiaz never made a motion to amend his complaint, nor did he ever suggest how he could cure his defective complaint in a subsequent pleading. Under our precedent, the district court\u2019s decision was not an abuse of discretion.\u201d); <em>Lord Abbett Mun. Income Fund, Inc. v. Tyson, </em>671 F.3d 1203, 1208 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201cThe Fund\u2019s request for leave to amend appeared in its response to the Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. The Fund failed, however, to attach a copy of this proposed amendment or set forth its substance. Therefore, the district court did not err by denying the Fund\u2019s request.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">In his response to Lincare\u2019s motion to dismiss, Britton included a footnote stating, \u201cPlaintiff is entitled to \u2018one chance to amend the complaint and bring it into compliance with the rule\u2019 \u201d (citing <em>U.S. ex rel. Clausen v. Laboratory Corp. of America, Inc., </em>290 F.3d 1301, 1308 (2002)). In the same response he also argued that \u201cLincare\u2019s Motion to Dismiss is due to be denied or in the alternative he be given one opportunity to cure.\u201d The district court decided that, \u201ceven if\u2019 these statements could be construed as requests to amend the complaint, Britton failed to set forth how he would amend his complaint to comply with Rule 9(b). On this record, the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing his complaint without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-6\">. The False Claims Act was amended and renumbered by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. <em>111-21, </em>123 Stat. 1617 (\"FERA\"). Britton\u2019s complaint quotes the pre-amendment version cited here. The FERA amendments apply to conduct on or after May 20, 2009, except the amendment of \u00a7 3729(a)(2) applies to all \"claims\u201d pending on or after June 7, 2008. Pub. L. No. 111-21, \u00a7 4(f), 123 Stat. at 1625. Because we have interpreted \u201cclaim\u201d to mean \"any request or demand ,,, for money or property,\u201d <em>Hopper v. Solvay Pharm., Inc., </em>588 F.3d 1318, 1327 n. 3 (11th Cir.2009), Britton may bring an action now under the pre-FERA version of the Act for claims submitted prior to June 7, 2008. The district court addressed the sufficiency of Britton's complaint under the pre-FERA sections, as briefed by the parties, and we do the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
