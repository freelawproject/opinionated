We granted Andrews a certificate of appealability on whether Andrews\u2019s trial lawyer was ineffective for \u201cfailing to adequately inform [Andrews] of the sentencing consequences of the 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 enhancement, thereby causing [Andrews] to reject the government\u2019s plea offer.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Andrews also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his <em>pro se </em>motion for a new trial. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a section 2255 motion, we review legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and fact determinations for clear error. <em>Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286, 1287 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cA claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo,\u201d Id. </em>We accord \u201csubstantial deference to the factfinder in reaching credibility determinations with respect to witness testimony.\u201d' <em>Id. </em>(alteration omitted). We will not disturb a credibility determination \u201cunless it is contrary to the laws of nature, or is so inconsistent or improbable on its face that no reasonable factfinder could accept it.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must demonstrate (1) that his lawyer\u2019s \u201crepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d and (2) \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1312-13 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc). If the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one element, we need not address the other. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2069, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). We apply this two-part test to ineffective-assistance-of-eounsel claims about a lawyer\u2019s performance during the plea-bargaining process. <em>Coulter v. Herring, </em>60 F.3d 1499, 1503-04 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">The proper measure of a lawyer\u2019s performance is \u201creasonableness under prevailing professional norms\u201d; and our review of a lawyer\u2019s performance is \u201chighly deferential.\u201d <em>Chandler, </em>218 F.3d at 1313-14. A \u201cstrong presumption\u201d exists that counsel\u2019s performance was reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 1314. Thus, \u201cwhere the record is incomplete or unclear about counsel\u2019s actions, we will presume that he did what he should have done, and that he exercised reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315 n. 15 (alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">To demonstrate prejudice, a defendant who rejected the government\u2019s plea offer must show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would have pleaded guilty and would not have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Coulter, </em>60 F.3d at 1504 (alterations omitted). A defendant cannot show prejudice if he offers no evidence that he would have accepted a plea offer absent his lawyer\u2019s errors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">After conducting an evidentiary hearing and observing the demeanor of both Andrews and Andrews\u2019s trial lawyer, the magistrate judge credited the trial lawyer\u2019s testimony (1)' that he informed Andrews that the government had filed an enhancement under which Andrews would face a mandatory life sentence if convicted; and (2) that he never told Andrews that Andrews would be exposed to the same sentence regardless of whether Andrews accepted the government\u2019s plea offer or was convicted at trial. We grant substantial deference to the magistrate judge's credibility findings. <em>See Devine, </em>520 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Moreover, the record contradicts Andrews\u2019s contention that he was unaware of the section 841 enhancement or that he faced a mandatory life sentence if convicted. At the arraignment and detention hearing, the government explained expressly that it had filed an enhancement that would subject Andrews to a mandatory life sentence. In response, the judge determined\u2014\u201cbecause of the enhancement\u201d and because Andrews was \u201cfacing a possibility of life imprisonment\u201d\u2014that Andrews was a flight risk and, thus, ordered pretrial detention. On this record, we accept the magistrate judge\u2019s credibility determination. Andrews has failed to show that his trial lawyer performed deficiently.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Andrews has also offered no evidence that he would have accepted the government\u2019s plea offer absent his trial lawyer\u2019s alleged error. Thus, Andrews has also failed to demonstrate that he suffered prejudice. <em>See Coulter, </em>60 F.3d at 1504. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Andrews\u2019s section 2255 motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Andrews also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial without conducting an evidentia-ry hearing. In support of his motion, Andrews submitted four affidavits that he contends constitute newly discovered evidence of three facts: (1) that the two confidential informants, Swint and Reid, conspired to make fake controlled drug buys from Andrews; (2) that an officer threatened Swint into testifying against Andrews; and (3) that Reid used drugs before meeting officers to conduct the second controlled buy.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>136 F.3d 1434, 1438 (11th Cir.1998). We also review the denial of an evidentiary hearing under an abuse-of-diseretion standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">To warrant a new trial based on newly discovered evidence a defendant must satisfy these five criteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">(1) the evidence was discovered after trial, (2) [the defendant\u2019s] failure ... to discover the evidence was not due to a lack of due diligence, (3) the evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching, (4) the evidence is material to issues before the court, and (5) the evidence is such that a new trial would probably produce a different result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-11\"><em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). \u201c[M]otions for a new trial are highly disfavored,\u201d and district courts must exercise \u201cgreat caution\u201d in awarding a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">The district court committed no abuse of discretion in denying Andrews\u2019s motion for a new trial. The affidavits relied upon by Andrews consist largely of inadmissible hearsay, and the allegations in the affidavits are unsubstantiated by an \u201cobjectively credible source.\u201d <em>See United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1354 (11th Cir.1997) (denying a motion for new trial based only on \u201cself-serving affidavits\u201d that were \u201ctotally unsubstantiated by any objectively credible source.\u201d) Furthermore, because the testimony in the affidavits would be used mainly to impeach the confidential informants\u2019 trial testimony about the controlled drug buys from Andrews, the evidence fails to satisfy the third criteria. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>13 F.3d 1464, 1472 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201cNewly discovered impeaching evidence is unworthy of a new trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">The district court also abused no discretion in denying Andrews an evidentiary hearing on his motion; the court had sufficient evidence to rule on the motion. Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>like our decision in <em>United States v. </em>Gates, 10 F.3d 765 (11th Cir.1993)\u2014in which we remanded for an evidentiary hearing to explore further an exculpatory affidavit from a non-testifying co-defendant\u2014this case presents no unique situation warranting an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-12\"> Under the .terms of the government's plea offer, Andrews\u2019s guideline range would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>been reduced to between 151 and 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. Instead of accepting the plea offer, Andrews proceeded to trial and was convicted of two counts of drug distribution. As a result of the section 841 sentencing enhancement\u2014imposed based on Andrews's two prior felony drug convictions\u2014 Andrews was subject to a mandatory life sentence,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
