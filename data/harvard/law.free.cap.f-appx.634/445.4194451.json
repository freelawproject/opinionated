The district court granted Nurse-Bell\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-20\">Although he had assistance of counsel in district court, Blank proceeds <em>pro se </em>on appeal. In challenging the summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>ment against four of his deliberate-indifference claims, Blank asserts Nurse Bell wrongfully: denied or delayed his requests to see Dr. Sandknop, the jail medical officer, for treatment of his Crohn\u2019s disease; refused to comply with hospital discharge instructions that he be seen by a specialist or outside doctor for that disease; failed to administer a special diet for that disease as allegedly ordered by Dr. Sandknop; and, deprived him narcotic pain medication for his neck injury. (Blank made other claims against Bell; but, he briefs only the four above-described claims on appeal. Accordingly, Blank is deemed to have abandoned the unbriefed claims. <em>E.g., Yo-hey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).) For each of his four claims, Blank fails to establish the requisite genuine dispute of material fact, as discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">A summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Hernandez v. Yellow Transp., Inc., </em>670 F.3d 644, 650 (5th Cir. 2012). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law\u201d. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a), To defeat summary judgment, the nonmovant must set forth specific facts showing the existence of a genuine dispute for trial. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c)(1). All facts and reasonable inferences must be construed in favor of the nonmovant, and the court must not weigh evidence or determine credibility. <em>Deville v. Marcantel, </em>567 F.3d 156,163-64 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Upon an invocation of qualified immunity, however, \u201cthe usual summary judgment burden of proof is altered\u201d. <em>Michalik v. Hermann, </em>422 F.3d 252, 262 (5th Cir. 2005). Blank may not \u201crest on conclusory allegations and assertions\u201d and \u201cmust demonstrate genuine [disputes] of material fact regarding the reasonableness of [Nurse Bell\u2019s] conduct\u201d. <em>Id. </em>On the other hand, facts and reasonable inferences are still construed in Blank\u2019s favor. <em>Tolan v. Cotton, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1861, 1866, 188 L.Ed.2d 895 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">The qualified immunity defense protects \u201call but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law\u201d. <em>Malley v. Briggs, </em>475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986). To defeat the defense of qualified immunity, Blank must plead facts to show: a violation of a constitutional or statutory right; and, in the light of clearly established law, Nurse Bell\u2019s conduct was objectively unreasonable. <em>E.g., Short v. West, </em>662 F.3d 320, 325 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">Concerning the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis, violation of a constitutional or statutory right, all of Blank\u2019s contentions rest on Nurse Bell\u2019s alleged deliberate indifference to his need for medical care. \u201cA pretrial detainee\u2019s constitutional right to medical care, whether in prison or other custody, flows from the ... due process guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Wagner v. Bay City, Tex., </em>227 F.3d 316, 324 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cLiability for failing to provide such care attaches if [Blank] can show that a state official acted with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious medical harm and that injuries resulted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">\u201c\u2018Deliberate indifference\u2019 requires that the official have <em>subjective </em>knowledge of the risk of harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Therefore, Blank must demonstrate a genuine dispute of material fact that: Nurse Bell \u201chad subjective knowledge of facts from.which an inference of substantial risk of serious harm could be drawn\u201d; she \u201cdrew that inference\u201d; and her \u201cresponse to the risk indicates [she] subjectively intended that harm occur\u201d. <em>Tamez v. Manthey, </em>589 F.3d 764, 770 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, Blank must demonstrate a genuine dispute of material fact that Nurse Bell \u201crefused to treat him, ignored his complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs\u201d. <em>Domino v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Along that line, neither an incorrect diagnosis nor the failure to alleviate a significant risk that should have been perceived, but was not, is sufficient to establish deliberate indifference. <em>Id. </em>Unsuccessful treatment, medical malpractice, and acts of negligence do not constitute deliberate indifference; nor does a prisoner\u2019s disagreement with his medical treatment, absent exceptional circumstances. <em>Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 346 (5th Cir.2006). Moreover, a delay in treatment is not unconstitutional, unless there has been deliberate indifference that results in substantial harm. <em>See Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 195 (5th Cir.1993). In short, \u201c[deliberate indifference is an extremely high standard to meet\u201d. <em>Domino, </em>239 F.3d at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">First, Blank asserts the court erred in granting summary judgment against his claim that Nurse Bell impermissibly delayed or denied his access to Dr. Sand-knop. Blank \u2018 contends the evidence showed Nurse Bell failed to contact Dr. Sandknop about the deterioration of his Crohn\u2019s condition for long periods of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Blank points to no evidence in the record to substantiate that belief. At his deposition, he admitted he did not have any evidence that Nurse Bell kept him from seeing Dr. Sandknop. A party may not rely upon unsubstantiated or concluso-ry assertions. <em>Morris v. Covan World Wide Moving, Inc., </em>144 F.3d 377, 380 (5th Cir.1998). Dr. Sandknop attested that Nurse Bell did not interfere with his treatment of Blank and he was unaware that anyone at the jail, including Nurse Bell, failed to comply with any of his orders relating to Blank\u2019s treatment. Contrary to.Blank\u2019s assertion, and as noted above, the court was not required to assume that his unsubstantiated allegations regarding his access to Dr. Sandknop were true. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); <em>Pioneer Expl., L.L.C. v. Steadfast Ins. Co., </em>767 F.3d 503, 511 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Blank\u2019s desire to see Dr. Sandknop more often amounts to a disagreement over his treatment, which, as discussed <em>supra, </em>does not rise to the level of deliberate indifference. <em>See Gobert, </em>463 F.3d at 346. Even if Blank could show he should have seen Dr. Sandknop more, and Nurse Bell was aware of that need, but denied or delayed access, at best, he alleges medical malpractice or negligence, which, as stated <em>supra, </em>are insufficient to establish a consti-tutionalviolation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Second, Blank contends the court erred in granting summary judgment against' his claim that Nurse Bell denied him access to a specialist, He relies heavily upon the fact that, following his three hospitalizations, his discharge instructions directed he see a specialist or other outside private general practitioner. Blank asserts the evidence shows Nurse Bell consciously chose to ignore the hospital-discharge instructions in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Although the intentional failure to schedule an appointment with a specialist may amount to deliberate indifference when it causes substantial harm, the negligent failure to schedule an appointment does not. <em>See, e.g,, Carrothers v. Kelly, </em>312 Fed.Appx. 600, 602-03 (5th Cir.2009) (unpublished); <em>Stewart v. Murphy, </em>174 F.3d 530, 534 (5th Cir.1999). The undisputed evidence showed that, when a per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>son incarcerated at the jail returned from the hospital with discharge instructions directing he see an outside doctor or specialist, the decision to make the referral remained with Dr. Sandknop. Blank does not contest that, following each of his hospitalizations, Dr. Sandknop either saw him personally or prescribed the medications indicated on the discharge instructions. Blank\u2019s allegation he should have been seen by a specialist amounts to a disagreement about his course of medical treatment or negligence, which, again, is not actionable. <em>See Gobert, </em>463 F.3d at 346. Moreover, a decision not to prescribe treatment recommended by an outside physician does not constitute deliberate indifference. <em>See, e.g., Stewart, </em>174 F.3d at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Third, Blank maintains Nurse Bell was deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs when she disregarded Dr. Sandknop\u2019s direct order that he be given a special diet (the avoidance of spicy and fried foods). \u201cPrison officials have a constitutional obligation to provide reasonably adequate food\u201d to inmates. <em>Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 10 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Although Blank may have interpreted Dr. Sandknop\u2019s statement that he should \u201cavoid\u201d spicy and fried foods as a medical order, no' such written order appears in the record. Blank did not challenge Dr. Sandknop\u2019s statement that, if he ordered a special diet, it would have been included in the progress notes. Further, Nurse Bell did not recall discussing a special diet with Dr. Sandknop at any time. Blank\u2019s unsubstantiated and subjective belief that Dr. Sandknop ordered a special diet is insufficient. <em>See Morris, </em>144 F.3d at 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Blank\u2019s unsupported assertion that \u201cspecial diets are required\u201d for Crohn\u2019s patients and that Bell\u2019s failure to administer such a diet supports a finding of deliberate indifference similarly fails. Dr. Sandknop stated there were no medically specialized diets for Crohn\u2019s patients, and Blank did not challenge this assertion. To the extent he maintains a special diet should have been ordered, such a contention amounts to a disagreement with the course of his medical treatment and, again, is not actionable. <em>See Gobert, </em>463 F.3d at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">In addition, the evidence indicated that, when Nurse Bell learned Blank began rejecting his food, she went to great lengths to provide him with alternative nutrients and made requests for specialized food trays. Blank fails to demonstrate that Nurse Bell intentionally delayed or denied him access to proper nutrition or otherwise engaged in any conduct that indicated \u201ca wanton disregard for any serious medical needs\u201d. <em>Domino, </em>239 F.3d at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">Fourth, and finally, Blank maintains the court erred in granting summary judgment against his claim that Bell was deliberately indifferent to his alleged neck injury; specifically, her failure to provide a narcotic painkiller. The record showed Nurse Bell did not have the authority to prescribe medications, and it was in Dr. Sandknop\u2019s discretion whether to follow any medication prescriptions in Blank\u2019s hospital-discharge instructions. Accordingly, Blank fails to show Nurse Bell acted \u25a0with deliberate indifference. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b468-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
