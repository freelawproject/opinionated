After Hutch-ins was found guilty of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, the sentencing court determined that 250 to 350 kilograms, of cocaine base were attributable to Hutchins and applied a base offense level of 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). Hutchins now challenges the sentencing court\u2019s findings as to the quantity of drugs he possessed and asserts that the district court erred when it found him ineligible for a modification of his sentence. Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court because application of Amendment 782 did not lower Hutchins\u2019s guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">In 1996, a federal jury found Hutchins guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.G. \u00a7 846. Hutchins\u2019s presentence investigation report (PSI) applied the 1995 Guidelines Manual to calculate Hutchins\u2019s base offense level as 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) because, based on the government\u2019s estimate, the offense involved over 630 kilograms of cocaine base. After the PSI applied a 2-level enhancement for possessing a dangerous weapon and a 3-level role enhancement, Hutchins\u2019s total offense level was 43. Based on the total offense level of 43 and a criminal history category of II, Hutchins\u2019s applicable guideline range was life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">At his sentencing hearing, Hutchins objected to the PSI\u2019s assertions regarding the amount of drugs attributable to him. The district court overruled Hutchins\u2019s objections and found, as \u201can inordinately conservative figure,\u201d that \u201cbetween 250 and 350 kilograms of crack cocaine should be attributable to Mr. Hutchins,\u201d The district court applied a base offense level of 38 and calculated an adjusted offense level of 43 and a criminal history category of II, resulting in a guideline range of life imprisonment. The district court sentenced Hutchins to life imprisonment. Hutchins filed a motion for a sentence reduction, which the district court denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority\u201d under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Once a sentence of imprisonment has been imposed, a district court\u2019s authority to modify the sentence -is \u201cnarrowly limited by statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2010). Nevertheless, a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where the defendant was sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reductions, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>See id. </em>The applicable policy statement precludes \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief unless the, amendment at issue has the effect of lowering a defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">The district court did not err in determining that Hutchins was ineligible for a sentence reduction because Amendment 782 did not lower his applicable guideline range, Amendment 782 revised the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(e), increasing the amount of cocaine base necessary to qualify for a base offense level of 38 to 25.2 kilograms or more. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C (Supp. 2014); <em>compare </em>U.S.S.G, \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), (c)(1) (1995), <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>\u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5), (c)(1) (2014). Amendment 782 became effective on November 1,2014, and was made retroactive by Amendment 788 as of the same date. U.S.S.G. app. C (Supp. 2014)..</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Here, the sentencing court found that Hutchins was responsible for 250 to 350 kilograms of cocaine base, which is above the new drug quantity requirement for a base offense level of 38. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (2014). The 250 to 350 kilograms of cocaine base attributable to Hutchins is far more than the 25.2 kilograms needed to trigger a base offense level of 38 under Amendment 782. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C (Supp. 2014). Therefore, because Amendment 782 did not lower Hutchins\u2019s applicable guideline range, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief was not authorized. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see also Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1368-69 (holding that the district court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because he was sentenced based on a large quantity of drugs that left his base offense level unchanged under Amendment 706).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Hutchins also challenges the sentencing court\u2019s factual findings regarding the amount of drugs for which he was responsible. However, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) adjustment \u201cdoes not constitute a de novo resentencing,\u201d and \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781-82 (11th Cir.2000) (emphasis omitted) (holding that the district court lacked jurisdiction under \u00a7 3582(c) to consider the appellant\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim because it was an \u201cextraneous resen-tencing issue[ ]\u201d). Thus, in the present procedural posture, this court and the district court may only consider whether Amendment 782 applies, and, if so, to what extent a reduction should be granted as a result of the amendment. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1561-62 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that the district court properly refused to reconsider factual findings regarding the quantity of drugs attributed to a defendant on review of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion). Accordingly, Hutch-ins\u2019s additional factual challenges are \u201cextraneous resentencing issues\u201d that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider on review of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">The district court correctly concluded that Hutchins was not eligible for a sentence reduction because Amendment 782 did not change his applicable guideline range in light of the large quantity of drugs for which he was held responsible and that Hutchins\u2019s additional factual challenges were outside the court\u2019s jurisdiction to consider. The court\u2019s order denying Hutchins\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 782 is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
