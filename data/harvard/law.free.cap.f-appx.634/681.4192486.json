On appeal, Florida Le-mark contends that the finding of a work-site hazard is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Florida Lemark also argues that it did not have constructive knowledge of the hazard, pursuant to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>ComTmn Group, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Labor, </em>722 F.3d 1304 (11th Cir.2013), because the hazard was created by supervisor misconduct. After careful review, we deny the petition and affirm the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-14\">This case arises out of a tragic incident involving the partial collapse of a nearly finished, six-story parking- garage under construction on Miami Dade College\u2019s campus in Doral, Florida, on October 10, 2012.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The collapse killed four employees of three different employers and injured several others, including a Florida Lemark employee. It is undisputed that the collapse occurred due to catastrophic structural failure of one of the garage\u2019s supporting columns.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">The garage was a \u201cprecast\u201d structure, meaning the structural pieces of the building were manufactured off-site and erected on-site. After the foundation was poured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>on-site, precast columns were moved into position on the foundation by a crane. The columns were placed on metal shims\u2014 small pieces of metal used to adjust the elevation of the column\u2014and then bolted to the foundation with four anchor bolts through a metal base plate embedded in the bottom of the column. This process left a two- to three-inch gap between the bottom of the column and the foundation. The gap was then filled with grout cement, which has a greater weight-bearing capacity than concrete. The shim stacks and anchor bolts could support the weight of only the column itself, but were insufficient to support the weight of the other structural pieces placed on the column later in construction. To address this situation, the grout was to allow the column to transfer weight more effectively to the foundation and to hold the subsequent loads. The engineering drawings for the parking garage required grout to be placed no later than forty-eight hours after each column was erected.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The construction of the parking garage was managed by Ajax Building Corp. (\u201cAjax\u201d). Other companies were hired to. complete specific parts of the project, including (a) MEP Structural Engineering and Inspection, Inc. (\u201cMEP\u201d), which inspected construction and ensured compliance with construction plans; (b) Solar Erectors, Inc. (\u201cSolar\u201d), which erected the precast pieces at the construction site; and (c) Florida Lemark, the petitioner in this case, which grouted the various pieces that made up the structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Following the collapse of the parking garage, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) investigated the worksite and then issued Florida Lemark, among others, a citation alleging that it failed to keep its worksite free- of hazards. OSHA specifically alleged a \u201cserious\u201d violation of the \u201cgeneral duty clause,\u201d which requires employers to keep their worksites \u201cfree from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm\u201d to their employees. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(1). According to the citation, Florida Lemark exposed its employees to a recognized hazard\u2014being struck by and caught in between collapsing pre-cast structural members\u2014by not performing grouting on the bases of two columns, identified as columns \u201cB3\u201d and \u201cA3.3.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">The Occupational Safety and Health Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651, <em>et seq., </em>gives the Secretary of Labor (\u201cSecretary\u201d), and by extension OSHA, the authority to commence enforcement actions against employers to ensure compliance with the Act. The overarching purpose of the Act is \u201cto assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651(b). Once OSHA issues a. citation to an employer, the employer may contest the citation and request a hearing before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). <em>See generally ComTran Grp., Inc., </em>722 F.3d at 1306-07 (explaining the statutory and regulatory scheme under the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">Florida Lemark contested its citation, and an ALJ held an evidentiary hearing to resolve the contest. The ALJ heard testimony from OSHA investigators and various persons involved in the construction of the parking garage. Notably, the ALJ heard from the following persons: Mohammad Ayub, who headed OSHA\u2019s investigation into the collapse; MEP\u2019s director of engineering, who testified about MEP\u2019s inspection records; and Ajax\u2019s director of risk management, who indicated that an engineering firm hired by Ajax found evidence of grout under column B3.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Ayub, an expert in the field of forensic structural engineering, testified about his investigation of the worksite for OSHA and his conclusions that columns B3 and A3.3 had not been grouted. He explained that the lack of grout under column B3 led to that column\u2019s failure and the partial collapse. He also stated that the lack of grout under column A3.3 posed a similar risk of collapse, though it was not the cause of the collapse in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">MEP\u2019s director of engineering testified about MEP\u2019s inspection records, which indicated that MEP inspected column B3 after it was erected on September 13, 2012. The report prepared for that inspection noted that grouting would be inspected at a future date, which meant, according to the director, that grout was \u201cnot present\u201d at the time of the inspection. The director also testified that he could find no inspection report showing that column B3 had been grouted. .</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Ajax\u2019s director of risk management, Marc Reeves, testified that he was privy to emails discussing the work of an engineering firm that Ajax had hired to investigate the collapse. According to Reeves, the engineering firm\u2019s testing had indicated the presence of grout under column B3. The firm purportedly determined that the grout had a high water content, which potentially could have caused the collapse. The purported engineering report was not introduced at the hearing, nor did someone with the engineering firm testify about the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Following the hearing, the ALJ issued a decision affirming the citation and assessing a penalty of $6,300.00. The ALJ conducted a five-step analysis to determine whether the Secretary had met its burden of showing a violation of the general duty clause. First, the ALJ found that an activity or condition at the site constituted a \u201chazard\u201d under the Act. Crediting Ayub\u2019s testimony, the ALJ found that the Secretary had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that columns B3 and A3.3 had not been grouted. According to the ALJ, no other credible evidence contradicted Ayub\u2019s conclusions and testimony. For example, no witness testified that either column had been grouted. The only evidence contradicting Ayub\u2019s testimony, the ALJ stated, was \u201cunreliable hearsay statements testified to by Mr. Reeves,\u201d whose testimony the ALJ explicitly did not credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Second, the ALJ found that the possibility of structural collapse due to the failure to grout supporting columns was a condition known to be hazardous by Florida Lemark and the precast concrete construction industry. Third, the ALJ found that the hazard was likely to cause death or serious physical harm. Florida Lemark does not challenge the ALJ\u2019s findings on these two points.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Fourth, the ALJ found that feasible means existed to eliminate or materially reduce the hazard. Specifically, Florida Lemark could have followed the construction plans and ensured that columns were grouted within forty-eight hours of being erected. The ALJ found that Florida Le-mark had no rule or procedure for tracking or determining when grouting had been done. Rather, Florida Lemark relied on others both to inform it both when grouting was necessary and if there were any deficiencies in the grouting. The ALJ found that Florida Lemark could have undertaken measures to ensure that inspections of its grouting were complete before a column was loaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">Finally, the ALJ determined that Florida Lemark had constructive knowledge of the condition, despite its lack of actual knowledge. In other words, the ALJ concluded that Florida Lemark could have discovered the condition with the exercise of due diligence. According to the ALJ, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Florida Lemark knew which elements were being erected each day and had supervisors on-site on a regular basis, but Florida Lemark conducted no routine inspections of the work its employees performed, nor did it keep track of the columns it had grouted. Instead, Florida Lemark relied'on Solar and MEP to conduct inspections. Thus, the ALJ found that Florida Lemark did not have an effective safety program because it failed to take reasonable steps to monitor compliance with safety requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The ALJ also rejected Florida Le-mark\u2019s reliance on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>ComTran Group, </em>The ALJ found that <em>ComTran Group </em>concerned the special circumstance of a hazard created by the unforeseeable misconduct of a supervisor, whereas this was \u201cthe ordinary case\u201d where the hazard was created by subordinate employees and should have been discovered by a supervisor through the exercise of due diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Florida Lemark sought discretionary review of the ALJ\u2019s decision before the Commission. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2200.91(b). The Commission declined review, and Florida Lemark now brings this petition for review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 660(a) &amp; 661(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">We review findings of fact by the ALJ to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a) (\u201cThe findings of the Commission with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive.\u201d); <em>J.A.M. Builders, Inc. v. Herman, </em>233 F.3d 1350, 1352 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>J.A.M. Builders, Inc., </em>233 F.3d at 1352 (quoting <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997)). \u201c[T]he legal determinations of an agency like the [Commission] are to be overturned only if they are \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with [the] law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fluor Daniel v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>295 F.3d 1232, 1236 (11th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-17\">IV,</p>\n<p id=\"b707-18\">To show a violation of the general duty clause, the Secretary must prove five things: (1) a hazard existed; (2) the employer or the industry recognized the hazard; (3) the hazard was likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees; a feasible means existed to mitigate or eliminate the hazard; and (5) employer knowledge of the hazard, <em>See Safeway, Inc. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>382 F.3d 1189, 1195 (10th Cir.2004); <em>cf. ComTran Grp., Inc., </em>722 F.3d at 1307. Florida Lemark challenges only whether a hazard existed and, if it did, whether it had knowledge of the haz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>ard. We address each contention separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that a hazard existed at the worksite because no grout was placed under columns B3 and A3.3. The ALJ reasonably relied on Ayub\u2019s testimony in concluding that columns B3 and A3.3 had not been grouted. Ayub was an expert in the field of forensic structural engineering<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> who had investigated approximately seventy-nine prior structural collapses, including ten parking garages using precast concrete. Ayub explained that he conducted a thorough, two-day search for any trace of grout at the base of column B3 but could find none. Based on visual inspection and comparison with other columns that had been grouted, he concluded that neither column B3 nor A3.3 had been grouted. In crediting Ayub\u2019s testimony, the ALJ also reasonably relied on the lack of credible evidence contradicting it. No witness with knowledge testified that those columns had been grouted, and no documentary evidence, such as inspection reports, indicated that the columns had been grouted.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Florida Lemark contends that Ayub\u2019s testimony fails to establish the existence of a hazard because he examined the column\u2019s base after the site had been cleaned up, he conducted no testing of the material under column B3, and he \u201crecanted\u201d his testimony about the presence of grout under column B3 when shown a pre-clean-up photograph of the bottom of the collapsed column. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">First, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Ayub, as an expert with considerable expertise, would have been able to make a visual inspection to determine the presence of grout even after the clean-up. Ayub testified without contradiction that he would have been able to see signs of grout on the underside of the column base plates, which were still intact, despite the clean-up, and without the need for testing. Ayub also explained that grout looks different than precast concrete, that column B3 had been carefully hand-cleaned with brush and broom, and that he compared columns A3.3 and B3 with other columns that had been grouted.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">Second, Ayub did not \u201crecant\u201d his testimony regarding the absence of grout under column B3, as Florida Lemark contends. During cross-examination by Florida Lemark\u2019s counsel, counsel presented Ayub with a photograph of the bottom of column B3 before clean-up. Ayub acknowledged that he could not \u201crule out the possibility\u201d that darker material in the photograph was grout, but he then clarified that he did not think it was grout, and at no point did he indicate that the picture changed his conclusions regarding the lack of grout under column B3. In sum, the ALJ permissibly relied on Ayub\u2019s testimony as evidence of the lack of grouting.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">Florida Lemark also contends that the ALJ ignored or improperly discredited other evidence indicating that grout was present under column B3. Again, we disagree. The ALJ gave good reasons for her decision to discredit Reeves\u2019s testimony that the engineering firm found the presence of grout, as it was based on hearsay statements regarding an unreleased and unfinished report. Moreover, no evidence was presented to the ALJ that substantiated the purported conclusion of the report, such as documentation or live testimony from an engineer with the firm.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>In making her credibility determination, the ALJ also relied on Reeves\u2019s demeanor, finding that he was a \u201creluctant\u201d witness. Consequently, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit Reeves\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In addition, evidence that no one at the construction site noticed or was aware that column B3 had gone ungrouted does not compel an inference that grout was present. Indeed, the fact that column A3.3 was not grouted\u2014a finding Florida Le-mark does not challenge\u2014supports the ALJ\u2019s decision not to infer the presence of grout from the fact that the lack of grouting went unnoticed for over twenty days. Assuming it would have been permissible for the ALJ to find in Florida Lemark\u2019s favor on this point, there is sufficient evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s contrary determination that grout was not present under column B3. <em>See Fluor Daniel, </em>295 F.3d at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Finally, Florida Lemark makes a cursory challenge to the finding of a hazard with respect to column A3.3, claiming that the load on the column was of \u201clittle significance.\u201d However, a \u201chazard\u201d refers to the risk of injury as a result of the condition, not the proximate cause of the accident in this case. <em>See Safeway, Inc., </em>382 F.3d at 1195 n. 5. Here, Ayub testified that the risk of collapse is present once workers start loading ungrouted columns and that the lack of grout under column A3.3 posed \u201cgreat risk of collapse.\u201d And there is no dispute that column A3.3 had been loaded or that collapsing columns posed a hazard to employees. Thus, although column A3.3 did not in fact collapse, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that the lack of grout under column A3.3, like the lack of grout under column B3, was a hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">in sum, the ALJ\u2019s decision to credit Ayub\u2019s testimony is supported by substantial evidence, and his testimony, in addition to other record evidence, provides sufficient evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding of a hazard due to the lack of grouting under columns B3 and A3.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">The Act imposes liability on the employer for a serious violation \u201conly if the employer knew, or \u2018with the exercise of reasonable diligence, [should have known] of the presence of the violation.\u2019 \u201d <em>W.G. Yates &amp; Sons Construction Co., Inc. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>459 F.3d 604, 607 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(k)). Thus, the Secretary must show either that the employer had actual knowledge or constructive knowledge of the violation. <em>ComTran Grp., Inc., </em>722 F.3d at 1307-08. There is no evidence of actual knowledge in this case. Therefore, the Secretary needed to show constructive knowledge\u2014that Florida Lemark could have discovered the hazard with the exercise of reasonable diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">We have identified two ways in which the Secretary can show constructive knowledge. First, constructive knowledge may be shown \u201cwhere the supervisor may not have directly seen the subordinate\u2019s misconduct, but he was in close enough proximity that he should have.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1308. Second, \u201cthe Secretary can show knowledge based upon the employer\u2019s failure to implement an adequate safety program, with the rationale being that\u2014in the absence of such a program\u2014the misconduct was reasonably foreseeable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The employer can avoid liability by showing that the violation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>the result of \u201cunpreventable or unforeseeable employee misconduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Here, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Florida Le-mark had constructive knowledge of the hazard because it failed to take reasonable steps to monitor compliance with safety requirements. <em>See id. N.Y. State Elec. &amp; Gas Corp. v. Sec\u2019y of Labor, </em>88 F.3d 98, 105-06 (2d Cir.1996) (\u201c[Constructive knowledge may be predicated on an employer\u2019s failure to establish an adequate program to promote compliance with safety standards.\u201d). The record establishes that Florida Lemark knew which elements were being erected each day but that it conducted no routine inspections of the work its employees performed, nor did it kept track of the columns it had grouted or train its employees what to do if a column went ungrouted. Nothing prevented Florida Lemark from taking steps to ensure that grouting was inspected, and therefore completed, before columns were loaded. Consequently, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Florida Lemark failed to implement an adequate safety program to ensure that grouting was performed before columns were loaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Florida Lemark\u2019s reliance on <em>ComTrm Group </em>is misplaced.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>ComTran Group </em>concerns when knowledge of a supervisor can be imputed to the employer for purposes of establishing employer knowledge. In the \u201cordinary case,\u201d a supervisor\u2019s knowledge is imputed to the employer. <em>ComTran Grp., Inc., </em>722 F.3d at 1308 &amp; n. 2. However, the \u201cordinary case\u201d is distinct 'from one where the supervisor is the \u201cactual malfeasant\u201d who creates the hazard. <em>Id. </em>at 1308 n. 2. Recognizing that distinction, we held in <em>ComTran Group </em>that showing misconduct by a supervisor alone is not sufficient to prove employer knowledge, <em>Id. </em>at 1316, Rather, \u201cemployer knowledge must be established, not vicariously through the violator\u2019s knowledge, but by either the employer\u2019s actual knowledge, or by its constructive knowledge based on the fact that the employer could, under the circumstances of the case, foresee the unsafe conduct of the supervisor [that is, with evidence of lax safety standards].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1316.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">Here, even assuming that the hazard was created by a Florida Lemark supervisor\u2019s failure to follow the erection guidelines, that unsafe conduct would still have been reasonably foreseeable to Florida Le-mark. As we have noted, Florida Lemark had no rule or procedure in place for tracking or determining when grouting had been done or ensuring that it had been inspected. As a result, the supervisor\u2019s failure to track what grouting had been performed and whether it had been inspected followed naturally from the lack of rule or procedure. Therefore, constructive knowledge was established because the alleged misconduct was reasonably foreseeable. <em>See id. </em>at 1308 &amp; n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">In its reply brief, Florida Lemark argues that the measures identified by the ALJ are not reasonable means to monitor compliance with safety standards. We decline to consider this belated argument because it was raised for the first time in Florida Lemark\u2019s reply brief. <em>See United States v. Levy, </em>379 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201c[T]his Court... repeatedly has refused to consider issues raised for the first time in an appellant\u2019s reply brief.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">Overall, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determinations that a hazard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>existed due to Florida Lemark\u2019s failure to grout columns B3 and A3.3 and that Florida Lemark had constructive knowledge of the hazard as a result of its lack of an adequate program to monitor compliance with safety requirements. Therefore, we DENY Florida Lemark\u2019s petition for review and AFFIRM the ALJ\u2019s decision finding that Florida Lemark committed a serious violation of the general duty clause, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-9\">.
