California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Tavira Espinoza has filed a response and has moved for the appointment of new counsel. The record is not sufficiently developed to allow us to make a fair evaluation of Tavira Espinoza\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; we therefore decline to consider the claim without prejudice to collateral review. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-21\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Tavira Espinoza\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, and counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir, R. 42.2. Tavira Espinoza\u2019s motion for the appointment of new counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b487-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. Ri 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47,5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
