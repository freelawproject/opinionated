According to the trial evidence, McGill responded to a Craigslist ad posted by an undercover officer posing as the mother of a 13-year-old girl. Through a series of emails and text messages, McGill arranged to travel to the fictitious mother\u2019s residence to engage in sexual activity with her fictitious daughter. When McGill arrived on the mother\u2019s doorstep with a condom in his pocket, he was arrested. After the jury found McGill guilty, the district court imposed a 120-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-14\">On appeal, McGill argues that: (1) the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment; (2) the district court abused its discretion in not admitting the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force Operational and Investigational Standards (\u201cICAC Standards\u201d); and (3) the trial evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b) because it showed only that he communicated with the fictitious mother and not directly with the fictitious daughter. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-15\">I. MOTION TO DISMISS INDICTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b257-16\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied McGill\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is well-settled that a motion to dismiss an indictment does \u201cnot provide for a pre-trial determination of the sufficiency of the evidence,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he sufficiency of a criminal indictment is determined from its face.\u201d <em>United States v. Salman, </em>378 F.3d 1266, 1268 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B). To avoid dismissal, the charging document \u201cmust contain the elements of the offense intended to be charged, and sufficiently apprise the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.\u201d <em>United States v. Sharpe, </em>438 F.3d 1257, 1263 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-17\">Section 2422(b), the statute under which McGill was charged, states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Whoever, using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce ... knowingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual who has not attained the age of 18 years, to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense, or attempts to do so, shall be fined ... and imprisoned____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b). McGill\u2019s indictment charged that he, \u201cusing a facility and means of interstate commerce, knowingly attempted to persuade, induce, and entice an individual who had not attained the age of 18 years to engage in sexual activity for which the defendant could be charged with a criminal offense, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 2422(b).\u201d In other words, the face of McGill\u2019s indictment contained the elements of a \u00a7 2422(b) offense and sufficiently apprised McGill of the accusations against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">McGill\u2019s argument in his motion\u2014that he did not attempt to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor because his email and text message communications were with \u201cAmy,\u201d the fictitious parent, rather than \u201cEmily,\u201d the fictitious minor-\u2014relate to the sufficiency of the trial evidence, rather than the facial validity of the indictment. <em>See Sharpe, </em>438 F.3d at 1263. Therefore, the district court properly denied McGill\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">II. EVIDENTIARY ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">As for McGill\u2019s evidentiary issue, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to admit Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 1, the ICAC Standards, tendered by McGill because it was not properly authenticated. At trial, McGill made no objection to the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling and failed to make a proffer and thus arguably failed to adequately preserve the issue. <em>See United States v. Stephens, </em>365 F.3d 967, 974 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that the defendant must show that his evidentiary objection was adequately preserved or that the ruling constituted plain error).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">In any event, McGill has not shown any reversible error at all with respect to Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 1. When asked whether Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 1 was a fair and accurate copy of the ICAC Standards, GBI special agent Brook Lindsey initially responded \u201cI guess so.\u201d The district court found that this equivocal statement was insufficient to identify and authenticate the exhibit. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 901(a), (b)(1) (providing that one way to authenticate a piece of evidence is testimony that the \u201citem is what it is claimed to be\u201d). Notably, upon further questioning, Lindsey indicated that, although she had reviewed the ICAC Standards in the past, she could not remember everything in them and could not say one way or the other whether Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 1 was the same ICAC Standards that she had reviewed. Under the circumstances, it was within the district court\u2019s discretion to refuse to admit Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 1. <em>See United States v. Caldwell, </em>776 F.2d 989, 1001 (11th Cir.1985) (\u201cThe decision of whether or not a particular piece of evidence has been appropriately identified falls within the discretionary function of the district court, and that determination will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing that there is no competent evidence to support it.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">Alternatively, McGill has not shown that the district court\u2019s refusal to admit the ICAC Standards affected his substantial rights. McGill questioned the government\u2019s witnesses about their compliance with the ICAC Standards, and he has not shown how the failure to admit the ICAC Standards themselves had a \u201csubstantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>influence\u201d on the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See id. </em>at 977.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">III. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Finally, the government presented ample evidence to establish that McGill attempted to knowingly persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in unlawful sex. <em>See United States v. Murrell, </em>368 F.3d 1283, 1286 (11th Cir.2004). McGill\u2019s email and text message conversations with \u201cAmy,\u201d the fictitious mother of \u201cEmily,\u201d demonstrate a clear intent on McGill\u2019s part to cause or stimulate the occurrence of unlawful sexual contact between him and Emily. <em>See id. </em>at 1287 (explaining that the term \u201cinduce\u201d unambiguously means \u201cto stimulate the occurrence of\u2019 or \u201ccause\u201d). McGill was aware that 13-year-old Emily would be participating in the unlawful sexual contact. In detailed messages to Amy, McGill: (1) asked numerous questions about Emily\u2019s interests and sexual experience, what Emily would enjoy, and what would \u201cfreak her out\u201d; (2) requested that Emily wear \u201csexy panties\u201d because \u201c[g]uys really like that\u201d and take a shower \u201ceverywhere because we may go there\u201d; and (3) described what he would say and do to make Emily feel comfortable and the sex acts he planned to perform with Emily when he arrived at Amy\u2019s house. Furthermore, McGill took a substantial step towards committing the crime by driving fifty miles to the rendezvous spot (a Chevron gas station) and then to Amy\u2019s residence, and bringing a condom. <em>See id. </em>at 1288 (finding that a substantial step was taken when the defendant\u2019s \u201cacts as a whole strongly corroborate the required culpability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">McGill\u2019s argument that communications with an adult intermediary are insufficient to support a \u00a7 2422(b) conviction lacks merit. It is well-settled in this Circuit that \u201cdirect communications with a minor or supposed minor is unnecessary under the text of \u00a7 2422(b).\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Lee, </em>603 F.3d 904, 912-13 (11th Cir.2010) (collecting cases). In <em>United States v. Murrell, </em>this Court affirmed a conviction under \u00a7 2422(b)\u2019s attempt clause even though the defendant\u2019s only contact was with an undercover police officer posing as an adult man with a fictitious teen daughter. 368 F.3d at 1284. The <em>Murrell </em>Court concluded that, by contacting the fictitious parent in order to \u201ccause the minor to engage in sexual activity with him,\u201d the defendant had the necessary specific intent to induce the minor to engage in unlawful sexual activity. <em>Id. </em>(noting that \u201cthe efficacy of \u00a7 2422(b) would be eviscerated if a defendant could circumvent the statute simply by employing an intermediary to carry out his intended objective\u201d). Thus, under <em>Murrell, </em>McGill\u2019s communications with fictitious-parent Amy were sufficient to show McGill \u201cacted with a specific intent to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce\u201d a minor to engage in unlawful sexual activity. <em>See id. </em>at 1286.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>For all these reasons, we affirm McGill\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-11\">. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>476 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b259-7\">. We note that McGill\u2019s counsel failed to move for a judgment of acquittal at trial, which would ordinarily result in review only for a miscarriage of justice, <em>See United States v. Milkintas, </em>470 F.3d 1339, 1343 (11th Cir.2006). Under this standard, we must affirm unless \"the evidence on a key element of the offense is so tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). \u25a0 Here, however, we readily conclude that the trial evidence amply supported all the elements of a \u00a7 2422(b) offense under the attempt clause, and thus we need not reach any miscarriage-of-justice issue. Additionally, because the trial evidence is sufficient to support the conviction, McGill has sustained no prejudice from his trial counsel\u2019s failure to move for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
