On appeal, he argues both that the district court erred by imposing a five-level U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5) pattern of activity enhancement, and that his convictions violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-19\">I. Sentencing Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b910-20\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002). The government bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence the facts necessary to support a sentencing enhancement. <em>United States v. Kinard, </em>472 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-21\">Section 2G2.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines governs the offense-level calculation for trafficking in child pornography. That section imposes a five-level enhancement if \u201cthe defendant engaged in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5). The commentary defines \u201csexual abuse or exploitation\u201d as (1) conduct prohibited by several enumerated federal criminal statutes, including 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (aggravated sexual abuse), \u00a7 2242 (sexual abuse), and \u00a7 2243 (sexual abuse of a minor or ward); or (2) a state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>law offense, if that offense would have violated one of the enumerated federal statutes if it had been committed within the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, comment. (n.1). Sections 2241, 2242, and 2243 all require that the defendant engage or attempt to engage in a \u201csexual act.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241, 2242, 2243.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cSexual act\u201d is further defined to include \u201cthe intentional touching, not through the clothing, of the genitalia of another person who has not attained the age of 16 years with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2246(2)(D). Finally, to qualify for the enhancement, the defendant\u2019s conduct of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of the minor need not result in a conviction for that conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, comment. (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Morin contends that pursuant to <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), in order to establish application of the enhancement, the government could only use the 1998 Judgment, Information and Florida Statute to show that his previous convictions involved direct, and not through the clothing, touching. However, <em>Shepard </em>is inapplicable here. In <em>Shepard, </em>the Supreme Court held that to determine whether a <em>conviction </em>qualifies for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act, a sentencing court is generally limited to examining the statutory definition, the charging document, any written plea agreement, the transcript of the plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented. 544 U.S. at 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, we are not considering whether it is a conviction that qualifies for the \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5) enhancement. Instead, this particular sentencing enhancement addresses the <em>conduct </em>of the defendant and, unlike <em>Shepard </em>and our decision in <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>is not limited to looking only at whether a prior conviction would satisfy the requirements of the enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, comment. (n.l). Accordingly, we cannot say that the district court committed reversible error in considering Morin\u2019s conduct, as alleged in the probable cause addendum to the arrest report, to support its application of the enhancement to Morin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">II. Double Jeopardy</p>\n<p id=\"AYC\">Morin also argues that we should reverse his conviction on Count Two because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>this Court has previously held in <em>United States v. Bobb, </em>577 F.3d 1366, 1373 (11th Cir.2009), that possession of child pornography is a lesser included offense of receipt of child pornography. He argues that because both counts against him charged a violation that was committed on the same date, his conviction for Count Two violates the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Here, it is not clear from the face of the indictment that punishing Morin for both counts would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. Count One of the indictment charged Morin with distributing and receiving child pornography between February 12, 2010 and March 9, 2010, in violation of \u00a7 2252A(a)(2), while Count Two charged him possessing child pornography on March 9, 2010, in violation of \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B). Although \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) possession is the same offense for double jeopardy purposes as \u00a7 2252A(a)(2) receipt, we affirmed the defendant\u2019s convictions for receipt and possession in <em>Bobb </em>because the offenses occurred on different dates and involved different images. 577 F.3d at 1375. Here, Morin was charged both with distribution and receipt of child pornography over approximately a one-month period and with possessing child pornography on the last day of that period. Despite this overlap of dates, we cannot determine from the indictment whether the images from both of those dates are the same, which is necessary to establish that Morin\u2019s convictions violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">The statement of facts in support of Morin\u2019s guilty plea provides more detail about the images. It describes Morin\u2019s distribution of child pornography to the undercover detective prior to Morin\u2019s March 9th arrest, as well as Morin\u2019s possession of a thumb drive containing numerous images on March 9th. Indeed, the statement of facts actually suggests that many more images were possessed by Morin on March 9th than what he previously had transmitted to the undercover detective. Morin admitted that the officers who executed the search warrant found 4,000 images and a few hundred videos, and approximately 160 of the images were known images of child pornography. However, Morin only identified seven images that he had transmitted to the undercover detective prior to March 9th. Accordingly, we cannot say that Morin\u2019s conviction on Count II was in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-6\">.The commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5) specifically does not include 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 among the enumerated offenses which would qualify for the enhancement. Unlike \u00a7\u00a7 2241, 2242, and 2243, \u00a7 2244 prohibits abusive sexual contact, which is defined as \"the intentional touching, <em>either directly or through the clothing, </em>of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2244, 2246(3) (emphasis added). The commentary to \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5) does not include the conduct described in \u00a7 2244 in its definition of \"sexual abuse or exploitation,\u201d <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, comment, (n.l), and thus Morin argues, conduct that entails touching through the clothing and not directly would not qualify for a \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5) enhancement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b911-11\">. Although <em>Shepard </em>was an Armed Career Criminal Act case, we have applied its categorical approach in sentencing enhancement cases where it is necessary to determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense under the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1328 (11th Cir.2010) (discussing cases that have applied <em>Shepard's </em>approach to enhancements under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2L1.2, 4B1.1, and 4B1.2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b911-12\">. In reaching this conclusion, we note that Morin has argued only that the arrest report and probable cause addendum are not permissible evidence under <em>Shepard. </em>He has not raised any other basis for precluding the district court's reliance on these two documents when imposing the \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5) sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>enhancement. Although he stated in his objections to the Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSI\u201d), that he disputed \"some of the facts\u201d in Paragraph 56 of the PSI (which were based on the probable cause addendum and arrest report), he specifically stated, when asked by the district court at the sentencing hearing, that he had no objections to the introduction of any of the government's exhibits, including the arrest report and probable cause addendum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
