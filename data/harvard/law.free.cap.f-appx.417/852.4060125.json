On appeal, Baez argues that the district court erred in concluding that it had to impose a five-year consecutive sentence for his conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). He maintains that the mandatory minimum in \u00a7 924(c) did not apply to his case because he faced a greater mandatory minimum sentence for his drug conspiracy conviction. Baez acknowledges, however, that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Segarra, </em>582 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir.2009). For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-15\">\u201cWe review questions of statutory interpretation <em>de novo.\u201d Segarra, </em>582 F.3d at 1271. Under the prior panel precedent rule, \u201ca prior panel\u2019s holding is binding on all subsequent panels unless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this court sitting <em>en banc. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-16\">In relevant part, \u00a7 924(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANG\">Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>of law, any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime (including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) ... uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime \u2014 (i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Section 924(c) further states that the sentence imposed under \u00a7 924(c) must run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment imposed on the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(D)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">In <em>Segarra, </em>we concluded that the plain language of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) requires a consecutive sentence where the defendant is subject to mandatory minimum sentences for both a \u00a7 924(c) offense and an underlying drug offense. <em>Segarra, </em>582 F.3d at 1272-73. Recently, in <em>Abbott v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court affirmed our interpretation of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). <em>Abbott, </em>562 U.S.-,-, 131 S.Ct. 18, 23, 178 L.Ed.2d 348 (2010). The Supreme Court held that the statute\u2019s \u201cexcept\u201d clause only applies where \u201canother provision of law directed to conduct proscribed by \u00a7 924(c) imposes an even greater mandatory minimum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 23. Thus, the \u201cexcept\u201d clause does not prohibit consecutive sentences when a defendant is subject to a mandatory minimum under both \u00a7 924(c) and a drug statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">Baez\u2019s argument that he should not have received a consecutive sentence under \u00a7 924(c) is squarely foreclosed by <em>Seganra </em>and <em>Abbott. </em>Accordingly, after review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Baez\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
