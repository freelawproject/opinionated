Miranda-Garcia ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>gues that his sentence: (1) is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately explain its reasoning, and (2) is procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately consider and then grant a downward variance consistent with the pending amendment to \u00a7 2L1.2 effective on November 1, 2010, allowing for a downward departure based on cultural assimilation. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">We review the sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Id. </em>at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court need not discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). It is generally sufficient that the record, viewed as a whole, reflects that the sentencing judge considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has taken the \u00a7 3553(a) factors properly into account. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc), petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Nov. 24, 2010) (No. 10-727).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation and brackets omitted). We will \u201cvacate the sentence if, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190 (quotation omitted). \u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 674, 178 L.Ed.2d 502 (2010). \u201c[Ordinarily, we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Chavez, </em>584 F.3d 1354, 1365 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 436, 178 L.Ed.2d 338 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">In this case, Miranda-Garcia\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable. As the record shows, the district court heard and considered the arguments of both Miranda-Garcia and the government, the letter from his father, and his own personal statement, along with other relevant factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court explained its reasoning for the 70-month sentence, noting its concerns regarding the risk of recidivism, based on Miranda-Garcia\u2019s history of repeated illegal reentry to the United States and his own statement to the district court. Thus, the record reflects that the sentencing court engaged in the necessary \u201cindividualized assessment based on the facts presented\u201d and indicated its particular reasons for imposing a sentence within the guideline range under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">Furthermore, Miranda-Garcia failed to demonstrate that the district court committed a clear error of judgment by not granting a downward variance in light of the pending amendment to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 for downward departures based on the offender\u2019s cultural assimilation. As acknowledged by Miranda-Garcia, the proposed amendment was not yet adopted and in force, and any variance would be discretionary for the district court. The district court heard and considered this argument, but in determining the final sentence, noted the strong risk of recidivism based on Miranda-Garcia\u2019s personal history and statement. Miranda-Garcia has provided no other argument that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Miranda-Garcia received a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range and well below the 20-year statutory maximum sentence. His sentence is both procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-6\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
