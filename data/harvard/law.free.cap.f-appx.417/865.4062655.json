Ultimately, the district court sentenced Bernall to mandatory life imprisonment on Count One, a 60-month consecutive term on Count Two, and a 180-month concurrent term on Count Three. On appeal, he raises nine arguments related to his convictions and sentences. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">First, Bernall\u2019s constitutional arguments pertaining to \u00a7 922(g) are foreclosed by precedent. See <em>United States v. Wright, </em>607 F.3d 708, 715 (11th Cir.2010). Second, Bernall\u2019s argument that \u00a7 924(c) is an unconstitutional extension of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power is also foreclosed by this Court\u2019s precedent. <em>United States v. Ferreira, </em>275 F.3d 1020, 1028 (11th Cir. 2001). Third, this Court has likewise previously held that the circumscription of a convicted felon\u2019s right to bear arms, as found in \u00a7 922(g)(1), does not violate the Second Amendment. <em>United States v. Rozier, </em>598 F.3d 768, 771 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 3399, 177 L.Ed.2d 313 (2010). With reference to the claim that the district court erred in giving the reasonable doubt jury instruction, we find that this Court has expressly approved the language that the district court used and conclude that the jury instruction did not misstate the law, mislead the jury, or lower the government\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-13\">As to sentencing, Bernall\u2019s mandatory life sentence on Count One, pursuant to \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), does not violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. In the case of an offense involving five kilograms or more of cocaine, \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii) provides that if the defendant has two prior felony drug convictions that have become final, the defendant \u201cshall be sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without release.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(ii). In <em>United States v. Willis, </em>956 F.2d 248, 251 (11th Cir.1992), this Court held that a mandatory minimum sentence of life in prison imposed for a conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), imposed as a result of having two prior drug convictions, did not violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">Bernall also argues that his life sentence on Count One must be vacated because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>district court failed to follow the proper procedure under \u00a7 851. Specifically, the district court did not (1) ask Bernall to affirm or deny the convictions or (2) inform Bernall that he could not challenge any prior conviction after the court sentenced him. We reject this argument because (1) Bernall did not object to the validity of the convictions, (2) the court asked Bernall whether he affirmed or denied his prior convictions, (3) his attorney affirmed that the convictions were valid and (4) Bernall does not argue that he could assert a valid challenge to any of the convictions used to support the \u00a7 851 enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Next, as Bernall recognizes, the Supreme Court has held that the Sixth Amendment does not require the government to allege in its indictment or to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant\u2019s prior convictions qualify him for enhanced sentencing. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1222, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Thus there is no merit to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">We must also reject Bernall\u2019s argument that the district court erred by using his Florida felony battery conviction to enhance his sentence on Count Three. Since Bernall received a concurrent life sentence and he apparently had three qualifying ACCA convictions, any error related to the Florida conviction is, at most, harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Finally, Bernall\u2019s argument regarding his consecutive sentence is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Abbott v. United States, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 18, 178 L.Ed.2d 348 (2010), holding that \u201ca defendant is subject to a mandatory, consecutive sentence for a \u00a7 924(c) conviction, and is not spared from that sentence by virtue of receiving a higher mandatory minimum on a different count of conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23; <em>see also United States v. Segarra, </em>582 F.3d 1269, 1272-73 (11th Cir. 2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 633, 178 L.Ed.2d 509 (2010) (concluding that the plain language of \u00a7 924(c) requires consecutive sentences for a defendant convicted of a \u00a7 924(c) offense and an underlying drug crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">For all of the foregoing reasons, Bernall\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
