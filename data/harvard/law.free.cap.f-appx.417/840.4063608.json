Steele and U.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Polster Chappell (collectively \u201cjudges\u201d), in their individual capacities, brought pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bevan\u2019s complaint generally alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>judicial corruption, concealment of a felony, nonfeasance, malfeasance, denial of due process and abuse of power relating to the events of two separate civil proceedings in the Middle District of Florida. Bevan contends the district court erred in adopting the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation to dismiss his complaint because the actions of the judges were non-judicial and thus, not subject to immunity. After review, we affirm the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-19\">Generally, judges are absolutely immune from damages for acts taken during the performance of their judicial duties. <em>See Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 9-10, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991) (per curiam). Judicial immunity is defeated in only two sets of circumstances: (1) where the judge\u2019s actions are non-judicial or (2) where the judge\u2019s actions are taken in complete absence of all jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 11-12, 112 S.Ct. 286. \u201cWhether a judge\u2019s actions were made while acting in his judicial capacity depends on whether: (1) the act complained of constituted a normal judicial function; (2) the events occurred in the judge\u2019s chambers or in open court; (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>the controversy involved a case pending before the judge; and (4) the confrontation arose immediately out of a visit to the judge in his judicial capacity.\u201d <em>Sibley v. Lando, </em>437 F.3d 1067, 1070 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Bevan\u2019s allegations against the judges do not support the assertion that the purported -wrongful conduct of the judges was non-judicial. Instead, the allegations indicate all of the judges\u2019 actions were taken as part of the normal conduct of the court, in relation to a case pending before the court, and arose immediately out of requests or complaints made to the judges in their judicial capacity. Accordingly, Be-van\u2019s claims against the judges are barred by absolute judicial immunity and we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-15\">. Although Bevan purported to bring suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the district court appropriately construed his complaint under <em>Bivens </em>because the claims involve federal officials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b864-20\">. We review de novo the district court's grant of a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Randall v. Scott, </em>610 F.3d 701, 705 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AE9\">. Bevan failed to make any legal arguments regarding the dismissal of his claims against the judges in their official capacity, so he is deemed to have abandoned that issue. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1284 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003). Regardless, the Supreme Court has held that <em>Bivens </em>claims do not extend to federal officers in their official capacity and are barred by sovereign immunity. <em>F.D.I.C. v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 483-86, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
