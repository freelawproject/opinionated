Martinez\u2019s amended complaint alleged violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, and 1985, as well as state tort violations. On appeal, Martinez argues that the district court improperly dismissed her \u00a7 1983 claim because she alleged sufficient facts to establish that the defendants used the aid of state law enforcement officers to violate her constitutional rights. She has abandoned her \u00a7 1981, \u00a7 1985, and state tort claims by failing to challenge their dismissal in her appellate brief. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-14\">A district court shall dismiss a case proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>at any time if the court determines that the action \u201cfails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). We review dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim <em>de novo. Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1348-49 (11th Cir.2001). Failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is governed by the same standard as dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir. 2008). In order to \u201csurvive a motion to dismiss [under Rule 12(b)(6) ], a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S.-,-, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1953, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). We liberally construe <em>pro se </em>briefs and pleadings. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-17\">In an action for relief under \u00a7 1983, plaintiffs \u201cmust establish that they were deprived of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States, and that the alleged deprivation was committed under color of state law.\u201d <em>Focus on the Family v. Pinellas Suncoast Transit Auth., </em>344 F.3d 1263, 1276-77 (11th Cir. 2003) (quotation and citation omitted). Further, in order for liability under \u00a7 1983 to be imposed, the plaintiff must establish proof of an affirmative causal connection between a defendant acting under color of state law and the constitutional deprivation alleged. <em>Troupe v. Sarasota County, </em>419 F.3d 1160, 1165 (11th Cir.2005). A war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>rantless arrest without probable cause violates the Constitution and provides a basis for a \u00a7 1983 claim, as does continuing detention which rises to the level of malicious prosecution. <em>See, e.g., Case v. Eslinger, </em>555 F.3d 1317, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2009) (false arrest); <em>Kingsland v. City of Miami, </em>382 F.3d 1220, 1234 (11th Cir.2004) (malicious prosecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">\u201c[T]he under-color-of-state-law element of \u00a7 1983 excludes from its reach merely private conduct, no matter how discriminatory or wrongful.\u201d <em>Focus on the Family, </em>344 F.3d at 1277. We recognize three tests for establishing whether the actions of a private entity are properly attributed to the state: the public function test, the state compulsion test, and the nexus/joint action test. <em>Id. </em>The public function test is satisfied when private actors perform a function that is \u201ctraditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation omitted). The state compulsion test is met when the government has coerced or at least significantly encouraged the acts alleged to be unconstitutional. <em>Focus on the Family, </em>344 F.3d at 1277. The nexus/joint action test is met when the state and the private party are in such a position of interdependence that the alleged conduct constitutes a joint action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">In considering Martinez\u2019s complaint, the district court properly concluded that Martinez failed to state an actionable \u00a7 1983 claim because she did not allege facts that establish state action by any of the named defendants. As we have previously held, the mere act of reporting a suspected crime to the police is insufficient to establish state action for purposes of a false arrest claim under \u00a7 1983. <em>White v. Scrivner Corp., </em>594 F.2d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1979) (dismissing a \u00a7 1983 claim against a store that detained a suspected shoplifter, searched her purse, and then reported a concealed firearm to the police).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff did not name the City of Orlando or any of the Orlando police officers who participated in her arrest as defendants. It is possible that had she done so she would have stated a valid claim, although it is difficult to tell from the record. However, as she did not, the district court correctly found that the complaint did not allege a plausible \u00a7 1983 claim against any named defendant and dismissal was thus proper under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">Upon careful review of the record and consideration of the Martinez\u2019s brief, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-7\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this Court adopted as binding precedent all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
