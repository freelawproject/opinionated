(\u201cCIS\u201d), the prevailing party in his underlying disability discrimination and retaliation suit. Ang argues on appeal that: (1) the district court erred in finding that his motion for relief was untimely; (2) the court should have declined to award costs because CIS failed to properly serve him with the bill of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>costs, causing him prejudice; (8) because CIS\u2019s attorneys failed to provide evidence of service, despite attesting to proper service, they acted in bad faith, thereby warranting a denial of costs; and (4) the award of costs should be set aside and the case remanded to determine whether his indigent status qualifies him for a reduction of costs. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision about costs only for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Chapman v. Al Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1039 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc). \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs if the trial judge bases an award or denial upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Mathews v. Crosby, </em>480 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir. 2007). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d) provides that a court should award costs to a prevailing party \u201c[ujnless a federal statute, these rules, or a court order provides otherwise.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(1). We have explained that Rule 54(d) creates a presumption in favor of awarding costs to a prevailing party. <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">\u201c[A] non-prevailing party\u2019s financial status is a factor that a district court may, but need not, consider in its award of costs pursuant to Rule 54(d).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1039. \u201cIf a district court in determining the amount of costs to award chooses to consider the non-prevailing party\u2019s financial status, it should require substantial documentation of a true inability to pay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Notably, a court may assess costs against a litigant who is proceeding in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(f); <em>Harris v. Forsyth, </em>742 F.2d 1277, 1277-78 (11th Cir.1984) (holding that appellate costs may be awarded under Fed.R.App.P. 39 against an unsuccessful IFP litigant).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Ang\u2019s motion for relief was untimely because Ang filed the objections to the award of costs beyond the time limit set forth by Rule 54(d)(1). Rule 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in part: \u201cThe clerk may tax costs on 14 days\u2019 notice. On motion served within the next 7 days, the court may review the clerk\u2019s action.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(1). In the instant case, the clerk taxed costs on February 5, 2010, and assuming Ang received notice on February 8, 2010, as he admitted, it is arguable that the clerk could have properly taxed costs only 14 days later, on February 22nd. But even under this scenario, Ang submitted his motion for relief another 16 days later, on March 10, 2010\u2014 beyond the 7 days required by Rule 54(d), and even beyond the 14 days he argues he had. Thus, even interpreting the rules most favorably to Ang, his motion still would have been untimely. And, assuming he needed the full itemized bill to file detailed objections, nothing prevented him from filing a general objection, asking the court for an extension of time, or otherwise alerting the court that specific objections were forthcoming. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Ang\u2019s motion was untimely despite CIS\u2019s alleged failure to serve him with the bill. <em>See Corwin v. Walt Disney Co., </em>475 F.3d 1239, 1254 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201c[I]t is fully within the discretion of the district court to decline to review an untimely objection to costs.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>Because the district court properly could have denied Ang\u2019s motion on the grounds of untimeliness alone, the court would not have abused its discretion in declining to address the merits of the motion. <em>See id. </em>at 1255 (holding that, where an objection to costs was untimely, \u201cthe district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to address the objection on the merits\u201d). However, the court did address Ang\u2019s claims on the merits and did not abuse its discretion in rejecting his claims. Indeed, even if CIS failed to properly serve Ang with its bill of costs, Ang failed to show any resulting prejudice. Moreover, CIS\u2019s mere inability to provide proof of service did not constitute such bad faith as would have warranted a denial of costs. Finally, in considering Ang\u2019s indigence, the court properly found that his affidavit and his IFP status did not constitute substantial evidence of his inability to pay. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ang\u2019s motion for relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-6\">. As for Ang\u2019s argument that construing his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion as an independent action in equity would have extended his time to file objections to the costs, the district court did not have to treat the motion as anything other than an objection to costs that had to be filed within the time limits of Rule 54(d). <em>See Livernois v. Med. Disposables, Inc., </em>837 F.2d 1018, 1020 (11th Cir. 1988) (stating that, regardless of how a post-trial motion is labeled, we \"will conduct an independent de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>termination of what type of motion was before the district court\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b863-8\">. We also note that Ang never argued in his opening brief that CIS filed its bill of costs late, nor challenged the district court's ruling on the matter, even construing his brief liberally. Therefore, he has abandoned the issue. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that, while we read <em>pro se </em>briefs liberally, issues not briefed by <em>pro se </em>litigants are abandoned); <em>Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol., </em>516 F.3d 955, 972-73 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201d[A]n argument not included in the appellant\u2019s opening brief is deemed abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
