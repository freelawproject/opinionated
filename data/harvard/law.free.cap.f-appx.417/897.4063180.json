Saldivar contends the district court abused its discretion by imposing a sentence greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Specifically, he claims his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the Guideline range of 77-96 months\u2019 imprisonment is too high, and the district court failed to take into account his cultural assimilation in this country and his age and immaturity when he committed the majority of his criminal offenses. After review, we affirm Saldivar\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Saldivar to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court agreed the Guideline range of 77 to 96 months, with a statutory maximum of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, was unfairly high and imposed a downward variance. Further, the record clearly shows the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing Saldivar\u2019s sentence. The court specifically commented on the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of Saldivar, including his criminal history, problems with alcohol, and reasons for returning to the United States. Accordingly, we affirm Saldivar\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-10\">.
