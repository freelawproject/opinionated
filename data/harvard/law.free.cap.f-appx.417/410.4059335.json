He appeals his 46-month, within-guidelines sentence, arguing that it is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Seraf\u00edn urges that despite his failure to object to the reasonableness of his sentence in the district court, this court should review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard. He raises the argument only to preserve it for possible future review because, as he recognizes, it is foreclosed and our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). To succeed under this standard, Seraf\u00edn must show an error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights, but even so, this court generally will exercise its discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d Puc<em>kett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009) (citation omitted). Moreover, we presume that his within-guidelines sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Seraf\u00edn contends that his sentence is greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing because the district court did not take into account his cultural assimilation to the United States. Though the district court had the authority to impose a shorter sentence based on this factor, it was not required to weigh Serafin\u2019s cultural assimilation more heavily than other factors. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008). The court heard and understood Serafin\u2019s arguments for a lower sentence, but merely rejected the contention that his cultural assimilation outweighed his criminal history. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Specifically, the court found relevant that Seraf\u00edn committed some of his crimes after illegally reentering the United States and that he had six felony convictions and two misdemeanor convictions. Seraf\u00edn\u2019s disagreement with the court\u2019s balancing of the relevant factors is insufficient to show that the district court committed error, much less plain error, in imposing a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429; <em>Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">Seraf\u00edn also contends that the district court mistakenly observed that he burglarized cars for a living. However, this remark is supported in the record because according to the presentence report, though Seraf\u00edn held jobs in the past, he was unemployed when he was caught breaking into cars and stealing tools. In any event, Seraf\u00edn does not explain how this statement rendered his sentence substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">Finally, Seraf\u00edn argues that his within-guidelines sentence should not be presumed reasonable because \u00a7 2L1.2, the illegal reentry Guideline used to determine his sentence, is not supported by empirical data. As Serafin correctly concedes, however, this argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Accordingly, Serafin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>has not shown that the district court committed error, much less plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
