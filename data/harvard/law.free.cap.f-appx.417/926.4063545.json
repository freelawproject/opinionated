Powell was sentenced pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), because he had been previously convicted of three ACCA-qualifying offenses. Powell contends the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by judicially determining that his prior convictions were \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another,\u201d as required for sentencing under the ACCA. Powell acknowledges our precedent permits such determinations, particularly where sentencing courts limit their inquiries to Shepard-approved<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sources, but argues, for the first time on appeal, that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Nijhawan v. Holder, </em>557 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2294, 174 L.Ed.2d 22 (2009), abrogates those precedents. Specifically, he asserts that after <em>Nijhawan, </em>circumstance-specific facts, like those required under the ACCA\u2019s different-occasions inquiry, may not serve as the basis for sentencing enhancements unless they are alleged in the indictment and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After review, we affirm Powell\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Under \u00a7 924(e)\u2019s different-occasions inquiry, a sentencing court must determine whether \u201cthe perpetrator had a meaningful opportunity to desist his activity before committing the second offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Pope, </em>132 F.3d 684, 690 (11th Cir.1998). Because this inquiry necessarily \u201crequires looking at the facts underlying the prior convictions,\u201d we initially concluded that sentencing judges should not be limited to considering \u201ceasily produced and evaluated court documents,\u201d as they are in other contexts. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>230 F.3d 1297, 1300 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">Recently, however, we modified our holding in <em>Richardson </em>in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). <em>See United States v. Sneed, </em>600 F.3d 1326, 1332 (11th Cir.2010). <em>Shepard </em>held for purposes of determining whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7 924(e), a sentencing court (1) may not consider police reports or complaint applications, but (2) may examine \u201cthe terms of the charging document, the terms of the plea agreement or transcript of the colloquy between the judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or [ ] some comparable judicial record of this information.\u201d 544 U.S. at 23-26, 125 S.Ct. 1254. Accordingly, sentencing judges must still consider the circumstances underlying a defendant\u2019s convictions in order to determine if the convictions occurred on different occasions, but judges may be required to limit their inquiries to S7z,epcmi-approved sources. <em>Sneed, </em>600 F.3d at 1332 (stating that the Supreme Court \u201cgave us the list <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>of Shepard-approved sources largely to address or avoid constitutional concerns\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">In <em>Nijhawan, </em>the Supreme Court held that in determining whether an alien\u2019s prior conviction constitutes an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (A) (iii), immigration courts may consider \u201cthe factual circumstances surrounding commission of the crime\u201d without limiting their inquiry to <em>Shepard-approved </em>sources. <em>Nijhawan, </em>557 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. at 2298. In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted the constitutional issues in <em>Shepard </em>were not relevant to proceedings in immigration court, but acknowledged constitutional concerns might arise if an aggravated-felony finding was later used to enhance a criminal defendant\u2019s sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. <em>See Id. </em>at -, 129 S.Ct. at 2302-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">Powell contends the district court constitutionally erred in performing \u00a7 924(e)(l)\u2019s different-occasions inquiry, despite the fact it relied only on Shepard-approved sources.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Contrary to Powell\u2019s contentions, nothing in <em>Nijhawan </em>undermines the <em>Shepard-Sneed </em>line of cases. <em>Nijhawan </em>merely implied that if immigration courts are not limited to Shepard-approved sources, their findings may not provide a constitutional basis for sentencing enhancements. <em>Nijhawan </em>did not suggest circumstance-specific determinations made for ACCA purposes must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the district court did not err in sentencing Powell under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-8\">. <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b951-9\">. Powell next argues, for purposes of preservation only, the district court erred by imposing an enhanced sentence under the ACCA because he did not admit to the existence of his predicate offenses when he pled guilty. This argument is foreclosed by precedent. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (recognizing the \"fact of an earlier conviction\u201d may be constitutionally determined by judicial fact-finding). Thus, we decline to address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b951-14\">.We review properly preserved constitutional claims de novo. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). Powell's claim is subject to de novo review because he objected to his enhanced sentenced on constitutional grounds before the district court, and is now free to expand on that position on appeal. <em>See Yee v. Escondido, </em>503 U.S. 519, 534, 112 S.Ct. 1522, 118 L.Ed.2d 153 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b952-12\">. The Shepard-approved documents the Government introduced at sentencing showed Powell\u2019s prior offenses occurred on different days, and thus clearly established he \"had a meaningful opportunity to desist his activity before committing the [next] offense.\" <em>See Pope, </em>132 F.3d at 690.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
