After he was released from prison, Jackson violated several conditions of his supervised release. Jackson failed to comply with the orders of his probation officer, admitted to smoking marijuana, and made threats to an official at the Georgia Department of Revenue and his probation officer. Based on these violations, the probation office petitioned the district court to revoke Jackson\u2019s supervised release. At the revocation hearing Jackson stipulated to the violations and explained that the more serious violations \u2014 his threats against state and federal officers \u2014 were the result of his anger management problems. The district court revoked Jackson\u2019s supervised release and remanded him to prison for a term of 21 months. Jackson appeals from the revocation and argues that the district court erred by not verifying that he and his counsel had read and discussed the probation office\u2019s revocation report and that his term of imprisonment is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-18\">We review a term of imprisonment imposed following revocation for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). We first look to whether the district court committed any significant procedural error. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). We then examine the substantive reasonableness of the term of imprisonment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Jackson argues that his \u201csentence\u201d is procedurally unreasonable because the district court erred by not verifying that he and his counsel had read and discussed the probation office\u2019s revocation report.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The crux of Jackson\u2019s argument is this: the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure that governs an initial sentencing also applies to supervised-release-revocation hearings. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Rule 32, which governs sentencing procedure, requires that the probation office create a presentence report and, at sentencing, a district court must verify that the defendant and his counsel have read and discussed that report. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32. Rule 32.1 \u2014 the rule of criminal procedure that governs revocation hearings-\u2014 does not require that the district court verify that the defendant and his counsel review the probation officer\u2019s revocation report. Indeed, it does not even require that the probation office produce such a report. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1</p>\n<p id=\"Acd\">It is clear from the language of Rule 32 that it does not apply to revocation hearings. When a defendant is imprisoned upon revocation of supervised release, he is still serving part of his original sentence. <em>Cf. United States v. Woods, </em>127 F.3d 990, 993 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that revocation of probation is part of defendant\u2019s original sentence). What Rule 32 requires \u00eds that, at <em>sentencing, </em>the district judge verify that the defendant and his lawyer have reviewed and discussed the presentence report. Because supervised release is part of a defendant\u2019s original sentence, a revocation hearing occurs after sentencing. Furthermore, because a revocation hearing occurs after sentencing, a revocation report cannot be a presentence report. Rule 32(i)(l)(A) does not apply to revocation hearings. And we can find no support for transplanting Rule 32\u2019s requirements to revocation hearings held under Rule 32.1. Accordingly, the district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">Jackson also argues that the term of imprisonment imposed by the court following revocation was substantively unreasonable. Whether a term of imprisonment is substantively unreasonable is essentially a question whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1179. Although we do not presume that a term of imprisonment, like this one, that is within the properly calculated guidelines range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect that is the case. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). But even if a term of imprisonment is within the guidelines, it must also, considering the totality of the circumstances, achieve the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Gall </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number><em>v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191. The party challenging a sentence bears the burden of establishing its unreasonableness. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Jackson argues that the sentence is unreasonable because it fails to account for or to address the root of his problems \u2014 his inability to control his anger. Jackson suggests that a more lenient sentence would help alleviate his anger management problem or that, in any case, the district court should have imposed a condition that he receive anger management treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">At the revocation hearing, the district judge considered and addressed Jackson\u2019s arguments about his anger management problem. Jackson does not offer any explanation how a lesser term of imprisonment would address his anger management problem. And he has not established that the district court\u2019s revocation order has denied him the ability to participate in anger management programs during his incarceration. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Jackson\u2019s supervised release and imposing a 21-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Because we conclude that the district court committed no procedural error and that it did not abuse its discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-6\">. Because Jackson raises this argument for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). To prevail, Jackson must establish (1) that there was error; (2) that it was plain; and (2) that it affected his substantial rights. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b898-8\"><em>. </em>The purposes of \u00a7 3553(a) are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-9\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
