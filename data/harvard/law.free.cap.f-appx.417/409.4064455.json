He maintains that the district court erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>in denying his motion to suppress his fingerprints and his immigration A-File because they were fruits of the illegal stop of the vehicle in which Rodriguez-Castorena was a passenger. The arguments regarding the immigration A-File are foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Herrera-Ochoa, </em>245 F.3d 495, 498 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Roque-Villanueva, </em>175 F.3d 345, 346 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Pineda-Chinchilla, </em>712 F.2d 942, 944 (5th Cir.1983). With respect to the fingerprints, we have previously held that identity need not be suppressed as a \u201cfruit of an illegal stop.\u201d <em>Roque-Villanueva, </em>175 F.3d at 346. Because the fingerprints themselves did nothing more than identify Rodriguez-Castorena and did not constitute affirmative evidence of his crime, we conclude that this argument also fails under the precedent cited above. Id.; <em>see also United States v. Baeza-Castillo, </em>72 Fed.Appx. 170, 171 (5th Cir.2003)(unpublished). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
