In his plea agreement, Adkins waived his right to appeal or collaterally challenge his sentence except for, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca sentence above the statutory maximum.\u201d The district court enhanced Adkins\u2019s sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), after finding that Adkins had three prior convictions for violent felonies, including a Florida conviction for escape. The ACCA enhancement made Adkins\u2019s mandatory statutory sentence 180 months. Adkins received a two-level departure, and the court sentenced him to 126 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">Almost five years later, Adkins filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The crux of his argument was that he should be re-sentenced because <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009), recently established that escape from custody was not a violent felony. Adkins argued that the maximum possible sentence without the ACCA enhancement was 120 months, therefore the sentence appeal waiver did not preclude relief. The Government argued (1) the motion was untimely, (2) the appeal waiver foreclosed relief, (3) Adkins procedurally defaulted his claims, and (4) a conviction for escape from custody is still a \u201cviolent felony\u201d after <em>Chambers. </em>The district court concluded that Adkins\u2019s motion was barred by the sentence appeal waiver in his plea agreement, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-13\">\u201cIn a Section 2255 proceeding, we review legal issues <em>de novo </em>and factual findings under a clear error standard.\u201d <em>Lynn v. United States, 365 F.3d 1225, 1232 </em>(11th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (quoting <em>United States v. Walker, </em>198 F.3d 811, 813 (11th Cir.1999) (per curiam)).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-14\">Adkins misreads <em>Chambers, </em>which held that \u201cfailure to report\u201d is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. <em>Chambers, </em>129 S.Ct. at 689. In <em>United States v. Lee, </em>we held that a \u201cnon-violent walkaway escape from unsecured custody\u201d is not a violent felony <em>post-Chambers. </em>586 F.3d 859, 874 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2392, 176 L.Ed.2d 782 (2010). But we have never held that escape from secure custody is not a violent felony. In fact, four days after our <em>Lee </em>decision we held that \u201ca conviction for escape under Florida law is a serious violent felony within the meaning of [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3559(c) because it is punishable by a sentence of up to 15 years and involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person of another may be used.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>586 F.3d 918, 931 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1926, 176 L.Ed.2d 394 (2010).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mindful of <em>Chambers, </em>we noted that Sanchez pleaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>guilty \u201cto escape, not a failure to report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 932 n. 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Accordingly, because a Florida conviction for escape is a violent felony, Adkins\u2019s sentence of 126 months does not violate the statutory maximum, and the waiver in his plea agreement precludes him from challenging his sentence on the grounds raised in his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-11\">. Because the definitions of \"crime of violence\u201d and \"violent felony\u201d are \"virtually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>identical,\" cases concerning one definition \"provide important guidance\u201d concerning the other. <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1350 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
