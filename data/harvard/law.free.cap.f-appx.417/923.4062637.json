Petitioner, a native of Haiti and a citizen of Venezuela, moved the BIA to reopen the proceedings so that he could have the immigration courts review his application for Temporary Protective Status (\u201cTPS\u201d), which is available to Haitian nationals. He asks us to reverse the BIA\u2019s order, and direct the BIA to reopen the removal proceedings on the ground that the BIA, in denying his motion to reopen, infringed his Fifth Amendment right to due process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">We review this due process challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision <em>de novo. Lapaix v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 1138, 1143 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cTo establish a due process violation, the petitioner must show that [he] was deprived of liberty without due process of law and that the purported errors caused [him] substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>No deprivation of liberty occurs when an alien fails \u201cto receive relief that is purely discretionary in nature,\u201d such as the BIA\u2019s granting of a motion to reopen proceedings. <em>Scheerer v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cTo show substantial prejudice, an alien must demonstrate that, in the absence of the alleged violations, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Lapaix, </em>605 F.3d at 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-14\">Petitioner\u2019s claim fails because the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen did not infringe on any constitutionally protected interest. <em>See Scheerer, </em>513 F.3d at 1253 (holding that an alien could not prevail on a due process claim because he had no constitutionally protected interest in the BIA\u2019s granting of his motion to reopen or in the adjustment of his immigration status). The statutory provision petitioner cites does not grant him the right to have his initial TPS application reviewed by the immigration courts instead of the Department of Homeland Security. <em>See Matter of Lopez-Aldana, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 49, 50-52 &amp; n. 1 (BIA 2009). Moreover, because the BIA did not deprive him of any rights, he failed to show that the BIA\u2019s decision resulted in substantial prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-15\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-10\">. The BIA\u2019s order indicated that the IJ had no jurisdiction over petitioner's application for TPS, but that the Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 244A(b)(5)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(b)(5)(B), granted him the right to have the immigration courts review his TPS eligibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
