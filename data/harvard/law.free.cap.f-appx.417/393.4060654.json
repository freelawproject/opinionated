Flores challenges the substantive reasonableness of his within-guidelines sentence, arguing that it is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and does not adequately account for his personal history and characteristics, and that the El Paso Division of the Western District of Texas does not offer a \u201cfast-track\u201d program that would have made him eligible for a more lenient sentence. He contends that his sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because the illegal reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, lacks an empirical basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">We review the substantive reasonableness of Flores\u2019s sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 751 (5th Cir.2009). As Flores concedes, his \u201cfast-track\u201d and empirical data arguments are foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 563 (5th Cir.2008) (challenging the lack of a \u201cfast-track\u201d program); <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009) (challenging the lack of empirical support for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2). Flores\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s balancing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to show error in connection with his sentence. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010) (per curiam). He has not established that his within-guidelines sentence is unreasonable or that it should not be accorded a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
