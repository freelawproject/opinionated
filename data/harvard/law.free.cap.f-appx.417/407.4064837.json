Gutierrez contends his within-Guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable because: it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); and the advisory Sentencing Guidelines fail to properly account for his reasons for returning to the United States, his personal history, and his work ethic.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-15\">Gutierrez also contends his within-Guidelines sentence should not be afforded the usual presumption of reasonableness because Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and improperly double counts his prior offense. These \u201clack-of-empirical-data\u201d and \u201cdouble-counting\u201d contentions are foreclosed by our court\u2019s precedent and are, therefore, unavailing. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). His challenge to the presumption of reasonableness of his within-Guidelines sentence is likewise identical to one our court has previously held lacking in merit. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-20\">Gutierrez does not assert procedural error regarding the calculation of his advisory Guideline sentencing range. Regarding his challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, Gutierrez concedes he did not object in district court to its reasonableness; therefore, his challenge is reviewed only for plain error. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). To show reversible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>plain error, Gutierrez must show a clear or obvious error that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Gutierrez\u2019 substantive-reasonableness contentions constitute a disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and the appropriateness of his sentence. Because these contentions do not suffice to show error, much less reversible plain error, Gutierrez has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness attached to his within-Guidelines sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
