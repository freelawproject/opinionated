Gordy, </em>526 F.2d 631, 635-36 (5th Cir.1976). No one factor is necessarily controlling. <em>Id. </em>at 635. This court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>166 F.3d 748, 751 (5th Cir.1999); <em>see also Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 509-10, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978) (according trial court\u2019s mistrial decision \u201cgreat deference\u201d). It is not clear from the record or the jury\u2019s notes that the reason for the jury\u2019s continued deliberation was its inability to agree as to Martinez\u2019s duress defense, rather than its effort to understand the nuances of the application of the duress defense. Accordingly, giving \u201cgreat deference\u201d to the district court, Martinez has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying her motion for a mistrial. <em>See Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 509-10, 98 S.Ct. 824; <em>Mitchell, </em>166 F.3d at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Martinez also argues that the district court erred in not giving her a safety valve adjustment because it failed to make an independent determination concerning the issue and instead relied solely on the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty as to one of the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">Consistent with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2\u2019s directive that the safety valve is applicable if \u201cthe court finds that the defendant meets the criteria,\u201d a district court is required to make an independent determination whether the criteria have been met. <em>See United States v. McCrimmon, </em>443 F.3d 454, 457-58 (5th Cir.2006). However, the record indicates that the court did not solely base its decision on the jury\u2019s verdict and that it instead reached an independent determination. Additionally, in light of conflicting evidence at trial concerning Martinez\u2019s truthfulness and the jury\u2019s verdict of guilt as to one of the charged offenses, a determination that Martinez did not meet her burden of showing that she had been truthful and thus entitled to safety valve relief was plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f); <em>McCrimmon, </em>443 F.3d at 457; <em>United States v. Powers, </em>168 F.3d 741, 753 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, the district court did not commit clear error in denying Martinez safety valve relief. <em>See McCrimmon, </em>443 F.3d at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
