The Board of Immigration Appeals agreed with the finding of the immigration judge that Castillo-Padilla had not been \u201cparoled into the United States\u201d and did not qualify for an adjustment of status. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5)(A). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-23\">In 1999, Castillo-Padilla entered the United States illegally. In 2006, the Department of Homeland Security gave Castillo-Padilla notice that he was subject to removal for being an alien in the United States without admission or parole. Castillo-Padilla was arrested and detained by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. The Attorney General later released Castillo-Padilla after he paid a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>bond of $12,000. When he was released, Castillo-Padilla received an 1-94 Departure Record with a stamp stating that he had posted bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Castillo-Padilla conceded removability, but he later applied to adjust his residency status based on his marriage to a citizen of the United States. The immigration judge found that Castillo-Padilla was not eligible for an adjustment of status based on his marriage, and Castillo-Padilla agreed with that finding. Castillo-Padilla argued that he was eligible for an adjustment of status on the alternative ground that he had been issued an 1-94 form that evidenced he had been \u201cparoled\u201d into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The immigration judge denied Castillo-Padilla\u2019s application for an adjustment of status and ordered him removed from the United States. The immigration judge found that the 1-94 form that Castillo-Padilla received was \u201cjust an indication that a bond was posted and he was released from the custody of the Department of Homeland Security under bond.\u201d The immigration judge reasoned that \u201ca release under bond\u201d did not establish that Castillo-Padilla \u201chad been in fact paroled into the United States by the Department of Homeland Security, and as such he would not be eligible for adjustment of status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">The Board agreed with the findings of the immigration judge and dismissed Castillo-Padilla\u2019s appeal. The Board stated that Castillo-Padilla had failed to \u201cadequately explain[] how his release from custody on a $12,000 bond constitutes conditional parole,\u201d but the Board found that, even if Castillo-Padilla had been \u201cafforded \u2018conditional parole\u2019 under section 236(a)(2)(B) of the Act,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a)(2)(B), that was \u201cnot the same as \u2018parole into the United States\u2019 \u201d that would make him \u201celigible for adjustment of status under section 245(a),\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). The Board also found that Castillo-Padilla failed to prove that the government intended to parole him into the United States when it issued the 1-94 form because the form was stamped with the amount of the bond instead of endorsed with the parole stamp, as required to grant parole to an alien under section 212(d)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5)(A). The Board agreed with the finding of the immigration judge that \u201cconditional parole under section 236(a)(2)(B)\u201d was a \u201cdistinct and different procedure from parole under section 212(d)(5)(A) and that [Castillo-Padilla] [was] not eligible to adjust his status under section 245(a) ... on the basis of his release from custody on conditional parole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">We review the decision of the Board to determine whether it is \u201c \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Diallo v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>596 F.3d 1329, 1332 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001)). As a general rule, we review questions of law <em>de novo, </em>but when the issue involves the interpretation of a statute by the administering agency, we apply the deferential two-step test articulated in <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resource Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>De Sandoval v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir.2006). The first step of the Chevron test \u201crequires us to determine whether \u2018Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1279 (quoting <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842, 104 S.Ct. at 2781). If Congress has not addressed the issue, or if language of the statute is ambiguous, we proceed to the second step of the Chevron test to determine \u201c \u2018whether the agency\u2019s [regulation] is based on a permissible construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. at 2782).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Castillo-Padilla makes two arguments in support of his petition, but we lack jurisdiction to consider one of those arguments. Castillo-Padilla argues that the Board misinterpreted the laws governing parole. Castillo-Padilla also argues that the denial of an opportunity to adjust his status violated his right to due process, but Castillo-Padilla did not present this argument to the Board. \u201c[Ajbsent a cognizable excuse or exception, \u2018we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before\u2019 \u201d the Board. <em>Amayar-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir. 2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Castillo-Padilla argues that when he was released from custody on \u201cconditional parole\u201d he became eligible for an adjustment of status, but the decision of the Board that Castillo-Padilla was ineligible is more consistent with the language of the statute. An alien may apply for an adjustment of status if he has been \u201cinspected and admitted or paroled into the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). Congress employed the term \u201cconditional parole\u201d to refer to the release of an alien subject to removal from the United States. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1226(a)(2). \u201cAs we have previously stated, \u2018when Congress uses different language in similar sections, it intends different meanings.\u2019 \u201d <em>DIRECTV, Inc. v. Brown, </em>371 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Iraola &amp; CIA, S.A. v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., </em>232 F.3d 854, 859 (11th Cir. 2000)). Alternatively, we conclude that the Board reasonably decided that Castillo-Padilla\u2019s release on conditional parole did not make him eligible to apply for an adjustment of status for having been \u201cparoled into the United States,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). An alien may be \u201cparoled into the United States\u201d by the Attorney General temporarily if the parole would serve \u201curgent humanitarian reasons\u201d or provide a \u201csignificant public benefit,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1182(d)(5)(A), which contrasts starkly with being released on conditional parole until immigration authorities decide if an alien should be removed from the United States, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1226(a)(2). <em>See Delgado-Sobalvarro v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>625 F.3d 782, 786-87 (3d Cir.2010); <em>Ortega-Cervantes v. Gonzales, </em>501 F.3d 1111, 1116-20 (9th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Castillo-Padilla\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
