On appeal, Ran-gel-Perez\u2019s brief challenges only the merits of the IJ\u2019s decision denying him cancellation of removal and voluntary departure. Rangel-Perez\u2019s brief does not address the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-22\">We lack jurisdiction to review the underlying merits of the denial of cancellation of removal. Rangel-Perez\u2019s June 29, 2010 petition for review was not filed within thirty days of the entry of the BIA\u2019s July 22, 2009 order affirming the denial of cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir. 2005) (explaining that the period for filing a petition for review \u201cis mandatory and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>jurisdictional, [and] it is not subject to equitable tolling\u201d (quotation marks omitted)); Jagg<em>ernauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350-51 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that the filing of a motion for reconsideration does not affect the finality of a removal order and that the order resolving the motion for reconsideration is a separately appealable final order).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the petition is dismissed to the extent Rangel-Perez seeks review of the BIA\u2019s July 22, 2009 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Rangel-Perez\u2019s June 29, 2010 petition for review is timely as to the BIA\u2019s June 1, 2010 denial of his motion for reconsideration. However, Rangel-Perez\u2019s brief does not offer any argument as to why the BIA abused its discretion in denying this particular motion. For this reason, RangelPerez has abandoned any argument regarding the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cWhen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d). Therefore, the petition is denied as to the BIA\u2019s June 1, 2010 denial of Rangel-Perez\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AGj\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>our own subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Avila v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>560 F.3d 1281, 1283 (11th Cir.2009). \"We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Calle v.

In fact, in August 2009, Rangel-Perez timely filed a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s July 22, 2009 order. On September 10, 2010, a panel of this Court dismissed Rangel-Perez\u2019s petition for review, concluding that Rangel-Perez, although couching his argument in due process terms, had effectively presented an abuse-of-discretion argument regarding the discretionary decision to deny cancellation of removal, a claim this Court does not have jurisdiction to review. <em>See Rangel-Perez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>No. 09-13934 (11th Cir. Sept. 10, 2010) (unpublished). In both his earlier appeal and this appeal, Rangel-Perez's arguments focus primarily on whether the IJ erred in finding that Rangel-Perez had not made the showing of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship required for cancellation of removal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
