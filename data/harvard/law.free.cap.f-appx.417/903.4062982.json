Pruitt contends the district court erred in construing his motion as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, instead of a petition under \u00a7 2241 to correct his sentence. We granted Pruitt leave to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>and a certificate of appealability as to the following issue: \u201cWhether the district court erred in construing Pruitt\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion to adjust his federal sentences as a non-authorized 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, as opposed to a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition.\u201d After review, we affirm the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-25\">Granting credit for time served under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 \u201cis, in the first instance, an administrative, not a judicial function.\u201d <em>United States v. Nyhuis, </em>211 F.3d 1340, 1345 (11th Cir.2000). Credit for time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>served may be sought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 after the exhaustion of administrative remedies. <em>Id. </em>Further, a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to \u00a7 2241 \u201cmay be brought only in the district court for the district in which the inmate is incarcerated.\u201d <em>Fernandez v. United States, </em>941 F.2d 1488, 1495 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Because Pruitt sought credit for time served under \u00a7 5G1.3, the district court erred in construing his motion as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, instead of a \u00a7 2241 petition. The district court did not, however, err in dismissing Pruitt\u2019s claim for lack of jurisdiction because Pruitt failed to show he exhausted his administrative remedies and further, his \u00a7 2241 petition was filed in the Northern District of Florida.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b927-18\">. We review de novo the dismissal of a \u00a7 2255 motion as successive. <em>McIver v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 1327, 1329 (11th Cir. 2002). We can affirm on any sufficient ground, even if different from that relied upon by the district court. <em>Parks v. City of Warner Robins, </em>43 F.3d 609, 613 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AYQV\">. Pruitt is incarcerated at the United States Prison in Coleman, Florida, which is located in the Middle District of Florida.
