Sutton appeals the grant of summary judgment to Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. on Sutton\u2019s claims under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\u201cReal Estate Act\u201d), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2607. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Sutton owned a home subject to two mortgages, but his only source of income was a $1,080 monthly social security benefit. He desired to reduce his mortgage payments, which exceeded $1,400 per month. So, he sought help from a mortgage broker with Apex Mortgage Services to obtain a refinance loan. During a telephone conversation with Sutton, the broker took down information for a loan application, and then he shopped the loan application to several lenders. According to Sutton, the broker led him to believe that he could receive, from Countrywide, a refinance loan with payments of $428 per month. The broker, however, ultimately arranged for Sutton an adjustable rate loan with Countrywide requiring monthly payments starting at over $1,000 per month and subject to further increases. Sutton signed forms stating he agreed to the terms of the loan arranged by the Apex broker. He claims, however, that he did not understand the terms of the loan until after closing. As compensation for brokering Sutton\u2019s loan, Countrywide paid Apex $7,270. This payment included a \u201cyield spread premium\u201d of $4,710, which is a payment made in exchange for the broker delivering a mortgage above the \u201cpar rate\u201d being offered by the lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">Sutton alleges that in applying for this loan on Sutton\u2019s behalf, the broker committed a variety of acts that were \u201cwrongful, fraudulent, and predatory.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 13.) For example, the broker reported on the loan application that Sutton earned a monthly salary of $4,500 even though Sutton informed the broker that his actual income was about one-fourth that amount. Also, Sutton\u2019s existing mortgage had a prepayment penalty, and the broker did not notify Sutton of this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">Sutton filed suit against Countrywide in Hendry County, Florida Circuit Court alleging a violation of the Real Estate Act. He also brought state law claims for deceptive trade practices, fraud, and elder abuse. Countrywide removed the case to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, invoking federal question and diversity jurisdiction. Sutton then amended his complaint to add Apex as a defendant. But, Apex is apparently no longer in business, and it did not make an appearance to defend the lawsuit. A default was entered against Apex, and Sutton ultimately dismissed with prejudice all claims against it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">Countrywide moved for summary judgment, which the court granted as to the Real Estate Act claim. The court summarized Sutton\u2019s theory of the case as arguing that \u201cbecause Apex allegedly did bad things in assisting Sutton with his refinancing, Countrywide should not have paid Apex any yield spread premium.\u201d (R.4-95 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>at 4.) It held that because Sutton presented no evidence Countrywide colluded with Apex, or knew or should have known that Apex did \u201cbad things\u201d in brokering the loan, there were no genuine issues of material fact. The court granted Countrywide summary judgment for the Real Estate Act claim and declined to maintain supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state claims. Sutton appeals the entry of summary judgment for the Real Estate Act claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The Real Estate Act proscribes the payment of kickbacks and unearned fees in association with mortgage lending. A payment by a lender to a mortgage broker violates the anti-kickback provisions of the Act when it is made solely in exchange for a referral of business. A payment does not violate the Act if it bears a reasonable relationship to goods or services actually provided or performed by the broker. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2607(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">This case involves a yield spread premium. The lowest interest rate at which a lender will make loans without charging a borrower additional up-front fees is commonly referred to as the par rate. If a broker arranges a loan with an interest rate below the par rate, the lender generally requires the broker to pay discount points; these costs are passed along to the borrower. In contrast, if a broker arranges a loan with an interest rate above the par rate, the lender pays the broker a yield spread premium. This payment is often passed along, in part, to the borrower in the form of reduced loan closing costs. <em>See e.g. Culpepper v. Inland Mortg. Corp., </em>132 F.3d 692, 694 (11th Cir.1998) (describing yield spread premiums). In this case, Countrywide paid Apex a yield spread premium of $4,710, and Sutton paid no cash at closing. (R.2-49, Ex. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">We apply a two-step test to consider whether a yield spread premium violates the anti-kickback provisions of the Real Estate Act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-9\">First, we ask whether the broker performed \u201cactual services\u201d in the course of arranging the mortgage transaction.... If the answer to the first question is no, then a [Real Estate Act] violation has been established. If the answer to the first question is yes, we then proceed to ask whether the total compensation was reasonable in light of the total array of services that the broker performed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atr\"><em>Culpepper v. Irwin Mortg. Corp., </em>491 F.3d 1260, 1273 (11th Cir.2007) (citations omitted) (applying test set forth in Department of Housing and Urban Development statement of policy). Sutton argues that Apex\u2019s acts should not count as \u201cactual services\u201d for purposes of this analysis because they were undertaken as part of a scheme to defraud Sutton by misrepresenting his financial capacity to Countrywide and arranging for him an \u201cunsuitable loan.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 9.) Because Apex provided no \u201cactual services,\u201d Sutton argues, any yield spread premium payment to Apex violated the Real Estate Act under step one of the test. Sutton also contends that even if Apex is found to have offered \u201cactual services,\u201d the compensation was unreasonable under step two of the test because the \u201ctotal array of services\u201d that Apex performed was of no value to Sutton in that he was left with a loan he could not afford. We reject these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">The Real Estate Act\u2019s anti-kickback provisions forbid lenders from compensating brokers for referrals. These provisions are not the appropriate vehicle for considering globally \u2014 as Sutton would have us do \u2014 whether a broker provided fair, honest, and competent service to a borrower. Instead, we consider whether the broker performed <em>actual </em>brokerage services; whether it completed tasks or provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>goods related to the arrangement of a mortgage that warrant payment from the lender or borrower. If so, we ask if any payment bears \u201ca reasonable relationship to the value received <em>by the person or company making the payment.\u201d </em>Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act Statement of Policy 1999-1 Regarding Lender Payments to Mortgage Brokers, 64 Fed. Reg. 10080, 10086 (March 1, 1999) (emphasis added). In arranging Sutton\u2019s loan, it is undisputed Apex actually completed tasks commonly performed in the origination of a loan. <em>See id. </em>at 10085 (listing common loan origination services). Because Apex performed tasks to further the processing and origination of the loan, Countrywide received value from Apex\u2019s services. So, its payment to Apex was not a kickback or unearned fee under step one of our analysis. As to step two, Sutton presents no evidence that Countrywide\u2019s payment to Apex was an unreasonably high sum for the types of services Apex performed. Therefore, the yield spread premium in this case satisfies both prongs of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Whether or not Apex acted out of its own self interest to arrange a loan with unfavorable terms for Sutton, this does not negate the fact that Apex performed \u201cactual services\u201d in brokering the loan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nor does it cause an otherwise reasonable fee for these services to violate the anti-kickback provisions of the Real Estate Act. Because Apex provided \u201cactual services\u201d in arranging Sutton\u2019s loan and because the total compensation paid to Apex was not unreasonable, Countrywide\u2019s payment did not violate the Real Estate Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b858-7\">. When Sutton filed his notice of appeal, no judgment had been entered against Apex, but only an entry of default. We ordered supplemental briefing to address whether there was a final judgment as to all parties to this action. We do not construe the district court's order of January 29, 2009 to remand any federal claims against Apex to the Florida Circuit Court. Sutton has now filed a voluntary notice of dismissal with prejudice of his claims against Apex. The dismissal of Apex cured any jurisdictional defect that would have prevented our review of the merits of this appeal. See <em>Kramer v. Unitas, </em>831 F.2d 994, 997 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b860-5\">. The district court's opinion includes an implicit finding that the yield spread premium in this case was not unreasonably high. The court also held Sutton presented no evidence that Countrywide colluded with or knew of Apex\u2019s alleged misconduct in arranging Sutton\u2019s loan. (R.4-95 at 4). We conclude that Sutton has not presented sufficient evidence to show that Countrywide knew or should have known of any acts taken by Apex that could give rise to a colorable claim of fraud. Therefore, we do not consider whether Countrywide would have violated the anti-kickback provisions of the Real Estate Act had it colluded with Apex to arrange an unfavorable loan for Sutton.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
