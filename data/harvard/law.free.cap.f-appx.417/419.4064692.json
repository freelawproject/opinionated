Wilson raises numerous issues and generally asserts that his deportation proceedings violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-25\">We generally review only the BIA\u2019s decision except to the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision influences the BIA. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 (5th Cir.2007). We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Wilson\u2019s requests for relief because he is removable for having committed the aggravated felony of conspiracy to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1101(a)(43)(B); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2); <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 60, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006); <em>Balogun v. Ashcroft, </em>270 F.3d 274, 277-78 &amp; n. 10 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-28\">Although we are not precluded from reviewing claims raising constitutional or purely legal questions, <em>see </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), Wilson\u2019s assertions of alleged due process violations are merely abuse of discretion claims in disguise. <em>See Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.2004) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>(\u201c[T]he failure to receive relief that is purely discretionary in nature does not amount to a deprivation of a liberty interest.\u201d) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, Wilson\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b443-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
