The district court construed the application as raising only \u00a7 2254 claims arising out of a prison disciplinary proceeding and denied it on the basis that Rosin did not have a liberty interest at stake. Rosin does not dispute the district court\u2019s decision that he was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 2254. Instead, he argues that he does not seek relief under \u00a7 2254 but wishes to bring claims for civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. We construe Rosin\u2019s request for a COA as both a request for a COA for any \u00a7 2254 claims and an appeal of the dismissal of any civil rights claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>The label attached to a prisoner\u2019s pro se pleading is not controlling; rather, courts must look to the content of the pleading. <em>United States v. Santora, </em>711 F.2d 41, 42 n. 1 (5th Cir.1983). In his pleading, Rosin sought damages and injunctive relief alleging, among other things, that prison officials had placed a hold on his trust account and had found him guilty of a disciplinary violation without due process. Where prisoners are permitted to possess property, they have a protected interest in their property and \u00a7 1983 provides a remedy if prison officials deprive prisoners of this interest absent due process. <em>McCrae v. Hankins, </em>720 F.2d 863, 869 (5th Cir.1983), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 531-33, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984), <em>as recognized in Augustine v. Doe, </em>740 F.2d 322, 328 &amp; n. 10 (5th Cir.1984). A prisoner has a protected property interest in the funds in his prison account. <em>Eubanks v. McCotter, </em>802 F.2d 790, 792-94 (5th Cir.1986); <em>Brewer v. Collins, </em>857 S.W.2d 819, 823 (Tex.App.1993). Moreover, Rosin\u2019s request for damages on the basis that his disciplinary proceedings did not meet minimum standards of procedural due process may be cognizable in a \u00a7 1983 suit as long as it does not implicate the validity of the disciplinary conviction or affect the duration of Rosin\u2019s sentence. <em>See Muhammad v. Close, </em>540 U.S. 749, 751, 124 S.Ct. 1303, 158 L.Ed.2d 32 (2004) (\u201cChallenges to the validity of any confinement or to particulars affecting its duration are the province of habeas corpus; requests for relief turning on circumstances of confinement may be presented in a \u00a7 1983 action.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Rosin also sought to amend his pleading to add additional claims under \u00a7 1983, including that prison officials retaliated against him for filing grievances and that officials denied him access to the courts to pursue a personal-injury claim. Rosin was entitled to amend his pleading once as a matter of right because the respondent had not yet filed a responsive pleading. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a); <em>Barksdale v. King, </em>699 F.2d 744, 746-7 (5th Cir.1983) (applying Rule 15(a) to \u00a7 1983 complaint where no responsive pleading had been filed). Accordingly, it was an abuse of discretion to fail to permit the amendment. <em>See Horton v. Cockrell, </em>70 F.3d 397, 402 (5th Cir.1996) (finding abuse of discretion based on denial of plaintiffs first motion to amend where no responsive pleading had been filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Accordingly, Rosin\u2019s request for a COA to appeal the dismissal of his \u00a7 2254 claims is DENIED. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Rosin\u2019s civil-rights claims is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for the district court to permit Rosin to amend his pleading and to consider whether he has alleged any civil-rights violations cognizable under \u00a7 1983. Rosin\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
