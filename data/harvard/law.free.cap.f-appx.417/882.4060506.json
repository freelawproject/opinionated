We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the issue of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>Whether the district court erred in concluding that Graber had failed to state a claim for federal habeas corpus relief, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, when he alleged that he had been illegally sentenced above the statutory maximum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdB\">For the reasons stated below, we answer that question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">\u201cWhen examining a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, we review questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact <em>de novo, </em>and findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Williams v. Allen, </em>542 F.3d 1326, 1336 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted). A petitioner\u2019s claim that his sentence exceeds the maximum authorized by state law \u201cproperly falls within the scope of federal habeas corpus review because \u2018the eighth amendment bars a prison sentence beyond the legislatively created maximum.\u2019 \u201d <em>Echols v. Thomas, </em>33 F.3d 1277, 1279 (11th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Ralph v. Blackburn, </em>590 F.2d 1335, 1337 n. 3 (5th Cir.1979)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By contrast, a petitioner\u2019s challenge to state sentencing guidelines is outside the scope of federal habeas corpus review. <em>See Branan v. Booth, </em>861 F.2d 1507, 1508 (11th Cir.1988) (explaining that habeas petitions based on issues of state law do not provide a basis for relief and that \u201c[i]n the area of state sentencing guidelines in particular, we consistently have held that federal courts cannot review a state\u2019s alleged failure to adhere to its own sentencing procedures\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">Graber was convicted of third-degree murder, a second degree felony under Florida law, and was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment in accordance with state sentencing guidelines. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 782.04(4) (1997). He argues that the district court erred in dismissing his \u00a7 2254 petition because his 20-year sentence exceeded the 15-year maximum sentence provided in Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.082(3)(c) (1997) for second-degree felonies. However, under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 921.001(5) \u201c[i]f a recommended sentence under the [sentencing] guidelines <em>exceeds </em>the maximum sentence otherwise authorized by \u00a7 775.082, the sentence under the guidelines <em>must </em>be imposed, absent a departure.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 921.001(5) (1997) (emphasis added). Because Graber\u2019s sentence was based on state sentencing guidelines, his claim falls outside the scope of federal habeas corpus review. <em>See Branan, </em>861 F.2d at 1508. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Graber\u2019s \u00a7 2254 habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-8\">. In <em>Bonner v.
