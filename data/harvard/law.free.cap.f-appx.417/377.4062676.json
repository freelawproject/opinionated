Molina\u2019s 78-month sentence was enhanced for obstruction of justice and for transporting a minor unaccompanied by a parent or grandparent. On appeal, Molina challenges these enhancements on the basis of the Sixth Amendment. Specifically, he contends that the district court violated the Sixth Amendment by imposing the enhancements based upon facts not found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-23\">A district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo, and its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir. 2008). In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Court extended <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) to the Sentencing Guidelines, holding that, with the exception of prior convictions, facts needed for a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict \u201cmust be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d In order to remedy the Sixth Amendment problem posed by factfinding under the Guidelines, the Court in <em>Booker </em>rendered the formerly-mandatory Guidelines advisory only. <em>Id. </em>at 245, 125 S.Ct. 738. Under the <em>post-Booker </em>advisory guideline sentencing system, district courts make the factual findings relevant to sentencing, just as they did before <em>Booker. United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-24\">Molina was sentenced under the post-<em>Booker </em>advisory Guidelines system. The district court did not violate <em>Booker </em>by finding the facts relevant to the enhancements. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519; <em>see also United States v. Stevens, </em>487 F.3d 232, 245-46 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Rhine, </em>583 F.3d 878, 886 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, Molina\u2019s Sixth Amendment arguments are unavailing and the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Molina\u2019s pro se motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
