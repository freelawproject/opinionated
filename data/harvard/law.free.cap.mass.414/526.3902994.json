L. c. 210, \u00a7 3 (1990 ed.). She argues that (1) the judge\u2019s findings regarding current parental unfitness and the best interests of the children were not supported by clear and convincing evidence; (2) the failure of the Department of Social Services (department) to provide timely and appropriate services to prevent the dissolution of the family requires reversal of the judge\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights; and (3) certain evidentiary rulings constituted reversible error. We transferred the case here on our own motion, and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">The children at issue, Kimberly and Joyce, have the same natural mother but different fathers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The mother also has another child, Lucy, by the father of Joyce (to whom we shall refer as \u201cBob\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since November 1, 1988, Kimberly and Joyce have lived with Kimberly\u2019s paternal grandparents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>who are the prospective adoptive parents.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On January 24, 1989, a District Court judge adjudicated Kimberly and Joyce in need of care and protection pursuant to a petition filed by the department. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24 (1990 ed.). On October 5, 1989, the department filed the instant petitions which, while not consolidated, were heard together. The children\u2019s natural fathers did not contest the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">After a three-day trial, the judge found that both girls had been victims of sexual and emotional abuse and neglect and allowed the department\u2019s petitions. The judge\u2019s order allowed the children to be adopted by the grandparents and granted the mother visitation rights subject to certain conditions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">1. The mother argues that the evidence relied on by the judge in concluding that she was currently unfit to parent the children was stale and, therefore, was not clear and convincing. She admits that the record supports the judge\u2019s findings as to her life-style up to the time that the children were removed from her care, but claims that she has since improved and currently has the ability to assume parental responsibility for the children. The mother also argues that the judge\u2019s conclusion that the best interests of the children are served by terminating parental rights is also not supported by clear and convincing evidence. Since parental fitness and the best interests of the child are interrelated inquiries, we address both arguments together. <em>Adoption of Carlos, </em>413 Mass. 339, 348 (1992), citing <em>Petition of the New England Home for Little Wanderers to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>367 Mass. 631, 641 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">In order to remove children permanently from a natural parent and to dispense with parental consent to adoption under G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, the judge must find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the parent is currently unfit to fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>ther the welfare and best interests of the child. <em>Care &amp; Protection of Martha, </em>407 Mass. 319, 327 (1990), and cases cited. However, a judge can \u201crely upon prior patterns of ongoing, repeated, serious parental neglect, abuse, and misconduct in determining current unfitness.\u201d <em>Adoption of Diane, </em>400 Mass. 196, 204 (1987). The judge\u2019s findings must be left undisturbed absent a showing that they are clearly erroneous. <em>Care &amp; Protection of Martha, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Many of the judge\u2019s findings concerned the mother\u2019s lifestyle prior to when Kimberly and Joyce were removed from her care in 1988.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge also made findings that the mother may have been improving her ability to care for the children.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the judge concluded that the mother was unfit to parent her children specifically due to \u201cher continuing and problematic relationship with [Bob, the father of Joyce and Lucy].\u201d The judge found that \u201c[b]oth girls [Kimberly and Joyce] were sexually abused by [Bob] by direct and inappropriate physical contact. This is clear from the Court\u2019s own observations of [Kimberly], as well as from the testimony and exhibits. . . . One of the many results of this abuse is that both girls are in fear of being in [Bob\u2019s] presence, alone or with others, and even seeing possessions associated with [Bob] cause them great anxiety.\u201d On the testimony of the children\u2019s therapist, the judge also found that, \u201c[u]nder no circumstances should [Joyce and Kimberly] be in the presence of [Bob], or in a place where he may leave his clothing or personal effects.\u201d Further, while the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>was unable to find that the mother lived with Bob at the time of the trial, he did find that Bob did not have a permanent address, worked near the mother\u2019s residence, visited her residence daily to visit his child Lucy, left many possessions there, and frequently showered, changed clothes, and ate there. In addition, on the basis of a psychological assessment, the judge found that the mother \u201cplaced her own needs to continue involvement with [Bob] before the needs of her children,\u201d that \u201cthe mother was very slow to acknowledge and deal with the impact of the sexual abuse,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he mother has a history of having failed to protect these two minor children from abuse and neglect and in fact has contributed to some of what they have suffered.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the judge concluded, \u201c[g]iven that on-going contact and relationship, there is no way that the girls could be returned to the mother\u2019s care as they would be continually at risk of contact with [Bob].\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">. In regard to the children, the judge found that Kimberly \u201cneeds consistently stable care with a regular routine, warm, nurturing care where she feels loved and safe with no threat of danger.\u201d As to Joyce, the judge found that her \u201cparenting needs are the same as those of [Kimberly] plus she needs a little more understanding for her regression: she needs tolerance and patience.\u201d The judge also found that both girls were suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder as a result of the sexual abuse, but that their behavior had improved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>since living with the grandparents. Thus, the judge concluded that the department\u2019s proposed plans for the children, which called for the grandparents to adopt the children, were in the best interests of the children. The judge granted the mother visitation rights, but stated that the children should not be exposed in any way to Bob or his effects, and that the visits should be at the discretion of the grandparents.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because of the evidence of Bob\u2019s abuse, the mother\u2019s continuing relationship with Bob, and the children\u2019s improvement since living with the grandparents, the judge\u2019s findings and disposition of these cases were not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">2. The mother next contends that the judge\u2019s finding that the children \u201cwere sexually abused by [Bob] by direct and inappropriate physical contact\u201d was not supported by clear and convincing evidence. She also argues that the finding is clearly erroneous because it conflicts with a finding adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>by the judge that \u201c[Bob] sexually abused [Kimberly] and may have also sexually abused [Joyce].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">We do not reach the mother\u2019s argument that the evidence of abuse must be shown by clear and convincing evidence because the ample evidence of abuse clearly met that standard. The mother testified that she believed Bob had abused both of her daughters. One expert testified that she had no question the sexual abuse had occurred. In a report admitted in evidence, another expert who evaluated the children stated that \u201cthese two girls give a very definite history of inappropriate sexual activity by [Bob]. This is given against a backdrop that is well defined by everyone as high risk given the substance abuse that is present in the home and the presence of x-rated movies.\u201d The grandmother testified that Joyce and Kimberly demonstrated inappropriate sexual activity at home with each other and with dolls. Another witness testified that the children demonstrated similar activity in therapy. This evidence provides a clear and convincing basis for the judge\u2019s finding that both girls were abused.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Care &amp; Protection of Martha, supra </em>at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">3. Pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 82 (1990 ed.),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the department filed a motion to admit six out-of-court statements of Joyce at trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The mother opposed the motion. After a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>hearing, the judge found, as required by the statute, that Joyce was unavailable to testify and that her statements met the statute\u2019s requirement of reliability.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The statements were later admitted in evidence. The mother now argues that admission of the statements was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The mother did not object to the introduction of the statements at trial. However, she asserts that, when the judge at the preliminary hearing stated that having children testify was his last preference, her counsel \u201cunderstandably, fell silent.\u201d See <em>Adoption of Seth, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 343, 350 (1990). She argues that her counsel\u2019s statement at the preliminary hearing, that he preferred that the children testify, should be interpreted as a continuing objection to the admission of Joyce\u2019s statements at trial. We disagree. A quick review of the record shows that the judge was not inappropriately pressuring counsel at the hearing or influencing the trial.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Adoption of Seth, supra </em>at 351. Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>judge gave counsel every opportunity not only to object at trial, but to argue that the department had not even offered the statements as part of its case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Counsel, however, failed to raise an objection. The consequence of such a failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>object is to waive the objection to the testimony and the statements retained their \u201cfull probative force.\u201d <em>Freyermuth </em>v. <em>Lutfy, </em>376 Mass. 612, 617 (1978). P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 74 (5th ed. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Moreover, since the judge\u2019s finding that both girls were sexually abused was supported by evidence independent of Joyce\u2019s statements, there was no risk of reversible error in the admission of the statements. See discussion at Part 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">4. The judge determined that, based on the testimony of the children\u2019s therapist in the preliminary hearing, Kimberly was available to testify at trial. However, because the therapist testified that Kimberly would suffer emotional and psychological trauma if she were required to testify in the courtroom and in her mother\u2019s presence, the judge asked counsel whether the mother would be agreeable to a procedure whereby Kimberly would testify out of counsel\u2019s and her mother\u2019s presence. Following a colloquy with all parties, it was agreed that Kimberly would be questioned in chambers by the judge, that the questioning would be tape recorded, that Kimberly would be accompanied by a social worker who had not yet testified, that the judge would use questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>based in part on proposed questions submitted by all counsel, and that the testimony would be recorded and later played back to the parties. The mother now argues that the judge erred in permitting Kimberly to testify in chambers outside her and her counsel\u2019s presence.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">a. Contrary to the mother\u2019s argument on appeal, the record indicates that the method of obtaining Kimberly\u2019s testimony was accomplished \u201cby agreement\u201d of all the parties.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The judge discussed the issue with the parties several times at both the preliminary hearing and at trial. The record indicates that the mother\u2019s counsel not only agreed to the hearing, but participated in fashioning the procedure.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Further, it is apparent that the judge did not force the mother\u2019s counsel to acquiesce to this procedure. The testimony was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">b. The mother next contends that Kimberly\u2019s testimony in chambers deprived the mother of both her rights of confrontation and due process of law under art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. However, she acknowledges that the right of confrontation in art. 12 is \u201cnot necessarily involved in a termination of parental rights case.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGruder, </em>348 Mass. 712 (1965). Citing <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Cedar Junction, </em>396 Mass. 830 (1986), she then states that \u201c[c]oncepts of due process of law expressed in [art. 12], however, are applicable to certain civil proceedings\u201d and \u201c[g]iven the significant nature of the parental rights affected in c. 210 proceedings, a measure of extra protection is required.\u201d This three-sentence argument does not assist us with meaningful citation of authority and cannot be said to rise to the level of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>acceptable appellate argument under Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 418, 428 (1991). Accordingly, this argument is deemed to be waived. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>413 Mass. 598, 603 n.6 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">5. The mother next contends that the department failed to perform its duty to provide timely and appropriate services to prevent the dissolution of this family and, thus, that we should reverse the judge\u2019s decision. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 1 (1990 ed.); 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01 (1986). We disagree. While there were findings that indicated one department social worker provided \u201cmarginal\u201d services for a five-month period in 1990, the judge also found that those deficiencies were subsequently rectified by a department case manager who reestablished counseling for the mother and visitation with the children.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In addition, the findings indicate that the department properly did not return the children to the mother after the care and protection proceeding because she continued her relationship with the man who sexually abused her children. Thus, we hold that the department\u2019s treatment of the family was not \u201cso arbitrary and irrational as to warrant a dismissal.\u201d <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>376 Mass. 252, 269 (1978).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>6. The mother\u2019s final contention concerns the admission of a report in the G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, proceedings that had been previously prepared by an investigator for the care and protection proceedings.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The judge based only three out of his many findings on the report.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Furthermore, the three findings were not so inconsistent with the judge\u2019s other findings as to raise any question concerning his ultimate conclusion. Thus, any error could not prejudice the mother and would not provide a basis for reversal. See <em>Adoption of Frederick, </em>405 Mass. 1, 6-7 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">In sum, we hold that (1) the judge\u2019s findings regarding the mother\u2019s parental unfitness and the best interests of the chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>dren were supported by clear and convincing evidence, (2) the department\u2019s supervision of the case does not require reversal of the judge\u2019s decision, and (3) the judge\u2019s evidentiary rulings were not reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments allowing the department\u2019s petitions to dispense with the mother\u2019s consent to the adoption of Kimberly and Joyce.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b543-14\">At the time of this proceeding in December, 1991, Kimberly was seven years old and Joyce was six years old.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b543-15\">At the time of the proceeding Lucy was two years old.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Kimberly\u2019s paternal grandmother and the children\u2019s pediatrician filed reports pursuant to G.

The department substantiated the reports and filed the care and protection petitions in November, 1988.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b544-10\">See note 10, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The judge found that, prior to their removal from the mother, the mother neglected the children\u2019s medical and nutritional needs, had a history of illicit drug use involving marihuana and cocaine, and on a number of occasions did not take antiseizure medication resulting in hospitalization. The judge also found that during this time the children were exposed to inappropriate partying, violence, drugs, alcohol, pornographic movies, and were sexually abused by Bob, the father of Joyce and Lucy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The judge found that the mother had consistently attended department therapy since it was set up in October, 1990, that she was currently addressing the issue of the children\u2019s sexual abuse with her therapist, and that \u201c[t]here is a very good relationship between the mother and her daughters.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b546-6\">A parent may be fit to raise one child and unfit to raise another. <em>Petition of Catholic Charitable Bureau of the Archdiocese of Boston, Inc., to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>395 Mass. 180, 185 n.6 (1985). <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>383 Mass. 573, 589 (1981). <em>Adoption of George, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 265, 269 (1989). Thus, the mother\u2019s argument that, because she is currently capable of caring for Lucy she is also fit to parent Joyce and Kimberly, is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The judge also stated, \u201cWhile it is appropriate under the circumstances of this case for mother and children to maintain a relationship, the mother\u2019s history and lack of current fitness predict that she would fail to protect them from [Bob] in the future. Having the mother as their caretaker under these factual circumstances presents an unacceptable risk to these two young girls.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Specifically, the judge stated that the proposed plans \u201ccall for the children to be adopted by . . . the paternal grandparents of [Kimberly] with whom the children have lived for the past three years. Each of these plans is in the best interests of the children and should be implemented. . . . [T]he minor children should have an on-going relationship with their mother. However, their best interests dictate that such visitation must be out of [Bob\u2019s] presence and that they not be exposed to any items of personal property belonging to him or which would tend to remind them of him. The visits cannot be at the mother\u2019s residence. As to the frequency and scheduling of the visits, that is to be left in the sound discretion of the legal caretakers of the children.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\">In <em>Adoption of Carlos, </em>413 Mass. 339, 351 (1992), the court held that the trial judge\u2019s denial of a department petition to dispense with parental consent to adoption was not clearly erroneous where the mother had made \u201c \u2018significant progress\u2019 with respect to her critical area of parental unfitness, namely her denial that her child had been sexually abused.\u201d The court focused on the fact that the findings of the mother\u2019s progress were largely unchallenged, that the child was suffering from \u201cinternal conflict\u201d due to the separation from his mother, and that the department had not proposed a fully developed adoption plan. The instant cases are different. Here, the judge found that \u201cthe mother was very slow to acknowledge and deal with the impact of the sexual abuse,\u201d and that even after admitting the abuse, she continued her relationship with the abuser. In addition, the department presented fully-developed adoption plans here to place the children with the grandparents, where the behaviors associated with their abuse have lessened.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The judge made many findings.

The content is very specific. The circumstances are with her grandmother during bathtime, which is a comfortable and intimate time in that household. This is a further indicator of the reliability for the statements. While the child is too young perhaps to appreciate specifically the consequences of this statement, I do find based on all the circumstances that she was sincere when she made the statements.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b549-12\"> The judge: \u201cLet me ask [counsel for the mother] what is your position relative to [Kimberly] to there being an unorthodox method of receiving her testimony not in your client\u2019s presence?

I guess my point is that, if I were to ask your Honor, would you cover these two or three areas or something of that nature, I\u2019d probably feel comfortable with that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Auy\">The judge: \u201cWell, certainly, if I were to do it in that manner, I would have no difficulty in receiving proposed questions beforehand, but not having all counsel present to say to me, \u2018Please ask her,\u2019 in her presence, and that does defeat the purpose of \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Counsel for the mother: \u201cNo, I \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">The judge: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you think on that[?]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">Counsel for the mother: \u201cThis is, of course, I\u2019m assuming the Court finds unavailability, etc., because my first preference is that, you know, they could testify. And I \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">The judge: \u201cThat\u2019s my last preference in any case in this court with a child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">Counsel for the mother: \u201cI understand, your Honor. Obviously I\u2019m coming from a different perspective. My understanding, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I thought the children had expressed a desire to come, that they wanted to.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b550-13\"> The judge: \u201cIn terms of this witness\u2019s testimony in the preliminary hearing, and the offering of the statements, is everyone considering that those are in for direct purposes?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-14\">Counsel for the mother: \u201cThank you. I meant to bring that up. I was going to ask the Court whether they are in or not. I was assuming that they were, but \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-15\">Counsel for the department: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-16\">The judge: \u201cIs that all right with other counsel?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-17\">Counsel for the mother: \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-18\">The judge: \u201cThose are considered to be in, and you have the right to cross examine?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-19\">Counsel for the mother: \u201cI did cross examine, so I think so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aeo\">The judge: \u201cWell, I mean, you certainly have a right \u2014 I didn\u2019t take that to be the direct testimony, so I\u2019m not \u2014 if you\u2019re saying it\u2019s okay that that\u2019s in as direct testimony, I still say that you may cross examine her further on those if you wish to, because I was not taking that as in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-20\">Counsel for the mother: \u201cYes. I don\u2019t see the purpose of having her repeat it, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-21\">Counsel for the department: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t \u2014 they\u2019re part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>the evidence but not part of her direct testimony, those went in under a separate hearing.

But yeah, they\u2019re part of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">The judge: \u201cWell, conceptionally, I was thinking of them in terms of having been dealt with separately, and I made a ruling that they could come in, and now you have a trial, it\u2019s a separate hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">Counsel for the department: \u201cYes, Well, are we agreed that they have come in?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">The judge: \u201cYes, he just agreed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">Counsel for the mother: \u201cYes.

She abandoned the children for eight months. On her return, the department engaged her in counseling. Later, the department recommended that she change counsellors to a person who specialized in children\u2019s sexual abuse. The mother, however, refused to follow the recommendation even after her own therapist left the counseling center. Later, the department asked the mother to participate in a study to observe her interaction with the children, but she never responded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\">See also <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub.
