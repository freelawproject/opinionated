The judge determined<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the defendants, prior owners of the property, were liable for clean-up costs under the Massachusetts Oil and Hazardous Material Release Prevention Act (Act), G. L. c. 21E (1990 ed.), but the judge concluded that the complaint was not timely filed under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A. The judge also ruled that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action accrued at the time G. L. c. 21E was enacted. We transferred the plaintiff\u2019s appeal to this court on our own motion. The plaintiff argues that the judge erred in concluding that the statute had a three-year period of limitations. He also challenges the judge\u2019s determination of the date the claim accrued. For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judge\u2019s ruling that the three-year statute of limitations is applicable, but we reverse and remand for a determination of the date or dates that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">We summarize the judge\u2019s findings of fact. The plaintiff is the owner of a piece of property in Westport. The defendants Thomas and Cora Pereira owned the property from 1952 to 1981. Thomas Pereira owned and operated a filling station, used automobile lot, and automobile repair shop on the property until 1971. In 1971, the other defendant, Paul Pereira, leased the service station from his father, operating it until he purchased it in 1981. In 1981, the plaintiff operated the service station. Then Paul Pereira sold it to him on December 31, 1982. The plaintiff continues to use the property as a service station, used automobile business, and automobile repair shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Initially, the property contained two underground storage tanks, each with a 2,000-gallon capacity. Shell Oil Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>(Shell) owned these storage tanks. At some time in the early 1960\u2019s, Shell added one 4,000-gallon underground storage tank and piped the two smaller ones together. Around 1965, two 4,000-gallon tanks replaced the two smaller tanks.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In 1965 or 1966, after the underground tanks had been replaced, Thomas Pereira noticed an odor of gasoline in the water of the service station. A well that was approximately thirty-nine feet deep supplied the water. Thomas Pereira informed his Shell sales representative. Shell arranged to have the well pumped out, but the odor of gasoline persisted. Then, in 1972, while Paul Pereira operated the service station, Shell sandblasted and \u201cfiberglassed\u201d the underground storage tank. Subsequently, in the presence of his Shell representative, Paul Pereira was able to ignite water piped into the service station restroom. Shell transferred ownership of the underground storage tanks to Paul Pereira in 1979.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The odor of gasoline still persisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The judge found that gasoline had leaked out of the underground storage tank and contaminated \u201cthe site, a well and the ground water.\u201d He found that the contamination occurred while Thomas Pereira and Cora Pereira owned and operated the property and that it continued while they owned and Paul Pereira operated the service station. The judge also found that the plaintiff did not contribute to or cause the contamination of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">In 1987, the plaintiff wished to refinance. He approached a lender who required that he get a G. L. c. 21E inspection certificate. Therefore, the plaintiff engaged Clean Harbors, Inc. (Clean Harbors), to assess the property. Clean Harbors performed an assessment and determined that the presence of gasoline in the soil and well water contaminated the site. The plaintiff provided this information to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), as the Act requires. G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 7 (1990 ed.). The DEP has placed the property on its list of confirmed contaminated sites, and has determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>that the property is a priority site. Wells have been dug to monitor the cleanup.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The judge found that the following were the expenses of the cleanup:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Phase I - Limited Site Assessment: $ 26,000</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Phase II - Comprehensive Site Assessment 340,000</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Phase III - Development of Remedial Response Plan and</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">Phase IV - Implementation of Remedial</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">Response Plan 400,000</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">$766,000</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">In addition, he found that the plaintiff had expended $18,000 on preliminary assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">Finally, the judge determined whether the defendants were responsible parties under the Act. He found that Thomas Pereira was a responsible person because he owned the property and operated the property as a service station at the time the contamination occurred. Although aware of the condition, Thomas Pereira did not \u201cassess, contain, or clean up the contamination\u201d nor did he notify the DEP of the problem. The judge found Cora Pereira, as joint owner of the land with her husband, to be jointly and severally liable for the costs of assessment, containment, and removal of contamination at the site. The judge then found that Paul Pereira had operated the service station from 1971 to 1981 and that he was aware at all times that gasoline leakage had contaminated the site. The judge determined that Paul Pereira did not assess, contain or clean up the site and also did not notify the DEP of the contamination. He too was a responsible person under the Act. As responsible persons under the Act, the defendants were liable for the \u201ccosts of assessment, containment and removal\" of contamination at the site. Because they failed to notify the DEP, they were not able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>avail themselves of the defense provided by G. L. c. 2IE, \u00a7 5 (c) (3) (1990 ed.), to limit liability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Finding that the contamination damaged the plaintiffs property, the judge ruled that the plaintiff had a private cause of action, having undertaken assessment action regarding the release of oil. The judge ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement. The judge also found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for clean-up costs not yet incurred, but that in order to recover he would have had to include a complaint for declaratory relief. The judge declared that the defendants were jointly and severally liable for containment and removal costs the plaintiff incurred, once they were incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Continuing his findings, the judge discussed the appropriate statute of limitations. The judge ruled that the three-year statute of limitations under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A (1990 ed.), controlled.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He then applied the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d and ruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>that the plaintiff had knowledge that the site was contaminated when he leased it in June, 1981, and at least when he purchased it in December, 1982. The judge noted, however, that the Legislature did not enact the provisions of G. L. c. 21E, until March 24, 1983. He ruled therefore that the statute of limitations began to run on that date. Because the action was commenced on July 25, 1988, the judge found that it was barred by the statute of limitations. On that basis, he ruled in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">1. <em>The statute of limitations under the Act. </em>A. <em>The proper length of the limitations period. </em>The judge analyzed the plaintiff\u2019s claim under \u00a7 4 of the Act as a tort, applying the statute of limitations found in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A. The plaintiff insists that this was error, asserting that his action is not in the nature of a tort, but is, according to the language of the Act, an action for reimbursement. The plaintiff claims that his action should be allowed to proceed under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2 (1990 ed.), which states that \u201c[ajctions of contract, other than those to recover for personal injuries, founded upon contracts or liabilities, express or implied . . . shall, except as otherwise provided, be commenced only within six years next after the cause of action accrues.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the alternative, the plaintiff suggests that the action for reimbursement is equitable. If so, to succeed on a time-bar defense, the defendants would have had to plead loches and show that they had experienced some prejudice because the plaintiff unreasonably delayed in bringing his action. <em>Jubinville </em>v. Jubinville, 313 Mass. 103, 105 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Prior to 1992, the Act contained no statute of limitations for actions .brought under \u00a7 4. See G. L. c. 2IE, \u00a7\u00a7 1-18.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See also Rosenblatt, Settlement Procedures and Strategy in Chapter 21E Private Party Cases, Environmental Litigation \u201991 21, 27-28 (Mass. Continuing Legal Educ. 1991). Section 4 of the Act, as it read at the time of trial, provided that \u201c[a]ny person who undertakes assessment, containment or removal action regarding the release or threat of release of oil or hazardous material shall be entitled to <em>reimbursement </em>from any other person liable for such release or threat of release for the reasonable costs of such assessment, containment and removal. If such release resulted from the <em>negligence of two or more persons, </em>each shall be liable to the others for his <em>pro rata share </em>of the costs of assessment, containment and removal\u201d (emphasis added). The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, interpreting this language, stated that an action under this section was not in the nature of tort, but rather was an action for statutory indemnification. <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Mobil Oil Corp., </em>736 F. Supp. 387, 396 (D. Mass. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u201cUnder Massachusetts law, the determination of whether the contract or tort statute of limitations applies is controlled by the essential nature of a party\u2019s claim. See <em>Hendrickson </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>365 Mass. 83, 85 (1974); <em>Kagan </em>v. <em>Levenson, </em>334 Mass. 100, 103 (1956). See also <em>Desmond </em>v. <em>Moffie, </em>375 F.2d 742, 743-744 (1st Cir. 1967).\u201d <em>Royal-Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Craven, </em>411 Mass. 629, 636 (1992). The flaw in the plaintiffs claim is in reading \u00a7 4 alone. Determining liability for contamination is not the focus of \u00a7 4 of the Act. The language of the section presupposes liability when it states that one who \u201cundertakes assessment . . . shall be entitled to reimbursement from any other person <em>liable </em>for such release\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4. Section 4 simply allows for reimbursement<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of expenditures made. <em>Id. </em>The statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>read as a whole, suggests that the essential nature of claims under G. L. c. 21E sounds in tort. For example, \u00a7 5 <em>(a) </em>talks of <em>joint and several liability </em>in some instances, and \u00a7 5 (c) (3) provides an exception to liability where a \u201cperson establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that he exercised <em>due care </em>with respect to the oil or hazardous material, that he took precautions against <em>forjejseeable acts or omissions </em>of any third party and the consequences that could <em>for[e]seeably result from such acts or </em>omissions.\u201d In addition, \u00a7 7 requires a party to notify DEP when \u201che has <em>knowledge </em>of a release or a threat of release of oil or hazardous material.\u201d We conclude that the statute, read as a whole, sounds more in tort than in contract. See <em>Pentucket Manor Chronic Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>394 Mass. 233, 240 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>389 Mass. 265, 273 (1983) (\u201cbasic principle of statutory construction [is] that a statute must be read as a whole\u201d); <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Holbrook, </em>1 Pick. 248, 250 (1822). There is no error in the judge\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">B. <em>The proper date of accrual. </em>The judge found that the plaintiff knew the property was contaminated when he leased it or at least when he purchased it in December, 1982. Because the Legislature had not then passed the Act, the judge found that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action accrued on March 24, 1983, the date the Act became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">An action under \u00a7 4 of G. L. c. 2IE, is an action for reimbursement. The plaintiff brought this case in order to be reimbursed for the \u201creasonable costs of such assessment, containment and removal.\u201d G. L. c. 2IE, \u00a7 4. We have defined \u201creimbursement\u201d as \u201crepaying or making good the amount paid out.\u201d <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>322 Mass. 177, 179 (1947). Thus, to be reimbursed, the plaintiff must have paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the sum due.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The proper date or dates of accrual of the actions for reimbursement of assessment costs is the date or dates the assessment costs were paid.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accord <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Mobil Oil Corp., supra </em>at 397 (judge found that the \u201climitations period on plaintiffs [c.] 21E cause of action did not begin to run when plaintiff first learned of the soil contamination . . . but when plaintiffs liability for the cleanup of the site was finally fixed\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The judge made no findings, however, as to the date or dates the clean-up costs were paid. We therefore remand for a determination of the date or dates the plaintiff made payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">2. <em>The availability of attorneys\u2019 fees under the Act. </em>The plaintiff argues that the judge erred in refusing to award attorneys\u2019 fees and expert opinion fees under G. L. c. 2IE, \u00a7 15. Because the judge did not have the benefit of our opinion in <em>Sanitoy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ilco Unican Corp., </em>413 Mass. 627, 631 (1992), we also remand this issue for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">In sum, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for determination of the date or dates on which the plaintiff paid reimbursement for the clean-up costs to determine whether the claims are barred by the three-year statute of limitations and for reconsideration of his claim for attorneys\u2019 fees and expert witness fees if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>plaintiff is entitled to reimbursement of the assessment costs. The statute of limitations to be applied is three years.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The plaintiff moved for leave to file an amended complaint, seeking declaratory relief. The judge granted the motion and the plaintiff filed an amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Beginning in 1987, Precision Testing Company has tested the tanks and lines each year and they have been sound.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b86-7\">General Laws c. 21E, \u00a7 5 (c) (3), states that, \u201c[sjubject to the limitation provided in paragraph <em>(d) </em>there shall be no liability under paragraph <em>(a) </em>for a person otherwise liable who can establish by a preponderance of the evidence, (A) that the release or threat of release of oil or hazardous material and the damages resulting therefrom were caused by: . . .

He found that Shell, which \u201cowned and maintained the underground storage tanks along with the defendants caused the contamination by the release of oil.\u201d The judge also found that the defendants had failed to \u201ctake precautions against foreseeable acts or omissions of any third party and the consequences that could foreseeably result from such acts or omissions.\u201d In addition, the judge found that, in order to use the defense of this section, the defendants would have had to comply with the notification procedures. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b86-8\">General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 2A, states that, \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided, actions of tort, actions of contract to recover for personal injuries, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>and actions of replevin, shall be commenced only within three years next after the cause of action accrues.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The plaintiff argues that he should receive the benefit of a six-year statute of limitations under G.

Thus, we reject the plaintiffs suggestion that a contract statute of limitations should apply. At least one commentator has noted, however, that cost recovery actions under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Federal analogue to the Act, are quasi-contractual. 3 R.
