L. c. 127, \u00a7 22 (1990 ed.). A judge in the Superior Court ordered summary judgment for all the defendants in their individual capacities and as public employees. The plaintiff appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own initiative. We now reverse the judgment and remand this case to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s complaint states in relevant part the following: The plaintiff was a pretrial detainee in the defendants\u2019 custody at the Berkshire County house of correction. He was housed with convicted criminals in violation of law and despite his repeated assertions that he was entitled to be housed only with other pretrial detainees. The defendants knew that \u201chousing pre-trial detainees with sentenced prisoners in the sentenced prisoner portions of Berkshire House of Corrections, had previously caused several injuries to pre-trial detainees.\u201d On an occasion when the plaintiff was working in the section housing convicted criminals, \u201che was <em>seriously </em>injured when a heavy footlocker was thrown at him off a tier by a sentenced prisoner striking him in the upper right shoulder\u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">As further alleged in the complaint, the plaintiff is black and, at the time of his injury, all the sentenced prisoners at the Berkshire County house of correction where the plaintiff was assigned to work were white, as are the defendants. \u201cUpon information and belief,\u201d the complaint continues, the defendants \u201cwho coerced and ordered plaintiff to (a) be housed in a section of the jail for sentenced prisoners, and (b) ordered plaintiff to work in an area where only sentenced (Caucasian) prisoners were at the time did so intentionally due to their racial prejudice knowing plaintiff was going to be seriously injured . . . Defendant Carmen C. Massimiano\u2019s actions in allowing pre-trial detainees to be housed and to work in areas where sentenced (dangerous) prisoners are housed, was intentional ... All other John Doe defendants acts and omissions were intentional and knowingly done . . . Defendant County Commissioners failure to provide ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>quote protection and housing for pre-trial detainees, separate from sentenced prisoners, in individual cases such as plaintiffs, was grossly negligent or intentional (due to Commissioners intentionally diverting those necessary funds and resources elsewhere).\u201d The complaint\u2019s allegations were followed by prayers for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The defendants filed an answer to the complaint, denying some allegations and neither admitting nor denying many others, and asserting numerous affirmative defenses. The defendant Massimiano filed interrogatories to the plaintiff which were never answered. Then, approximately fourteen months after the complaint and answer were filed, and without any further pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, or admissions having been filed, the defendants moved for summary judgment under Mass. R. Civ. P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974). The defendants\u2019 motion was supported by one affidavit and by a memorandum of law that was directed to the proposition, as summarized in the memorandum\u2019s \u201cconclusion,\u201d that \u201c[t]he [pjlaintiff has failed to present a claim upon which relief can be granted against the named [djefendants.\u201d The affidavit in support of the defendants\u2019 motion was that of Peter Menard, a county commissioner, and it addressed only the allegation, at least implied, in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, that the defendant commissioners had improperly diverted funds that had been appropriated for the use of the house of correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">According to the docket entries, on the day the defendants\u2019 motion was filed, the plaintiff filed a \u201ccross-motion\u201d for summary judgment together with a memorandum of law and his person\u00e1l affidavit to which numerous exhibits were attached. One week later, without stating his reasons, a judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion, entered summary judgment for the defendants, and denied the plaintiff\u2019s cross motion. In keeping with the notice of appeal filed by the plaintiff, the present appeal is solely \u201cfrom the Court\u2019s allowance of Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s cross motion is not in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>In support of their contention that they are entitled to summary judgment, the defendants\u2019 appellate brief sets forth numerous arguments which we briefly outline in this and the next three paragraphs. \u201cIn order to state a cognizable claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,\u201d the defendants argue, \u201ca plaintiff must allege or present specific facts which show the defendants, while acting under color of state law, deprived him of rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States,\u201d and \u201cthere is no factual basis\u201d in this case for such a claim. In furtherance of this argument, the defendants say that \u201cthe [p] laintiff is essentially alleging that the [defendants had a duty or obligation to protect him from potential harm by other inmates,\u201d but \u201cthere is no evidence\u201d to support the plaintiff\u2019s allegation. The defendants then argue that, \u201c[ajssuming the defendants had a duty to protect there is no evidence that the defendants were intentionally, wilfully or deliberately indifferent to the personal security of the plaintiff,\u201d and therefore the plaintiff cannot recover damages under \u00a7 1983. In addition, the defendants say that \u201cthe record is totally devoid of any evidence of bad faith or improper motive on the part of the [defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In two other sections of their brief, the defendants assert that (1) \u201cassuming the plaintiff is alleging State civil rights claims pursuant to G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and I, the complaint fails to state a cognizable claim and was properly dismissed as a matter of law,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s complaint fails to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for failure to provide medical treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">On the question whether the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity from suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1988) and G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 111 (1990 ed.), the defendants\u2019 brief argues that the defendants are entitled to immunity because \u201c[t]he [p] laintiff has failed to introduce evidence to establish that: 1) the [defendants violated the [p] laintiff s rights; 2) the right he seeks to vindicate was clearly established such that the [defendants knew or should have known of it at the time of the alleged wrong; and 3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>that the [defendants were acting in an objective bad faith manner at the time of the alleged wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Lastly, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs claims against the so-called \u201cJohn Doe\u201d defendants were \u201cproperly dismissed\u201d because \u201cthe use of a fictitious name for a defendant will not be permitted if ignorance of the defendant\u2019s identity is the result of . . . lack of reasonable inquiry.\u2019,\u2019 The defendants impliedly assert that the plaintiff failed to produce evidence to show that his use of fictitious names was reasonable in the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">It is apparent that the defendants\u2019 argument in support of their entitlement to summary judgment is based on their, claim that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted, and on the further assertion that, in response to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff produced \u201cno evidence\u201d demonstrating that he has a triable case. We reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"A8i\">The sufficiency of a complaint to state a viable claim may be tested by motions pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6) and 12 (c), 365 Mass. 754 (1974) \u2014 motions that were not presented in this case. However, a complaint is not properly challenged by a motion for summary judgment under rule 56. Indeed, a summary judgment motion \u201cconcedes the validity of the pleading,\u201d J.W. Smith &amp; H.B. Zobel, Rules Practice 347 (1977 &amp; 1993 Supp.), and, unlike rule 12 motions, focuses on the merits of the controversy. Therefore, the defendants were not entitled to summary judgment on the ground that the complaint was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Also, for the reasons we state below, the defendants were not entitled to summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to produce evidence of deliberate indifference or bad faith or other facts. The plaintiff had no burden to do so. Since the defendants were the moving parties, they had the burden under rule 56 (c) \u201cto show by credible evidence from [their] affidavits and other supporting materials that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that [they are] entitled, as matter of law, to a judgment. See 6 J. Moore, Federal Practice par. 56.15[3] (2d ed. 1975). Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>56 (e) provides that once a motion is made and supported by affidavits and other supplementary material, the opposing party may not simply rest on his pleadings or general denials; he must \u2018set forth <em>specific facts' </em>(emphasis added [by the court]) showing that there is a genuine, triable issue. Rule 56(e). The inference to be drawn from the burden placed on the moving party is that his failure to establish the absence of a genuine issue of material fact must, without more from his opponent, defeat his motion.\u201d <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 554 (1976). In the same vein, we held in <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991), that \u201ca party moving for summary judgment in a case [such as this one] in which the opposing party will have the burden of proof at trial is entitled to summary judgment <em>if he demonstrates by reference to material described in Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), </em>unmet by countervailing materials, that the party opposing the motion has no reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of that party\u2019s case. -To be successful, a moving party need not submit affirmative evidence to negate one or more elements of the other party\u2019s claim\u201d (emphasis added). The fact that a moving party need not submit affirmative evidence to negate one or more elements of the other party\u2019s claim does not excuse the moving party from demonstrating by reference to rule 56 (c) materials, that the party who will have the burden of proof at trial has no reasonable expectation of carrying it. In <em>Kourouvacilis, </em>the moving party made such a demonstration by presenting materials that showed that the evidence the plaintiff relied on to prove her case at trial would be unavailable. <em>Id. </em>See also <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Nobile, </em>411 Mass. 382, 389 (1991); <em>Flesner </em>v. <em>Technical Communications Corp., </em>410 Mass. 805, 809 (1991). Here, the defendants filed a single affidavit and no other rule 56 materials to demonstrate that there would be no genuine issue of material fact at trial and that they would be entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The affidavit, which addressed only the question of diversion of funds, did not demonstrate that the plaintiff would be unable to prove his case at trial, and therefore the plaintiff, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>order to avoid summary judgment, was not obligated to present countervailing proof at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">We conclude that the summary judgment for the defendants must be reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
