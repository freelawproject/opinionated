L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34 (1990 ed.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, ruling that the use of the newborn\u2019s urinalysis to prosecute his mother for possession of narcotics, not child abuse, is beyond the scope and defeats the purpose of the statute used to obtain the evidence. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 51A, 51B (1990 ed.).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We reject the defendant\u2019s claim that she has a privacy right in her child\u2019s hospital record. We agree with the Commonwealth that the pretrial dismissal of the indictment was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The judge found the following facts in her memorandum of decision and order granting the motion to dismiss the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>dictment for possession of cocaine. On July 2, 1989, the defendant gave birth. The medical staff at Brockton Hospital tested a sample of the infant\u2019s urine, revealing the presence of cocaine metabolites which are the product of cocaine after it has been broken down by the liver in preparation for excretion from the body. The Commonwealth alleges that the presence of such metabolites indicates that the mother must have ingested cocaine and passed it in \u00fatero to the fetus shortly before birth.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">On August 15, 1989, the child was taken to the Brockton Hospital after a report that he had sustained injuries on his toes believed to be burn marks. Pediatric physicians at Brockton Hospital concluded that the burns had been inflicted by a cigarette or similar object. En route to the hospital, the defendant stated to the police that she had been using drugs during her pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">1. <em>Pretrial dismissal. </em>On appeal, the Commonwealth argues that the judge violated art. 30 in dismissing the indictment for possession. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>The defendant contends that the judge correctly dismissed the case thereby protecting the defendant\u2019s fundamental State and Federal constitutional rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Article 30 creates a separation of powers among the branches of government essentially granting the prosecutor exclusive power to decide whether to prosecute a case. <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the N. Dist., </em>381 Mass. 717, 721 (1980). Pretrial dismissal, over the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, of a valid complaint or indictment before a verdict, finding, or plea, and without an evidentiary hearing basically quashes or enters a nolle prosequi of the complaint or indictment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>410 Mass. 498, 503 (1991) (when a lawful complaint is dismissed prior to trial it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>\u201cprematurely cuts off the prosecution without a legal basis\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brandano, </em>359 Mass. 332, 334-335 (1971); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bressant, </em>126 Mass. 246, 247 (1879). A decision to nolie pros a criminal case rests with the executive branch of government and, absent a legal basis, cannot be entered over the Commonwealth\u2019s objection. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra </em>at 500. See <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>409 Mass. 398, 401 (1991) (prosecutors have broad discretion in determining whether to prosecute a case); <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Roxbury Dist., </em>372 Mass. 315, 318 (1977) (discretion lies with the prosecutor whether to prosecute a case and when to discontinue prosecution without appeal or approval of another oEcial); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dascalakis, </em>246 Mass. 12, 18 (1923) (power to enter a nolle prosequi rests with the prosecuting oEcer from indictment until the start of trial unless clear abuse of authority); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>149 Mass. 7, 8 (1889) (only the prosecutor has authority to refuse to prosecute a case on behalf of the Commonwealth); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuck, </em>20 Pick. 356, 366 (1838) (power to enter a nolle prosequi is with the prosecutor without the court\u2019s interference); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wheeler, 2 </em>Mass. 172, 173 (1806) (power and responsibility of entering a nolle prosequi is for the prosecutor alone). In some instances a judge may properly dismiss an indictment over the objection of the prosecutor. See <em>Angiulo </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>401 Mass. 71, 79 (1987) (double jeopardy principles bar the Commonwealth\u2019s prosecution); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>392 Mass. 445, 447 (1984) (improper presentation of evidence to the grand jury requires dismissal of indictment); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160, 163 (1982) (insuEcient evidence presented to the grand jury to justify arrest of defendant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salman, </em>387 Mass. 160, 166 (1982) (when it appears that grand jury integrity is impaired, defendant is entitled to evidentiary hearing to resolve the issue). This case does not fall within any of these exceptions, but rather is governed by the general rule that an indictment valid on its face should not be dismissed absent a showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>that the defendant\u2019s ability to obtain a fair trial is prejudiced. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freiberg, </em>405 Mass. 282, 300-301 (1989). Furthermore, pretrial dismissal cannot be sustained if, as here, the Commonwealth fails or refuses to stipulate that it has presented all the proof available for a contemplated trial. <em>Id. </em>See also <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>372 Mass. 59, 63 (1977) (claim of insufficient evidence to be presented at trial cannot justify dismissal absent affidavit or stipulation of facts by Commonwealth).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The defendant also argues that she had no notice that her newborn\u2019s urine could be used as evidence in a prosecution against her, and, therefore, her due process rights were violated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34, possession of a controlled substance may be constructive and shown by circumstantial evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>407 Mass. 647, 651 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dinnall, </em>366 Mass. 165, 168-169 (1974). The burden of proving all requisite elements of a possession charge is on the Commonwealth at trial, where it may be determined what criminal conduct is sufficiently delineated to put an average person on notice of what is prohibited.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Once on trial, the defendant may utilize all procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>and evidentiary safeguards available to ensure a fair trial and protection of her constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">2. <em>Admissibility of hospital records. </em>The judge dismissed the indictment because of her view that the defendant possessed an overriding privacy interest in her child\u2019s medical records and further that use of the medical records would contravene the purpose of both the child abuse and drug possession statutes in violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights. The confidentiality and right to privacy of medical records and treatment is addressed under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79 (1990 ed.).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This statute permits the court, in its discretion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>to allow in evidence hospital records to prove the truth of the facts in the record as they relate to the medical history and treatment. See <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Dong, </em>412 Mass. 682, 684 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>385 Mass. 639 (1982). We have permitted the admission of statements and tests contained in hospital records which bear on criminal culpability if they relate only incidentally to the issue of liability. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gogan, </em>389 Mass. 255, 263 (1983) (hospital record admissible which contained notations that defendant was violent and intoxicated on admission to the hospital in case charging assault and battery on police officer); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>359 Mass. 577, 579-580 (1971) (test result revealing presence of sperm in victim admissible by prosecution in rape case); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russo, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 923 (1991) (blood alcohol level admissible as part of hospital record because presumption of reliability attaches to records relied upon when treating patients); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 698, 699-700 (1986) (hospital record containing blood test result admissible because it was ordered for medical reasons); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McNickles, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 114, 123 (1986) (hospital records admitted which contained diagnosis of rape, and test results showing presence of semen). The judge has discretion in determining whether disclosure is appropriate, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>385 Mass. 639, 642 (1982), and if admitted, the evidence may be \u201ccontradicted, qualified, believed or disbelieved.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, supra </em>at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s privacy and due process arguments assume that the defendant has the same privacy right in her child\u2019s medical record as she does in her own. This assumption is not correct. To permit parents to exclude medical or hospital records of their child on a privacy claim could be adverse to the child\u2019s best interests. See <em>Adoption of Diane, </em>400 Mass. 196, 202 (1987) (privilege belongs to patient who has the burden of asserting the privilege; in care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>and protection proceeding it would be anomalous to permit the parent to assert privilege); <em>Petitions of the Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>399 Mass. 279, 286-287 (1987) (parent\u2019s hospital records are admissible under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79, in a parental termination proceeding). \u201c[R]elevant evidence given by medical personnel concerning the treatment of a patient is admissible\u201d and does not raise an issue of privacy. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dube, </em>413 Mass. 570, 571 (1992) (Commonwealth can introduce at trial hospital record revealing elevated alcohol level found on routine blood test performed at the direction of physician).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Furthermore, the Legislature has recognized that prenatal exposure to a controlled substance is probative of neglect by the mother. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A (presence of drug addiction in newborn constitutes abuse). Other jurisdictions also find evidence of neglect based on prenatal exposure to drugs. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7 626.556(2)(c) (1989) (neglect includes prenatal exposure to a controlled substance used by mother for nonmedical purpose and detected by toxicology on child or mother after delivery); Fla. Stat. ch. 415.503(9)(a)(2) (1991) (drug dependency of newborn ground for suspicion of child abuse and neglect); Ind. Code \u00a7 31-6-4-3.1 (1989) (neglect includes newborn whose blood or urine contains any amount of a controlled substance). Additionally, some States have imposed civil liability on mothers for drug impairment of their newborn children. See <em>In re Stefanel Tyesha C., </em>157 A.D.2d 322 (N.Y. 1990) (mother\u2019s admitted drug use and child\u2019s positive toxicology for cocaine at birth sufficient for cause of action for neglect); <em>In re Troy D., </em>215 Cal. App. 3d 889, 895, 900-901 (1989) (mother charged with neglect when newborn tested positive for cocaine had no right to prevent disclosure of child\u2019s medical records); <em>In re Ruiz, </em>27 Ohio Misc. 2d 31, 35 (1986) (mother\u2019s use of heroin constituted abuse of viable fetus under child abuse statute); <em>Matter of Baby X, </em>97 Mich. App. 111, 115-118 (1980) (best interests of child permit examination of all prenatal conduct that has impact on the child, including hospital records).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Accordingly, the order dismissing the indictment for possession of a class B substance, cocaine, is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-6\"> Article 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights provides: \u201cIn the government of this commonwealth, the legislative department shall never exercise the executive and judicial powers, or either of them: the executive shall never exercise the legislative and judicial powers, or either of them: the judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers, or either of them: to the end it may be a government of laws and not of men.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b419-7\">On September 26, 1989, the Plymouth County grand jury returned an indictment charging the defendant with the unlawful distribution of a Class B substance, cocaine, to a person under the age of eighteen in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32F (1990 ed.). The defendant filed a motion to dismiss which was allowed by the court on October 15, 1990. The Commonwealth does not appeal the dismissal of this indictment. The Commonwealth elected to pursue the possession of cocaine charge, which is a lesser included offense of the indictment. -See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>391 Mass. 808, 813-814 (1984) (indictment charging a violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32-32G, the manufacturing, distribution, or dispensing of narcotics without a prescription, includes the offense of unauthorized possession of a controlled substance under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b419-8\">General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 51A (1990 ed.), requires hospital personnel to notify the Department of Social Services (department) immediately if there is reasonable belief that a child has suffered physical, emotional, sexual abuse or neglect, or is physically dependent on a drug at birth, in contemplation of prosecution for child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 51B (1990 ed.), requires that medical reports of drug addicted newborns be turned over to the department in contemplation of prosecution for child abuse. The report apprises the department of the need to evaluate the family and to institute necessary support services in an effort to stabilize and to preserve the family.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b420-8\">There is no evidence that the child suffered any injury as a result of these traces of cocaine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b420-9\">The defendant\u2019s brief does not specify which articles of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights or of the United States Constitution were violated by the indictment. Instead, the defendant refers to her privacy, due process, and equal protection rights with little case law support.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The defendant contends that she may have had notice of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A, in that suspected child abuse must be reported. However, she asserts that G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34, was not intended to be applied in this type of circumstance and to do so would constitute arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by police and prosecutors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\">We do not decide the issue whether a newborn\u2019s urinalysis revealing cocaine metabolites is enough evidence to support a conviction of the mother for possession of a controlled substance. The majority rule in other jurisdictions seems to be that, absent other evidence, the mere presence of a controlled substance in a person\u2019s own body will not constitute possession within the meaning of criminal statutes. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vorm, </em>570 N.E.2d 109, 110 (Ind. Ct. App. 1991) (unless there is additional evidence, the presence of cocaine metabolites in a urine sample does not constitute prima facia evidence of knowing and voluntary possession of cocaine); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thronsen, </em>809 P.2d 941, 943 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991) (defendant could not be convicted of cocaine in his body because he did not have control over the cocaine and therefore, could not be in possession); <em>Green </em>v. <em>State, </em>260 Ga. 625, 626 (1990) (presence of cocaine metabolites in a person\u2019s urine is indicative of cocaine ingestion within prior forty-eight hours and only circumstantial evidence or indirect evidence that the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>possessed cocaine); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>394 N.W.2d 212, 217 (Minn. Ct. App. 1986) (mere presence of a controlled substance in a person\u2019s urine is insufficient circumstantial evidence to prove prior possession by defendant); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hornaday, </em>105 Wash.2d 120, 125 (1986) (once a controlled substance is ingested into the body it is no longer under the person\u2019s dominion and control for possession purposes); <em>State </em>v. <em>Flinchpaugh, </em>232 Kan. 831, 834 (1983) (while drug in person\u2019s blood can be used as circumstantial evidence to prove prior possession, it is insufficient to establish guilt because the drug could have been injected involuntarily or by trick). But see <em>Hall </em>v. <em>State, </em>260 Ga. App. 585, 587 (1991) (conviction of possession of controlled substances based on level of drugs in defendant\u2019s blood upheld because there was additional evidence available to support possession charge including accident scene, police officer\u2019s observations, and defendant\u2019s demeanor).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Jurisdictions that have been faced with the possibility of convicting a woman of possession or distribution of a controlled substance, based on residual drug metabolites in her infant, have found the evidence to be insufficient to establish guilt. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>State, </em>833 S.W.2d 220, 223 (Tex. Ct. App. 1992) (test for drugs in bodily fluids does not satisfy the elements for the offense of possession, nor can presence of residual drugs in an infant be ground for charging mother with possession); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>State, </em>602 So.2d 1288, 1290 (Fla. 1992) (cocaine metabolites found in infant\u2019s urine after birth insufficient evidence to convict mother of distribution of a controlled substance to another person, nor within legislative intent); <em>State </em>v. <em>Luster, </em>204 Ga. App. 156, 157-159 (1992) (fetus is not considered a person under criminal statutes nor did Legislature intend to prosecute pregnant women who ingest a controlled substance, therefore, cannot find delivery from one person to another person when mother ingests a controlled substance while pregnant and infant tests positive for metabolites after birth).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 79 (1990 ed.), provides in pertinent part that \u201cRecords kept by hospitals ... under [G.
