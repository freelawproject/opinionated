D\u2019Urso shot Keizo Nonaka wounding him seriously. The plaintiff (Merrimack) commenced this action seeking a declaratory judgment that a Merrimack homeowner\u2019s insurance policy covering D\u2019Urso as an insured did not provide coverage of Nonaka\u2019s claim against D\u2019Urso. That insurance policy excluded coverage for bodily injury \u201cwhich is expected or intended by the insured.\u201d A jury in this action found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>D\u2019Urso intentionally shot Nonaka. Subsequently, a second jury awarded $900,000 to Nonaka in his action against D\u2019Urso.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Nonaka does not argue that, by its terms, the Merrimack policy covers his claim against D\u2019Urso. He argued below successfully that Merrimack must afford him coverage of that claim because of Merrimack\u2019s conduct in defending the Nonaka claim for approximately five months without giving D\u2019Urso notice of a reservation of rights or a disclaimer of coverage. Because the trial judge found that D\u2019Urso was in no way prejudiced by Merrimack\u2019s defense of the tort case, he rejected Nonaka\u2019s claim that Merrimack was estopped to deny coverage. His decision in favor of Nonaka was based on his conclusion that Merrimack\u2019s dominion over the case, before it commenced this action, \u201cduring most of the pretrial period, during which important events such as the deposition of the plaintiff [Nonaka] and the preliminary pretrial conference occurred\u201d obligated it to cover the Nonaka claim. In the judge\u2019s view, Merrimack\u2019s delay was too great, even if there was no prejudice to D\u2019Urso.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">We granted Merrimack\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We vacate the judgment and order the entry of a declaration that Merrimack is not obliged to provide coverage of Nonaka\u2019s claim against D\u2019Urso.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">We recite the significant facts found by the judge or established in the pleadings. On July 30, 1990, Nonaka sued D\u2019Urso alleging only negligent conduct. On August 24, counsel for D\u2019Urso filed an answer. In September, D\u2019Urso\u2019s counsel notified Merrimack of the claim. Early in October, counsel selected by Merrimack entered an appearance for D\u2019Urso and original counsel for D\u2019Urso withdrew his appearance. New counsel for D\u2019Urso conducted a deposition of Nonaka in October. Early that month Merrimack retained coverage counsel. On November 19, Nonaka filed an amended complaint that alleged assault and battery as well as other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>claims, including negligence, and added D\u2019Urso\u2019s son Anthony as a defendant. On January 25, 1991, the filing of a second amended complaint was allowed. That complaint alleged no intentional conduct. On February 21, the tort case was called for a preliminary pretrial conference, and an early trial date was set. On March 11, Merrimack filed this declaratory judgment action. Later that month counsel selected by the D\u2019Ursos appeared for them in Nonaka\u2019s tort action (at Merrimack\u2019s expense), and counsel selected by Merrimack withdrew his appearance. On May 23, the jury in this action found that D\u2019Urso intentionally shot Nonaka. On May 31, judgment was entered for Nonaka in his action against D\u2019Urso.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Any claim that Merrimack\u2019s conduct bars it from disclaiming coverage must rest either on estoppel or on waiver. <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Frew, </em>318 Mass. 595, 598 (1945). Estoppel is not involved here because D\u2019Urso did not rely to his detriment on anything Merrimack did or did not do. See <em>Royal-Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Craven, </em>411 Mass. 629, 635 (1992).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To succeed Nonaka must establish that Merrimack waived its right to disclaim coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">An insurance company is obliged to provide coverage to an insured who has violated a provision of the policy if the company has waived its right to assert the policy breach as a ground for denying liability. Waiver consists of the insurer\u2019s voluntary or intentional relinquishment of a known right. See <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Commercial Travelers Mut. Accident Ass\u2019n of Am., </em>283 Mass. 543 (1933); <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Cos., 26 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 508, 511 (1988). An insurer\u2019s intention to waive a ground for not providing coverage may be inferred from the circumstances. <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Globe &amp; Rutgers Fire Ins. Co., </em>227 Mass. 354, 364 (1917). See <em>Hurley </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>296 Mass. 130, 136 (1936). One class of waiver case involves a claimed breach of an insured\u2019s duty to the insurer, such as the failure promptly to notify the insurance company of a claim or the failure of an insured to cooperate with the insurance company. See, e.g., <em>DiMarzo </em>v. <em>American Mut. Ins. Co., </em>389 Mass. 85, 99 (1983); <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Regan, </em>344 Mass. 223 (1962).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Another class of waiver case involves claimed misrepresentations by the insured that led the insurer to provide insurance coverage. See, e.g., <em>Employers\u2019 Liab. Assurance Corp. </em>v. <em>Vella, </em>366 Mass. 651 (1975).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Nonaka\u2019s argument rests on a claim that the entry of an appearance for D\u2019Urso by an attorney selected by Merrimack in fulfilment of its duty to defend Nonaka\u2019s claim and the continuation of that appearance for approximately five months resulted, as a matter of law, in a waiver of Merrimack\u2019s right to disclaim coverage. The concept of waiver has had no part to play in the insurance law of the Commonwealth when an insured has argued that the insurance company has waived the limits of coverage defined in the insurance policy. In <em>Palumbo </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>293 Mass. 35 (1935), we said that \u201cwhatever may be the scope of waiver in the law of insurance, it does not extend to the broadening of the coverage, so as to make the policy cover a risk not within its terms. That would require a new contract, and cannot be accomplished by waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37-38. See <em>New England Gas &amp; Elec. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Ocean Accident &amp; Guar. Corp., </em>330 Mass. 640, 665 (1953); <em>Wedgwood </em>v. <em>Eastern Commercial Travelers Accident Ass\u2019n, </em>308 Mass. 463, 467 (1941). This is the majority view in this country. See A.D. Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes \u00a7 6.33, at 361 (2d ed. 1988) (\u201ccoverage under an insurance contract cannot be created or enlarged by waiver\u201d). This principle, argued to us by Merrimack and not discussed in Nonaka\u2019s brief, is dispositive of this case. The waiver cases on which Nonaka relies are not applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Even if we were to reexamine the question whether an insurance company could be found to have waived the limits of coverage stated in its policy, this case would not support a waiver theory. There was, of course, no express waiver. An implication that Merrimack intended to waive the coverage question is not warranted. Because there were negligence counts in each successive complaint, it was reasonable for Merrimack to conclude that it had a duty to defend all aspects of the case. See <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>413 Mass. 730, 732 n.1 (1992) (weight of authority imposes duty to defend all counts of complaint if insurer has duty to defend at least one count).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Merrimack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>retained coverage counsel shortly after it initially retained counsel to defend D\u2019Urso. The trial judge noted that \u201cpresumably all of the attorneys were aware of a potential coverage issue.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The judgment is vacated. Judgment shall be entered declaring that Merrimack Mutual Fire Insurance Company is not obliged to afford coverage under its homeowner\u2019s policy to Anthony J. D\u2019Urso, or Anthony A. D\u2019Urso, with respect to claims arising out of the shooting of Keizo Nonaka on June 11, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Nonaka has filed a brief individually and as assignee of D\u2019Urso. D\u2019Urso has filed no brief here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b205-7\">By not earlier (a) disclaiming coverage, (b) withdrawing from the defense of the case, (c) tendering notice of a reservation of rights to D\u2019Urso, or (d) commencing an action such as this, Merrimack ran the risk that D\u2019Urso might be able to prove that Merrimack was estopped to deny coverage. In retrospect, it seems that Merrimack would have been well-advised to have acted sooner to protect its position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In the <em>Rose </em>case, the court held that an insurance company had waived its right to disclaim coverage because of the noncooperation of its insured, when, without the insured\u2019s consent, the insurance company entered an appearance for him when its insured had not been properly served with process. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Regan, </em>344 Mass. 223, 229 (1962). This action \u201cirrevocably and materially affected the insured\u2019s position in respect\u201d to the action. <em>Id. </em>at 228. \u201c[T]he controlling circumstance [was] the exercise of dominion over the c\u00e1se, to determine irrevocably its future course.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229. The insurer thus waived its defense of noncooperation by entering an appearance, which gave the court jurisdiction over the insured that the court would not otherwise have had and caused the insured to lose his claim for false return of service. <em>Id. </em>at 226-227.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b206-7\">In the <em>Vella </em>case, the insurer sought a determination that it could disclaim liability because of an intentional misrepresentation by its policyholder. We held that the policyholder had made no material misrepresentation <em>(id. </em>at 656), and that, in any event, the insurer lost its_right to disclaim liability \u201cwhen it [knew] the facts, [failed] to disclaim within a reasonable time, and [acted] in a way inconsistent with an intention to disclaim\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 658). There, the insurer did not raise the question of its right to disclaim until one and one-half years after it had discovered the facts on which it relied. Although the word \u201cwaiver\u201d does not appear in the opinion, the authorities cited in support of the pnhciple just set forth deal with the loss of the power to avoid an agreement, with waiver, or with acts manifesting an election to affirm a transaction. <em>Id. </em>The delay was too great, and the insurer lost any right to disclaim. In such circumstances, the passage of an unreasonable length of time before disclaiming liability, after learning the facts and after undertaking a defense of a claim under the policy required a finding of waiver and, therefore, the insurer lost the right to disclaim liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Two courts may have treated the <em>Vella </em>case as an estoppel case. See <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Cos., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 508, 512 (1988); <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co., </em>595 F. Supp. 939, 943 (D. Mass. 1984). There was no reliance in the <em>Vella </em>case. Estoppel was, therefore, not involved. It was a waiver case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The purpose of reserving the right to disclaim is to permit an insurer to fulfil its duty to defend without forfeiting any subsequent right to disclaim. See <em>Salonen </em>v. <em>Paanenen, </em>320 Mass. 568, 573 (1947). It seems that Merrimack should have availed itself of this option at least as early as when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Nonaka filed a complaint alleging an intentional tort. Merrimack\u2019s failure to do so cannot alone support a finding of waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b208-9\">The judge found that Merrimack\u2019s coverage counsel kept up with the progress on the case by speaking from time to time with Nonaka\u2019s attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
