Auguste, of murder in the first degree and of two separate armed robberies. The defendant appeals his convictions, arguing that at the empanelment the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>failed to question adequately jurors who had expressed concerns about their impartiality. We agree that the judge failed in his duty to question the venire adequately. We reverse. We discuss briefly issues likely to arise at a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">There was ample evidence introduced at trial to justify the defendant\u2019s convictions. The defendant does not argue otherwise. On November 26, 1989, Gesner Junior Louisville (Junior) witnessed the murder of Joseph R. Bruno (Bruno), a relative of Junior, at Bruno\u2019s home in the Dorchester section of Boston, where Junior had been living for about six months. The assailants, wielding at least one firearm, murdered Bruno during their robbery of Junior.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The day after the murder, Roussel Theodat (Theodat), who played cards at Bruno\u2019s house frequently and was a friend of Bruno\u2019s, told police that he had been robbed of $1,200 and a gold ring at the same address on November 20, 1989. The defendant was convicted of the armed robberies of Junior and Theodat, and the murder of Bruno.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">1. <em>Jury empanelment. </em>At the beginning of the jury empanelment phase of the defendant\u2019s trial, the judge asked that any jurors who answered affirmatively any of the questions required by G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28 (1990 ed.), to approach the sidebar. The judge also asked that \u201cany members of the panel aware of any reason, whatsoever, why you could not stand indifferent or impartial\u201d make themselves known. A substantial fraction of the full venire indicated that for a variety of reasons they might not be able to judge the evidence impartially. The judge\u2019s basis for determining whether a juror was impartial depended on the juror\u2019s answer to the following question: \u201cDo you think you could listen to the evidence here, and if you determine that this defendant is not guilty, you will say he is not guilty?\u201d (or a minor variation thereof). See, e.g., Appendix. Defense counsel repeatedly objected to the judge\u2019s questioning of the prospective jurors as to their impartiality because the questions suggested the correct answers. Defense counsel requested that further questions be asked of each juror to determine whether there was a basis for either excusing the juror or a challenge for cause. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>The judge repeatedly denied defense counsel\u2019s requests. The defendant challenged those jurors for cause whom the judge refused to question any further, and whose answers indicated that there might be a reason either to excuse the jurors or challenge the jurors for cause. The defendant exhausted his sixteen peremptory challenges, expending nine of them removing jurors who had expressed concerns as to their impartiality in these sidebar conferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">General Laws c. 234, \u00a7 28 (1990 ed.), requires a judge, on \u201cmotion of either party . . . [to] examine on oath a person who is called as a juror therein, to learn whether he . . . has expressed or formed an opinion, or is sensible of any bias or prejudice\u201d toward a defendant or in a case. Section 28 further requires that, if it appears that a juror may not stand indifferent (due to factors extraneous to the case, such as community attitudes or bias for or against certain classes of persons), \u201cthe court shall . . . examine the juror specifically with respect to such considerations, attitudes, exposure, opinions or any other matters which may, as aforesaid, cause a decision or decisions to be made in whole or in part upon issues extraneous to the issues in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The defendant contends that the judge allowed a number of persons to be seated as potential jurors even after the jurors expressed grave doubts about their impartiality. In support of his argument, the defendant points to a number of instances when jurors were determined to be indifferent in spite of the jurors\u2019 expressed reservations about their impartiality. One example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">The Court: \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">The Juror: \u201cI don\u2019t really feel I could be impartial \u2019cause of the race thing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\">The Court: \u201cWhy?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-10\">The Juror: \u201cI just have a problem with that.

We agree. The defendant argues that he was forced to exhaust his peremptory challenges on some potential jurors who might have been challenged for cause or excused. Two disputed jurors remained on the panel after the defendant had exhausted his peremptory challenges. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>389 Mass. 552 (1983) (erroneous denial of the right to exercise a proper peremptory challenge is reversible error without a showing of prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">The Commonwealth relies on our cases which generally uphold a judge\u2019s exercise of discretion. \u201cOur general rule has been that \u2018[i]n the absence of action or inaction which constitutes a denial of constitutional rights ... or which constitutes an error of law, such as an abuse of discretion, we will not interfere with the trial judge in the jury selection process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>372 Mass. 783, 794 (1977), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McKay, </em>363 Mass. 220, 223 (1973). See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ascolillo, </em>405 Mass. 456 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lattimore, </em>396 Mass. 446 (1985). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheline, </em>391 Mass. 279, 290-291 (1984) (judge\u2019s initial determination of impartiality of proposed jurors \u201cwill not be disturbed on appeal . . . [barring] a substantial risk that the case [was] decided in whole or in part on the basis of extraneous issues\u201d). The Commonwealth highlights a number of factors that, it contends, demonstrate the difficult task the judge faced in seating a willing jury, including the high percentage of the total venire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>that expressed doubts about their own impartiality, probable juror vacation plans, the subject matter of the trial, and pleasant summer weather on the days of jury empanelment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although we recognize that many factors may influence a juror\u2019s desire not to serve, and agree that a judge has broad discretion in determining impartiality, we disagree with the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that the judge\u2019s probing of prospective jurors was sufficient to insure impartial jurors were empanelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The problem with the judge\u2019s inquiry is that it avoided the very issue which the judge is required to investigate, i.e., whether the juror would be impartial in his or her determination of the evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[I]f there is reason to suspect that a juror or jurors are not or may not be indifferent within the meaning of [G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28], the judge must inquire fully before declaring jurors indifferent and allowing them to be seated.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>376 Mass. 380, 395 (1978), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Wideman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>440 U.S. 923 (1979), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>372 Mass. 783, 793 (1977). A prospective juror who does not come forward in response to a judge\u2019s questioning of the full venire is \u201c[impliedly representing] that he or she is not biased.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duddie Ford, Inc., </em>409 Mass. 387, 393 (1991). An affirmative response to the judge\u2019s questioning indicates that the judge must probe the juror to determine impartiality. In such circumstances the judge\u2019s duty is to conduct a meaningful inquiry into the juror\u2019s impartiality in an effort to promote the intelligent exercise of peremptory challenges. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fudge, 20 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 382, 388 (1985). Although the judge may reasona<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>bly determine, after a meaningful inquiry, that a juror\u2019s doubts about his or her own impartiality are unfounded, that determination should be made after the judge conducts an inquiry that could be reasonably expected to determine impartiality. See Appendix. That determination should come from the juror\u2019s answers to the judge\u2019s questions, and not from answers suggested or, in fact, required by the questions. An inquiry into impartiality must be fair and neutral. Jurors should not be coerced into a particular response.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">During the judge\u2019s questioning of potential jurors, the defendant repeatedly objected to the form of the judge\u2019s questions, pointing out that the judge\u2019s inquiries did not address the jurors\u2019 ability or intent to weigh the evidence introduced at trial fairly and impartially. Because the defendant exhausted his peremptory challenges, this case differs from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ascolillo, </em>405 Mass. 456 (1989), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amazeen, </em>375 Mass. 73 (1978), relied on by the Commonwealth. In <em>Ascolillo, </em>prospective jurors who were related to police officers were seated on the jury only after they had expressly indicated that they could be impartial in their deliberations. In <em>Amazeen, </em>there was no harm to the defendant even if the judge erred in not excluding a potential juror for cause, as the defendant peremptorily challenged this juror and did not exhaust all of his peremptory challenges. Here, however, the defendant was forced to expend peremptory challenges excluding jurors who, on meaningful examination, may have been excludable for cause or for bias. \u201cThe defendant suffered a prejudicial diminution of peremptory challenges warranting reversal and a new trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Susi, </em>394 Mass. 784, 789 (1985). We note further that the defendant has adequately shown that he would have exercised a proper peremptory challenge, had another been available, to exclude at least one of the sitting jurors. \u201c[T]he erroneous denial of the right to exercise a proper peremptory challenge is reversible error without a showing of prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 789, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>Wood, </em>389 Mass. 552, 564 (1983). We therefore reverse the defendant\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">2. <em>Issues likely to recur at a retrial. </em>A. <em>Allowance of witness to be seated at prosecution table. </em>The defendant asserts that it was reversible error for the judge to allow a police officer witness to sit at the Commonwealth\u2019s table during trial, maintaining that such a seating arrangement was a tacit endorsement by the Commonwealth of the officer\u2019s credibility. The officer at issue was the chief investigator in the case, and coordinated much of the scientific testing and other investigative work related to the case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">We have recognized that frequently a police investigator\u2019s presence is essential to the management of a case during trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>405 Mass. 339 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salcedo, </em>405 Mass. 346 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>359 Mass. 500, 508 (1971). While we have cautioned the Commonwealth to be wary of deciding to have an essential witness sit at the counsel table, we also have determined the necessity of reserving the determination of the need for such a seating arrangement to the discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>of the judge. <em>Perez, supra </em>at 344. We therefore conclude that the judge\u2019s allowance of the Commonwealth\u2019s request to have the police officer seated at the Commonwealth\u2019s table was not an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">B. <em>Denial of motion to sever. </em>The defendant contends that the judge\u2019s decision to join for trial the armed robbery charge and murder charge arising out of the events of November 26 with the armed robbery charge arising out of the events occurring a week earlier at the same address was reversible error. We review the judge\u2019s decision to join the charges for trial for errors of law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>388 Mass. 749 (1983). We conclude the judge\u2019s refusal to sever was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The defendant argues that the only common thread between the two incidents was that they occurred at the same address, asserting that the first crime consisted of an armed robbery of a card game, whereas the second crime was a murder \u201cnot related to the card game,\u201d and that therefore \u201cthe two offenses can hardly be said to be \u2018related\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of Mass. R. Crim. P. 9 (a) (1), 378 Mass. 859 (1979). As the Commonwealth notes in its brief, however, the murder of November 26 occurred during another armed robbery of participants in a card game, at the same address, less than a week after the initial armed robbery; the assailants in both incidents employed the same tactics and type of weapons; and the defendant was identified as the assailant in both armed robberies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Separate trials are not required merely because offenses occurred on different dates, <em>Mamay, supra </em>at 412, or involved different victims. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garafolo, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 905 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahar, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 307 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 544 (1977). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>cannot say, therefore, that the judge\u2019s decision to join the offenses was an abuse of discretion or an error of law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Good, </em>409 Mass. 612 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tobin, 392 </em>Mass. 604 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chalifoux, </em>362 Mass. 811 (1973).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The judgments are reversed, the verdicts set aside, and these matters are remanded to the Superior Court for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Examples of the judge\u2019s inquiries include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">The Juror: \u201cMy brother was stabbed to death, your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alx\">The Court: \u201cHow long ago?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">The Juror: \u201cAbout twenty years ago, it is like yesterday. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av6\">The Court: \u201cDo you think you could listen to the evidence here and decide whether this man is guilty or not guilty?

Proceed with the jury selection, . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Because the length of service of a juror is one day, unless the juror \u201cis assigned to or impanelled on an incompleted trial,\u201d there was no need to complete the empanelment without appropriate inquiry by the judge. See G. L. c. 234A, \u00a7 44 (1990 ed.). New jurors are summonsed daily unless there is no need for them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b73-7\">We note that in at least two cases, the judge determined that prospective jurors were impartial even after the jurors had displayed some reluctance to answer the judge\u2019s question with a response indicating impartiality. The defendant challenged these jurors. See Appendix.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The judge said to counsel about the jurors: \u201cYou know, you get used to all the fakers up here after a while. Everybody tells them what to say when they come up and see the Judge, so they can get out of jury service. Some of it is pretty sad. They ought to get lessons in faking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Judges and lawyers are reminded that jurors are essential to the administration of justice. The jury system provides the most important means by which laypersons can participate in and understand the legal system. \u201cIt makes them feel that they owe duties to society, and that they have a share in its government. . . . The jury system has for some hundreds of years been constantly bringing the rules of law to the touchstone of contemporary common sense.\u201d 1 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 348-349 (3d ed. 1922).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b75-9\">The defendant cites as support three inapposite Federal cases. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez Vargas, </em>558 F.2d 631 (1st Cir. 1977); <em>Patriarca </em>v. <em>United States, </em>402 F.2d 314 (1st Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1022 (1969); and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cotter, </em>425 F.2d 450, 453 (1st Cir. 1970), focused on prosecutors\u2019 express statements of personal beliefs regarding the merits of a case in closing argument. These cases merely emphasize the judicial prohibition on an attorney\u2019s expression of his or her personal convictions during trial, a principle we do not dispute; they do not address the issue of seating arrangements at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b76-7\">That the evidence against the defendant in each of these incidents was not merely circumstantial is significant. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blow, </em>362 Mass. 196, 200-201 (1972) (where no identification of defendant made, and evidence against him for one offense was purely circumstantial, jury were likely influenced by cumulative effect of evidence).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b77-18\">Defense counsel unsuccessfully attempted to introduce a typed transcript of a witness\u2019s pretrial testimony. The judge refused to admit the typed transcript of the witness\u2019s prior testimony as a prior inconsistent statement to impeach. That ruling was well within the judge\u2019s discretion. Where a witness\u2019s statements at trial do not plainly contradict prior statements, the judge has wide discretion to deny the admission of the prior statements in evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGowan, </em>400 Mass. 385, 390-391 (1987). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hesketh, </em>386 Mass. 153, 161 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
