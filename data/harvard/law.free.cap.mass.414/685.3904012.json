King filed a third-party complaint against the third-party defendant director seeking a declaration that lead poisoning regulations that the director had issued were unlawful. On motion of the director, a Superior Court judge, without a statement of reasons, dismissed the third-party complaint and entered a separate judgment of dismissal of the third-party complaint. We allowed King\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">We affirm the judgment of dismissal on a ground that appears not to have been argued below but, in any event, warrants dismissal pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). It is well established that, on appeal, we may consider any ground apparent on the record that supports the result reached in the lower court. See <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>413 Mass. 730, 734-735 (1992); <em>St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>411 Mass. 615, 619 n.9 (1992); <em>North Shore Corp. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Topsfield, </em>322 Mass. 413, 416 (1948); <em>Rosenfeld </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Chilmark, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 621, 626 n.10 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">King\u2019s right to assert a third-party claim against the director can be justified only if the conditions exist that are set forth in Mass. R. Civ. P. 14 (a), as amended, 385 Mass. 1216 (1982). That rule provides that \u201ca defending party, as a third-party plaintiff, may . . . cause a summons and complaint to be served upon a person who is or may be liable to him for all or part of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against him.\u201d The rule is intended to be used in situations of indemnity or possible contribution. Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Civ. P. 15, Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Civil Procedure at 358 (1982). See <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Westerlind, </em>374 Mass. 524, 525 (1978) (allowance of motion to implead third party under rule 14 [a] \u201cturns on whether [the third party] is or may be liable to [the defendant] for all or part of [the plaintiff\u2019s] claim against [the defendant]\u201d); J.W. Smith &amp; H.B. Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7\u00a7 14.1, 14.7, 14.8 (1974). Under the substantively similar Federal rule (Fed. R. Civ. P. 14 [a]), \u201cim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>pleader is available only against persons who are or may be liable to defendant for part or all of plaintiffs claim.\u201d C.A. Wright, A.R. Miller &amp; M.K. Kane, 6 Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1442, at 295 (1990). See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 1441, at 286, 1446, at 377-379; <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>American Int\u2019l Oil &amp; Gas Co., </em>845 F.2d 196, 200 (9th Cir. 1988) (court did not err in dismissing third-party complaint where \u201cthere was no derivative nor secondary liability involved\u201d in complaint); <em>U.S. Gen., Inc. </em>v. <em>Joliet, </em>598 F.2d 1050, 1053 (7th Cir. 1979) (\u201cplain condition on the face of Rule 14\u201d was not met where \u201cthere was no claim that any one of the additional parties would be secondarily liable to [the defendants] in the event it was found in the original cause that [the defendants] were liable to [the plaintiffs]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">King\u2019s third-party complaint contains no claim for money damages against the director. It does not assert that the director is directly or derivatively liable to King for the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries through indemnity, contribution, or otherwise. The complaint, therefore, does not allege conditions that, pursuant to rule 14, permit the impleading of the director.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
