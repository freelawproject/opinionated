Shul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>man and Mr. Emidio DiLoreto. We summarize the underlying facts, as set forth in the record, including the affidavits submitted by the parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Between 1967 and 1989, DiLoreto and Shulman maintained a professional relationship under an oral agreement, the precise contours of which are in dispute. Shulman asserts that he employed DiLoreto on a case by case basis. Shulman contends that, pursuant to the agreement, he would compensate DiLoreto only for those cases that DiLoreto personally brought to a successful conclusion while working for Shulman. DiLoreto, on the other hand, claims that he worked as Shulman\u2019s independent cocounsel rather than as his employee. DiLoreto also contends that the oral agreement contemplated that he should receive payment regardless of which attorney settled a particular case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">DiLoreto maintained his own law office throughout his relationship with Shulman. However, DiLoreto always used Shulman\u2019s law office to serve the clients whom Shulman turned over to him. All meetings between DiLoreto and these clients took place in Shulman\u2019s law office, and DiLoreto used Shulman\u2019s stationery when corresponding with the clients. Also, the name and address of Shulman\u2019s law office appeared on all the pleadings and motions which DiLoreto signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">In July, 1989, the professional relationship between DiLoreto and Shulman ended.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Shulman requested that DiLoreto return the case files which Shulman had turned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>over to him. DiLoreto asserts that, on November 7, 1989, he returned most such files. DiLoreto also contends that Shulman authorized him to continue to work on twenty-five active cases. While Shulman acknowledges that DiLoreto returned a majority of files, Shulman also asserts that he never authorized DiLoreto to retain any case files. Shulman claims that he did not even know that DiLoreto had retained files until DiLoreto forwarded settlement checks to Shulman\u2019s office. On December 7, 1989, Shulman requested in writing that DiLoreto return all the remaining files, and DiLoreto complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Among the cases which DiLoreto returned was the personal injury claim that underlies the present fee dispute. On August 22, 1985, Shulman entered into a contingent fee agreement with the plaintiff, Noreen J. Boswell.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Pursuant to the arrangement that we described above, Shulman assigned the Boswell file to DiLoreto. On November 7, 1986, Shulman\u2019s law office filed a complaint on Boswell\u2019s behalf in the Superior Court. Shulman himself signed the complaint. Subsequent pleadings and motions were signed by one of three attorneys: Shulman, DiLoreto, or DiLoreto\u2019s daughter, Elizabeth. Regardless of which attorney signed a particular pleading or motion, the name and address of Shulman\u2019s law office appeared underneath the signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">DiLoreto asserts that he conducted most of the pretrial work and the settlement negotiations on behalf of Boswell. On November 29, 1989, DiLoreto wrote to Boswell that the defense had offered $53,000 in settlement of her claim. DiLoreto\u2019s letter also stated that DiLoreto was likely to obtain an offer of $60,000. DiLoreto, however, returned Boswell\u2019s file to Shulman before the case settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Subsequently, Shulman\u2019s office settled the case, thereby obtaining the right to a contingent fee of $21,000. On December 18, 1989, DiLoreto filed an attorney\u2019s lien pursuant to G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50 (1990 ed.). DiLoreto and Shulman filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>opposing affidavits. Based on these affidavits and on court records, but without holding an evidentiary hearing, the judge below allowed DiLoreto\u2019s motion to enforce the lien. The judge ruled that DiLoreto performed, \u201csubstantial work\u201d in the Boswell case, and that DiLoreto\u2019s signing of motions and pleadings constituted an \u201cappearance\u201d on behalf of Boswell. This appearance, the court held, entitled DiLoreto to an attorney\u2019s lien amounting to $10,500, or one-half of the net contingent fee. Shulman appealed this ruling to the Appeals Court, and we transferred the case on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">In Massachusetts, attorneys have a statutory right to assert a charging lien securing compensation for their legal services. G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50. See <em>Elbaum </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>344 Mass. 662, 663 (1962). In relevant part, the attorney\u2019s lien statute provides that \u201c[fjrom the authorized commencement of an action, counterclaim or other proceeding in any court <em>... the attorney who appears for a client. . . </em>shall have a lien for his reasonable fees and expenses\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50. DiLoreto argues that the judge properly construed this language when she held that DiLoreto\u2019s signing of some pleadings and motions constituted an \u201cappearance\u201d within the meaning of the attorney\u2019s lien statute. DiLoreto bases this argument on Mass. R. Civ. P. 11 (b) (1), 365 Mass. 753 (1974), which provides that the \u201cfiling of any pleading, motion, or other paper shall constitute an appearance by the attorney who signs it, unless the paper states otherwise.\u201d Such an appearance, DiLoreto argues, entitles him to recover one-half of the contingent fee generated from the Boswell case pursuant to his agreement with Shulman.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Shulman, in turn, asserts that the judge below erred in several respects. First, Shulman asserts that DiLoreto was not Boswell\u2019s attorney of record and thus did not \u201cappear\u201d for Boswell within the meaning of G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Rather, Shulman argues that DiLoreto was his employee and \u201cappeared\u201d in the Boswell case, if at all, only as a representative of Shulman\u2019s law office. Shulman points out that DiLoreto did not file a notice of appearance pursuant to rule 11 (b) (2), which states that \u201c[a]n appearance in a case may be made by filing a notice of appearance, containing the name, address, and telephone number of the attorney or person filing the notice.\u201d Further, Shulman notes that each time DiLoreto signed a pleading or a motion the name and address of Shulman\u2019s law office followed DiLoreto\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Shulman also argues that the judge below erred when she established a lien in DiLoreto\u2019s favor without determining that DiLoreto had a contractual right to recover against Boswell. Shulman points out that DiLoreto was not a party to the contingent fee agreement into which Shulman and Boswell entered. Shulman argues that, in the absence of such a written retainer agreement, DiLoreto has no right to collect a fee from Boswell. See S.J.C. Rule 3:05, as appearing in 382 Mass. 762 (1981); S.J.C. Rule 3:07, DR 2-106 (C), as appearing in 382 Mass. 773 (1981). Without an underlying contractual right to recover, Shulman argues, DiLoreto may not assert an attorney\u2019s lien pursuant to G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50. Finally, Shulman contends that, even if DiLoreto had the right to file a lien, the judge below erred when she established the lien and its amount without an evidentiary hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>and on the sole basis of the affidavits and court records of the original case presented by the parties.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">This case requires us to determine the circumstances in which an attorney hired by retained counsel to assist in the preparation of a case may file a lien in the original action under G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50. This issue is one of first impression in this Commonwealth, but the courts of some of our sister States have discussed this question under attorney\u2019s lien statutes presenting the same language as ours. We now turn to an examination of these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The attorney\u2019s charging lien statute of New York provides that \u201cthe attorney who appears for a party\u201d may assert \u201ca lien upon his client\u2019s cause of action.\u201d N.Y. Jud. Law \u00a7 475 (McKinney 1983). The New York courts have construed this language to confine the use of the statute to the attorney of record in a particular case. <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>City of New York, 66 </em>N.Y.2d 825, 827 (1985). See <em>D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Nuzzo, </em>138 A.D.2d 667, 668 (N.Y. 1988). While a litigant may employ additional counsel, the additional attorney may not assert a statutory lien, regardless of the extent to which he or she contributes to the litigation of a case. <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>Srogi, </em>96 A.D.2d 723, 723-724 (N.Y. 1983).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, where a lawyer retained by the client employs another attorney to conduct a trial, the additional attorney is not entitled to file a lien pursuant to the New York statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Other courts have disagreed with the New York approach. In <em>Nickel Rim Mines Ltd. </em>v. <em>Universal-Cyclops Steel Corp., </em>202 F. Supp. 170, 173, 175 (D.N.J. 1962), for instance, the court, applying New Jersey law, rejected the New York rule and refused to confine the use of the New Jersey attorney\u2019s lien statute to an attorney of record.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Nickel Rim Mines Ltd. </em>involved an out-of-State attorney who, pursuant to the local rules of court, had participated in the conduct of a trial but had hired a local attorney of record to sign all pleadings and motions. The court held that, under New Jersey law, a trial counsel may file a statutory lien even if he or she is not the attorney of record. <em>Id. </em>at 175, citing <em>St. John the Baptist Greek Catholic Church </em>v. <em>Gengor, </em>124 N.J. Eq. 449 (Ch. 1938). This rule, the court reasoned, should extend to an out-of-State attorney who participates in the conduct of a litigation but is not the attorney of record. <em>Nickel-Rim Mines Ltd., supra </em>at 175. Accord <em>Liberty </em>v. <em>Liberty, 226 </em>Wis. 136, 139 (1937). The Supreme Court of Minnesota has reached a similar result. See <em>Meacham </em>v. <em>Ballard &amp; Co., </em>184 Minn. 607, 612-613 (1931) (rejecting New York rule and holding that any attorney who renders services in an action, even if not attorney of record, may file lien under Minnesota statute providing that \u201can attorney has a lien for his compensation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">In deciding which of these conflicting approaches should guide us in construing G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50, we must give due deference to the underlying intent of our Legislature as expressed by the plain language of the statute. See <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975); <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 360, 364 (1975). Additionally, we must attempt to construe \u00a7 50 in harmony with other related statutes and rules so as to give rise to a consistent body of law. See <em>Board of Educ., supra </em>at 513-514. By its plain terms, \u00a7 50 extends the right to file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>lien to the attorney who \u201cappears\u201d for a client. In turn, rule 11 (b), 365 Mass. 753 (1974), provides that an attorney may \u201cappear\u201d either by filing a notice of appearance or by signing pleadings and motions on behalf of a client. Were we to follow the New York rule and hold that an associated counsel who signs motions and pleadings in a case may not file a lien, see <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>Srogi, supra, </em>we would skew the clear definition of the term \u201cappearance\u201d provided by rule 11 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Attorneys\u2019 liens are devices, first created by the common law, which help attorneys deal with the oft-encountered reluctance of certain clients to pay for legal fees at the conclusion of a matter. McCann, The Attorney\u2019s Lien in Massachusetts, 69 Mass. L. Rev. 68, 68 (1984). As Chief Judge Cardozo aptly put it, the attorney\u2019s lien protects attorneys \u201cagainst the knavery of their clients, by disabling the clients from receiving the fruits of recoveries without paying for the valuable services by which the recoveries were obtained.\u201d <em>Matter of Heinsheimer, </em>214 N.Y. 361, 364 (1915), quoted in McCann, <em>supra </em>at 68 n.1. In other words, the attorney\u2019s lien grants the unpaid attorney a tool for recovery of legal fees which surpasses in effectiveness a traditional action in contract or in quantum meruit.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">While attorneys practicing in this Commonwealth derive the right to file a lien from an act of the Legislature rather than from the common law, <em>Elbaum, supra </em>at 663-664 n.1, the underlying goal remains the protection of the unpaid attorney. See <em>Crabb </em>v. <em>Robert R. Anderson Co., </em>117 Ill. App. 2d 271, 275 (1969). The statutory grant of the right to file a lien to the attorney \u201cappearing for a client\u201d reflects a legislative judgment that such an appearance indicates that the attorney is expending services and skills in furtherance of the client\u2019s interest. Both the signing of motions or pleadings and the filing of a notice of appearance indicate that an attorney is participating in the litigation of a case. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 11 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Neither the plain language nor the underlying purpose of the attorney\u2019s lien statute requires us, as Shulman argues, to confine the use of this statute to an attorney of record. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>decline to do so. We hold that the word \u201cappears\u201d in G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50, should be construed to encompass the signing of pleadings or motions as well as the filing of a notice of appearance. See Mass R. Civ. P. 11 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In the present case, this holding means that DiLoreto \u201cappeared\u201d on behalf of Boswell within the meaning of G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50. However, our analysis does not stop here. As we explained, the attorney\u2019s lien is a tool for collecting fees. It follows that a mere appearance without a right to recover fees from the client directly does not support a lien against the proceeds of the client\u2019s recovery. <em>Democratic Cent. Comm. </em>v. <em>Washington Metro. Area Transit Comm\u2019n, </em>941 F.2d 1217, 1219 (D.C. Cir. 1991). <em>Hahn </em>v. <em>Oregon Physicians\u2019 Serv., </em>786 F.2d 1353, 1355 (9th Cir. 1985). Thus, an attorney must establish a substantive contractual or quantum meruit basis to recover fees from the client as a prerequisite to filing a lien. See <em>Elbaum, supra </em>at 664. See also <em>Gil-Wal Corp. </em>v. <em>Painewebber, Inc., </em>734 F. Supp. 566, 567 (D. Mass. 1990) (enforcing attorney\u2019s lien under G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50, to secure quantum meruit right of recovery).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">An associate counsel has no underlying right to recover fees against a client unless the client authorized or ratified the employment of the associated lawyer. <em>Serlin </em>v. <em>Rotman, </em>371 Mass. 449, 450 (1976). <em>Parke </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>304 Mass. 35, 39 (1939). While the ratification of the associated attorney\u2019s work need not be express, the circumstances of the case must be such as to raise an inference that the client expected that the associated lawyer would look to the client for payment. <em>Hahn, supra </em>at 1355. See <em>Aldrich </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>103 Mass. 527 (1870).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">However, whether or not Boswell authorized DiLoreto\u2019s employment, DiLoreto has no right of recovery against her because his claim arises under a contingent fee agreement. See S.J.C. Rule 3:05 (providing the circumstances and terms of valid contingent fee agreements); S.J.C. Rule 3:07, DR 2-106 (C), (prohibiting contingent fee agreements except as authorized by rule 3:05). DiLoreto was not a signatory of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>contingent fee contract between Shulman and Boswell. Thus, DiLoreto could not sue Boswell on this contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Further, the oral agreement between DiLoreto and Shulman precludes DiLoreto from recovering in quantum meruit against Boswell. Recovery in quantum meruit presupposes that no valid contract covers the subject matter of a dispute. Where such a contract exists, the law need not create a quantum meruit right to receive compensation for services rendered. <em>Hahn, supra </em>at 1355, citing <em>Kashmir Corp. </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>43 Or. App. 45, 48, aff'd, 289 Or. 589 (1979). See <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>B.A. Gardetto, Inc., </em>306 Mass. 212, 216 (1940), citing <em>Gardiner </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>234 Mass. 350, 354-355 (1920), <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Fales, </em>139 Mass. 21, 28 (1885). In <em>Hahn, </em>for instance, an attorney associated with the lead counsel in an antitrust action sought to establish a lien against the proceeds of the clients\u2019 recovery. The associated counsel had no contract with the clients, but he sought to assert a lien for the reasonable value of his services under a quantum meruit theory of recovery. The court held that the existence of a contract for fees between the associated counsel and the lead counsel precluded the associated counsel from recovering in quantum meruit against the client. <em>Hahn, supra </em>at 1355. In the absence of a substantive right of recovery against the client, the court refused to establish a lien in favor of the associated attorney. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Thus, the judge below erred when she established a lien in DiLoreto\u2019s favor without determining whether he has a substantive right to recover against Boswell.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While DiLoreto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>may attempt in a separate action to enforce his oral agreement with Shulman, see <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Ginsburg, </em>346 Mass. 421 (1963), <em>Parke </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>304 Mass. 35 (1939), DiLoreto may not establish a lien against the proceeds of Boswell\u2019s recovery without an independent substantive right.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The decision of the Superior Court enforcing DiLoreto\u2019s attorney\u2019s lien is reversed. DiLoreto\u2019s lien is vacated forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b258-8\">The parties shown are the original parties in a tort action. This matter has been settled, and the original plaintiff, Boswell, has received all funds due her. As will be noted, attorney\u2019s fees of $21,000 have been placed in escrow, pending the resolution of this appeal. Thus, neither Boswell nor the defendants have any further interest in this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Shulman and DiLoreto agree that the agreement contemplated that, when entitled to compensation, DiLoreto would receive a fee amounting to one-half the legal fees generated from any particular case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b258-10\">The parties disagree as to the events that triggered the termination of their relationship. While Shulman claims that DiLoreto \u201cunilaterally and without justifiable cause\u201d ended the relationship, DiLoreto says that he withdrew because Shulman took a course of action that DiLoreto judged \u201cintolerable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\">The agreement provided that attorney\u2019s fees (including those of any associated counsel) would not exceed one-third of the settlement plus costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\">It appears that Shulman is relying on the New York rule whereby a litigant may generally designate only one \u201cattorney of record.\u201d See note 8, <em>infra. </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, however, provides a broader definition of \u201c [attorney of record\u201d: \u201cAttorney whose name must appear somewhere in permanent records or files of case, or on the pleadings or some instrument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>filed in the case, or on appearance docket. Person whom the client has named as his agent upon whom service of papers may be made. ... An attorney who has filed a notice of appearance (e.g., through a praecipe) and who hence is formally mentioned in court records as the official attorney of the party.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 129 (6th ed. 1990).

See Mass. R. Civ. P. 11 (b), 365 Mass. 753 (1974). Thus, we reject the New York rule. See our discussion of the word \u201cappearance\u201d in the context of G.
