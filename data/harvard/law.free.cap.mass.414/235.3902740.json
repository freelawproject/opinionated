On appeal the defendant challenges the judge\u2019s exclusion of a psychiatrist\u2019s letter, thereby limiting an expert\u2019s testimony, and the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>on criminal responsibility. We transferred the defendant\u2019s appeal to this court on our own motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We summarize the facts. On January 10, 1990, pursuant to a search warrant,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Lowell police searched the defendant\u2019s apartment and found large quantities of heroin, money, bank books, a notebook, and a small bag of cocaine. Roman was arrested and searched. The police found a large quantity of heroin on her person. On August 17, 1990, a Lowell police officer<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> observed the defendant and others in what appeared to be drug transactions. The defendant was arrested. The defendant was searched and heroin was found on her person. The grand jury returned two indictments for possession of heroin with intent to distribute (second offense)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and one indictment charging possession of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">At trial, James C. Beck, a psychiatrist and director of the Cambridge Court Clinic, testified on the defendant\u2019s behalf. He said that he reviewed past medical records, records of the defendant\u2019s outpatient psychotherapy, police reports relating to her arrest, grand jury minutes and a letter by Dr. James A. Chu, a psychiatrist who evaluated the defendant in 1987 for an attorney.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Dr. Beck also interviewed her twice for a total of two hours. He testified that the defendant\u2019s demeanor changed dramatically between the two interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Dr. Beck testified that he was of the opinion that the defendant suffered from MPD when he met with her in July, 1990, that she had suffered from it in January, 1990, when she was first arrested and that she continued to suffer from it in August, 1990, when she was arrested for the second time. Dr. Beck testified that the condition was chronic. He also noted that he never met the core personality, \u201cNorma,\u201d that he did not know whether \u201cNorma\u201d could control the actions of the other personalities, whether the transitions from \u201cNorma\u201d to one of the other personalities were voluntary, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>whether \u201cNorma\u201d had any memories of acts the other personalities performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">On cross-examination, Dr. Beck testified that \u201cjust because you say this person has [MPD], doesn\u2019t go to the issue of whether they were responsible at the time of the alleged act or they weren\u2019t.\u201d He also admitted that he found no evidence that the defendant, at the time of the commission of the crimes, could not conform her behavior to law or that she did not appreciate the wrongfulness of her conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The defendant testified. As \u201cNorma\u201d she denied using or selling drugs. She told the jurors that, on two occasions in the past, she (\u201cNorma\u201d) had disposed of drugs found in her apartment. \u201cNorma\u201d said that she \u201clost time\u201d on the two dates on which the Commonwealth said she possessed the heroin with intent to distribute. \u201cNorma\u201d denied meeting with Dr. Beck. The defendant also testified as \u201cAlice Mejias.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cAlice\u201d said she had no control over \u201cVicky.\u201d \u201cVicky\u201d testified and admitted selling drugs on August 17 and possessing drugs in January. \u201cVicky\u201d denied she had any mental illness and said she chose to engage in drug-related activities. She said she knew the activities were illegal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">A jury returned verdicts of guilty. The judge in a jury-waived trial found the defendant guilty of the portion of the indictments alleging a second offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">1. <em>The exclusion of Dr. Chu\u2019s letter. </em>The defendant had pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in February, 1988. The defendant\u2019s attorney in that case referred her to Dr. James A. Chu. Dr. Chu sent the attorney a letter in which he concluded that the defendant met \u201cthe criteria for a diagnosis of multiple personality disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">The defendant offered the Chu letter in evidence in her 1991 trial. The defendant also wanted her expert to testify to the contents of the letter. The Commonwealth requested a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>voir dire. See <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 532 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">At the voir dire, the expert, Dr. Beck, testified that, in the thousands of times he had testified as to a defendant\u2019s mental health, he had derived the information mainly from the defendant. Dr. Beck explained that he was skeptical with regard to MPD and that he had never seen a case before the defendant\u2019s. He testified that MPD was a subspecialty of Dr. Chu\u2019s and that he (Dr. Beck) did pay some attention to the diagnosis of Dr. Chu. In response to a question from the judge, Dr. Beck concluded that he could reach his opinion, that the defendant suffered from MPD, without relying on Dr. Chu\u2019s letter. The judge then excluded the letter, but allowed Dr. Beck to testify as to his opinion without including Dr. Chu\u2019s letter. The defendant claims that the judge\u2019s ruling was erroneous. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The Chu letter was hearsay and inadmissible barring an exception to the hearsay rule. <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Lewis/Boyle, Inc., </em>408 Mass. 269, 274 (1990). \u201c[A]n expert [may] base an opinion on facts or data not in evidence if the facts or data are independently admissible and are a permissible basis for an expert to consider in formulating an opinion.\u201d <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, supra </em>at 531. Although in forming an opinion an expert can draw on the education and general experience that combine to create the witness\u2019s expertise, the expert may not give an opinion based on inadmissible evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeFave, </em>407 Mass. 927, 945 n.2 (1990) (Liacos, C.J., dissenting). The defendant suggests two grounds for the admissibility of the letter.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The defendant points to art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, which states that \u201cevery subject shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>have a right to produce all proofs, that may be favorable to him.\u201d The defendant\u2019s argument is meritless; art. 12 does not require the admission of hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The defendant also relies on cases in which we have said, \u201cAn insanity defense may be raised properly by the admission of any evidence which, if believed, might create a reasonable doubt concerning the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility at the time of the [crime].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dias, </em>402 Mass. 645, 649 (1988), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laliberty, </em>373 Mass. 238, 243, 246-247 (1977) (\u201cexperts experienced in the study and treatment of the mentally ill may testify fully as to the nature and extent of impairment of defendants\u2019 mental faculties as well as their observations or other bases for their conclusions\u201d). The defendant argues that \u201c[c]learly, the other bases referred to in these cases implicate hearsay evidence.\u201d Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, our cases do not support her claim. The cases merely state the obvious: evidence of mental incapacity may come from a wide range of evidence including nonexpert evidence. Our cases do not suggest that inadmissible hearsay evidence becomes admissible because it relates to criminal responsibility. There was no error in the judge\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">2. <em>The judge\u2019s instruction on insanity. </em>The defendant concedes that the judge charged the jury in accordance with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544, 546-547 (1967). She argues, however, that the judge erred in instructing the jury that \u201cyou must focus on the particular mental state under or in which you find the defendant was operating at the time of the alleged criminal conduct.\u201d The defendant asserts that this instruction precluded the jury from returning a verdict of lack of criminal responsibility for an individual suffering from multiple personality disorder. The defendant asserts that, although \u201cVicky\u201d did not suffer from a lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>criminal responsibility, \u201cNorma\u201d did. She argues that the instruction should have focused on the issue whether \u201cNorma,\u201d the \u201ccore personality,\u201d lacked \u201csubstantial capacity to control \u2018Vicky\u2019 and thereby to conform her conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d The defendant argues that the judge\" should have instructed the jurors to consider whether \u201cNorma\u201d lacked substantial capacity to conform \u201cVicky\u2019s\u201d behavior to the requirements of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">States that have considered the issue of the criminal responsibility of a person suffering from MPD follow the general rule that jurors are to consider the mental state of the individual at the time of the commission of the crime. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Grimsley, </em>3 Ohio App. 3d 265, 268 (1982) (\u201cThere was only one person driving the car and only one person accused of drunken driving. It is immaterial whether she was in one state of consciousness or another, so long as in the personality then controlling her' behavior, she was conscious and her actions were a product of her-own volition\u201d); <em>Kirkland </em>v. <em>State, </em>166 Ga. App. 478, 480 (1983) (\u201cThe law adjudges criminal liability of the person according to the person\u2019s state of mind at the time of the act; we will not begin to parcel criminal accountability out among the various inhabitants of the mind\u201d). The defendant cites no authority to the contrary. Our law requires jurors to determine criminal responsibility of the person at the time of the commission of the crime. The judge so instructed the jury. There was no error.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-16\">A conviction of possession of cocaine was placed on file after the jury returned a verdict of guilty.

As the Chu letter was not a medical record, it fails to satisfy the requirements of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79 (1990 ed.).
