The department terminated Johnson\u2019s benefits because Johnson\u2019s daughter Anitra was placed in the temporary custody of the Department of Social Services (DSS). That termination was upheld by the hearing officer in the administrative appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>process. Johnson sought review in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1990 ed.). Johnson appeals from the judge\u2019s rulings on the cross-motions for summary judgment. We allowed Johnson\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We conclude that the judgment for the department is to be reversed and judgment is to be entered for Johnson without further hearing except as to the amount due for the lost benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The Federal government, through the AFDC program, wants to encourage \u201cthe care of dependent children in their own homes by enabling each State to furnish financial assistance and rehabilitation and other services, as far as practicable under the conditions in such State, to needy dependent children and the parents or relatives with whom they are living to help maintain and strengthen family life and to help such parents or relatives to attain or retain capability for the maximum self-support and personal independence consistent with the maintenance of continuing parental care and protection.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 601 (1988). We have recognized that the \u201cpurpose of the AFDC program is to enable children, one or both of whose parents are absent or unable to provide support, to continue living at home through the provision of funds for their shelter, food, and other necessary items.\u201d <em>Civetti </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. </em>Welfare, 392 Mass. 474, 477 (1984). One of the requirements for the receipt of AFDC is that the child \u201cmust be living with his or her relative ... in a place of residence maintained by such relative as a home.\u201d 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.230 (A) (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">If the child is temporarily in the care or custody of an agency, the \u201cliving with\u201d requirement will be met if the relative continues to exercise responsibility for the care and control of the child. 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.230 (A) (2) (b) (1986). To verify that the relative does exercise such responsibility, the regulations mandate that the relative submit a copy of the voluntary agreement or court order, the service plan of the agency that details the relative\u2019s responsibility for the care and control of the child and a statement from a worker \u201cdescribing the actual care and control of the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>being exercised\u201d by the relative. 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.230 (B) (2) (1986). The regulation requires that the relative show he or she has substantial involvement in the child\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">We summarize the relevant facts. Johnson is the mother of Anitra Johnson. Anitra is diabetic and must take insulin. She also has emotional problems. When Johnson found she could not control Anitra, she sought the help of the Springfield Juvenile Court. On December 14, 1989, the court found Anitra to be a child in need of services (CHINS) and gave temporary legal and physical custody to DSS, with placement out of the home.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">DSS, Johnson, and Anitra entered into a service plan on December 10, 1989. Johnson, who had been alcohol and drug-involved, contracted to attend Narcotics Anonymous, submit to random urine tests, to \u201c[participate in Anitra\u2019s counseling as deemed appropriate by the therapist, to help re-establish parent-child relationship and communication,\u201d to participate in family counseling and to maintain at least weekly contact with Anitra while Anitra was in placement. The foster parent was to supervise the diabetes management, take Anitra to her medical appointments, and meet with DSS and with Johnson monthly. Anitra\u2019s target return date was March, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Because of her emotional and physical problems, DSS placed Anitra in four different situations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In December, 1990, Johnson, DSS, and Anitra entered another service plan. Again, Johnson was to attend meetings in order to remain drug-free, to participate in Anitra\u2019s counseling as deemed appropriate by the therapist, to attend counseling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>sessions, to meet with the DSS worker at least once a month, and to maintain weekly contact with Anitra. Johnson submitted these service plans to the hearing officer at the administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Prior to Anitra\u2019s removal from her home, Johnson had been receiving AFDC benefits. In October, 1990, the department attempted to terminate these benefits because \u201cthere is no eligible child living with you and you do not meet the special rules to get benefits when your child is temporarily absent from your home.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Johnson appealed her case and a hearing officer conducted a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">At the administrative hearing, Johnson presented testimony and documentary evidence. Johnson stated that DSS had temporary custody. She asserted that she did all the things her first service plan required and that she was a member of Anitra\u2019s counseling and treatment team. She said that when Anitra went to Shepard Hill, a second service plan was signed, with the same goal as the previous one, to strengthen the family unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Johnson participated in Anitra\u2019s counseling and was a member of her counseling team. Johnson worked with DSS to devise treatment and education goals. Johnson met with Anitra\u2019s teachers and with the principal of Anitra\u2019s school\" every month to monitor Anitra\u2019s educational progress and continued to meet one-on-one with the teachers and the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Johnson explained that she provided some clothes and personal items for Anitra, although she did understand that Shepard Hill also would buy some clothes and supply some toiletries. Johnson also said that Anitra came home once a week. On these weekly visits, Johnson would travel by bus to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>meet Anitra in another town and they would travel back home together by bus. Anitra would spend the afternoon, with Johnson responsible for making sure she took her insulin and ate; and then someone from Shepard Hill would pick her up. Johnson stated that Shepard Hill did not think that Anitra was ready for overnight visits, although she occasionally spent the night with her. Johnson stated that she met with the therapists and teachers at Shepard Hill to discuss Anitra\u2019s medical needs. Johnson stated that she maintained a two-bedroom apartment so Anitra would have a room when she came home.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Johnson also submitted a letter from the DSS worker stating that DSS had temporary legal and physical custody of Anitra and noting that the goal of the Johnson service plan was reunification. The letter explained that DSS \u201cdid not seek custody nor was it granted to DSS as a result of an unwillingness or inability of Kathy Johnson to parent her daughter. Anitra\u2019s behavior had become so unmanageable at home, in school and in the community that the court felt this measure was necessary in order to stabilize her.\u201d The worker explained that \u201cJohnson has been actively involved in Anitra\u2019s life and her care all along. She communicates with this office and with the residence on a regular basis regarding her daughter. She attends all meetings that pertain to Anitra and visits with her at least once a week. This has been difficult at times depending on Anitra\u2019s location but it is important to note that while Anitra was placed in Springfield for a period, her mother visited her four to five times a week.\u201d The worker continued, \u201cIt is the opinion of [DSS] that it is essential that . . . Johnson be able to maintain a home for Anitra to return to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The hearing officer allowed the department two weeks within which to present its case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The department did not submit any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>The hearing officer, after examining the service plans and the letter from DSS and hearing Johnson\u2019s testimony, noted that \u201cDSS has not given the appellant any financial responsibility for [Anitra] for purchase of clothing or personal needs.\u201d She found that \u201c[Responsibility for the child\u2019s care and control has been delegated by the DSS, the legal custodian, to the residential placement center. . . . The fact that the DSS has arranged for [Johnson] to attend meetings at [Anitra\u2019s] treatment center and participate in counseling with [Anitra] does not mean that [Johnson] exercises responsibility for the care and control of [Anitra]. It is merely evidence that the DSS is working to reunite the family by persuading [Anitra] to accept [Johnson\u2019s] care and control, and by teaching [Johnson] how to exercise responsibility for care and control.\u201d She concluded that the Johnson case was not one in which \u201ca parent retains responsibility for the day-today care of a child attending school as the regulation contemplates.\u201d The hearing officer concluded that Johnson did not exercise responsibility for the care and control of Anitra. Therefore, she determined that Johnson was not eligible for AFDC benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Johnson sought review in the Superior Court. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The judge said that \u201cthe issue becomes whether [Johnson] exhibits the requisite day-to-day care and control of Anitra.\u201d He noted that \u201c[t]he responsibility and decision making process regarding Anitra\u2019s life . . . does not rest with [Johnson]. The finding of the [hearing officer] is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Johnson argues that the department\u2019s termination of her benefits violated its own regulations because the department required that Johnson demonstrate that she has responsibility for the day-to-day care of Anitra. Johnson asserts that the application of the day-to-day standard was error. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">In 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.230 (A) (1), when the child is physically present in the home, a relative must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>responsible for the day-to-day care of the child in order to meet the \u201cliving with\u201d requirement and thus be eligible for AFDC. This language is missing from the section regarding children in the custody of DSS. That regulation only requires that the relative exercise responsibility for the care and control of the child. Rules of statutory interpretation, relevant to interpreting regulations, suggest that \u201cwhere the Legislature has employed specific language in one paragraph, but not in another, the language should not be implied where it is not present.\u201d <em>Beeler v. Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 616 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">When a child is in the temporary<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> custody of DSS, the regulations require a relative to exercise responsibility for care and control of the child. 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.230 (A) (2) (b). The regulations do not contemplate consideration of a relative\u2019s responsibility for day-to-day care when DSS has temporary custody. Therefore, the hearing officer and the judge erred in requiring Johnson to show that she exercised responsibility for Anitra\u2019s day-to-day care.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The regulation concerning eligibility for AFDC requires that the department look at the DSS service plan and determine what the relative can do to exercise care and control. The department has determined it will implement the policy of strengthening families by continuing AFDC benefits to a relative with a child temporarily absent when the parent exercises responsibility for the care and control of the child. To verify that the relative does exercise responsibility for the care and control of the child, the regulations mandate that the relative submit a copy of the voluntary agreement or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>court order, the service plan of the agency that details the relative\u2019s responsibility for the care and control of the child and a statement from a worker \u201cdescribing the actual care and control of the child being exercised\u201d by the relative. 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.230 (B) (2) (1986). In addition, the department provides its workers with a manual that lists various factors a worker should examine in making a determination about the continuation of benefits. AFDC workers are instructed to look at whether the relative \u201cparticipates in decisions about (1) the child\u2019s schooling, (2) the child\u2019s vacations, and (3) the educational, treatment, service, or health care planning for the child; provides clothing, transportation, school supplies, entertainment or other expenses; maintains a residence or must obtain a separate residence (for example, away from an abusive spouse or other individual) when the return of the child is conditioned on these factors; maintains a bedroom for the child\u2019s visits or return home; spends weekends or vacations with the child; cares for the child during illnesses; maintains close contact with the child; and has the ability to terminate the commitment arrangement with the public or private agency.\u201d Massachusetts AFDC Worker Handbook, at 4030-1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Johnson submitted to the hearing officer the evidence required by the regulations and suggested by the AFDC Worker Handbook. From the record before us, Johnson may have exercised all responsibility for care and control of Anitra that she could have under the DSS service plan. Johnson recognized that Anitra needed help and requested it from the Juvenile Court through the CHINS petition. The DSS worker stated that Anitra was difficult to manage and that, as a result, DSS had to move her to a series of placements. When Anitra resided in placements close to Johnson, Johnson generally visited her five times a week. Johnson continued to spend as much time as possible with Anitra when DSS moved her to Shepard Hill, given the distance between Johnson\u2019s home and the residence. Johnson did everything possible to regain custody of Anitra, including remaining drug- and alcohol-free for a substantial time. Johnson paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>for the two-bedroom apartment on a reduced income, paid transportation costs, bought what personal items and clothes she could, and supervised Anitra on her visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Johnson submitted documentation indicating that she was a member of Anitra\u2019s treatment and counseling team. She did not miss any meetings. Johnson also worked with Anitra\u2019s therapists, counselors, and teachers at Shepard Hill. Johnson met Anitra\u2019s teachers and principal once a month to make sure Anitra was meeting her educational goals. Johnson remained familiar with every aspect of Anitra\u2019s life. The DSS worker wrote that Johnson was actively involved in Anitra\u2019s life, communicated regularly with DSS, and attended all meetings that pertained to Anitra. In <em>Civetti </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>392 Mass. 474, 491 (1984), we concluded that \u201cit would be wholly antithetical to the objectives of the AFDC program to deprive the plaintiff of benefits intended in large part to keep families together by making the costs of sheltering children affordable.\u201d We said that the plaintiff was entitled to continued AFDC benefits when \u201cthe children visited the plaintiff [Furtado] on vacations and holidays but were not permitted to stay in the plaintiff\u2019s home overnight.... Although the DPW [the predecessor of DSS] assumed school expenses, the plaintiff paid, in connection with the children\u2019s visits, expenses relating to food, clothing, entertainment, school books and transportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Johnson asserts that the hearing officer erred in determining she did not exercise responsibility for the care and control of Anitra. The goal of the AFDC program is \u201cto enable children, one or both of whose parents are absent or unable to provide support, to continue living at home through the provision of funds for their shelter, food, and other necessary items.\u201d <em>Civetti </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, supra </em>at 477. There was substantial evidence to conclude that Johnson exercised the maximum responsibility for the care and control of Anitra the DSS service plans permitted. The evidence showed that Johnson had a substantial degree of involvement in Anitra\u2019s life sufficient to satisfy the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>An administrative agency\u2019s determination may be set aside if the evidence \u201cpoints to an overwhelming probability of the contrary.\u201d <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 466 (1981). In addition, \u201c \u2018evidence of a party having the burden of proof may not be disbelieved without an explicit and objectively adequate reason.\u2019 L.L. Jaffe, [Judicial Control of Administrative Action] 607 [1965]. \u2018If the proponent has presented the best available evidence, which is logically adequate, and is neither contradicted nor improbable, it must be credited . . . .\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 608.\u201d <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, supra </em>at 470-471.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The summary judgment for the department is reversed. Judgment is to be entered for Johnson on her motion for summary judgment and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for a determination as to the amounts due for the loss of benefits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\">A copy of the order was not included in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-9\">In the record before us, a letter written January 4, 1991, from DSS to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney listed Anitra\u2019s placements:</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">\u201c12/14/89-1/17/89: DSS approved foster home where foster parent also diabetic.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">01/19/90-03/02/90: Temporary residential placement with twenty-four hour staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">03/02-90-06/22/90: Adolescent Assessment Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">06/22/90-present: Shepard Hill Residence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b591-9\">The department already had actually terminated Johnson\u2019s benefits under AFDC and had certified her for Family Reunification Benefits (FRB).
