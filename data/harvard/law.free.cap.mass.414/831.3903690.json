Bauerband applied for a loan from Minster purportedly for himself and his wife. The loan officer knew both Bauerband and his wife. Minster mailed loan doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>uments to Bauerband in Massachusetts, including a promissory note to be executed by Bauerband and his wife. Bauer-band forged his wife\u2019s name on these documents. The signed note acknowledged falsely that Michelle had received a copy of the note. On return of these documents, Minster issued a bank customer\u2019s check payable to the order of both Bauer-band and his wife and mailed it to their home in Massachusetts. Bauerband endorsed the check for himself, forged his wife\u2019s name on the check, and deposited the check into a business account which he maintained at BayBank Middle-sex (BayBank). Bauerband\u2019s wife had no knowledge of the loan transaction, the note, or the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Minster claims that BayBank violated the warranty provisions of G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 4-207 (2) <em>(b) </em>(1990 ed.). In response, BayBank urges that Bauerband was an impostor which exculpates BayBank under the provisions of G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-405 (1) (1990 ed.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Apart from the \u201cimpostor\u201d statute, in the face of Bauerband\u2019s forgery of his wife\u2019s name on the check, BayBank would be liable for warranting to Minster that \u201call signatures are genuine or authorized\u201d under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 4-207 (2) <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The trial judge ruled on a motion for summary judgment that Bauerband was an impostor and ordered judgment for BayBank. Minster requested a report to the Appellate Division of the District Court Department which affirmed the judge\u2019s ruling and dismissed the report. Minster appealed and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">The narrow issue in this case is whether the forged endorsement by Bauerband of his wife\u2019s name makes him an impostor within the sweep of G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-405. He may be an impostor whether he acts face to face, by mail, or \u201cotherwise.\u201d We do not get much help from the Uniform Commercial Code as to the meaning of \u201cimpostor\u201d in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>commercial law context except that the official comment on \u00a7 3-405 (1) provides that \u201c[i]mpostor\u201d refers to \u201cimpersonation.\u201d 2A U.L.A. 77, official comment 2 (Master ed. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">We have not previously considered this question of who qualifies as an impostor<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and there is precious little case law under the Uniform Commercial Code to help us. \u201c[Questions about who is and who is not an \u2018impostor\u2019 remain unanswered.\u201d J.J. White &amp; R.S. Summers, 1 Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 16-4, at 796 (3d ed. 1988). What cases exist fall on both sides of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Two New York opinions support the proposition that an impostor was involved in the case before us. See <em>Franklin Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Shapiro, </em>7 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. (Callaghan) 317, 320-321 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1970) (depository bank not liable to drawer bank when wife procured loans by mail on the purported signature of herself and her husband); <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. </em>v. <em>Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., </em>63 Misc. 2d 960, 964 (N.Y. Civ. Ct. 1970) (husband who presented withdrawal orders with wife\u2019s forged signature on them was impostor).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Cases to the contrary are not particularly persuasive for our purposes. Where a person purporting to obtain an automobile loan presented forged documents from an automobile dealer to the lender, courts have rejected the impostor rule as to an instrument payable to the person and the dealer and have treated the matter as simply invoking misrepresentations. See <em>Valley Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Zions First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>656 P.2d 425, 427 (Utah 1982); <em>East Gadsden Bank </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>v. <em>First City Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>50 Ala. App. 576, 581 (1973).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Broward Bank </em>v. <em>Commercial Bank, </em>547 So. 2d 687, 689 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1989) (two-to-one decision), the facts are substantively the same as in our case, and the court held that the husband was not an impostor. In reaching this conclusion, the court erroneously stated that to rule otherwise would mean that \u201cvirtually every forgery would also constitute an \u2018impersonation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The impersonation by forgery that is crucial to the impostor defense under \u00a7 3-405 (1) is one that is made to the drawer bank that issued the check and not any impersonation inherent in the forged endorsement presented to the collecting bank. See <em>id. </em>at 689, 690 (Letts, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">We obtain no insight from the law prior to the adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code. Section 3-405 (1) <em>(a) </em>\u201chas no correlative section in the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law but does represent, to some extent, case law developed prior to the drafting of the Code.\u201d 2 Bender\u2019s U.C.C. Service, Commercial Paper \u00a7 3.08[2], at 3-48 (1993). But \u00a7 3-405 (1) rejected pre-Code cases that distinguished between face-to-face impersonation and those accomplished by mail or over the telephone. See 2A U.L.A. 77, official comment 2 (Master ed. 1991); 2 Bender\u2019s U.C.C. Service, <em>supra </em>at 3-50. Nor is there some apparent legislative purpose that can guide us effectively to an answer as to whether there was an impersonation by mail in this case. Proof of estoppel and relative negligence play no role in the application of \u00a7 3-405 (1) <em>(a). </em>If there was an impostor, equitable considerations are irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The only inquiry is whether Bauerband, as an impostor, by the use of the mails or otherwise induced Minster to issue the check to him in the name of the payees. By his conduct in signing his wife\u2019s name to the promissory note and submitting it to Minster, he was holding himself out as Michelle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>Bauerband in writing. In acknowledging that she will pay the note and that she had received a copy of it, Bauerband was purporting to be Michelle when he forged her name and sent the note to Minster. He was impersonating her, not in the literal \u201cin person\u201d sense, but \u201cby use of the mails or otherwise,\u201d as stated in \u00a7 3-405 (1) (a). In signing Michelle\u2019s name to the note, Bauerband implicitly was indicating that he was Michelle. The fact that Bauerband also signed the note on his own behalf does not make him any less an impostor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, we affirm the order of the Appellate Division dismissing the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-8\">General Laws c. 106, \u00a7 3-405 (1990 ed.), in material part reads as follows: \u201c(1) An indorsement by any person in the name of a named payee is effective if (a) an imposter by use of the mails or otherwise has induced the maker or drawer to issue the instrument to him or his confederate in the name of the payee . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b849-8\">The passing reference to \u00a7 3-405 (1) (a) in <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>361 Mass. 258, 261 (1972), is not informative for our purposes.

BayBank Middlesex (Bay-Bank) accepted Minster State Bank\u2019s cashier\u2019s check for deposit and collection and transferred it to Minster, which paid it. Minster seeks repayment from BayBank on the ground that BayBank warranted to Minster that the payees\u2019 endorsements were genuine. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 4-207 (2) <em>(b) </em>(1990 ed.). Minster is entitled to recover unless Bauerband was an \u201cimpostor\u201d who, by the use of mails or otherwise, induced Minster to issue the check to him payable to him and Michelle. G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-405 (1990 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Clearly, as the court\u2019s recitation of the relevant facts shows, Bauerband by fraud induced Minster to issue the check to him payable to himself and Michelle. However, in my view, it is equally clear that Bauerband was not an impostor, by the use of mail or otherwise, and therefore Minster is entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">A District Court judge granted summary judgment to BayBank aft.er concluding that Bauerband was an impostor by reason of his \u201cimpersonation of himself as Michelle\u2019s agent.\u201d The Appellate Division of the District Court Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>ment dismissed the report and affirmed the judgment but rejected the judge\u2019s reasoning, concluding instead that Bauer-band had \u201cimpersonated his wife\u2019s participation in the transaction with Minster at every relevant stage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">It is clear from the record that, although Bauerband perpetrated a fraud on Minster, he did not do so as an impostor. An impostor is \u201c[o]ne who pretends to be somebody other than who he is, with intent to deceive . . . .\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 756 (6th ed. 1990). An impostor speaks by act or word and he speaks about himself. He may speak by mail or otherwise, but he must speak to someone other than himself, he must speak in the present tense, and he must say that he is someone who in fact he is not. For a person to be an impostor by mail, he must state explicitly or implicitly in the mailed material that he is someone else. At no time, by mail or otherwise, did Bauerband explicitly or implicitly tell Minster that he was Michelle.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">It is unclear whether the court has concluded that Bauer-band impersonated Michelle when he signed her name to the note, or only when he sent the signed note to the bank. Surely, if Bauerband had destroyed the note immediately after signing Michelle\u2019s name to it, it could not reasonably be said that he had impersonated Michelle. Without communication there can be no impersonation. It may well be that, if Minster had sent the unsigned note to Michelle and the note had called for execution by Michelle alone, which was not the case, and Bauerband had forged her signature and returned the note to Minster without a covering letter, or with a letter purporting to have been sent by Michelle, impersonation would have occurred. Impersonation would have occurred in those circumstances because the mailing would have falsely represented that Michelle, not Bauerband, was the correspondent. However, the note in this case required execution by Bauerband and Michelle and it was not sent to Michelle alone. Thus, regardless of whether, when Bauer-band returned the note, he did so without a covering letter to which he signed his name, a matter about which the record is silent, the mailing did not imply that Michelle was the corre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>spondent. Bauerband implied that Michelle had signed the note, and that was a lie, but he did not act as an impostor because he did not at any time represent to Minster that he was someone other than the person he was. Respectfully, to say as the Appellate Division said, that Bauerband impersonated \u201chis wife\u2019s participation\u201d is a misuse of the term \u201cimpersonated.\u201d A person can only impersonate another person; he cannot \u201cimpersonate\u201d an activity. Bauerband \u201cmisrepresented\u201d his wife\u2019s participation. He did not \u201cimpersonate\u201d it, and he did not impersonate her.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The court cites with apparent approval two New York trial court opinions as supporting the court\u2019s result. The court rejects the contrary decisions of appellate courts in other jurisdictions as \u201cnot particularly persuasive for our purposes.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 833. In my view, those cases are not fairly distinguishable from the present case and they ought not be so lightly dismissed. They were rightly decided. They are in accord both with sound logic and with the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s dictum in <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>361 Mass. 258 (1972). In that case, the court dismissed, as unworthy of discussion, the thought that a man acted as an impostor within G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-405 (1) <em>(a), </em>when he induced a lender to issue a check by misrepresenting to the lender that the man\u2019s wife had signed the note when in fact, as in this case, the man had forged his wife\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">If the Legislature had intended that a forgery that induces a check\u2019s issuance should result in the risk of loss being placed on the drawer rather than on collecting banks, it could easily have so provided in the statute. Instead, the Legislature chose to place the risk on the drawer only when the drawer was induced to issue the check by fraud in the form of impersonation. Reasonable persons might differ as to whether, in the absence of a controlling statute, the loss in a case such as the one on review should fall on the drawer, which issued a check in reliance on documents with forged signatures, or instead should fall on the collecting bank which accepted a check with a forged endorsement. However, the Legislature has spoken, placing the loss on the col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>lecting bank, and the court is obliged to apply the statute as enacted. I would reverse the order of the Appellate Division dismissing the report, and I would remand the case for the entry of judgment for Minster State Bank.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
