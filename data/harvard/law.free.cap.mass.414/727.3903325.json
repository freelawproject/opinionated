(Bay State), appeals from a declaration that the proceeds the plaintiff, Eleanor Meyers, received from her underinsurance coverage, see G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (1990 ed.), were not subject to the statutory lien provided to health maintenance organizations by G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70A (1990 ed.). The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>wrote a comprehensive memorandum of decision and declared that Meyers\u2019s underinsurance benefits were not subject to the statutory lien. We allowed Bay State\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We affirm the decision of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Meyers brought an action for declaratory relief, seeking a declaration that her underinsurance benefits were not subject to the lien provided by G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70A. Bay State counterclaimed, asking for satisfaction of its lien for all the costs it incurred in treating Meyers\u2019s injuries. The Superior Court judge allowed the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and entered a declaration in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">We set forth the facts from the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision: \u201cBay State is a non-profit Massachusetts corporation that operates a health maintenance organization (HMO). At all material times, Meyers was enrolled in Bay State\u2019s health care plan and entitled to receive health care services pursuant to the plan\u2019s terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">\u201cOn January 2, 1988, while crossing Ocean Avenue in Marblehead, Massachusetts on foot, Meyers was struck by a motor vehicle driven by Julianne C. Wells (Wells). Meyers sustained serious injuries as a result of the accident, and Bay State furnished health services to treat these injuries. On September 19, 1988, Bay State asserted and perfected an HMO lien pursuant to G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 70A and 70B in the amount of $141,202.31 for health services furnished to Meyers as a result of the accident. Bay State twice updated its lien. Bay State\u2019s total statutory lien is now in the amount of $158,051.83.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">\u201cMeyers settled her tort claim against Wells for $25,000, which was the policy limit of Wells\u2019 automobile liability insurance with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company. In addition, Meyers was a named insured under two automobile insurance policies issued by Continental Casualty Company (CNA) to Meyers and to her husband, Marvin Meyers; each policy provided uninsured/underinsured benefits with a limit of $250,000 per person and $500,000 per accident. Meyers has settled her underinsurance claims with CNA. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>amount of $380,813.04 has already been paid pursuant to the above executed settlements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Meyers\u2019 counsel have been fully paid for their services in connection with the above settlements. In a separate action, Meyers seeks recovery under a $2 million personal umbrella policy with Peerless Insurance Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The statute at issue is G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically at issue is whether the word \u201cdamages\u201d in \u00a7 70A included underinsurance benefits within the scope of the lien. Bay State argues that the benefits Meyers received from her underinsurance coverage should be subject to the statutory lien. Bay State claims that underinsurance benefits are meant to provide the money that the tortfeasor cannot pay.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, Bay State asserts that these benefits should be treated in the same manner as the damages paid by the tortfeasor. In response, Meyers argues that the payments she received from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>her underinsurance coverage were not legal liabilities but were contractual obligations, for which she paid premiums. As such, she claims they are not damages and consequently are not subject to the lien. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">We have defined damages as \u201cthe money payable by a tortfeasor who is liable for injuries caused by his tortious act.\u201d <em>Wincek </em>v. <em>West Springfield, </em>399 Mass. 700, 702 (1987). In <em>Wincek, </em>the plaintiff was a police officer of the defendant town. While performing his duties, he was struck by an automobile and injured. He collected benefits pursuant to privately purchased underinsurance policies. The town claimed that, under the subrogation statute, G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F (1984 ed.), it was entitled to the proceeds of the underinsurance policies \u201cto the extent that it has or will pay compensation to the plaintiff as required by G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Wincek </em>v. <em>West Springfield, supra </em>at 702. We said that the benefits were not payable to the town because \u201c[t]he statute only subrogates the town to the employee\u2019s rights against the tortfeasor to the extent of the compensation the officer receives from the tortfeasor. \u2018A payment made in performance of a contractual obligation is not a payment of \u2018damages.\u2019 <em>State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Am. Ins. Co., </em>550 S.W.2d 554, 557 (Ky. 1977).\u201d <em>Wincek </em>v. <em>West Springfield, supra </em>at 702-703.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Bay State argues that <em>Wincek </em>is not applicable because the language in G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF, the subrogation stat\u00fcte, differs from that in G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70A, the lien statute. Bay State claims that, in <em>Wincek, </em>we defined damages as we did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>because we determined that the word damages was a limiting word, qualifying the statutory language regarding a \u201clegal liability.\u201d <em>Wincek </em>did not so limit its discussion of damages. In that opinion we said that benefits resulting from underinsurance policies were not damages. While we agree that definitions are not static and that each word should be interpreted in relation to the general statutory scheme, there is no basis on this record for us to depart from the meaning given the word \u201cdamages\u201d in <em>Wincek.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Bay State also argues that the purpose of the subrogation statute in issue in <em>Wincek </em>differs from that of the lien statute. Bay State claims that the purpose of that statute is to \u201ccompensate police and firefighters who are injured on the job.\u201d <em>Wincek </em>v. <em>West Springfield, supra </em>at 704 n.3. Bay State claims that the purpose of the lien statute is to \u201creduce the cost of health care by permitting HMOs and others to recover the cost of treating injuries.\u201d We accept Bay State\u2019s premise that the purposes of the two statutes are not identical. Nevertheless, we cannot conclude that the underinsurance payments were damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The payments were not made as payment due from a tortfeasor. Meyers contracted with the insurance companies to pay her benefits in the event she was injured by an underinsured motorist. The benefits were paid as a result of that contractual obligation. The judge correctly declared that the benefits received from an underinsurance policy were not subject to a lien pursuant to G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70A.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-6\">According to the judge, \u201c$149,990.00 has been placed in escrow pending the outcome of this action. (The escrow arrangement apparently preceded the latest update of Bay State\u2019s lien.)\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b745-7\">In relevant part, G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70A (1990 ed.), provides that \u201c[a]ny person and any city or town maintaining a hospital licensed under the provisions of [\u00a7 51], . . . which furnished medical or other services to any person injured in an accident not covered by the workmen\u2019s compensation act shall, subject to the provisions of [\u00a7 70B], have a lien for the reasonable and necessary charges of such hospital, . . . and any health maintenance organization which has furnished health services, . . . shall, subject to the provisions of [\u00a7 70B], have a lien for such benefits, upon the net amount payable to such injured person, his heirs or legal representative out of the total amount of any recovery or sum had or collected or to be collected, whether by judgment or by settlement or compromise, from another person as damages on account of such injuries. The lien of any attorney shall have precedence over the lien created under this section. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any such charges incurred subsequent to any such judgment, settlement or compromise.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b745-13\">Bay State asserts that the courts of Massachusetts categorize the compensation from underinsurance coverage as damages. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 617 (1991). That case, however, determined that an agreement between the injured individual and the insurer of the tortfeasor fixed the amount of damages of the injured individual. <em>Id. </em>at 620-621. It did not rule that benefits resulting from an underinsurance policy were damages. Instead, the Appeals Court held that the injured individual was not entitled to underinsurance benefits where the damages did not exceed the limits on the tortfeasor\u2019s policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The pertinent part of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF (1984 ed.), and <em>Wincek </em>v. <em>West Springfield, supra </em>at 700 n.1, reads: \u201cWhere the injury causing the incapacity of a . . . police officer for which he is granted a leave without loss of pay and is paid compensation in accordance with the provisions of this section, was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person to pay damages in respect thereof, either the person so injured or the . . . town . . . may proceed to enforce the liability of such person in any court of competent jurisdiction. The sum recovered shall be for the benefit of the . . . town . . . paying such compensation, unless the sum is greater than the compensation paid to the person so injured, in which event the excess shall be retained by or paid to the person so injured.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b747-7\">After our decision in <em>Wincek, </em>the Legislature amended G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF, first par. We note that the Legislature did not amend the second paragraph, which concerns the issue of damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
