Walsh and Bernard J. Doherty as partners in a real estate partnership (Brandon Group) and a loan agreement between the Brandon Group and Chestnut Hill Bank and Trust Company (bank). The complaint against the bank included, among other claims, claims for fraud and deceit and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Walsh appeals from the judge\u2019s denial of her motion to amend her complaint to include a claim under G. L. c. 93A (1990 ed.) against the bank. She also asserts that the bank should be required to rescind the loan agreement. Doherty appeals from the denial of his motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial. We transferred the case on our own motion. We affirm the judge\u2019s denial of the motion to amend, his denial of Walsh\u2019s request that he grant rescission of the contract, and the relief granted. We affirm the judge\u2019s denial of Doherty\u2019s motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">1. <em>We summarize the relevant facts in Walsh\u2019s appeal. </em>Walsh and Doherty agreed in 1985 to form a partnership, the Brandon Group, to conduct real estate business in Charlestown. As part of their business, they approached the bank in order to negotiate a $400,000 line of credit. Pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement, the bank took mortgages on property that Doherty owned in Lincoln, New Hampshire, and property that Walsh owned in Newport, Rhode Island. The bank notified Walsh by letter that it had first mortgages on the property in Lincoln, New Hampshire. Sometime after that, but before the loan agreement was signed, the bank became aware that its mortgage on one parcel of the New Hampshire property was a second mortgage, not a first mortgage. The bank did not inform Walsh that its mortgage on this parcel was a second mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Walsh sued the bank alleging a variety of claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>supra. </em>The day before trial was scheduled to begin, she moved for leave to amend her complaint in order to allege a violation of G. L. c. 93A. The judge reserved the c. 93A claims. The remainder of the case was tried to a jury who answered special questions. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 49 (a), 365 Mass. 812 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">With respect to the case between Walsh and the bank, the jury found that (1) the bank violated its covenant of good faith and fair dealing with Walsh; (2) the bank did not intentionally make false representations of material fact to Walsh on which she relied to her detriment; (3) the bank did negligently make false representations of material fact to Walsh on which she reasonably relied to her detriment; and (4) Walsh did not bring her claim against the bank for the purpose of obtaining an advantage or concession with respect to her obligations under the loan agreement. After hearing the answers to the special questions, Walsh requested that the judge cancel or rescind the loan agreement. She did not offer to repay the money or any portion of the money that the Brandon Group had received under the loan agreement with the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">In his memorandum of decision and orders, the judge ruled on the plaintiff\u2019s motion for leave to amend the complaint to include a count against the bank for violation of G. L. c. 93A. The judge found, \u201cDespite the latitude and leniency counseled by [Mass. R. Civ. P. 15 (a)] the request to further amend the already prolix complaint came too late.\u201d In addition, the judge found that the bank\u2019s \u201cconduct in the transaction was neither unfair or deceitful.\u201d Conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>quently, the judge denied Walsh\u2019s request to amend her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The judge considered Walsh\u2019s request that the loan agreement either be cancelled or rescinded. The judge determined that rescission was not appropriate given the particular facts, circumstances, and equities of the case. The judge did rule that the bank \u201cbe required to proceed against collateral put up by . . . Doherty in the event of a foreclosure of the security before it proceeds against the collateral put up by\u201d Walsh.</p>\n<p id=\"As5\">a. <em>The motion for leave to amend</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Castellucci </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>372 Mass. 288, 292 (1977), we said that \u201c[a] liberal amendment policy does not justify overriding the rights of a person who would be prejudiced by the last minute allowance of a motion to amend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Walsh notes that the G. L. c. 93A theory of liability rose from the same set of facts as the other theories in her complaint and that the allowance of the amendment would not have prejudiced the bank. Walsh had already amended her complaint once, to add a count under G. L. c. 93A against the other defendant, Doherty. She was aware of the facts of her case and the possibility that those facts might support a c. 93A claim against the bank. She moved for leave to amend more than eighteen months after she had filed her original complaint and the motion came on the eve of the scheduled first day of trial. Walsh unreasonably delayed amending her complaint. A \u201cplaintiff\u2019s undue delay in pressing these claims justifies the judge\u2019s refusal to allow the amendment.\u201d <em>United States Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>402 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Mass. 228, 233 (1988), citing <em>Castellucci </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., supra </em>at 289-292. See <em>Hamed </em>v. <em>Fadili, </em>408 Mass. 100, 106 (1990); <em>Barbosa </em>v. <em>Hopper Feeds, Inc., </em>404 Mass. 610, 621-622 (1989). \u201cWhile \u2018undue delay\u2019 may justify a denial [of a motion to amend], [we] usually require [ ] some factor other than delay, such as the imminence of trial or the plaintiffs attempting to introduce a totally new theory of liability.\u201d <em>Goulet </em>v. <em>Whitin Mach. Works, Inc., </em>399 Mass. 547, 552 (1987). There is an additional element here because Walsh moved to amend on the day before the scheduled first day of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">More importantly, however, the record reveals that the judge, in substance, did rule on Walsh\u2019s c. 93A claim. Before denying the motion, the judge heard the evidence. After the trial and after receiving the jury\u2019s responses to the special questions, the judge determined that \u201cthe Bank\u2019s conduct in the transaction was neither unfair or deceitful\u201d and then denied Walsh\u2019s motion to amend. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">We may not set aside a fact finder\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>First Pa. Mortgage Trust </em>v. <em>Dorchester Sav. Bank, </em>395 Mass. 614, 621 (1985). See Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We must be definitely and firmly convinced that the fact finder made a mistake before we will reject its determinations. <em>First Pa. Mortgage Trust, supra </em>at 621.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Walsh argues that, because the jury found that the bank had made negligent misrepresentations, the judge\u2019s determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>nation that the bank did not engage in any unfair or deceitful acts or practices was clearly erroneous. We do not agree. \u201c[N]ot every negligent act is unfair or deceptive and thus unlawful under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2.\u201d <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Bankers Life Co., </em>389 Mass. 345, 349 (1983). The judge determined that the acts were not unfair or deceptive. Walsh was not entitled to have this issue decided by a jury. \u201c[T]he equitable nature of the relief permitted [under c. 93A] . . . leads us to conclude that there is no right to a trial by jury for actions cognizable under G. L. c. 93A.\u201d <em>Nei </em>v. <em>Burley, </em>388 Mass. 307, 315 (1983). There was no error in his denial of Walsh\u2019s motion for leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">b. <em>The request for rescission. </em>Walsh suggests that the judge should have granted rescission of the loan agreement. She relies on Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 551 and comment h (1977).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u201c[A] false, though innocent, representation which concerns a matter susceptible of knowledge . . . may afford the basis of rescission.\u201d <em>Bellefeuille </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>335 Mass. 262, 265 (1957). Ordinarily, a party requesting rescission must \u201crestore or offer to restore all that he received\u201d through the contract, although it \u201chas been held that, where complete restoration is not possible, rescission may, nevertheless, be granted upon such equitable conditions as would amply protect the rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266. Both parties cite numerous cases from within and without the jurisdiction on whether this remedy requires that the party requesting re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>scission \u201crestore or offer to restore\u201d all or a portion of what she has received.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Walsh may not have entered into the loan agreement had she known that the mortgage on Doherty\u2019s property was not a first mortgage. She did, however, sign the loan agreement. As a principal in the partnership, she did receive a benefit of almost $400,000 from the loan agreement. She has not offered to return it or any portion of it. The jury determined that the bank was negligent, not wilful. In such circumstances, there was no error in not granting rescission of the loan agreement. <em>Bellefeuille </em>v. <em>Medeiros, supra </em>at 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">c. <em>The relief granted Walsh against the bank. </em>Walsh claimed that the bank represented to her that the mortgages on Doherty\u2019s property were in excess of the amount of the line of credit and that it would proceed against Doherty first. The jury did not receive a special question concerning the making of such a representation. Under Mass. R. Civ. P. 49 (a), 365 Mass. 812 (1974), when a question of fact is omitted from the questions submitted to the jury, \u201ceach party waives his right to a trial by jury of the issue so omitted unless before the jury retires he demands its submission to the jury.\u201d Neither party demanded the question of this alleged misrepresentation be submitted to the jury so both have waived a jury trial with regard to it. Rule 49 (a) continues: \u201cAs to an issue omitted without such demand the court may make a finding; or, if it fails to do so, it shall be deemed to have made a finding in accord with the judgment on the special verdict.\u201d See <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., KG, </em>399 Mass. 790, 800-802 (1987), for a discussion of the procedure under rule 49 (a). The jury concluded the bank was negligent. The judge appears to have considered the determination of the jury. When granting relief, the judge ordered that the bank proceed against Doherty\u2019s property first. The bank has not appealed from that ruling. \u201c[Fjailure to take a cross appeal precludes a party from obtaining a judgment more favorable to it than the judgment entered below.\u201d <em>Boston </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>374 Mass. 37, 43 n.5 (1977).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">2. <em>Doherty\u2019s appeal, </em>a. 77ze <em>denial of his motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. </em>Walsh sued Doherty alleging among other things breach of contract, fraud, deceit, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The jury found that (1) Doherty violated the partnership agreement with Walsh; (2) under the partnership agreement, each partner was responsible for 50 % of the losses; (3) Doherty violated his fiduciary duty to Walsh; and (4) Doherty did not intentionally make false representations of material fact to Walsh on which she reasonably relied to her detriment. The jury awarded monetary damages for the breach of the partnership agreement but no damages for the breach of fiduciary duty. Doherty appeals from the denial of his motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The standard for reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is \u201cwhether \u2018anywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\u2019 <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978), quoting <em>Raunela </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>361 Mass. 341, 343 (1972).\u201d <em>Dobos </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>404 Mass. 634, 656, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Kehoe </em>v. <em>Dobos, </em>493 U.S. 850 (1989). We therefore summarize the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In December, 1985, Walsh and Doherty formed a partnership to buy real estate in Charlestown. A partnership agreement, drafted in September, 1986, specified that 75% of the profits would be assigned to Walsh and 25 % would belong to Doherty. There was evidence that Walsh and Doherty also agreed that both parties would contribute to capital on an equal basis; that both parties would share the partnership expenses equally; and that the partnership\u2019s losses would be split evenly between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The partnership bought three properties in 1986; one of the properties was sold the same year. The partnership held onto the other two. Walsh contributed over $229,000 to capital while Doherty had contributed only $5,000, despite Walsh\u2019s repeated demands that he contribute more. Without more capital, Walsh was unable to meet the expenses of the partnership and the two remaining properties were foreclosed on by another bank. Doherty purchased these properties at the foreclosure sale for prices below the market values.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Doherty argues that Walsh presented no evidence to show that his breach of the agreement to make equal contributions to the capital of the partnership caused either the partnership\u2019s or Walsh\u2019s losses. He uses the testimony of Walsh\u2019s accountant and expert, James E. Feeney, to show that the partnership would have sustained losses even if Doherty had contributed capital. Doherty asserts that the evidence did not establish that the damage caused by the foreclosures on the property the partnership owned was not a result of the decline in the real estate market or of Walsh\u2019s failure to pay the mortgages on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Walsh argues that the expert\u2019s testimony provided evidence from which the jury could have concluded that she had been damaged by Doherty\u2019s breach of the agreement. She asserts that, had Doherty made capital contributions, her effective capital return would have been $118,467. Instead, her capital account balance is a negative $158,830. Walsh states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>that the jury was entitled to believe her expert\u2019s testimony about her damage.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Given the expert\u2019s testimony, we cannot say that there was no evidence on which a jury could have premised liability. There was no error in the denial of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">b. <em>The motion for new trial. </em>The jury\u2019s answer to the special question stated that it awarded Walsh \u201c[$234,425]. The award is [Walsh\u2019s] capital contributions, from 1986 to 1989 to the Brandon Group.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Doherty argues that the jury\u2019s damage award operated as a rescission. He asserts that the judge should have granted his motion for a new trial on the damages issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\u201cIt is settled that it \u2018is only in an extraordinary case revealing an abuse of judicial power, or an excess of jurisdiction or similar error, that the action of the trial court upon a motion for a new trial can be reversed,\u2019 <em>Berggren </em>v. <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>231 Mass. 173, 176 [1918].\u201d <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>320 Mass. 315, 316 (1946). In addition, we have stated that motions for a new trial on the theory that the damages were inadequate or excessive \u201cought not to be granted unless on a survey of the whole case it appears to the judicial conscience and judgment that otherwise a miscarriage of justice will result.\u201d <em>Bartley </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>317 Mass. 35, 41 (1944), quoting <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>235 Mass. 482, 496 (1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Doherty argues that the jury\u2019s award to Walsh was inconsistent with her theory of the case and that, having sued on the contract, she was not legally entitled to rescission. Nonetheless, the jury was entitled to credit Feeney\u2019s testimony that Doherty\u2019s breach damaged Walsh in the amount of $277,297. The jury awarded a lesser amount. There was no error in denying the motion for new trial based on the damages awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Doherty also asserts that the judge erred in denying his motion for new trial on the ground that the jury\u2019s verdict with respect to the allocation of losses under the partnership agreement was against the weight of the evidence. The partnership agreement stated that the profits would be divided so that 75% went to Walsh and 25% went to Doherty but said nothing about the division of losses. Doherty claims that the Uniform Partnership Act, as adopted in Massachusetts, G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 18 (a), requires that, where the partnership agreement is silent as to the division of, losses, losses are divided in the same way as profits.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Walsh states that the partners had agreed orally to a certain allocation of the losses, and that allocation was 50% to Walsh and 50% to Doherty. As Walsh notes, \u00a7 18 <em>(a) </em>of the Uniform Partnership Act controls when there is no agreement. Walsh asserts there was an agreement. She presented the testimony of the lawyer who drew up the agreement, her accountant and a bookkeeper. She also testified to the 50/50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>split of losses herself. The record supports the judge\u2019s denial of Doherty\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\">In her request for relief in connection with her allegation of conspiracy to defraud against both the bank and Doherty, Walsh did ask that the defendants pay her the resultant damages as well as interest and attorney\u2019s fees. The docket sheet reveals that the conspiracy count was dismissed. Walsh has not argued error in the dismissal of that count. Therefore, error, if any, is deemed waived. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975); <em>Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. Guirola, 410 Mass. 820, 827 n.9 (1991).

Walsh claims that the negligent misrepresentation induced her to enter into the loan agreement and to continue to draw on the line of credit, thereby increasing her exposure to the bank. Walsh claims the increased exposure is her damage. The bank argues that it has neither foreclosed on the collateral Walsh pledged as security nor altered the terms of the loan agreement. Only the properties the Brandon Group purchased have been foreclosed by another bank.
