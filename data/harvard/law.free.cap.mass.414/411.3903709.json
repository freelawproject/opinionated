Wholesalers), </em>we considered whether G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 323 (g), of the so-called \u201cbottle bill,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as originally enacted, required bottlers and distributors to hold \u201cdeposits and/or handling charges\u201d created by the law in trust for consumers and, with respect to unclaimed deposits, for the Commonwealth by application of principles of abandoned property law. <em>Mass. Wholesalers, supra </em>at 342.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We held that the unclaimed \u201cdeposits\u201d belonged to the bottlers and distributors. <em>Id. </em>at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">In 1989, the Legislature amended G. L. c. 94, \u00a7\u00a7 321-327, by St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7\u00a7 68-72, 235-237 (amendment), adding a number of sections to the bottle bill. A new provision, G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 323 <em>{h) </em>(1990 ed.), required bottlers and distributors to maintain, as of January 1, 1990, a \u201cseparate account to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>known as the Deposit Transaction Fund . . . [which] shall be kept separate from all other revenues and accounts. Each bottler or distributor shall place in said fund the refund value for all non-reusable beverage containers it sells . . . .\u201d Amounts in the fund may only be expended to pay refund values for returned nonreusable beverage containers, and \u201cshall not be used to pay the handling fees required by [\u00a7 323 (c)-(e)].\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the fund shall be maintained \u201con behalf of consumers who have purchased refundable non-reusable beverage containers and on behalf of the commonwealth; ... for no purposes are amounts in such fund to be regarded as income of said bottlers or distributors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The bottler or distributor may, however, transfer to its own account any interest earned on the fund. G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 323C.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">By the tenth of every month, bottlers or distributors must turn over to the Commissioner of Revenue all \u201cabandoned deposit amounts\u201d in the fund.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> G. L. c. 94, \u00a7\u00a7 323C, 323D. A specified portion of the \u201c[a]mounts collected by the commissioner of revenue . . . shall be deposited in the Clean Environment Fund,\u201d G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 323D; the remainder is deposited in the General Fund.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 235. The amendment eliminated the provisions of G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 323 (g), which we construed in <em>Mass. Wholesalers, supra, </em>as of January 1, 1990. St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>The amendment also provides for the retroactive funding of the \u201cdeposit transaction fund\u201d by requiring each bottler to place into its fund by January 1, 1990, a sum equal to the refund value for each container that it sold during the last three months of 1989. St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 237. Section 71 of the amendment also requires the Commissioner of Revenue to administer the deposit transaction fund and to promulgate \u201crules and regulations to effectuate the purposes\u201d of G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 323 (g) &amp; <em>(h), </em>and \u00a7\u00a7 323B-323E.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The plaintiffs filed the instant action in the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County seeking a declaratory judgment that the bottle bill, as amended, takes the property of the bottlers and distributors without compensation in violation of the takings clauses of the United States Constitution and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. The plaintiffs also requested a preliminary injunction enjoining the Commonwealth from enforcing the provisions of the amendment. A single justice refused to issue an injunction and remanded the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings. In the Superior Court, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The judge ruled that the amendment, apart from the retroactive funding portion, \u201cdoes not effect a taking of any property of bottlers or distributors,\u201d \u201cdoes not violate any constitutional requirement concerning abandoned property,\u201d and was a \u201cproper exercise of legislative power that establishes that refund values belong to consumers until they escheat to the Commonwealth.\u201d He further ruled that the retroactive funding portion of the amendment \u201ceffects an unconstitutional retroactive taking of the property of bottlers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>and distributors as to refund values collected during the three months prior to the Amendment\u2019s effective date,\u201d but declared that the retroactive funding portion was severable from the rest of the amendment. He entered a detailed order, allowing in part and denying in part each of the cross motions, and reported the matter to the Appeals Court. See G. L. c. 231 \u00a7 111 (1990 ed.); Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974). We granted direct appellate review and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">1. The first question before us is whether the amendment to the bottle bill violates the takings clause by conferring the right to the deposits on the consumer and, once abandoned, on the Commonwealth. Since the plaintiffs do not argue that we should apply any principles under the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights different from those established by the United States Supreme Court, we focus on the claimed violations of the United States Constitution. <em>Steinbergh </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>413 Mass. 736, 738 (1992). The material facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Government action does not constitute a \u201ctaking\u201d if the plaintiffs do not have a property interest in the affected property. <em>German </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>410 Mass. 445, 450 (1991). The \u201cgovernment is not required to compensate an individual for denying him the right to use that which he has never owned.\u201d <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>383 Mass. 152, 160 (1981). The plaintiffs claim to have a property right to the deposits based on common law. However, they admit that the bottlers and distributors did not begin to include a separate deposit amount (equivalent to the statutory \u201crefund value\u201d for nonreusable containers) in the price of beverages charged to retailers until the enactment of the bottle bill.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> They also admit that, prior to the bottle bill, they did not charge this ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>tra deposit amount.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It follows, therefore, that any right to these deposits was created under the original bottle bill, as we interpreted that statute in <em>Mass. Wholesalers, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, we did not recognize such a common law property right in <em>Mass. Wholesalers, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cIt is in that context that we consider whether \u00a7 323 (g) <em>reveals a legislative intent </em>that beneficial ownership of the \u2018deposits and/or handling charges\u2019. . . resides not in the bottlers and distributors but, instead, in the consumers\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 342. Moreover, the statement \u201c \u2018deposits and/or handling charges\u2019 can only be viewed as a portion of the purchase price of filled containers paid by dealers to distributors and by distributors to bottlers\u201d did not imply a common law property right on the bottlers and distributors to the deposits. <em>Mass. Wholesalers, supra </em>at 341. Instead, our holding was simply that, absent express legislative intent in the language of the original bottle bill, the deposits belonged to the plaintiffs. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">\u201cThe motion judge considered significant, as do we, that \u2018there is no express provision [in the bottle bill] concerning the disposition of unclaimed deposits. . . . <em>The absence of legislative direction, </em>express or implied, leads to the fair inference that the unclaimed deposits belong to the bottlers and distributors\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 342.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>The plaintiffs\u2019 right to the deposits created under the original bottle bill, as interpreted in <em>Mass. Wholesalers, supra, </em>does not translate into a similar right to these deposits under the bottle bill, as now amended. \u201cProperty interests ... are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\u201d <em>Regents of State Colleges </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972). <em>German </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 450.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> What the Legislature granted in the original bottle bill, the Legislature can take away by amendment. See, e.g., <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Parker, 472 </em>U.S. 115, 129 (1985) (Congress had plenary power to define scope and duration of entitlement to food-stamp benefits, and to increase, to decrease, or to terminate those benefits); <em>German </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 450 (State furlough program did not violate takings clause since no property interest in future wages for future State employment existed). See <em>Answer of the Justices, </em>406 Mass. 1220, 1225 (1989) (Legislature has power to amend prior legislation, so long as amendment would not violate provisions of Constitution). See also <em>Answer of the Justices, </em>375 Mass. 790, 793 (1978) (\u201c[W]hatever interpretation we might give would not affect the Legislature\u2019s power to amend or clarify the statute, giving it whatever interpretation the General Court might desire\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As the Superior Court judge noted, the amendment now \u201cmakes it redundantly clear that these [deposit] rights belong to the consumer and to the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>wealth and \u2018. . . for no purpose [are] ... to be regarded as income of said bottlers or distributors.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">2. The amendment includes a retroactive funding provision that requires each bottler and distributor to establish a deposit transaction fund as of January 1, 1990, and to deposit in that fund \u201can amount equal to the total amount of refund values received\u201d (deposits) during the last three months of 1989. St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 237. The Superior Court judge held that \u00a7 237 effected a \u201cretroactive taking\u201d of the refund values collected during the three months prior to the amendment\u2019s effective date. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Bottlers and distributors are required to make the initial deposit to the fund regardless of the amounts they paid out to retailers for returned empty containers. To meet that amount, bottlers and distributors must deposit all unclaimed deposits from those three months, and finance the balance with their private assets. The Attorney General argues that the funding requirement is neither retroactive nor a taking since the bottlers and distributors do not have a vested interest in the bottle deposits. See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, </em>366 Mass. 779, 781 (1975). Even if that were so with regard to unclaimed deposits, the bottlers and distributors have a vested interest in any personal assets they deposited into the fund. Furthermore, pursuant to our holding in <em>Mass. Wholesalers, supra, </em>the bottlers and distributors have a similar right to all unclaimed deposits until the effective date of the amendment on January 4, 1990. Therefore, the bottlers and distributors have a\" vested interest in the amount of their initial deposit in the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The Attorney General also argues that St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 237, does not effect a per se taking of these assets. However, once a bottler or distributor deposits any amount into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>fund, the money must be held \u201con behalf of consumers,\u201d and is \u201cfor no purpose ... to be regarded as income of said bottlers or distributors.\u201d G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 323 <em>(h). </em>Furthermore, the bottlers and distributors cannot use any amounts from the fund to pay refund values for those last three months of 1989. <em>Id. </em>The retroactive funding provision, thus, takes assets, which are the property of the bottlers and distributors, without compensation and is unconstitutional. \u201cA State, by ipse dixit, may not transform private property into public property without compensation.\u201d <em>Webb\u2019s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Beckwith, </em>449 U.S. 155, 164 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Both the Attorney General and amicus curiae argue that \u00a7 237 is a valid exercise of the State\u2019s police power that meets the \u201ctest of reasonableness\u201d enunciated for such cases. See <em>Leibovich </em>v. <em>Antonellis, </em>410 Mass. 568, 577 (1991), and cases cited. The Superior Court judge concluded that \u00a7 237 was not \u201csaved as a reasonable exercise of the Commonwealth\u2019s police power.\u201d We, however, need not conduct such an analysis. The provision effects a simple taking of private property. See <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>United States, </em>364 U.S. 40, 48 (1960) (\u201cThe total destruction by the Government of all value of . . . compensable property, has every possible element of a Fifth Amendment \u2018taking\u2019 and is not a mere \u2018coincidental incidence\u2019 of a valid regulatory measure\u201d). We know of no case where the reasonableness of a statute has cured an outright taking of the sort effected by this provision. See, e.g., <em>Leibovich </em>v. <em>Antonellis, </em>supra; <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Keene Corp., </em>406 Mass. 301 (1989); <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>397 Mass. 416 (1986); <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>374 Mass. 181 (1978). \u201c[Pjrivate property shall not be thus taken even for a wholly public use without just compensation.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Security Indus. Bank, </em>459 U.S. 70, 77 (1982), quoting <em>Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank </em>v. <em>Radford, </em>295 U.S. 555, 602 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">3. The Superior Court judge also ruled that St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 237, was severable from the remainder of the amendment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>\u201cWhen a court is compelled to pass upon the constitutionality of a statute and is obliged to declare part of it unconstitutional, the court, as far as possible, will hold the remainder to be constitutional and valid, if the parts are capable of separation and are not so entwined that the Legislature could not have intended that the part otherwise valid should take effect without the invalid part.\u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>387 Mass. 531, 540 (1982), quoting <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>330 Mass. 713, 716 (1953). The Legislature included the retroactive funding provision so that abandoned deposit amounts would escheat to the State almost immediately after enactment. Without the provision, the State will not receive these amounts immediately. However, bottlers and distributors are still required to begin depositing unclaimed refund value amounts in the funds as of January 1, 1990. See G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 323 <em>(h). </em>Abandoned deposit amounts would then escheat to the State beginning in the third month after the law takes effect. See G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 323C. Thus, the amendment will still accomplish its purposes, but only three months later than expected, without the retroactive funding provision. Clearly, the Legislature would have intended the amendment to have this less than immediate effect, rather than no effect at all.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The provision is severable from the rest of the amendment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>4. Finally, Mass. Wholesalers contends that the amendment effects a taking through the operation of an abandoned property scheme that is irrational and unworkable, and is contrary to general principles of abandoned property law. They claim that it is a common law principle that property can only be deemed abandoned where the party who has legal interest in the property does not assert a claim of ownership. See <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen. </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>388 Mass. 410, 412-413 (1983). They argue that consumers who purchase beverages in nonreusable containers and fail to return them do not have a legal interest in the deposit amounts that they can later abandon. However, the amendment itself now explicitly gives the consumer the right to the deposit. See G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 323 <em>(h) </em>(bottlers and distributors hold deposits \u201con behalf of consumers, . . . and for no purpose are . . . to be regarded as income of said bottlers or distributors\u201d). The lack of any connection between the deposit paid by the consumer and that received ultimately by the bottler or distributor which we recognized in <em>Mass. Wholesalers, supra </em>at 341, has been rectified by the specific language of the amendment. \u201cAs a broad principle of jurisprudence rather than as a result of the evolution of legal rules, it is clear that a State, subject to constitutional limitations, may use its legislative power to dispose of property within its reach, belonging to unknown persons.\u201d <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>341 U.S. 428, 435-436 (1951). The abandoned property scheme set up in the amendment is proper.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">5. We hold that (1) St. 1989, c. 653, apart from the retroactive funding provision contained in \u00a7 237, does not offend the takings clause of the United States or our Constitution; (2) the retroactive funding provision, \u00a7 237, does effect a taking, but is severable from the rest of the amendment; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>(3) the amendment\u2019s abandoned property scheme is not improper. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b428-12\">G.
