A judge in the Juvenile Court found two minor children, Eleanor and Carol, in need of care and protection and placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>them in the permanent custody of the Department of Social Services (department). See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 24 and 26 (1990 ed.). The Appeals Court reversed the judgment. <em>Custody of Eleanor, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 668 (1992). We granted the department\u2019s application for further appellate review, and reverse the judgment of the Juvenile Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">We summarize the relevant facts as found by the judge. On April 7, 1988, seven year old Eleanor was examined at the South Boston Health Center for a vaginal infection. During the examination, Eleanor\u2019s mother informed the attending physician that Eleanor had told her that the mother\u2019s boy friend, whom we shall call John Flanders, had \u201ctouched her down there.\u201d When questioned, Eleanor confirmed that Flanders had touched her vaginal area. Four days later, a report in accordance with G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A (1990 ed.) (51A report), was filed with the department alleging sexual abuse of Eleanor. Due to the nature of the allegations, Eleanor\u2019s three year old sister, Carol, was added to the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">On April 18, 1988, the mother informed a Boston police sergeant that she did not want the district attorney\u2019s office to prosecute Flanders.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 20, 1988, the allegations of sexual abuse were supported along with allegations of emotional neglect of both children by their mother. Eleanor later recanted her allegation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">On August 19, 1988, a second 51A report was filed alleging that the mother continued emotionally to neglect Eleanor and Carol by allowing them to remain alone and unsupervised with Flanders. Following these allegations, the mother and Eleanor participated in therapy at the South Boston Health Center and the mother was generally cooperative with the department. Her cooperation and participation in therapy ceased, however, on the release of Flanders from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>Bridgewater State Hospital.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Within the next year, several 51A reports alleging emotional neglect of both children were filed with the department, but went unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">On December 9, 1989, the mother and Flanders were married. The department then initiated another 51A report alleging that: Flanders now had access to Eleanor and Carol; the mother and Eleanor had stopped therapy; the mother refused to acknowledge that Eleanor had been sexually abused; and the mother had failed to complete tasks outlined in a service plan that she had signed on October 25, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">On January 22, 1990, the department filed the instant care and protection petition on behalf of Eleanor and Carol pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 24 and 26. After a full hearing, the judge granted temporary custody of Eleanor and Carol to the department, ordered that they be placed in foster care, required that their visits with their mother be supervised, and ordered Flanders to have no contact with either child. The department placed both children in separate South Boston foster homes. In February, 1990, however, Eleanor was removed from her foster home at the request of her foster mother. Because the department was unable to find alternative foster placement in South Boston, the department placed Eleanor with her aunt and uncle in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">The judge found that Flanders had a history of mental illness and instability that required repeated psychiatric admissions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, a sexual offender evaluation of Flanders conducted by Dr. David Doolittle found that Flanders demonstrated characteristics in his history and psychological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>test findings associated with child sexual offenders.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Dr. Doolittle concluded, \u201cThe circumstances to [Flanders\u2019] emotional adjustment as well as the characteristics outlined above suggest the need for considerable caution regarding his having unsupervised access to children at the present time.\u201d He recommended that Flanders not be granted unsupervised access to children residing in his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">As of January, 1990, the mother had called a department social worker four times and indicated that she would obtain a divorce from Flanders. However, at the care and protection proceeding on July 23, 1990, she had not obtained one and she continued to live with Flanders. She also testified at the proceeding that nothing would ever convince her that Eleanor was sexually abused, and that Flanders is not a danger to her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The judge concluded that both Eleanor and Carol were in need of care and protection pursuant to G. L. c 119, \u00a7\u00a7 24 and 26, and permanently committed them to the care of the department for placement in foster care. The Appeals Court reversed, stating that \u201cthe evidence presented a slender, and therefore insufficient, basis for a finding of the mother\u2019s unfitness.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Custody of Eleanor, supra </em>at 670. We reach the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>same result as the Appeals Court, but by slightly different reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The judge\u2019s findings in a custody proceeding must be specific and detailed so as to demonstrate that close attention has been given the evidence and such findings must prove current parental unfitness clearly and convincingly. <em>Care &amp; Protection of Laura, ante </em>788, 790 (1993). <em>Care &amp; Protection of Martha, </em>407 Mass. 319, 327 (1990). <em>Adoption of Frederick, </em>405 Mass. 1, 4-5 (1989). <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>396 Mass. 610, 619 (1986). The findings, however, must be left undisturbed absent a showing that they are clearly erroneous. <em>Adoption of Kimberly, ante </em>526, 529 (1993). <em>Care &amp; Protection of Martha, supra. Care &amp; Protection of Stephen, </em>401 Mass. 144, 151 (1987). <em>Custody of Two Minors, supra </em>at 618, and cases cited; Moreover, the judge\u2019s assessment of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses is entitled to deference. <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>397 Mass. 659, 670 (1986). <em>Custody of Two Minors, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">None of the judge\u2019s findings in this case was clearly erroneous. A finding is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence to support it, or when, \u201calthough there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Building Inspector of Lancaster </em>v. <em>Sanderson, </em>372 Mass. 157, 160 (1977), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948). See <em>DiGiovanni </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 343 (1985). Here each finding was adequately supported in the record, including the judge\u2019s finding that Eleanor\u2019s recantation lacked credibility.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge reviewed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>documentary evidence and heard the witnesses testify.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He was in the best position to assess Eleanor\u2019s credibility, and the credibility of Eleanor\u2019s allegation. See, e.g., <em>Care &amp; Protection of Martha, supra </em>at 328 (\u201cjudge\u2019s findings . . . were clear, articulate, amply supported by the record, and fully set forth what testimony the judge found to be credible\u201d); <em>Care &amp; Protection of Three Minors, </em>392 Mass. 704, 711 (1984) (\u201cIt is within the judge\u2019s discretion to evaluate the credibility of witnesses and to make his findings of fact accordingly. ... He was not obliged to believe the mother\u2019s testimony or that of any other witness\u201d). See also <em>Spiegel </em>v. <em>Beacon Participations, Inc., </em>297 Mass. 398, 407 (1937) (\u201cthe judge who has heard the testimony and seen the witnesses face to face has a better opportunity for determining the credibility of their conflicting statements than can possibly arise from reading a record\u201d); <em>Springgate </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Mattapoisett, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct 304, 310 (1981) (\u201cThe credibility of witnesses, particularly, is a preserve of the trial judge upon which an appellate court treads with great reluctance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">It does not follow, however, that the findings, taken together, proved parental unfitness by clear and convincing evidence. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Laura, supra </em>at 793. \u201cClear and convincing proof involves a degree of belief greater than the usually imposed burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, but less than the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt imposed in criminal cases.\u201d <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 849, 871 (1975). The finding of parental unfitness depends to a large extent on the underpinning that Flanders sexually abused Eleanor. That finding is based entirely on one allegation of inappropriate touching that was later withdrawn. Although the judge was not required to believe Eleanor\u2019s recantation, in the absence of any corroboration or physical evidence of sexual abuse, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>cannot be said that parental unfitness was proved by clear and convincing evidence. In addition, although the judge\u2019s reliance on profile evidence that Flanders demonstrated characteristics associated with child sexual offenders might be appropriate in some circumstances, such evidence cannot support a finding that sexual abuse actually occurred. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Day, </em>409 Mass. 719, 723-724 (1991). Thus, although the judge\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous, the evidence on which they were based did not prove parental unfitness by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Counsel for the children argues that a \u201cde nova\u201d review is required on appeal because the judge\u2019s decision implicates constitutional rights. However, it is settled that, while the interest of parents in their relationship with their children is constitutionally protected, see <em>Department of Pub. Welfare </em>v. <em>J.K.B., </em>379 Mass. 1, 3 (1979),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it is not absolute. <em>Care &amp; Protection of Robert, </em>408 Mass. 52, 60 (1990), quoting <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>383 Mass. 573, 587 (1981). We conclude that the parent-child relationship is sufficiently protected by requiring that the judge \u201center specific and detailed findings demonstrating that close attention has been given the evidence,\u201d and by requiring that the judge\u2019s findings prove parental unfitness by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>396 Mass. 610, 619 (1986). Even where we have applied a heightened level of scrutiny on appellate review of constitutional claims, we have not subjected findings based on credibility determinations to \u201cde nova\u201d review.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>Appellate review in custody appeals is not done to assess the evidence de nova, but rather to determine whether the judge\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous and whether they proved parental unfitness by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., <em>Care &amp; Protection of Martha, </em>407 Mass. 319, 328 (1990); <em>Care &amp; Protection of Stephen, </em>401 Mass. 144, 151 (1987) (\u201cjudge\u2019s findings are supported by the evidence and are thus not clearly erroneous\u201d); <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>397 Mass. 659, 664 (1986) (\u201csubsidiary findings fully support[ed] [judge\u2019s] ultimate conclusion, and the record in turn supports his subsidiary findings\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">We were informed at oral argument that the mother has filed a complaint for divorce against Flanders.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This information, together with the considerations cited by the Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>Court and any other relevant changed circumstances, should be evaluated in determining any appropriate future care and protection for these children. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Custody of Two Minors, supra </em>at 621. The judgment of the Juvenile Court granting the department permanent custody of Eleanor and Carol is reversed and the matter is remanded to the Juvenile Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b812-8\">One of the judge\u2019s findings indicates that the mother so informed the sergeant on March' 18, 1988.
