P\u2019s heirs, living in Louisiana, owned two tracts of land in the county of Carrol, adjoining each other, one of one hundred and thirty and the other of one hundred and thirty-eight acres, on which they had tenants, who paid the taxes up to 1858. In i860 the 130 acre tract was sold for the delinquent taxes of 1858 and 1859, and was purchased by H; for which he paid the said taxes, <em>$3.93, </em>and all other charges, amounting in all to $4.37, Within three years, and before a deed was made to H, P\u2019s heirs paid to the clerk of the County court the said sum with ten <em>per cent, per annum </em>interest thereon and the charges, all amounting to $7.72; H not then being in the county, and they not knowing that H had paid taxes on the land. H refused to receive the money on the ground that he had paid taxes on the land since his purchase; and he had the tract of 138 acres surveyed and obtained a deed for it from the clerk of the County court.

From this decree Hale applied to this court for an appeal; which was allowed.

In the year 1860, the tract of one hundred and thirty acres, which had been returned delinquent, was sold for the taxes of 1858 and 1859, amounting to $8.93, and F. L. Hale became the purchaser for the said arrearage of tax and all other charges upon it, amounting in all to $4.37.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The plaintiffs, soon after they were informed that the said tract of one hundred and thirty acres had been sold for taxes, which they supposed had been paid by their tenants as thei\u2019etofore, in order to redeem their land, paid to the clerk of the county of Carrol, thi'ough their attorney, $7.72, being the amount paid by the said Hale, with ten per cent, interest thereon. The court is of opinion that they had the right to redeem their land at that time by paying the amount for which the same was sold, and such additional taxes thereon as may have been paid by the purchaser, with <em>ten per cent, </em>interest thereon from the time the sazne was paid by the purchaser, the sale having been made moz\u2019e than thz\u2019ee years prior thereto, and no deed having been made to the purchaser, and no costs of survey and repoz-t having then been incurred by him. Code of 1873, chap. 38, \u00a7\u00a7 16 and 25. And the purchaser not being found in the county, the pz\u2019oof being that he was out of the county at the time, payment was propei\u2019ly made to the clez'k. They, nor their attorney, were aware at the time that the purchaser had paid any taxes upon the land since his purchase, or that he had any such claim. If they had been informed of it, there can be no doubt that any just and legal claim he had on that score would have also been paid. Mr. Lybrook who, as attorney for the appellees, made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>payment for them to the clerk, proves that he got the statement from the clerk of the amount due, which he paid; and that he afterwards informed the appellant that he had paid to the clerk for the appellees the amount of pui\u2019chase money he had paid for the land, and the damages, &amp;c. He says that appellant made no claim for taxes, which he had paid on the land since the purchase, and that he was under the impression that he had paid none, as he had not gotten a deed. But, on the contrary, that he spoke to him in a way, though he could not recollect his language, which he distinctly recollected induced him to believe that the controversy in relation to the land was finally settled, that Mr. Hale was satisfied, and that the appellees were to have no more trouble, as far as he was concerned, and that appellant requested him to say nothing about it, as he had purchased other lands at the same sale, or words to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">The appellant afterwards refused to receive the money from the clerk, assigning as his reason that no payment had been made of taxes which he claimed to have paid on the land since his purchase, and after-wards caused a survey of the one hundred and thirty-eight acre tract to be made, describing it as the tract of land sold on the 1st day of October, 1860, for the non-payment of taxes due thereon for the years 1858 and 1859, containing one hundred and thirty acres, to the said Hale, and a deed to be made to him for it by the clerk, which tract, it appears, is much more valuable than the one hundred and thirty acre tract which was sold. He assigns as a reason therefor, that the commissioner had committed an error in describing it as the one hundred and thirty acre tract on the commissioner\u2019s books. If that were so, if the commissioner had put the one hundred and thirty acre tract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\u25a0on his book by mistake, instead of the one hundred and thirty-eight acre tract, the one hundred and thirty \u2022acre tract was sold, and the appellant became the pur- - \u25a0chaser of that tract. He could not claim to be the purchaser of the one hundred and thirty-eight acre tract if it were true that the commissioner had made a mistake in putting upon his book the one hundred and thirty .acre tract, when it ought to have been the one hundred and thirty-eight acre tract. But he furnishes no proof of such mistake. The report of sale, and the receipt given by the sheriff to the appellant for the purchase money, describes the tract sold as one hundred and thirty acres; and there is nothing else in the description that is not equally as applicable to that tract as to the one hundred and thirty-eight acre tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The appellant files in the cause a memorandum, setting out a claim for purchase money, taxes paid, and other costs incurred by him, with <em>ten per cent, </em>interest, amounting to $48.64. This memorandum includes charges for taxes paid on the one hundred and thirty-eight acre tract subsequent to the sale of the one hundred and thirty acre tract, which is not, however, supported by any evidence. But there is no claim even of his having paid any taxes subsequent to the sale on the one hundred and thirty acre tract, which was the tract sold; and there was nothing then on that score to be paid by the heirs to entitle them to redeem. If he chose to pay the taxes upon another tract of the heirs, which was not sold, they were not bound to refund to him those taxes in order to redeem their tract of land which had been sold. The payment then which they made to the clerk of $7.72 being the amount of the purchase money which the appellant paid for the one hundred and thirty acre tract, with <em>ten per cent, </em>interest thereon, as shown by the clerk\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>receipt, was a redemption of their land which had been sold as aforesaid; and it would have been a flagrant wrong against them for the appellant afterwards to have had that tract surveyed, and a deed for it made-to him by the clerk. But it seems to the court the survey and report of the one hundred and thirty-eight acre tract, and the deed which he caused to be executed to him for the same, was without even a pretext-of right; and that there is no error in the decree of the court below, adjudging said deed to be null and void. But we think the court should have gone further, in order to preserve to the appellees their unbro-. ken record of title, and required the appellant to havereconveyed the title of the said tract of land to them, or to have appointed a commissioner to do it for him. The clerk\u2019s receipt, as we have seen, was a full satisfaction by the appellees of their -obligation to the appellant, and entitled them to the redemption of their tract of one hundred and thirty acres of land which had been sold as delinquent, and purchased by the appellant; and the clerk, who was before the courts should have been ordered to pay over the same to the-appellant. The appellees are not liable for payments made by the appellant for the survey and report, or for-the making, stamping and recording of the deed; and the account was properly ordered of the taxes paid by the appellant on the said tract of land from October-1860, but they not being upon the tract of land which was sold and purchased by the appellant, he was not-en titled to <em>ten per cent., </em>but only to <em>six per cent, </em>interest thereon. And the decree may be amended in those-particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">The court is therefore of opinion, to affirm the decree thus amended with costs, the appellees being the-party substantially prevailing, and to remand the cause-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>for the taking of the account in execution of the order as modified. And upon the return of the report, and the payment of the amount appearing to be due the appellant; which may be paid by the appellees crediting their decree in this court, or the court below for costs, with the amount, the appellant should be required to reconvey the tract of land aforesaid to them, or upon his default by a commissioner appointed for the purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">Decree amended and arrirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
