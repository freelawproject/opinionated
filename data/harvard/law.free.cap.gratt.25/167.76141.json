A judgment creditor brings a suit in equity to subject his debtor\u2019s land to satisfy his judgment; and other judgment creditors of the same debtor come into the cause by their petitions, to subject the same land. None of these judgments amount to $500. Upon a decree against them, dismissing the bill, the Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction to allow or hear an appeal from the decree, either on the ground that the united judgments amount to more than $500, or that the suit concerns the title or hounds of land.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-6\">2. In such case the decree is to be considered as several as to each creditor.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-8\">3. The matter in controversy, in reference to the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, is that which is the essence and substance of the judgment, and by which the party may discharge himself.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-10\">This was a suit in equity, brought in February 1871, in the County court of Tazewell, against Sterling F. Watts and Jane M. his wife, and R. C. Fudge, her trustee, to subject the life estate of said Watts in certain lands mentioned in the bill, to satisfy a judgment confessed in the clerk\u2019s office of said court by Watts at the suit of the plaintiffs, for $394, with interest from the 9th of January, 1871, till paid, and costs $6.03.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-11\">The defendants answered the bill, and insisted that the life interest of Watts in the land had been conveyed to the trustee for the benefit of Mrs. Watts, in consideration of several conveyances of her own land by Watts and herself to third parties, to enable him to pay his debts; and that this deed was executed,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>and, as they insisted, left with the clerk, to be recorded before the plaintiffs obtained their judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-9\">In the progress of the cause, several judgment creditors of Watts filed their petitions in the cause, and asked to be permitted to come in and have their judgments satisfied out of the fund. These judgments were prior to the deed, but neither of them amounted, principal and interest, to $500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-10\">When the cause came on to be heard in the County court, that court held that the life estate of Watts in the land was liable to the satisfaction of the judgments, and made a decree appointing special commissioners to sell the said life estate in the land. Trom this decree Mrs. Watts applied to the judge of the Circuit court of Tazewell county for an appeal, which was allowed. The cause came on to be heard in that court on the 11th of May, 1872, when the court held that the preexisting equities of Mrs. Watts were superior to the lien claimed by Umbarger and wife; and that the deed should be considered as a recorded deed, and dismissed the bill with costs. And further held that the petitioning creditors having tacked their fate to the fate of the bill, their petitions must be dismissed, but without prejudice. And, thereupon, Umbarger and wife, and two of the petitioning creditors, obtained an appeal to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-11\">After the appeal had been allowed and perfected, the appellees moved the court to dismiss it, on the ground that the court did not have jurisdiction of the cause.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-12\"><em>Richardson </em>and J. <em>W. $ J.

Neither of these claims amount to the sum of $500, the largest being below that sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The bill of Umbarger and wife is answered by Watts and wife and also by Fudge, trustee of Mrs. Watts, in which several answers it is claimed that before the recovery of the judgment by Umbarger and wife tbe land sought to be charged with the lien of their judgment had been, for a valuable and lawful consideration, conveyed to Fudge, trustee, for the sole use and benefit of Mrs. Watts; and that the deed conveying said land had been put upon record before the judgment in favor of Umbarger and wife was confessed by Watts.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Much evidence was taken as to the fact of the recordation of the deed, which it is not necessary here to notice. The County court rendered a decree declaring that \u201ctbe land in the bill and proceedings mentioned were liable to the liens of the several judgments, inasmuch as the trust deed for the benefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>the female defendant was not admitted to record until after the rendition of said judgments.\u201d It was accord-decreed that Sterling F. Watts pay to the several judgment creditors the amounts of their several judgnients, and, in default thereof, commissioners appointed by the court were directed to sell the lands for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">From this decree an appeal was taken to the Circuit court of Tazewell county; which court reversed the decree of the County court, dismissed the bill of Umbarger and wife, and also dismissed the petition of the other judgment creditors, but without prejudice to the latter to institute new proceedings. From the decree of the Circuit court an appeal was allowed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">The jurisdiction of this court is invoked upon' two grounds: 1st. That, although no one of the several claims of the appellants amount to the sum of $500, yet the aggregate sum of all amount to more than that sum, and that having a joint interest in subjecting the land to the payment of their several judgments, the aggregate amount ought to be considered in this court as the amount in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">2d. But if the aggregate amount is not to be considered the amount in controversy, but each claim is to be considered as several and independent, still this court may take jurisdiction, because the matters in controversy are concerning \u201c the title or bounds of lands,\u201d which the constitution recognizes as a proper subject of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">As to the first proposition, it is clear that the claims of the appellants are several, and independent of each other. They are founded upon different contracts, upon judgments obtained at different times. The allowance or rejection of one in no manner af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>feets the others. There is neither a joint interest nor a community of interests among them. All that can be said is, that they are pursuing the same debtor, and are seeking to subject the same property. Nor have they a common interest in that property. If the property they are seeking to subject to the liens of their several judgments was declared to be so liable, their interest would not be a common interest, but each independent of the other; for the proceeds would not be distributed <em>pro </em>rata, but according to the priorities of their several judgments. So that, in fact, their interests are diverse and antagonistic,' instead of joint and common. They do not sue as co-plaintiffs, because they have a joint and common interest; but for convenience, and to save a multiplicity of suits, other creditors are permitted to come in by petition in a suit already commenced by one creditor. But though the proceeding by petition be in the same suit, these several demands are as distinct and independent of each other as if they were pursuing the same debtor in different and independent suits. The decree of the court is not joint, but several, decreeing the several amounts due to them respectively, according to their several judgments. If one of the creditors is aggrieved by the decree, it is to the extent that <em>his claim </em>is not paid, and not because other creditors are not paid: and if his claim be less than $500, he cannot successfully invoke th\u00e9 jurisdiction of the court by uniting his claim to that of another creditor, in order to swell the amount to $500. These positions are fully sustained by the authorities cited by the learned counsel for the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The case of <em>Oliver </em>v. Alexander, 8 Peters\u2019 R. 143, was a suit in which several seamen united, as was per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>mitted by act of congress and practice in admiralty in a libel, seeking to subject a certain fund to the payment of their several demands. The sum decreed to the libellants in no case amounted to $2,000 (that being the amount which gives jurisdiction to the Supreme court of the United States), most of the claims being less thap $500. It was held that the matter in controvei\u2019sy was sevei\u2019al with each libellant; and that inasmuch as no one claim amounted to $2,000, though all combined exceeded that sum, the court had no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Mr. Justice Story delivering the opinion of the court says : \u201c The decree assigns to each seaman severally the amount to which he is entitled, and dismisses the libel as to those who have maintained no right to the interposition of the court in their favor. The whole proceeding, therefore, though it assumes the form of a joint suit, is, in reality, a mere joinder of distinct causes of action by distinct parties, growing out of tbe same contract. * * * It is obvious that the claim of each seaman is distinct and several', and the decree upon each claim is distinct and several. One seaman cannot appeal from the decree made in regard to the claim of another, for he has no interest in it, and cannot be aggrieved by it. The controversy, so far as he is concerned, is confined solely to his own claim, and the matter of dispute between him and the owner, or other respondents, is the sum or value of his own claim, without any reference to the' claim of others. It is very clear, therefore, that no seaman can appeal from the District court to the Circuit court, unless his claim exceeds $50, nor from the Circuit court to the Supreme court, unless his claim exceeds $2,000.\u201d And accordingly the appeal was dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The same doctrine was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>affirmed in the cases of <em>Stratton </em>v. <em>Jarvis and Brown, </em>8 Peters\u2019 R. 4, and in <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>12 How. U. S. R. 847. The case of <em>Seaver </em>v. <em>Bigelows, </em>5 Wall. U. S. R. 208, is a case much in point. That was a case (as is the case before us) of a judgment creditor filing a bill setting up his judgment and seeking its enforcement against the property of the defendant; and another creditor came into the same suit to enforce a judgment against the same fund, which he had recovered against the same defendant. The case is, in this respect, strikingly analogous to the case under consideration. Mr. Justice Kelson, who delivered the opinion of the court, said: \u201cThe judgment creditors who have joined in this bill have separate and distinct interests depending upon separate and distinct judgments. In no event could the sum in dispute, of either party, exceed the amount of their judgment, which is less than $2,000.\u201d * * * \u201cIt is true the litigation involves a common fund, which exceeds the sum of $2,000; but neither of the judgment creditors has any interest in it exceeding the amount of his judgment. Hence, to sustain an appeal in this class of eases, where separate and distinct interests are in dispute, of an amount less than the statute requires, and' where the joinder of parties is permitted by the mere indulgence of the court, for its convenience and to save expense, would be giving a privilege to the parties not common to other litigants, and which is forbidden by law. The case (that is the case of creditors asserting different and distinct claims in the same suit) is analogous to proceedings in admiralty in behalf of seamen for wages, and salvers for salvage, where the practice of the court is well settled.\u201d He then cites <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>and other cases above cited, and declares that the appeal must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>These authorities seem to \u2018establish the proposition, that where the claims of the plaintiffs are separate and though joined in the same suit, and where one claimant has no interest in the claim of the other, the court will not take jurisdiction because the aggregate sums amount to over $500; but in such a case the claim of each party appealing must amount to that sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">I am not aware that the question in the form in which it is here presented, has ever been before this court. But this court held in <em>Claiborne </em>v. <em>Gross </em>and <em>Wimbish </em>v. same, 7 Leigh 331, that where two judgment creditors filed separate bills in chancery impeaching a conveyance of land made by a debtor as fraudulent, which suits were consolidated, aud there was a final decree dismissing .the bills respectively, and the plaintiffs respectively appealed, that the amount in controversy in one of the suits being insufficient to give this court jurisdiction, the appeal in that suit should be dismissed. In the ease before us the claims of each of the judgment creditors are as separate and distinct as if each had filed his separate and independent bill. They are permitted to assert their claims in the same suit merely as a matter of convenience, and to save the costs of litigation and prevent a multiplicity of suits. The amount in controversy between the parties is the amount of the claim of each judgment creditor, and not the aggregate amount of the whole. So that it follows that no one claim amounting to $500 the court has no jurisdiction,</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The case of <em>Rodd </em>v. <em>Heartt, </em>17 Wall U. S. R. 354, so earnestly relied upon by one of the learned counsel for the appellants, is not at all in conflict -with the views above presented and the authorities cited to sustain them. The case was this: A steamer having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>been sold under a proceeding <em>in rem </em>in tbe admiralty, left in the registry of the court $4,387.51, claimed on the one hand by Rodd and several other persons ereditors of the owners, who by one mortgage on the vessel had undertaken to secure all those creditors in a body, and, on the other hand, claimed by Heartt and others, mariners, furnishers of supplies and material men. The claim of Rodd under the mortgage was $4,825, and of his co-mortgagees was (in the aggregate) $8,000. The claim of the mariners, furnishers of supplies and material men was $10,150. The District court decreed the fund to the mortgagees, which gave to Rodd $1,498.99 as his <em>pro rata </em>share. This decree of the District court was reversed by the Circuit court, which held \u201cthat the claims of the mariners, furnishers of supplies and material men be recognized as superior to the claim of the mortgagee creditors, and paid in preference to the latter; and that a new distribution of the proceeds be prepared by the commissioner in accordance with the principles thus laid down.\u201d It was from this decree that Rodd and his co-mortgagees appealed to the Supreme court, where a motion was made to dismiss the appeal, among other grounds, \u201c because no one of the claims exceeded $2,000, Rodd\u2019s which was the largest, being but $1,498.99, and the judiciary acts giving an appeal only where the matter in dispute exceeds $2,000.\u201d The plain answer to this proposition is that the sum of $1,498.99 does not represent <em>the claim, </em>of Rodd, but that amount was the <em>pro rata </em>share of the fund decreed to him by the District court, but that decree was reversed by the Circuit court; his claim and those of his co-mortgagees was disallowed and the whole fund decreed to the other claimants. His claim was $4,825, the whole of which was <em>disallowed; </em>so that it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>true as contended by tbe counsel in that ease, that \u201cRodd\u2019s claim, which was the largest, was less than $2,000.\u201d And Chief Justice Chase therefore says, on the motion to dismiss the appeal: \u201cAs to the second ground on which a dismissal is asked, it is apparent that though no one of the claims allowed exceeded $2,000, yet the claim of the appellant which was <em>disallowed </em>exceeded that sum.\u201d The matters in dispute were the claims of the mortgagees in the fund,' amounting to over $8,000, of which Rodd\u2019s was over $4,000 and the claims of the mariners and others, on the other hand, amounting to over $10,000; both sets of claimants asserting their right to the fund in the hands of the court, amounting to over $4,000. This whole fund was given to one set of claimants, and the claim of the mortgagees was wholly disallowed. It is plain that the <em>matter in dispute </em>in this case exceeded $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">In that case, too, it may be observed, that the mortgagees had a joint and common interest arising under the same contract, and secured by the same mortgage, having an interest <em>pro rata </em>in a common fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">This case is not only not in conflict with the uniform course of decisions of the Supreme court of the United States, but, when properly understood, is entirely consistent with those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">I think it is plain, therefore, both upon principle and authority, that the aggregate amount of the creditors\u2019 claims cannot give the jurisdiction; and the claim of each being less than $500, the appeal must be dismissed, unless, there be some other ground upon which the jurisdiction will attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">It is claimed by the learned counsel for the appellants, that this case is brought within the jurisdiction of this court, because the matter in controversy is one \u201cconcerning the title to land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>By the second section of article sixth of the con<em>s</em>titution it is provided that the Supreme court of Appeals \u201cshall not have jurisdiction in civil where the matter in controversy, exclusive of costs, is less in value or amount than five hundred dollars, except in controversies concerning the title or boundaries of land, the probate of a will, the appointment or qualification of a personal representative, guardian, committee or curator, or concerning a mill, roadway, ferry or landing, or the right of a corporation or of a county to levy tolls or taxes, and ex'cept in cases of <em>habeas corpus, mandamus, </em>and prohibition, or the constitutionality of a law,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The phrase, \u201c the matter in controversy,\u201d when used in relation to the appellate jurisdiction of this court, has already received a judicial exposition. In <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Long, </em>3 Munf. 136, Judge Roaue says: \u201c The matter in controversy is that which is the essence and substance of the judgment, and by which the party may discharge himself.\u201d In the cases of <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Kellam, </em>and <em>Lymbrick </em>v. <em>Selden, </em>3 Munf. 202, in both of which the action was trespass <em>guare clausum fregit, </em>and the damages recovered were less than $100, but it appeared from the records that the title or bounds of land were drawn in question, Judge Cabell said, and in this the majority of the court concurred: \u201c To give this court jurisdiction, the matter in controversy must be equal in value to $100, or must be a franchise or freehold. The action of trespass is one in which damages alone can be recovered, and although title or bounds of land may be incidentally or collaterally brought in question, yet the value of the matter in controversy is, from the nature of the action, the value of the damages sustained by the trespass; and this as well where the title or bounds of land may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>be drawn in question, as where they may in no manner be involved in the dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">These cases were followed by <em>Skipwith </em>v. Young, 5 Munf. 276. That was an action on the case for injury to the land of the plaintiff by the erection of a mill dam. There was a verdict for the plaintiff for one penny damages, subject to the opinion of the court on a point reserved, involving the right of the defendant to build a mill under the circumstances set forth. It thus appeared that the questions between the parties were the right and title to the land overflowed, and the right to continue the mill and dam. In the course of his opinion in this case, Judge Brooke remarked \u201c that the matter in controversy is that for which the suit is brought, and not that which may or may not come in question.\u201d * * \u201cThe injury in the ease before the court is emphatically the matter in controversy, though other matters may have been put in issue, the finding of which by a jury may, if pleaded, estop the party in another action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">blow to give this court jurisdiction in the case before us, the matter in controversy must either be $500, or the matter in controversy must be \u201cconcerning the title or boundaries of land;\u201d or in other words, adopting the judicial interpretation of the words \u201cmatter in controversy,\u201d <em>that for which the suit is brought </em>must be a matter \u201cconcerning the title or bounds of land.\u201d In the case before us, the suit is not brought <em>for the </em>land, but to enforce a pecuniary demand against the land. The object of the suit is to recover money evidenced by judgments; and the land is only the fuud out of which it is sought to enforce the payment. In such a suit by a creditor to \u2022enforce a judgment lien, the question as to the title \u2022or bounds of land may or may not arise. The ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>tion does not (in such a suit) directly arise, but may arise as incident or collateral to the matter \u201c for which the suit is brought.\u201d To adopt the language of Judge Brooke, \u201cthe essence and substance\u201d of the decree in such a case is for the <em>payment of the money </em>due upon the judgment; and by the payment of that \u201cthe party may discharge himself.\u201d In every such case the decree is always for the payment of the money due under the judgment; and <em>in default of payment </em>within a reasonable time, the sale of the land is decreed. Now it would be a most unreasonable construction to hold that in every creditor\u2019s bill to enforce a judgment lien, because the land <em>may he </em>sold by decree of the court to satisfy the judgment, that therefore it is necessarily a suit \u201cconcerning the title or bounds of land.\u201d \u201cThat for which the suit is brought\u201d is to enforce a pecuniary demand. The essence and substance of the decree is the payment of the pecuniary demand asserted; and by that payment the defendant \u201cmay discharge himself,\u201d and \u201c the title or bounds of the land\u201d be in no manner brought in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">In support of these views as to the true construction' of the constitution, it may be further observed, that not only have the words \u201c matters in controversy\u201d received a judicial exposition, but also the word \u201c concerning,\u201d as used in the constitution. The same section of the constitution which we have been considering confers jurisdiction upon this court in \u201ccontroversies concerning a road,\u201d and the statute law authorizes appeals as of right from orders of the County courts in \u201ccontroversies concerning a road.\u201d But it was held by this court in <em>Hancock </em>v. <em>Richmond and Petersburg Railroad Co., </em>3 Gratt. 328, that appeals of right from orders of the County court in controversies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>concerning roads, only exist where the controversy is. concerning <em>the establishment of a road; </em>and not where it is a <em>collateral </em>controversy concerning the damages occasioned by a road already established. See also opinion of Chief Justice Marshall in <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Gray\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>6 Peters\u2019 R. 151, 10 Curtis 77, where the same word \u201cconcerning\u201d is used in a statute under consideration in that case, and is construed by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion that this court is without jurisdiction to determine the questions in controversy between the parties, and that the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
