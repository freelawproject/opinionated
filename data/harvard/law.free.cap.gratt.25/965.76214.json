An indictment for the larceny of divers notes of the \u201cnational currency of the United States,\u201d is equivalent to the phrase in the statute of \u201cUnited States currency;\u201d and the indictment is sufficient.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b985-8\">2. It is always safer and better, in a prosecution for a statutory offence, to describe the offence in the indictment in the very language in which it is described in the statute; but except some technical words as \u201cfeloniously,\u201d &amp;c., the words of the statute may be substituted by the use of synonymous words, or words which plainly bring them within the meaning of the statute.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b985-10\">3. There are two kinds of United States currency, both of which may properly be called national currency of the United States. Of these, one consists of treasury notes, and the other of national bank notes.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b985-12\">4. If P and L, at the house of the accused, by the use of false pretences, obtained from F the sum of $570, the accused is not guilty of the of-fence, unless he was- present, aiding and abetting therein, or suffered or permitted the said P and L to use said house, with knowledge that they intended to use the same for the employing of such pretences. But if the accused was within easy call with intent to aid or assist them in their purpose, or in escaping, or in getting rid of or misleading the person from whom such money was obtained, that is a presence, aiding and abetting, and the accused is as guilty as if he were personally present.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b985-14\">5. If the accused and others concerted and conspired together to induce, . by false representations, F, or any other persons who might be induced by such representations, to enter the house of the accused, and to obtain the money of such persons by false pretences, or rented his house to be used for such purpose by said conspirators; and in pursuance of such concert, one of the confederates of the accused induced F to go into said house, and by false representations and pretences did obtain from F a large sum of money; and the accused was present or within easy call to aid and assist them in their purpose, or in escaping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>or in getting rid of or misleading the person from whom such money was obtained; then the accused is as guilty as if he himself had obtained the \u2019money from F!</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b986-9\">6.

Fowlkes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b986-14\">On the trial, the commonwealth introduced through sundry witnesses evidence tending to prove that on \u2022or before the 7th day of October 1874, the prisoner, as lessee, occupied a certain house at the corner of Franklin and Thirteenth streets,'in the city of Richmond, and that on the said 7th day of October 1874 one John H. Keisel, on Main street in the city of Richmond, by falsely representing that he was a countryman and acquaintance of Joseph M. Fowlkes (who was from Amelia county), and that he, Keisel, had just received a letter from his brother in Kentucky, informing him that he had drawn three thousand dollars in a lottery, and that being a stranger he could not find the place to get it cashed, which was the corner of Franklin and Thirteenth streets, induced said Joseph M. Fowlkes to go with him to find the place; that upon finding the place, said John H. Keisel asked Joseph M. Fowlkes to go with him up stairs into the rooms of the said house, leased as aforesaid by accused, they consisting of a front and back room <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>on the second floor, between which rooms were large folding doors, which were closed when Joseph M. Fowlkes and John H. Keisel entered the room; that there was only one person in the said room, one Robert Purdy\u2014John H. Keisel and he pretending to be strangers; that said Robert Purdy, upon presentation of his ticket by John H. Keisel, informed him, after looking at a large book, that it had only drawn eight hundred dollars; and then, looking at the ticket more closely, that it being only an eighth of a ticket, it only drew one hundred dollars; and then handed from a draw two fifty-dollar notes, saying he owed him in addition one dollar, but as he did not have the change he gave him a ticket upon which he might draw for another prize; and John H. Keisel agreeing, Robert Purdy, upon looking at a book, told John H. Keisel that his ticket had won forty dollars and two other tickets, which he gave John H. Keisel; John H. Keisel then insisted that Joseph M. Fowlkes, as he had been kind enough to show him the way, should take one of the tickets, and, upon Joseph M. Fowlkes declining, said he would draw the tickets and would divide with Joseph M. Fowlkes what was drawn. Robert Purdy, thereupon, looking at the book again, told John H. Keisel that the tickets had drawn one hundred and fifty dollars; but this time he did not pay the money, but said that they, meaning John H. Keisel and Joseph M. Fowlkes, would, under the regulations of the society, have to make four draws; that they had been very lucky, but, as a matter of form, in order to \u25a0 draw a second time, they must each put up ten dollars, assuring Joseph M. Fowlkes that they would certainly get the one hundred and fifty dollars which had been already won, and the ten dollars which they had put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>down, and had a chance of drawing a much larger sum. The ten dollars each in national currency was put down by John H. Keisel and Joseph M. Fowlkes, and John H. Keisel taking a little slip of paper from a bundle on the table turned it over, and it corresponding with one of the several figures on a table, Robert Purdy informed them that draw had won four hundred and forty dollars, but that they must go through the form of putting down ninety dollars in order to draw again; that they were obliged to get what they had already won and what they had put down, as well as the ninety dollars, which they were-obliged to put down according to the regulations; thereupon Joseph M. Fowlkes put down the ninety dollars in national currency; that John H. Keisel took another slip of paper from a bundle, turned it over, and it corresponding with one of the numbers on the table, Robert Purdy announced that it had won two hundred and ninety dollars; that by the regulations'it was necessary, as a matter of form, for the last draw, which might draw twenty thousand dollars or thirty thousand dollars, that four hundred and seventy dollars should be put up; Robert Purdy then explicitly and repeatedly assured Joseph M. Fowlkes that he ran no risk in putting up the four hundred and seventy dollars; that the money already drawn and that put up, and the four hundred and seventy dollars to-be put up, could not be affected by the draw, and that the worst draw that could be made was a blank, and all the money drawn and put up would be paid, and whatever was drawn on the fourth draw; that by the rules and regulations he could not put up a check, but must put up the currency; thereupon Joseph M. Fowlkes went out and borrowed the four hundred and seventy dollars, and upon returning was again assured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>that his money was perfectly safe, and he could not lose a cent, while, by complying with the rules and putting down the money, they stood the chance winning a very large sum; thereupon Joseph M. Fowlkes put down the four hundred and seventy dollars in national currency, and John H. Keisel, taking another ticket, turned it over, and Robert Purdy swept the money into the table drawer and locked it; that Joseph M. Fowlkes turning instantly to look for Keisel, as he demanded his money back, found that John H. Keisel, who had been by his side the moment before, had slipped away; that the folding doors were 'opened, and that prisoner was sitting in the other room; prisoner rose and beckoned to Joseph M. Fowlkes, who went to him, and prisoner told him that his \u201cson or brother,\u201d meaning John H. Keisel, had gone <em>\u201c </em>that way,\u201d pointing to a back door, and caught Joseph M. Fowlkes by the shoulder, leading him through some dark passages which led through another tenement out to a rear entrance way, some forty yards from the front door, where Joseph M. Fowlkes had entered, and opening on another street; but Joseph M. Fowlkes, being frightened, refused to go further in that direction, returned and went out of' the front door, after being told by Robert Purdy that what went into that drawer never came out; that Joseph M. Fowlkes soon after obtained an officer and went back to the house, but the rooms were locked up and no person to be found there; that soon after the occurrence described as taking place in the room,, the prisoner, Robert Purdy and two others were seen coming out of the room and going away; that later in the afternoon one John Wren, a detective, brought the prisoner (not under arrest) to the vicinity of the-St. Charles Hotel, where Joseph M. Fowlkes was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>stopping, and Joseph M. Fowlkes, with his counsel or friend, Mr. Samuel M. Page, had a short interview with him, in which he said that Joseph' M. Fonrlkes had lost his money, and that the men who had got it were gone, and the prisoner didn\u2019t mean to pay a damn cent. Thereupon, at the advice of Samuel M. Page, Joseph M. Fowlkes swore out against the prisoner and others a warrant for a felony, in obtaining by false pretences the said sum of five hundred and seventy dollars, which warrant Mr. Page took possession of and withheld from execution until the next morning, with the hope of being able to secure the repayment of the money thus obtained; that while said warrant was so held by said Page the character or contents of said warrant were unknown by said John Dull; that said Joseph M. Fowlkes and Mr. Page refused to show said warrnt, or to name the justice who issued it, upon request of said John Dull\u2019s attorney, George D. \"Wise; that on the 8th day 'of October 1874, the said John Dull, by agreement with Joseph M. Fowlkes, through their attorneys or friends, at the Circuit court-room, paid said Joseph M. Fowlkes two hundred and eighty-five dollars, in satisfaction and discharge of said John Dull\u2019s house and all persons for the aforesaid loss of five hundred and seventy \u25a0dollars, for which said Joseph M. Fowlkes then and there, under advice of his said friend, Samuel M. Page, executed a receipt and release in writing, which receipt is in the words and figures following, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b990-9\">\u201cRichmond, Ya., October 8th, 1874.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b990-10\">\u201cReceived of John 0.

At this interview prisoner also called the attention of Joseph M. Fowlkes to a statement made by Joseph M. Fowlkes when at his, prisoner\u2019s house, while the pretended drawings were going on'; that after this interview at the Circuit court room, the warrant was placed in the hands of the officers, and they found John Dull and arrested him at his said rooms; that when he was arrested there were two other men in the adjoining room, one being John H. Keisel, and being seen by the officers, the officers inquired of John Dull who these men were, and prisoner informed the officers that John H. Eeisel\u2019s name was Smith; and the court certifies that the foregoing was all the evidence tending to prove, on the part of the commonwealth, that the prisoner was guilty of the larceny charged in the indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b991-6\">And the accused, John Dull, on his part, introduced evidence tending to show that before the said 7th day of October 1874, he had sub-let said house to Robert Purdy and one Dr. Lewis, to be used for playing a game therein, and, for the use or rent thereof, was to receive fifteen <em>per centum </em>of the proceeds thereof; that at the time of the fraud aforesaid upon said Joseph M. Fowlkes, the said Robert Purdy and Dr. Lewis were present, but said John Dull was not present in \u00abaid front room where said fraud was practiced; that said two hundred and eighty-five dollars, paid to said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>Joseph M. Fowlkes, was not the money of said John Dull, but of other persons; and on his part introduced a witness, who testified that at the interview when the two hundred and eighty-five dollars was paid over, prisoner did not, as far' as witness heard, say that it was a hard ease that he should have to pay two hundred and eighty-five dollars when he got only two hundred dollars, but thought he could understand how that idea got into the head of the witnesses who testified to it; and that said John Dull did not know that, he was then charged, in the warrant or otherwise, with a felony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b992-9\">After the conclusion of the evidence and argument of counsel, the prisoner asked the court to give two instructions to the jury, and the attorney for the commonwealth asked for one. The court gave the second instruction asked for by the prisoner, and gave the first with an addition to it; and gave the instruction asked for by the attorney for the commonwealth. And the prisoner excepted. These are set out in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b992-10\">Tbe jury found the prisoner guilty, and ascertained the term of his imprisonment in the penitentiary at three years. And thereupon the prisoner moved the court to set aside the verdict and grant him a new trial, on the grounds, first, that the court erred in giving and in refusing the instructions; and second, that the charge given by the clerk to the jury before the evidence was introduced, was allowed to remain unchanged, as the guide to the jury touching the measure of punishment. But the court overruled the motion and sentenced the prisoner in accordance with the verdict. And he again excepted; and obtained a writ of error from this court. This point is also set out in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b993-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number><em>Neeson, </em>for the prisoner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b993-4\"><em>The Attorney General, </em>for the commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A7rq\">Moncure, P.,</author>\n<p id=\"AFnd\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">This is a writ of error to a judgment of the Hustings court of the city of Eichmond, rendered on the 21st day of November, 1874, convicting the plaintiff in error, John Dull, of grand larceny, and sentencing him therefor to confinement in the penitentiary for the term of three years; the period by the jurors in their verdict ascertained. Various errors are assigned in the judgment, which we will consider in the order \u2022of their assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">The first is, that the court erred in overruling the motion to quash the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">The indictment charges the larceny of divers \u201c notes of the <em>national currency of the United States, </em>the number and denomination of which are to the grand jurors unknown, for the payment of divers sums of money, in the whole amounting to the sum of five hundred and seventy dollars, and of the value of five hundred and seventy dollars, the property and notes of one \u2022Joseph M. Fowlkes,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-13\">It is argued that this indictment charges no indictable offence, either at common law or under any statute of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-14\">Certainly it charges no such offence at common law. Larceny could not, by the common law, be committed \u2022of written instruments, whether they related to real estate or concerned mere choses in action. 2 Eussell on Crimes, p. 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-15\">Nor does it charge any such offence under any \u2022statute, unless it be under the act approved'February 28th, 1874, entitled \u201cAn act to amend section 6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>chapter 201, of the Code of 1873, with reference to-larceny.\u201d Acts of Assembly, page 65, chap. 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">Prior to the passage of that act, to wit, in 1870, it had been decided by this court in <em>Leftwich\u2019s case, </em>20 Gratt. 716, that in an indictment for larceny, a description of the subject as \u201cUnited States currency,\u201d was not sufficient. Therefore on that ground, the-indictment in that case was considered to be radically defective, and the judgment of the court below was-reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">In consequence of that decision, the act aforesaid was passed, by which, among other things, it was enacted that, \u201cin a prosecution for the larceny of United States currency,\u201d \u201cit shall be sufficient if the accused be proved guilty of the larceny of national bank notes, or United States treasury notes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">An indictment for an offence committed since the passage of that act, charging the offence as a larceny of \u201c United States currency,\u201d does charge an indictable offence under that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">The question therefore is, whether the indictment in this case is, in effect, an indictment for the larceny of United.States currency? \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b994-13\">It is certainly safer and better, in a prosecution for a statutory offence, to describe the offence in the indictment in the very language in which it is described in the statute. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peas, 4 </em>Leigh 692; 2 Gratt. 629; same v. <em>Hampton, </em>3 Gratt. 590; <em>Howell\u2019s case, </em>5 Id. 664; <em>Young\u2019s case, </em>15 Id. 664; <em>Old\u2019s </em>case, 18 Id. 915; <em>Cousin\u2019s case, </em>19 Id. 807; and <em>Taylor\u2019s case, </em>20 Id. 825. But as was said by the court in the last named case, while \u201cthere are certain technical words of description of an offence which cannot be substituted by the use of other words in an indictment; such as the words \u2018feloniously,\u2019\u2018burglariously,\u2019\u201d &amp;c.,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>yet \u201cdescriptive words which are not of such technical character, though they generally better express their own meaning than any other words that can be used, may be substituted by the use of synonymous words, or words which plainly bring them within the meaning of the statute.\u201d To the same effect are <em>Young\u2019s case </em>and <em>Old\u2019s case, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\">In this case the indictment charges a larceny of \u201c divers notes of the national currency of the United States.\u201d Is not that precisely the same, in meaning and effect, as a charge of a larceny of \u201c United States currency\u201d? We think that it is. \u201cCurrency of the United States,\u201d is certainly the same thing as \u201cUnited States curency.\u201d The addition of the word \u201cnational\u201d in the indictment can certainly make no difference. If it has no meaning at all it must be rejected as surplusage. If it has any meaning at all it can only refer to the \u201cnation\u201d of the United States, and currency of the nation of the United States, must mean currency of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">There are two kinds of United States currency, both of which may properly, be called national currency of the United States, one of which consists of treasury notes, (2 Brightley\u2019s Dig. p. 167, title \u201ccurrency,\u201d) and the other of national bank notes. (Id. p. 56, title \u201cbanking,\u201d) That both of these kinds of currency are embraced in the denomination of \u201c United States currency,\u201d contained in the act before referred to, is shown by the act itself, which expressly declares that to sustain a charge of larceny of United States currency, \u201cit shall be sufficient if the accused be proved guilty of the larceny of national bank notes, or United States treasury notes.\u201d So that, whatever may be said of the strict accuracy of the language \u201cUnited States currency,\u201d as applied to both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>of the descriptions of currency aforesaid, it must be regarded as perfectly accurate in a prosecution under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">We are therefore of opinion that the Hustings court did not err in overruling the motion to quash the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">The second assignment of error is, that the court erred in refusing to give to the jury instruction Ho. 1, as prayed for by 'the prisoner, and especially in giving the same with an addition made thereto by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">Instruction Ho. 1, as prayed for by the prisoner, is in these words: \u201cThat if the jury believe from the evidence that Robert Purdy, Hr. Lewis, or any other persons, at the house of accused, by the use of false pretences, obtained from one Joseph M. Fowlkes, the sum of five hundred and seventy dollars, the jury cannot find the accused guilty of the larceny alleged in the indictment, unless they are satisfied from the evidence, beyond all reasonable doubt, that the prisoner was present, aiding and abetting therein, or suffered or permitted the said persons so using the .false pretence, to use the said house with knowledge that such persons intended to use said house for the employing of such fraudulent pretence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">The court refused to give that instruction as it stands, but gave it with an addition in these words: \u201cBut if the prisoner was within easy call, to aid or assist them in their purpose, or in escaping, or in getting rid of, or misleading the person from whom such money was obtained, that is a presence, aiding and abetting, and the prisoner is as guilty as if he were personally present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b996-12\">The court was certainly right in refusing to give the first instruction as asked for by the prisoner, for it might, and no doubt would, have misled the jury into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>the belief that to make the prisoner guilty of the offence charged against him in the indictment, it was necessary that he should have been <em>actually </em>present at the commission of the same; whereas he might have been, and the evidence strongly tended to prove that he was, guilty of the said offence as a principal in the second degree, by being <em>constructively </em>present and aiding and abetting in the commission of the same. \u201c In order to render a person a principal in the second degree,\u201d says Iiussell, \u201che must be present, aiding and abetting at the fact, 'or ready to afford assistance if necessary; but the <em>presence </em>need not be a strict, actual, immediate presence, such a presence as would make him an eye or ear witness of what passes, but may be a constructive presence. So that if several persons set out together, or in small parties, upon one common design, be it murder or other felony, or for any other purpose unlawful in itself, and each takes the part assigned him; some to commit the fact, others to watch at proper distances and stations, to prevent a surprise, or to favor, if need be, the escape of those who are more immediately engaged; they are all, provided the fact be committed, in the eyes of the law, present at it; for it was made a common cause with them, each man operated in his station at one and the same instant, towards the same common end, and the part each man took tended to give countenance, encouragement and protection to the whole gang, and to ensure the success of their common enterprise.\u201d 1 Russell on Crimes pp. 26-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-3\">It was proper, therefore, that the court should qualify the instruction prayed for by prisoner, so as to refer to and explain this matter of constructive presence; and accordingly, the addition before mentioned was made thereto. We think <em>that </em>addition is free from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>any just ground of exception, and cures the defect in the original instruction. We do not think that it was calculated to mislead the jury, as argued by the counsel for the plaintiff in error; nor that it treats him ag a principal in the second degree, by <em>proximity </em>to the crime or principal in the crime, without regard to <em>intent. </em>It is certainly true,-as argued by the learned counsel, that <em>\u201cpresence </em>alone is not sufficient to criminate;\u201d and that \u201cit must be with <em>intent </em>to aid in the crime.\u201d But there is nothing in the addition, as we understand it, and as we think the jury must have understood it, which is inconsistent with that proposition. On the contrary, the addition affirms it. To supply the words, \u201cto aid or assist them,\u201d used in the addition, at other places therein where they are necessarily understood, the addition will read thus: \u201cBut if the prisoner was within easy call, to aid or assist them in their purpose, or to aid or assist them in escaping, or to aid or assist them in getting rid of or misleading the person from whom such money was obtained; <em>that </em>is a presence, aiding and abetting, and the prisoner is as guilty as if he were personally present.\u201d How what is the meaning of the words, \u201cBut if the prisoner was within easy call, <em>to aid or assist </em>them?\u201d Clearly we must read them as if the words \u201cwith intent,\u201d or \u201cfor the purpose,\u201d were written before the words \u201cto aid or assist them.\u201d We think this is perfectly plain if we read the addition together with the original instruction of which it formed a part when given to the jury. The original instruction declared that the jury could not find the accused guilty of the larceny charged against him, unless they were satisfied that he was present aiding and abetting therein. But (continues the addition) if the prisoner was within easy call, to aid or assist them in their pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>pose, &amp;c., that is a presence aiding and abetting, and the prisoner is as guilty as if he were personally present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">We are therefore of opinion, that the Hustings court did not err in regard to the said instruction, or the addition thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">The third assignment of error is, that the court erred in giving instruction Ho. 3, which was given on the motion of the attorney for the commonwealth, \u2022and is in these words: \u201cIf the jury believe from the evidence that the prisoner and others concerted and \u2022conspired together to induce, by false representations, \u2022the witness, Joseph M. Fowlkes, or any other persons who might be induced by such representations, to enter the house of the prisoner, and to obtain the \u2022money of such persons by false pretences, or rented his house to be used for such purpose by said conspirators, and that in pursuance of such concert, one of the prisoner\u2019s confederates induced the witness, Joseph M. Fowlkes, to go into said house, and by false representations and pretences did obtain a large \u25a0sum of money from said Joseph M. Fowlkes, and that the prisoner was present, or within easy call, to \u25a0aid or assist them in their purpose, or in escaping, or in getting rid of or misleading the person, from whom such money was obtained, then the prisoner is as guilty as if he himself had obtained the money from 'the said Joseph M. Fowlkes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Certainly the mere fact of renting a house to others to be used by them for the purpose of committing a felony therein would not make the landlord or lessor -a principal, either in the first or second degree, in the felony when committed. But that fact is connected with a good many other facts in the instruction, which would clearly make the accused a principal in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>second degree in the felony charged against him.. The same objection which was urged to the addition, to instruction Wo. 1, was also urged to instruction Wo. 3, to wit: \u201cthat in defining constructive presence, constituting guilt, it wholly omits the essential of' <em>intent </em>to aid in the crime.\u201d But that objection has already been fully answered, and the answer applies-as well in the one case as the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">The fourth assignment of error is, that the court erred in refusing to grant a new trial on the two-grounds on which the motion therefor was founded, viz: 1st, the error of the court in giving and in refusing instructions to the jury as aforesaid; and 2dly, the error of the court in regard to the charge which was given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">In regard to the first ground: we have already shown that there was no error in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">In regard to the other ground: the charge given by the clerk to the jury, by direction of the court, before the evidence was introduced to them, was in the ordinary form of such a charge in a case of larceny,, and is in these words: \u201cTour charge, therefore, is to enquire whether he be guilty of the larceny of which he stands indicted, or not guilty. If you find him guilty, you are further to enquire whether the goods and chattels stolen be of the value of fifty dollars or more; and if you find them to be of the value of fifty dollars or more, you are further to ascertain the term of his confinement in the penitentiary at not less than three nor more than ten years; and if you find the goods or chattels stolen to be of less value than fifty dollars,, say so and no more; and if you find him not guilty, say so and no more. So hearken to the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-12\">The learned counsel was right in arguing that this charge of the clerk was the act of the court; and if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>there be any error in it to the prejudice of the prisoner, it is an error for which the judgment ought to be reversed; as the case cited plainly shows. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Leigh 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">The counsel admits that on the face of the indictment for larceny the charge was correct, the <em>minimum </em>imprisonment for larceny being three years. Code of 1873, p. 1196, \u00a7 14. But the trial, he says, made the case a case, not of larceny, but of false pretences. And he contends that the two cases, of larceny and false pretences, are different from each other, at least in regard to punishment. He seems to admit that an indictment for larceny, in the common form, is sufficient, though the case be one of false pretences; and that the charge to the jury may, in the first place, conform to the indictment. But he argues that if the trial, in other words, the evidence, make a case, not of larceny, but of false pretences, the charge ought to be changed in the course of the trial so as to suit the case thus newly made by the evidence. This, we think, would be a strange incongruity between the <em>allegata </em>and the probata, and would be an anomalous proceeding in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">The law having declared that \u201c if a person obtain, by any false pretence, or token from any person, with intent to defraud, money or other property which may be the subject of larceny, he shall be deemed guilty of the larceny thereof\u201d (Code of 1873, ch. 188, \u00a7 24, p. 1197), has made the offence, to all intents and purposes, larceny; just as if the offender had feloniously stolen, taken and carried away the subject thus obtained by a false pretence or token. And the indictment and charge to the jury may be precisely in the same form in either case. And evidence that the subject was obtained by the accused by false pretence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>with intent to defraud, will sustain the indictment and be consistent with the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">This court has repeatedly declared, that an indictment in such a case may be in the ordinary form of an indictment for larceny at common law; ' and it seems to follow, as a matter of course, that proof of the offence described in the statute will sustain the indictment, and be consistent with a proper charge upon such an indictment. <em>Dowdy\u2019s case, </em>9 Gratt. 727; <em>Leftwich\u2019s case, </em>20 Id. 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">The learned counsel argues, that the two offences, of larceny and obtaining property by false pretences, with intent to defraud, are punished differently and under different sections of the law; that the former is punished more severely, under ch. 188, \u00a7 14, of the Code, which prescribes the punishment of grand larceny to be confinement in the penitentiary for not less than three nor more than ten years; and the latter is punished less severely, under section 24 of the same chapter of the Code, in which the only punishment prescribed is confinement in the penitentiary for not less than one nor more than five years; or, at the discretion of the jury, confinement in jail not more than one year, and a fine of five hundred dollars. He argues, that the punishment prescribed in the latter part of the latter section is not confined to the offence described in that part of the section, to wit; the offence of obtaining, by any false pretence or token, with intent to defraud, the signature of any person to a writing, the false making whereof would be forgery; but extends also to the offence described in the former part of the same section, to wit: the offence of obtaining, as aforesaid, money or other property which may be .the subject of larceny: whereas that part of the section expressly declares that the offence thereby de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>scribed shall be deemed to be larceny; after which the latter part of the section proceeds to declare how the offence therein described shall be punished. He argues, very ingeniously, that the 24th section aforesaid was taken from the 30th section of chapter 4 of what is called the Criminal Code; Acts of 1847-8, p. 103; which embraced both offences, and subjected them to the same punishment, to wit: the punishment prescribed by the latter part of the 24th section aforesaid; and that we ought not to infer an intention in the legislature to increase the punishment of the of-fence described in the former part of the 24th section unless such intention were more plainly manifested than is done by the words, \u201cshall be deemed guilty of the larceny thereof,\u201d inserted in that part of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">How, we can imagine no other reason for inserting those words than to change the punishment of the offence described in the former part of the section, and make it the same with the punishment of larceny as prescribed by section 14 aforesaid. The counsel seems to suppose that the 24th section creates a peculiar kind of larceny, neither grand nor petit, nor punishable as other larcenies, but punishable only as prescribed in the latter part of that section, and without regard to the value of the subject obtained by false pretences, except so far as that consideration might influence the jury in ascertaining the punishment within the prescribed limits. If this be so, why did the legislature make any such change in the language of the section ? Why did they not leave the offence as it was under the Criminal Code? The legislature would no doubt have made the offence described in the latter part of section 24 larceny also, if it had been, in its nature, capable of being so made. But a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>person, in obtaining the signature of another to a writing, as mentioned in that part of the section, could not be said to be guilty of feloniously stealing, taking and carrying away the goods and chattels of another; and therefore the punishment of that offence was left as it had been before. The legislature, in declaring the offence of obtaining property by false pretences, described in the former part of section 24, larceny, only applied to that offence, the same principle which was applied to the offences described by sections 19, 20 and 21 of the same chapter of the Code, p. 1197, to wit: the offences of receiving stolen property, knowing it to have been stolen, and of embezzlement by officers or other persons. The principle had .been applied to these latter offences by the Criminal Code of <em>1847-8; </em>and the legislature, in section 24 aforesaid, only extended the same principle to a new case, to which it seemed to. be equally applicable. In deciding all these offences to be larceny, they were of course to be grand or petit laeeny, according to the value of the subject, as prescribed by section 14 as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">But the Hustings cou\u00bbrt was of opinion that the evidence tended to prove an ordinary case of simple larceny, independently of section 24, and that the charge was proper on that ground also. \"We think this view of the court was also correct. The distinction between eases in which <em>property, </em>and cases in which the mere <em>possession </em>of property is fraudulently obtained from the owner by a person who converts the same to his own use, <em>animo furandi, </em>is well settled and familiar law. The offence in the latter being larceny, but not in the former. 2 Russell on Crimes pp. 24 and 35. On page 45 several cases are referred to which strongly resemble the one under consideration, according to the evidence; as, where it appeared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>that the prisoner decoyed the prosecutor into a public house, and then introduced the play of cutting cards, and that one of them prevailed upon the prosecutor \u2022(who did not play on his own account), to cut the cards for him, and then, under pretence that the prosecutor had cut the cards for himself, and had lost, another of them swept his money off the table and went away with it; it was considered to be one of those cases which should be left to the jury to determine, <em>quo animo </em>the money was obtained, and which would be felony, in case they should find that the money was obtained upon the preconcerted plan to steal it. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Horne </em>&amp;c., 1 Leech, 270. So, if there is a plan to cheat a man of his property under color of a bet, and he parts with the possession only to deposit as a stake with one of the confederates, the taking by such confederate is felonious. The prosecutor was drawn in to deposit twenty guinea notes on a bet that one of the prisoners could not guess right three times successively on the hiding of half a penny, by another of the prisoners, under a pot; he put the notes in the hands of one of the prisoners, and then the other guessing right, the notes were handed over. The question was left to the jury, whether, at the time the notes were taken, there was not a plan between the prisoners that they should be kept, under the false color of winning a bet, and the jury so found. Upon a case reserved, the judges (ten of them being present), held that the conviction was right, because, at the time of the taking, the prosecutor parted with the possession only. Russ. &amp; Ry. 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">Besides the two grounds relied on in support of the motion for a new trial in the court below, ad additional ground was relied on in this court, that if the plaintiff in error was guilty of any offence, it was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>more than a misdemeanor in cheating at a game, anoffence declared by \u00a7 10, of ch. 194 of the Code, p. ' 1214, and this is the subject of the fifth assignment of' error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">What we have already said to show that the offencewhich the evidence tends to prove is a larceny, is a sufficient answer to this assignment of error. If the offence be a larceny it cannot be a misdemeanor, the minor being merged in the major offence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">We are of opinion that there is ho error in the judgment of the Hustings court, and that it ought to-be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
