He had advanced to his son F. S. Sampson from thirty-five to forty thousand dollars, and to his son-in-law Richard Wood a farm on James river, for which he gave $13,500, and which some years afterwards sold for $35,000. He and his wife were old, and their, daughter Josephine lived with them until she was married, and after a short absence she and her husband came back and lived with them until their deaths respectively.

Walker, as executor of Richard Sampson, deceased, and the said Walker and his wife, as devisees of said Sampson, and the other legatees under the will and a codicil which had been made in 1868, to recover her legacy, and her share of the legacy to Mrs. Sampson, and seeking to subject the real estate devised to Mrs. Walker. The plaintiff afterwards married Henry Wood, and the suit was conducted in their name; and after various proceedings, came on to be heard on the 7th of September 1869, when the court held that the will of Richard Sampson did not subject the real estate devised to Mrs. Walker to the satisfaction of the legacies; and that Mrs. Sampson having died in the lifetime of her husband, the legacy to her sunk into the residuum of the estate; and decreed that the bill, so far as it sought to subject the real estate to the satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s legacy, and to recover a share of the legacy to Mrs. Sampson, be dismissed. \"And the report of the commissioner was recommitted. From this decree Wood and wife applied to this court for an appeal; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b867-4\"><em>Jones $ Bouldin, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b867-5\"><em>Guy, </em>for the executor.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b865-13\"> He had been counsel in the eause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b867-6\">Staples, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AAPr\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">The court is of opinion, that whether general pecuniary legacies are chargable on real estate is always a question of intention; that this intention is to be ascertained, not by parol proof of the declarations of' the testator, but by reference, as in other cases, to the provisions of the will and the circumstances surround<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>ing its author. And in examining the instrument, the language used must receive that interpretation which a long series of decisions have attached to particular words. One of the rules or canons of construction is, that where there is a general gift of legacies, and then the testator gives the rest and residue of his property, real and personal, the legacies are chargeable upon the realty. It is considered that the testator, in blending his real and personal estate into a common fund, plainly indicates his purpose to make no distinction between them. And as there is no previous devise of any portion of the real estate, the residue can only mean what remains after satisfying the legacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">This is the established doctrine of the English courts; is almost universally recognized in this country; and was acted on by the court in <em>Crouch </em>v. <em>Davis\u2019 ex\u2019or, </em>23 Gratt. 62; where the authorities are cited. See <em>Greeville </em>v. <em>Brown, 7 </em>House of Lords cases 688; <em>Smith\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Smith, 17 </em>Gratt. 268. In the present case the testator, after various pecuniary legacies to a large amount, gives all his <em>remaining estate, </em>property and credits, real and personal, to his daughter, Mrs. Susan J. Walker. The testator in thus using the words \u201cremaining estate,\u201d can only mean what remains after the previous dispositions; and as there is no previous disposition of any part of the realty, the legacies must be looked to to satisfy the terms of the residuary clause. The court is therefore of opinion that the Circuit court erred in holding that the legacies given by the testator are not chargable upon his real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">The court is further of opinion that Mrs. Mary \u25a0Sampson, the wife of the testator, having died during his lifetime, leaving issue who survived the testator, the .legacy of twenty thousand dollars which was given to her passed to her issue under the provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>13th section, chap. 122, Code of 1860. That section declares that \u201cif a devisee or legatee die before the testator leaving issue who survive the testator, such issue shall take the estate devised or bequeathed, as the devisee or legatee would have done if he had sur- \u00b0 vived the testator, unless a different disposition thereof be made or required by the will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">There is nothing in the will here indicating in the slightest degree, that the testator designed or desired a different disposition of the legacy from that pointed out by. the statute. The court is therefore of opinion that the Circuit court erred in holding that the legacy aforesaid lapsed by the death of Mrs. Sampson in the lifetime of her husband, and passed into the residuum of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">For these errors the decree must be reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings in conformity with these views.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
