In July 1871 H became the surety of B as collector of township B. At that time the taxes for that year, by law, went into the hands of the collector on the 1st of September, and were to be accounted for to the county treasurer on the 1st of December. After the execution of the bond by H, there -were several extensions, by joint resolutions and statutes of the general assembly, of the time in which collectors should make their settlements with the county treasurers.

Where new duties are imposed upon a public officer by statute after the execution of his official bond by his surety: the bond should be held good against the surety to the extent of the duties lawfully covered by it, though it may not be good as to the new duties imposed since its execution.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b791-13\">John Q. A. Barham, who had been appointed collector of the township of Berlin and Ivor, in the county of Southampton, having been required to give \u00e1 new bond, he, with Peter J. Holmes, executed their bond, bearing date the 18th of September 1871, in the penalty of $2,000; with condition reciting the fact that said Barham has been required to give a new bond as such collector, and says, \u201cHow if the said John Q. A. Barham shall faithfully discharge the duties of said office according to law, then the above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>obligation to be void, else to remain in full force and virtue.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b792-9\">In June 1873, James M. Corbitt, treasurer of Southampton, gave notice to Barham and Holmes, that in the name of the commonwealth he would move the County court of Southampton, on the first day of the July term 1873, for a judgment and award of execution against them for the sum of $910.28, with damages thereon at the rate of ten <em>per cent, </em>per month, from May 2d, 1873, until paid; .which said sum was the balance due from John Q. A. Barham, collector of Berlin and Ivor township in Southampton county, on account of state taxes for the year 1872.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b792-10\">Before the day fixed for the motion to the court, Holmes applied for and obtained an injunction to the proceeding; on the ground that by several acts and resolutions of the general assembly which he refers to in his bill, time for the payment of the taxes had been allowed to the collector, and other duties had been imposed upon him, without the consent of the plaintiff;' and that therefore and thereby he had been released from his liability as surety on the bond of Barham.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b792-11\">The cause was docketed by consent, and by like consent came on to be heard upon the bill and exhibits, upon a motion by the treasurer to dissolve the injunction. But the court overruled the motion, and made the injunction perpetual. From this decree the commonwealth obtained an appeal to the Circuit court of Southampton county; where it was affirmed. And then the commonwealth applied to this court for an appeal; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b792-12\"><em>The Attorney General, </em>for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b792-13\"><em>Friend </em>and <em>Davis, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b793-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>Bouldin, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AMQ\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-3\">The appellee, Holmes, was surety for one who qualified as collector of Berlin and Ivor township, in Southampton county, for the year commencing July 1,1871, and ending July 1,1872. At the time of Bar-ham\u2019s qualification, and when he gave the bond with Holmes as surety (which was a new bond required by the County court), the taxes for that year went into the hands of the collector on the 1st of September 1871, and were to be accounted for to the county treasurer on the first of December following, and for default of duty in this respect, legal proceedings were to be instituted by the said treasurer. Subsequent to the execution of the bond aforesaid, and whilst Barham was in office, there were sundry extensions by joint resolutions and by statutes of the general assembly, of the time within which the collector should make his settlements with the county treasurer, without the assent of his surety; and the question before us is, what is the effect of these extensions on the obligation of Holmes as surety?</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">It was contended for Holmes, and was held by the Circuit court, that all the provisions of the statute on this subject, existing at the date of his bond, entered into and formed a part of his contract as surety, and that the extensions referred to being made without his consent, discharged him from his obligation. Is this law?</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">It is unquestionably true, as a well established principle of equity law, that a surety can only be held bound by his contract as he made it, and that he will be discharged if, by any binding agreement for indulgence to his principal or otherwise, his contract is materially altered or varied by the creditor without his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>consent. And it is also true that this principle applies ^ # A <em>x </em>x alike to sureties in official bonds and private obligations. The <em>contract </em>of the surety cannot be so varied or extended in either case without his consent. What contrac* rea^J is becomes then the all important inquiry. When that is ascertained the application of the principle is without difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">In cases of suretyship, in private and individual obligations for the payment of money, there can rarely arise any serious difficulty as to the nature and extent of the surety\u2019s liability. But when, as here, his obligation is that a public officer shall discharge his duties according to law, the delicate and important question at once arises, what is that law according to which the officer is to discharge his duties? The appellee\u2019s counsel insist, and cite authority to show, that it is the law existing at the date of the contract, and that alone. Ho Virginia authority has been cited to that point; and a just interpretation of the words, anda due regard to the nature and object of the bond and the office would perhaps justify us in holding that the condition of the bond was to secure the due discharge by the officer of all such reasonable duties gertnain to the office as might be imposed by law during his continuance therein; that the legislature could not have intended by taking bond to secure the public interest, to deprive itself of the power of otherwise contributing to the same end in a proper way without first obtaining the consent of the surety. It would perhaps not be unreasonable to hold, under such a bond as this, that the legislature had not intended to do, and had not done an act so inconvenient and indeed so prejudicial to the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">But without deciding that proposition, and conceding, as a general rule, that the law at the date of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>contract is the law, and the only law, which enters into and forms part of the sureties\u2019 contract, the question again arises, what part of that law is it which enters into and forms part of the sureties\u2019 contract?</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">For the purposes of this case that question may he more conveniently answered by showing what kind of laws do <em>not </em>enter into the sureties\u2019 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Laws, then, merely directory to the officers of government, requiring that settlements shall be made at short and stated periods \u201c are provisions of law created by the government for its own security and protection, and to regulate the conduct of its own officers. They are merely directory to such officers, <em>and constitute no part of the contract of the </em>surety.\u201d Mr. Justice Story delivering the opinion of the Supreme court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>9 Wheat. R. 720, 736\u2014\u20197.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">In the <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vanzandt, </em>11 Wheat. R. 184, Mr. Justice Washington, delivering the opinion of the court, confirms the authority of the <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick; </em>and speaking of analogous provisions made in that case for the safety of the public, he says, p. 190, \u201c The provisions in both laws are merely directory to the officers, and intended for the security and protection of government, by insuring punctuality and responsibility; <em>but they form no part of the contract with the \u25a0surety.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">The same principle is reaffirmed in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nicholl, </em>12 Wheat. R. 509, and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Boyd &amp; others, </em>15 Peters R. 187, 208. In the last mentioned case Mr. Justice Catron says for the court: \u201cThe regulations requiring settlements to be made by its officers at short periods, are designed for the protection of the government, and merely directory to the officers, and <em>form no part </em>of the contract. Such is the settled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>doctrine of this court as holden in <em>The United States </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>9 Wheat. 720; <em>The United States </em>v. <em>Vanzandt, </em>11 Wheat. 184; and <em>The United States </em>v. <em>Nicholl, </em>12 Wheat. 509.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">The force of these principles have been attempted to be averted by the counsel for the appellee, by showing that the question directly decided in each of the cases involved <em>laches </em>merely; and not a change or violation of the sureties\u2019 contract. That is true; but it is equally true, that in order to reach that question it became necessary for the court to inquire and decide what the <em>contract </em>of the surety really was; and it was held unanimously in all the cases, that these directory regulations for prompt settlements were regulations for the protection and security of the government, and formed no part of the contract of the surety. Forming no part of that contract, it follows as a necessary consequence, that like any other act of a like nature, the provision may be extended, altered or repealed at the will of the legislature, and without the assent of the surety, looking alone to the public interest. And we think, as a general rule, that what in such a case will advance the public good, will at the same time protect the interest of the surety. Indeed the indulgence granted to the officer by the extension of time in this case, is not a contract, but is an ordinary act of legislation for the public good, with no consideration for the extension moving from the officer; and is repealable at the will of the general assembly. Such extension was held, and we think correctly, by the Supreme court of Maryland,'in the case of the <em>State </em>v. <em>Carleton &amp;c., </em>1 Gill R. 249, 258, not to operate as a discharge to the sureties. \u201c The law was not considered as binding or obligatory upon the.state, but alterable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>by tbe legislature at their pleasure, whenever the interest or convenience of the state might require it.\u201d And this we think is the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">Several cases in the English courts have been cited in seeming conflict with these views. Were that actually so, we would not hesitate to disregard their authority, however high may be our respect for the source from which they come. But when carefully examined, these cases will be easily distinguished from the case in judgment. They were cases in which such new and additional duties were imposed on the officer as to make the office itself, in the opinion of the court, <em>a new </em>office, to which, of course, the contract of the surety did not extend. This is merely the conceded doctrine that you cannot enlarge or materially vary the surety\u2019s contract without his consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Two cases from the Supreme court of Illinois, reported in first and second Gilman, which seem to be very much in point, have also been relied on for the appellee. On these cases we will only say, that they seem to be in conflict with the principles established by the Supreme court of the United States and the Supreme court of Maryland in the cases above <em>cited; </em>and we think the latter the better law, and approve them.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">But it was further argued, that the act of the 19th of March 1872, superadded the duties of constable, in relation to the collection of small claims, to the duties of collector as existing at the date of the bond, and thereby clearly varied the contract of the surety and discharged him, under the authority of <em>Pybus </em>v. <em>Gibbs &amp; als., </em>88 Eng. C. L. R. 902, and other English cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">It may be enough to say that the act referred to was general, and in its nature prospective. But in the par-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>^cu^ar addition, of duty relied on, it is so in express terms. It is provided expressly that in this respect the shall be effective from the first of July thereafter, that being the date of the legal expiration of the then existing: term of the collector\u2019s office, and the com- \u00b0 mencement of the term of a newly elected collector, whose bond would cover these new duties. This plainly manifests a purpose on the part of the general assembly to avoid interference with existing rights of sureties to the bond; and it will be found also that the duties thus devolved'on the collector after the 1st of July 1872 were, from the <em>same date, </em>taken from the constable; both acts showing that existing obligations were not intended to be affected by the change of duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">But it might perhaps be said that it may be reasonably concluded in this case that the old collector held over, as there is in the record no evidence of a new qualification of collector, and in that event his duties .were, after the 1st of July, 1872, the duties imposed by the act of March 19, 1872; and these duties being such under the English authorities as would discharge the sureties, the surety in this case is discharged, whether the default was a failure to discharge the new \u25a0duties not covered by the bond or the old duties which were protected by the bond. Such seems to be the result of <em>Pybus </em>v. <em>Gibbs </em>&amp;c., and the other cases cited from the common law reports. The principle thus affirmed by the English decisions does not commend itself to the judgment of this court as just and reasonable, and we should hesitate to follow it were there no authority against it, but we have against it the opinion of the Supreme court of the United States in the case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>9 Wheaton, already cited, in which in an analogous case Judge Story says, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>the bond should be held good to the extent of the duties lawfully covered thereby. This, we think, the more just and equitable rule. It would seem to be unreasonable to hold that an obligation ample and valid to secure the due performance of duties should be avoided as to those duties by reason of an ineffectual effort by statute to engraft on it other duties. It would seem reasonable in such case to hold the statute void and the bond good.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
