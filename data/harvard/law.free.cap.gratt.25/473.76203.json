In a chancery cause, the court directs an issue to be tried at its bar. This issue is tried on the common law side of the court and the verdict is certified to the chancery side of the court; and there is a motion to set it aside and for a new trial. The court sets aside the verdict and directs a new trial of the issue as amended by him; he being the same judge who presided at the trial of the issue.\u2014Held :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b493-7\">1. It is not necessary for the judge sitting on the common law side of the court to certify to himself on the chancery side, that he is dissatisfied with the verdict; but he may set it aside without such certificate.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b493-9\">2. Another judge holding a subsequent term cannot set aside the order of the judge at the previous term and reinstate the verdict.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b493-11\">3. If the party objecting to set aside the verdict is dissatisfied with the order, he should except to it, and have the facts proved on trial, or the evidence spread upon the record, and thus the order may be reviewed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-13\">This was a suit in equity in the Circuit court of Rockbridge county, instituted in June 1859 by Abraham Lavell against William M. Gold\u2019s administrator, to set up and recover the amount of a bond for $1,701, which the plaintiff alleged William M. Gold had executed to him on the 5th of September, 1856, and which he had lost in October 1858; and upon which there was endorsed a credit for $400, and another for \u2022$200.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-14\">Gold\u2019s administrator answered, and admitting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>possibly the plaintiff held the bond of his intestate,, on which a small balance might be due, he believes said bond was not lost, but the loss was feigned, in order to gain more'than the face and the endorsements, on the bond would give him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-11\">An immense amount of testimony was taken in the-case; and on the 23d of April 1868 the court made an order, that a jury be empannelled at the bar of this court, and sworn to try the following issues:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-12\">1st. Did William M. Gold, in his lifetime, execute and deliver to the plaintiff, A. Lavell, a writing obligatory, or a note in writing, binding the said William M. Gold to pay the plaintiff the sum of one thousand seven hundred and one dollars; if so, when and what sums, if any, were paid on said obligation or note in writing by said William M. Gold, and at what dates., 2d. If such bond or note was so executed and delivered, has the same been lost or casually destroyed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-13\">The issue came on to be tried in December 1868, at a special term of the court, when the jury found that William M. Gold in his lifetime did not execute and deliver to the plaintiff, A. Lavell, a writing obligatory, or a note in writing, binding said Gold to pay the plaintiff the sum of $1,701; and that no such bond orn\u00f3te in writing has been lost or casually destroyed. All which was ordered to be certified, with the costs of both parties on the trial of the issues, to the chancery side of this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-14\">Whereupon, the plaintiff' moved the court to set aside the verdict of the jury, and to grant him a new trial. And on the 17th of December 1868 \u201cthe-cause came on to be further heard upon the papers formerly read, and upon the verdict of the jury upon the-issues directed to be tried at the bar of this court, and upon the motion of the plaintiff for a new trial upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>said issues: On consideration whereof, the court, not being satisfied with the verdict, doth set the same aside, and doth order and decree that the former order directing an issue be amended, so as to omit the second issue; the matter therein directed to be enquired of by the jury being proper for the consideration of the court, and there being evidence enough in the record to enable this court to decide the question suggested in said second issue upon the decision of the questions involved in the first.\u201d It was therefore, for reasons stated, ordered that the first named issue be certified for trial at the bar of the Circuit court of Bath county, &amp;c. And liberty was given the parties to take further testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-4\">At the April term of the court for 1869, on the 17th of April, the order made in the cause on the 17th of December 1868 was set aside. And on the 21st of July 1871 the cause came on to be heard upon the papers formerly read, and the order of the -court of April 1869, setting aside the order of December 1868, and the cause now standing upon the verdict of the jury, and the court seeing no reason to set aside said verdict, confirmed the same; and made a decree that the bill be dismissed with costs. And, thereupon, A. Lavell applied to a judge of this court for an appeal; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b495-5\"><em>Sheffey g Bumgardner, Letcher </em>and <em>Pendleton, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b495-6\"><em>Tucker Christian, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b495-7\">Anderson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APT\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Where an issue out of chancery was directed to be-tried at the bar of the common law court, it was a. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>well established rule of practice, before the common law and chancery jurisdictions were united in the same judge, that the verdict of the jury should, be certified by the judge before whom the issue was tried to the chancellor; and that a motion to set aside the verdict, and to direct a new trial, could not be entertained by the common law court, but must be made in the chancery court. But if the judge of the common law court, certified to the chancellor that the verdict was against evidence, it was the duty of the chancellor, at least, if there had not been more than one trial, to set aside the verdict and award a new trial. In <em>Grigsby </em>v. Weaver, 5 Leigh 197, the judge before whom the.issue was tried, certified not only that the verdict was against evidence, but also the facts proved. The chancellor not only refused to direct a new trial, but entered a decree, founded upon the verdict, dismissing the bill. And the Court of Appeals\u2014only three judges sitting\u2014affirmed the decree; Broekenbrough, J., dissenting. Judge Carr, referring to <em>Pleasants &amp; als. </em>v. Ross, 1 Wash. 156, and <em>Southall </em>v. McKeand, 1 Wash. 336, says, the farthest they go, is to hold, that as a general rule the chancellor ought not to be satisfied, where the certificate is against the verdict; admitting at the same time that the rule only holds where there is no circumstance appearing to vary the case. Brooke, J., says, that \u201cif the judge had certified the verdict was contrary to the evidence, <em>\u25a0and no more\u201d </em>he (the chancellor) would have been bound to direct a new trial. Judge Brockenbrough \u25a0did not think it clear that the judge had no other evidence than what he certified. And he thought the chancellor erred in confirming the verdict and decreeing upon it. He says no case has been produced, in which after a single trial, the certificate of the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>against the verdict has been entirely disregarded. In that case all the judges concurred in the general rule, that where the judge before whom the issue is tried certifies to the chancellor against the verdict, it is the duty of the chancellor to set it aside, unless it appears from the evidence certified, or circumstances varying the case, that the verdict was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Since the union of the two jurisdictions of law and chancery in Virginia, although it is the policy of the law, that the distinctive character of the two jurisdictions shall be preserved in the exercise of their respective functions, yet, as prior to the union of the two jurisdictions, the issue might be tried at the bar of either, it cannot <em>now </em>be a matter of any consideration whether it is tried on the common law or the chancery side of the court. \u00a3Tor can it be material, as the issue is to be tried before the same judge, whether tried on the common law or chancery side of the court, to require the verdict to be certified to the same judge who presided at the trial. Though it might be well to observe this formality, it would be going too far to hold, that the order made by the judge, on the chancery side of his court, in the cause there depending, setting aside the verdict, which he thought contrary to the evidence, should be reversed, because he had not observed the formality of certifying to himself that it was against evidence. The court is therefore of opinion that there was no error in the decretal order made in this cause on the 17th day of September 1868, setting aside the verdict and directing a new trial of the issue, as altered and modified in said order; being of opinion that section 15 of eh. 177, Code of 1860, p. 738, was never designed to take from a court of chancery the power to direct a new trial of an issue in a cause depending therein.</p>\n<p id=\"AHX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>^he court is further of opinion that the subsequent order made in the cause, on the 17th of April 1869, setting aside the decretal order of 1868, is unwarranted by anything appearing on the face of the record. We have seen that said decretal order was valid; that it rendered null and void the verdict, and directed a new trial of the issue. If the defendant had felt himself aggrieved by the order setting aside the verdict, he might have excepted to the ruling of the court, and had the facts proved at the trial, or the evidence spread upon the record, and thus said order might be reviewed. But that was not done, and there is nothing in the record to show that said order was erroneous. That decretal order could only be rescinded, and the verdict which it annulled revived, for cause appearing upon the face of the record. No such cause appears, and nothing even assigned as cause for its rescission. It could not have been set aside at a subsequent term, by the arbitrary order of the same judge who made it, much less by another judge who did hot preside at the trial of the issue, and who was not informed, so far as this record shows, of what was proved on the trial of the issue. If, when the courts were separate, it was error for the chancellor, not knowing what had been proved on the trial, to ratify the verdict, which had been certified by the judge who presided at the trial to be against evidence, much more would it be error for a judge who had not presided at the trial, nor been informed as to what was proved, to rescind at a subsequent term the decretal order of the judge who had presided at the trial, setting aside the verdict, and directing a new trial. It does not appear that the judge who set aside the decretal order of 1868, and restored the verdict, was informed as to what was proved' on the trial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>issue, or that he was the same judge who had at a previous term set aside the verdict. It is a fact that he was not the same judge, which may be judicially known, though not appearing upon this record, being evidenced by the public records of the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">The court is further of opinion that the final decree in this cause being founded upon the aforesaid erroneous order and abrogated verdict, is likewise erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The court is therefore of opinion, without looking into the merits of this case, or indicating any opinion thereon, to reverse said decree with costs, to set aside and annul the order of April 17th, 1869, which sets aside the decretal order of December 17th, 1868, and to remand the cause for further proceedings to be had therein in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The decree was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The court is of opinion, for reasons stated in writing, and filed with the record, that there is no error in the decretal order of the 17th day of December 1868, setting aside the verdict of the jury, and directing a new trial on the issue as amended; and that the order of April 17th, 1869, setting aside said decretal order is erroneous, and should be set aside and annulled; and consequently that the decree of July 21st, 1871, founded upon said verdict, is erroneous. It is therefore ordered and decreed that the said last mentioned decree, and the said order of April 17th,. 1869, be reversed and annulled; and that the appellee, out of the estate of his intestate, pay to the appellant his costs expended in the prosecution of his appeal aforesaid here; and the cause is remanded to the said Circuit court of Rockbridge county, for further proceedings to be had therein in conformity with this decree, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>without prejudice to the right of said Circuit court to make any change in the decretal order of December 1868, as to the court at whose bar the issue shall be tried, as may be deemed proper under the circumstances as they may then appear. Which is ordered to be certified to the said Circuit court of Rockbridge county.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
