The widow died in i860, when W and R took possession of the slaves, and divided them between them, and held them until two died in 1862, and the others were freed by the results of the war. In 1861 H, another son of K, brought suit to have the slaves valued.

Kenny, and their three \u00absisters, an equal part with themselves, to be paid in trade at trade prices. And they are to have five years to pay for them. My object for doing this is to keep them all together, where they will be well treated.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-12\">The slaves were four, and the widow went into possession of them, and held them until her death in September 1860, when they went into the possession of Robert and William Kenny, who divided them between them, and they remained in their possession until two of them died, and the other two were freed by the results of the war.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-13\">In February 1861, Hance H. Kenny instituted a suit in equity against Robert and William Kenny and the other parties interested, in which after setting out the foregoing facts, he said that a difficulty had occurred as to how the valuation of the slaves should be made; that the County court, on the application of the plaintiff, had appointed three men to make the valuation; but the said Robert and William Kenny refused to let them be valued, and still hold them and refuse to let them be valued. They ask for a construction of the will, and that the provision as to the slaves may be carried out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>The defendants appeared but did not answer, as all the facts were set out in the bill and exhibits; and it was agreed that the court might decide all questions as upon a bill taken for confessed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-4\">The court made a decree appointing commissioners to value the slaves, in a mode stated in the decree; and upon the return of their report, made a decree in favor of the different parties, according to the report. Thom this decree Robert and William Kenny took an \u2022appeal, and in May 1867 the decree was reversed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-5\">When the cause went back, Robert Kenney aud the administrators of William Kenny filed their answer. They say that the slaves went into the possession of the widow of the testator, and were held by her until her death in September 1860; and that after her death they came into the possession of Robert and William Kenny, Jr., the executors of William Kenny, Sr., as a portion of the unadministered assets of their testator; and so remained in their possession until they ceased to be property, by the death of two of them in 1862, and as to the other two, by the results of the war. They deny that they ever took or held possession of the said slaves in their own right, as their own property, or that they ever considered or treated them as their own property; and, indeed, they had no right to do so until said slaves were valued and appraised to them in the mode directed by the will of William Kenny. They deny that they have refused to have the slaves valued at the proper time and by the proper persons, according to the plainly expressed will of the testator, but they were always willing to have them so valued. And they insist that the legacy was coupled with a \u2022condition that the slaves should be valued; and until this was done, they were not bound to make their \u2022election whether they would take them and pay to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>other children their shares of the value; and that the said slaves having ceased to be property, they have no \u25a0 choice left and cannot be compelled to pay their-brother and sisters for property which never came into their possession as a legacy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-11\">There was evidence taken as to the value of the slaves; but it was finally agreed by the parties, that the four should be valued each at $1,250. This court held the evidence showed clearly that Robert and William Kenny took the slaves into their possession on the death of their mother, and held them as their-own, until they died or were freed as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-12\">Robert and William Kenny having died, the suit was revived against their administrators; and the-cause came on to be heard on the 9th of September 1870, when the court held that Robert and William Kenny, in their lifetime, made their election to take- and hold the said slaves, and that they were concluded by such election. And decreed against their administrators in favor of the other parties, each for one-sixth of the agreed value of the slaves. And the administrators thereupon applied to this court for an appeal; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b316-13\">J. <em>N.

There is no doubt about the general rule; but the question of its application to this case does not.ai\u2019ise, as there has been here no rejection in fact of any of the provisions of the testator\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">It is very clear, on a just construction of the will, that the testator, after having bequeathed the slaves in question to his wife for life, bequeathed the same \u201cafter the death of his widow to the appellants,Robert Kenny and William Kenny, who were to pay each of the other children of the testator an equal proportionate part with the said appellants respectively of the value of said slaves, viz: one-sixth part to each child,\u201d such value to be ascertained as provided in the will. About this there can be no doubt, as the proposition announced is in the very words of this court when construing the will on a former appeal in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">On the death then of the testator\u2019s widow, the legatees, Robert and William Kenny, were entitled to the slaves on the terms of the will; and if they were willing to accept the legacies, it was their absolute and unqualified right to take immediate possession of the slaves and to hold the same as their own property without the intervention or assent of the executors, whose office in this respect was fully discharged when the slaves were delivered to the life tenant. The valuation of the slaves, and the payment by Robert and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>\"William Kenny to their brother and sisters respectively, of their due proportions of such value in the mode and within the period prescribed by the testator were matters outside, and wholly independent of the <em>title </em>to the slaves. The title to the slaves passed to the legatees in remainder, by operation of law, immediately on the death of the life tenant, unless rejected by them; and it was competent to them to signify their acceptance of the legacies by receiving and holding the slaves as their own property under the will while awaiting a valuation thereof. Such a course was convenient in itself, and could not result in any practical, mischief. Whether they did so take and hold or not is purely a question of fact; and we think the affirmative is abundantly established by the evidence in the case. They took possession of the slaves, as they had a right to do, immediately on the death of the life tenant, not as executors, but in their own right as legatees. They denied that they belonged to the estate\u2014refused to allow them to be hired out pending the controversy as to the mode of valuation\u2014claimed them as their own property under the will\u2014actually divided them between themselves as such very soon after the life tenant\u2019s death\u2014and so held them respectively, until they perished on their respective hands by death and the results of the war. In the face of these facts it was too late, in March 1868, for them or their personal representatives to pretend for the first time, that they held as executors, and had not accepted the legacies, when more than eight years had elapsed since they had actually divided the slaves between themselves as legatees, when nearly three years had elapsed since the close of the war, and when the slaves themselves had long since perished in their individual \u2022service\u2014two of them by death, and the others by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>results of the war. Under such circumstances we think their acceptance of the legacies was final and complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">We are of opinion, therefore, that there is no error in the decree complained of, and that the same be \u25a0affirmed with costs and damages to the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">Degree aeeirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
