The prayer of the petitioner was that a citation might be issued directed to the parties in interest, commanding them to appear in court and show cause why the said decision of the register should not be reversed, and why the probating of the alleged will and the letters, granted thereon should not be revoked; and directing also to W. S. Hopkins, Esq., register of wills, commanding him to produce in this court the records and files in his office made and entered concerning the matter aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-4\">The answer of J. H. Hopkins, deputy register of wills, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-5\">That he was subpoenaed to produce the caveat filed against the probate of the will of Hiram Nichols on the 5th day of October, 1886, on a rule to take depositions at the office of Hulslander and Vosburg in the above estate, and was there sworn and stated that he had made diligent search for the said caveat and that it could not be found; that he had been requested to search for it on several different occasions by James Nichols, and that he did search for it at the time he was deputy register, six years ago, but that at no time was he able to find it until searching for it on the 20th day of July, 1895, he found it among old files belonging to another estate in the register\u2019s office, and the same is returned to this court with the other files belonging to said estate in obedience to said citation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\">The court filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-7\">The petition for appeal shows that the will was probated October 6, 1886. The proceedings from which this appeal is sought to be taken were for the purpose of calling that decree in question, and that is the purpose here. This is too late. The decree of probate is conclusive as to personalty after three years, and as to real estate after five. The mere fact that there was an undisposed-of caveat pending before the register during this time does not affect this.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-8\">The caveator was bound to move upon his caveat within a proper time or it became ineffective ; in fact the probate dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>posed of it right or wrong. That probate certainly was not void, however irregular. The petition for an appeal is dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree dismissing petition.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-6\"><em>A.

He may hear testimony, both for and against their admission to probate, and he may then, in the exercise of a legal discretion, decide upon it, or refer it to a jury, and his decision may be examined on appeal: Wikoff\u2019s App., 15 Pa. 281; Miller\u2019s App., 166 Pa. 97.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-13\">The decision of the register in the first instance is conclusive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>and if unappealed from by tbe party aggrieved, he is concluded: Shermer\u2019s App., 44 Pa. 396; Ottinger v.

Tbe purpose of that appeal was to call in question and set aside tbe decree of tbe register admitting tbe will to probate nearly nine years before. The petition was dismissed on tbe ground that it was too late; and thereupon tbe appeal now before us was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">As is clearly shown in tbe brief opinion of the' court below, there is no merit in tbe appellant\u2019s case. For reasons given in that opinion tbe decree of tbe orphans\u2019 court is affirmed, and tbe appeal is dismissed with costs to be paid by tbe appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
