Before Ebmenteout, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-5\">At the trial it appeared that about eight o\u2019clock on the evening of June 22,1892, the plaintiff, at that time about six years \u2022of age, was struck and injured by one of defendant\u2019s electric cars. Just before the accident plaintiff had started across the street, and then stopped. When the car which struck her was about ten feet from her, she turned suddenly and ran upon the track, and was struck upon the shoulder. It appeared that from the time the child started to run towards the track, until the car was stopped, the car traveled about eighteen feet. The evidence as to the speed of the car was conflicting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-6\">\u25a0Plaintiff\u2019s points among others were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-7\">8. The defendant\u2019s motorman, having, as a witness for the defendant, testified he first saw the plaintiff on the curbstone, and that he saw her stepping from the curbstone into the gutter, which was in the direction of the railway track, \u2014 if. the jury believe that the action and attitude of the child were such as should have indicated to a reasonably cautious man an intent to get upon or across the track, it is the motorman\u2019s duty by \u2022checking the speed of the car, by ringing of the gong, or by other proper and reasonable precautions, to have guarded against the accident. <em>Answer : </em>This point I would affirm if the facts were correctly stated in it, but there is nothing in the evidence of the motorman or any other witness to this accident, to show the action of this child indicated an intention to cross the street until within ten feet from the place of contact, and then he swears, together with the witnesses who were there at the time, that he did all he could to prevent the accident. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-8\">5. The defendant\u2019s motorman having, as a witness for the defendant, testified that he turned off the power, and tried to slacken the speed of the car by applying the brakes only when he was within ten feet of the plaintiff, \u2014 if the jury believe that the defendant could have avoided the accident if the motorman had slackened the speed of the car as soon as he saw the child in the gutter or upon the street, then it was negligence in not having done so. <em>Answer: </em>This point I cannot affirm. It was not incumbent upon the motorman to slacken the speed of the car , or to stop the car simply because he may have seen somebody standing in the gutter. While she was standing in the gutter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>there was no possibility of running over her, and there is no evidence to show any attitude or anything in the manner.of the child that would indicate to anybody that she was about to run across the street or upon the track, or in front of the car.

There is no evidence of negligence on the part of the motorman. He could not anticipate the sudden action of the child in attempting to cross the track immediately in front of the car, and his failure to do so is not negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
