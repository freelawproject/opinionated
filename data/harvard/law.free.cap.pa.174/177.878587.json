T., 1896, by Otto Walther et al., from order of Q. S.

Before Clayton, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-4\">From the record it appeared that the draft accompanying the petition was indescriptive of the land proposed to be annexed. The case was referred to J. N. Shanafelt, Esq., as master, who filed a report recommending a decree in accordance with the prayer of the petition. The master\u2019s report was confirmed. Before the final decree was entered the record was amended by filing an accurate description of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-5\">Objection was made that some of the persons who signed the petition were not taxables; upon this subject the master found as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-6\">Who are the taxables ? Who pay taxes in this part of the township ? We have:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-7\">1st. Those who pay or should pay taxes on land and reside in the section.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-8\">2d. Those who pay or should pay a school tax not owning land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-9\">3d. Those who pay or should pay a county tax not owning land and reside in the section.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-10\">4th. Those who pay or should pay a state tax whether landowners or not, who reside in the section.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-11\">The fact that these petitioners lived at the time they signed this petition in this section of the township, and were all of age and voters, most of them being on the registry list, made them taxable inhabitants; whether they paid taxes or not made no difference, as they were subject to and liable for a tax. To say that they are not is to say that a real estate owner who does not pay his taxes on his land is not a taxable inhabitant. The collector could by not collecting the taxes make every citizen in the township a noninhabitant, a power too extensive to be thought of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-12\">The petition was signed by eighteen persons. Of these we find on the assessment made in the fall of 1893: Joseph H. Waddell, T. K. Gartside, Thomas Lambert, William Weaver, N. J. Robinson, Joseph P. Moore, John Burk, Lewis J. Moore, David Moore, Jokn Moore, Lewis Thomas, Patrick Green and John Watterson; in number, thirteen. All of these were proved to have lived in that section in March, 1893.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-13\">The following four- persons, while not shown in assessment, were proved to be living there in March of 1893, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Henry Cheeseman. John Flower testified that he was a resident, and he himself testified the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-4\">James J. Moore. Was of age; had voted. John Flower testified he was a resident there; subpoena was served on him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-5\">H. H. Hoskins. Subpoena was served on him; his name is on the registry list and S. J. Cochran testified he was a resident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-6\">George Sharron. His name is on the registry list, and J. Harvey testified he was a resident there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-7\">This makes seventeen persons proved to have lived in the section who signed petitions in regard to whom there can be no doubt as to their right to be termed \u201ctaxable inhabitants.\u201d The remaining person, J. C. Madden, there is some doubt about. The best evidence produced to prove him a resident is that of Job Wheaton. Wheaton served a subpoena on him at 1101 Kerlin street, and Malden told lfim he lived there and had signed the petition. Tins, with Ms name on the petition, without the exceptant provmg he was not a resident, must be taken as proof that he was such and he should be counted. This makes eighteen persons signing. This number is tMee fifths of tMrty, and it must be shown that there were tMrty-one \u201c taxable inhabitants\u201d in the section in March, 1893, to defeat the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-8\">In addition to the above eighteen the exceptants have proved the following residents: James Clayton, John M. Clayton, Thomas Emory, Henry Simpers, Isaac Cooper, Thomas Clayton, J. N. SMelds, Stephen Cheeseman, or CMlsman, and D. or T. Christy, or nine in all, maldng twenty-seven residents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-9\">Mr. J. Harvey testified that Wm. Hannum, whom they attempt to prove a resident, lived at Maddux, out of the section.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-10\">David CMisman, whom they prove as on the registry list, with Stephen Cheeseman, Ms son, must be the same as A. Cheeseman, as it was shown they lived in the Pennell house. Cheeseman said he had lived there two years and David Harvey said there were two Cheesemans. Now only one Cheese-man appears m tMs case, and the only testimony as to any Chrismans was that of the registry book. Neither Harvey nor Flower speak of them, while every one knew the Cheesemans. And it is not likely that both families lived in the Pennell house at the same time..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-11\">Your master would therefore recommend that a decree be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>entered by tbe said court annexing tbe said part of Chester township to the city of Chester as set out in the petition hereto annexed and the accompanying plan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-4\"><em>JErrors assigned </em>were decree in dismissing exceptions to the master\u2019s report, and decree permitting amendment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-5\"><em>O. B. Dickinson, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azg\">The master\u2019s definition of \u201c taxable \u201d was incorrect. In its widest scope it includes only those who are liable to a tax, or in other words, those to whom a tax has been assessed: Act of April 15, 1834, P. L. 512.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-6\">No borough, however insignificant, can be incorporated unless an accurate description of its territorial limits is made a matter of record.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-7\"><em>A. A. Cochran, </em>city solicitor, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8t\">The assessor\u2019s list is not conclusive as to who are taxables: Act of July 2, 1839, P. L. 519; Act of January 30, 1874, P. L. 31.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-8\">The findings of facts by the master and the decree of the court of quarter sessions confirming the same, should be taken as conclusive and not disturbed unless illegality in the proceedings appears: Ellis et al.\u2019s App., 37 W. N. C. 204.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A8V\">March 2, 1896 :</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b200-9\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">The draft accompanying the petition for the annexation of part of Chester township to the city of Chester was indescriptive. Councils should have required a new one to be prepared giving an intelligible description of the land to be annexed. It has however been replaced by an accurately descriptive one by amendment regularly allowed by the court below. It is now sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">The other question is one of definition. Who is a taxable inhabitant ? Clearly, a taxable is one who is, or who may lawfully be, taxed. One who possesses all the qualifications necessary to authorize the proper taxing authorities to assess him with a tax. The assessor\u2019s list is the best and readiest evidence of this liability to be taxed, just as the registry fist is the best and readiest evidence of the right of a citizen to vote. But neither the assessment roll nor the registry fist is conclusive upon the subject to which it relates. A taxable or a voter may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>be overlooked by the enrolling officer. In that event, the fact of the right to vote or of the liability to be taxed may be shown by other evidence. The record discloses no sufficient error to justify the reversal of this judgment and it is now affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
