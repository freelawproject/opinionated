He was placed by tbe foreman of the defendants at a revolving canvas screen to pick coal, but was not given any special instruction. The canvas screen was used as a carrier on which coal was carried from a point below a dock diagonally up through an open space in the dock floor to a point above, where it emptied into a feeder from whence it passed to boats below. Plaintiff occupied a position between the canvas screen from which he was to pick the slate, and a sheave wheel revolving parallel with the revolving screen. It was the plaintiff\u2019s duty to sit on a bench by the side of the canvas screen facing down the carrier, and as the coal came up to pick out from it the pieces of slate and refuse and throw them into a box at his side. The distance of the sheave wheel from the canvas screen was variously stated at from one and one half feet to two feet. In the immediate vicinity other screens and wheels were revolving, cars were being run and dumped, and an elevator was hoisting coal. Plaintiff had been employed at this screen for about a day, when in making a turn his arm was caught by the spokes of the sheave wheel, and he was carried around the wheel, and severely injured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-4\">Defendants\u2019 point among others was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-5\">4.

An examination of the latter discloses nothing that would have warranted an affirmance of the above quoted request. To have affirmed it would have been manifest error.
