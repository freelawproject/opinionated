H. Kinney a policy of insurance in the amount of $1,000; $750 on his machinery, shafting, belting, etc., used in the manufacture of foundry facing ; $250 on his stock of ground facing and crude material, all and only while contained in a three-story brick, slate-roofed, water-power grinding mill situate in the western limits of Allentown, Pa. The company is what is known as a Mutual Insurance Company and which raises the funds necessary to meet losses and expenses by assessments upon policy holders, and the exaction of a fixed premium fee when the policy issues. At the time the policy issued, Mr. Kinney paid the sum of $5.75, viz.: premium $5.00 and policy fee of $.75. He admits that this is the only money he has ever paid to the company. The policy, by its written terms, was to insure Mr. Kinney \u201c against all such immediate loss or damage sustained by the assured, as may occur <em>by fire </em>or <em>lightning </em>to the property above specified, but not exceeding the interest of the assured in the property, and <em>except </em>as hereinafter provided, for the term of five years from the first day of December, one thousand eight hundred and 89 at 12 o\u2019clock noon, to the first day of December, one thousand eight hundred and 90 at 12 o\u2019clock noon,\u201d etc., subject to numerous conditions as contained on the face of the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-8\">The policy is indorsed \u201c Expired December 1,1894.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-9\">The policy contains a copy of the application of Mr. Kinney for insurance.

Shortly after the fire, Mr. Kinney forwarded, a proof of loss to the company. The company admits that the amount of loss sustained by Mr. Kinney is $4,182.22. On September 8,1891, M. S. Eby, secretary of the company, addressed a letter to Mr. Kinney referring to the nonpayment of assessments, and intimating that the company was not liable on its policy to him. At the time the policy of the Alliance Company issued to Mr. Kinney, he was carrying other insurance on this property to the amount of $4,000, viz: $2,000 in the Quaker City Mutual; and $2,000 in the Lehigh Mutual.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-5\">His policy in the Lehigh Mutual expired July 30,1891. After taking out his policy in The Alliance Company, Mr. Kinney took out reinsurance to the extent of $3,000, viz: $1,000 in the Dauntless Company, of Philadelphia; $1,000 in the Peoples\u2019 Company, of Harrisburg, and $1,000 in the Capital City of Harrisburg. In the policy of The Alliance' Company, condition 1, clause 2, is as follows : \u201c This policy shall become void unless consent in writing is indorsed by the company hereon, in each of the following instances, viz: .... If the assured have or shall hereafter obtain any policy or agreement for insurance, whether valid or not, on the property above mentioned, or any part thereof.\u201d No written consent is indorsed on the policy permitting any additional insurance. After Mr. Kinney\u2019s fire he called upon Mr. Van Heed, receiver of the defendant company, and admitted that his reason for not paying the assessment, of which he had notice, was this : that, not considering The Alliance Company reliable, he had taken out policies in other companies upon which he relied, in place of that issued to him by The Alliance Company. But failing to receive sufficient money from these substituted companies, and being informed that this failure to pay the assessment was no forfeiture of his policy in The Alliance Company, he decided to present his claim. The by-laws and constitution of The Alliance Company are not attached to or made part of the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-6\">The master disallowed the claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-7\">Exceptions to the master\u2019s report were overruled, in an opinion by Endlich, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>Error assigned, </em>among others, was decree dismissing exceptions to the master\u2019s report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b462-4\"><em>E.

He took out other insurance for the very purpose of supplying the place of this policy. The master\u2019s finding on this subject is eminently correct and could not have been otherwise under the testimony. It was confirmed by the learned court below and is approved by us: There is no-error in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">The decree of the court below is affirmed, and the appeal is. dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
