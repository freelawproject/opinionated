There was some evidence that the hanger broke by the set screws being unduly tightened either by the plaintiff or by a fellow workman named Taylor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>When the plaintiff was on the stand he testified under objection and exception to a conversation which he had with a Mr. Davis who was defendant\u2019s superintendent, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-4\">Q. He was the general superintendent of the mill? A. Yes, sir. Q. Had charge of the whole establishment? A. Yes, sir. Q. Who told you about the hanger? A. Mr. Davis told me that the hanger had been condemned. Q. Previous to your using it? A. Yes, sir. Q. And even after its condemnation it-had been used twice? A. Yes, sir. Q. You were then ordered to put it up? A. Yes, sir. Q. When did this conversation take place ? A. Monday following the accident. [1] Plaintiff\u2019s wife testified under objection and exception that at the same time and place she had heard Mr. Davis say that the hanger should not have been put up there, that it was a condemned hanger and had been used twice before in the miff. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s daughter testified under objection and exception that at the same time and place she had heard Davis say that the hanger had been used in two other departments of the mill and had been condemned. [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-6\">The- court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-7\">[Now, if that be true, if the superintendent, the man in charge, a man who had the power to employ or discharge workmen, if he knew that the hanger had been condemned, that it was structurally weak, that it was not fit for the work it was intended to do and that it would be dangerous to use it,- then the plaintiff may recover.] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-8\">Defendant\u2019s points were among others as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-9\">7. If the hanger was sufficient for the purpose for which it was to be used; was strong enough to hold the shaft and box, ,and would not have been broken had the plaintiff or Taylor .adjusted the s,et screws in a careful and skillful manner, the verdict should be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>That is also .affirmed upon the point of the plaintiff being guilty of conitributorymegligenee. If he did not skillfully and properly, with \u25a0ordinary .care put up the machinery, he was not bound to take \u25a0extraordinary care; ordinary care is all the plaintiff was bound it\u00a9 use. [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-10\">.9. If the hanger was broken by either Taylor or the plaintiff \u25a0or both, by accidentally tightening the set screws, the verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>should be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>That, gentlemen, I can\u2019t affirm; because, unless the hanger was broken by either Taylor or the plaintiff by tightening the set screws there would be no evidence of contributory negligence at all, and if the defendant knew of the defect he would be liable. If the defendant knew of the defect the mere fact of accidentally tightening the set screws too much would not reheve the defendant, and I therefore decline to affirm this ninth point. [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-3\">10. Under all the evidence the verdict should be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>I decline to so charge you. You may find for either the plaintiff or defendant. The questions are entirely for you. The court has no power to take it from you. The great question, gentlemen, in this case is, can you rely with certainty upon the statement of the plaintiff, his wife and daughter, that Mr. Davis, the superintendent, knew that this was imperfect machinery, and that it was before condemned, [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-4\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $1,250.

On the trial, the court permitted plaintiff to prove declarations of the superintendent of the mill, \u2014 made several days after the occurrence and away from his place of business, \u2014 to the effect that the hanger had been condemned, and should not have been put up there, etc. In Ms charge, the learned trial judge commented on tMs testimony, and instructed the jury that if what the superintendent had said in relation to the hanger were true, the plaintiff might recover. In refusing to affirm defendant\u2019s tenth request for instructions recited in the seventh specification, he also said, inter alia: \u201cThe great question, gentlemen, in this case, is can you rely with certainty upon the statement of the plaintiff, Ms wife, and daughter, that Mr. Davis, the superintendent, knew that this was imperfect machinery, and that it was before condemned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In admitting the declarations of the superintendent of the mill, made in the circumstances disclosed by the testimony of the witnesses, and in afterwards instructing the jury, as he did, in relation thereto, we think there was error. It has been held, in a long line of cases, that admissions made by an agent as to past occurrences, are not competent evidence to affect his principal: Huntingdon etc. Railroad Co. v. Decker, 82 Pa. 119, and cases there cited. Speaking for tMs court, Mr. Justice Mebcub, in that case, said, \u201c It is a well established rule, that the declarations of an agent, made at the time of the particular transaction winch is the subject of the inquiry, and while acting within the scope of Ms authority, may be given in evidence against Ms principal, as a part of the res gestae. It is equally well settled that the declarations of an agent made after the transaction is fully completed and ended, are not admissible.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>This principle has been recognized, with approval in subsequent cases including Dampman v. Penna. Railroad Co., 166 Pa. 520. It therefore follows that the first four and the seventh specifications must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\">The learned judge\u2019s answer to defendant\u2019s request for charge recited in the fifth specification is also erroneous, in that it ignores the effect that may have resulted from the possible negligence of Taylor, plaintiff\u2019s fellow workman, in unskillfully and negligently adjusting the set-screws too tightly \u2014 so much too tightly that the hanger was thereby broken. This was by no means an unimportant matter^ because there is some testimony tending to show that the hanger was broken in consequence of carelessly and improperly tightening the set-screws, by either Taylor or the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Judgment reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
