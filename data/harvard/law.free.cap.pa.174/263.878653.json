The plaintiff\u2019s chief engineer testified that at the point selected for crossing the least injury would be done to the defendants\u2019 property; and the defendants\u2019 chief engineer testified that the point selected was as good as any that could be found in that vicinity, and that a bridge with a clear span of sixty feet and a height of twenty-two feet would not be an obstruction, and would give sufficient room for four tracks. This was the only testimony on the subject.

The plaintiff has filed its bill in which it avers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-8\">\u201c That in order to build the railroad of the plaintiff company between its terminal points it is necessary to cross the property and tracks of the said Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad Company, and the said plaintiff company has located, surveyed, and marked upon the ground a permanent location for its proposed line of railroad, which said permanent location crosses the tracks and property of the said Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad Company, and was adopted at a meeting of the board of directors of the said plaintiff company held on the 6th day of June, A. D. 1895, and entered upon the minutes of the said meeting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-9\">\u201c That the said permanent location of the line of the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>company, so adopted as aforesaid, crosses the tracks of the Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad Company at a point known as the \u2018 Summit Cut,\u2019 in the township of Benzinger, county of Elk, and state of Pennsylvania, about two and one half miles east of the Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad station at St. Mary\u2019s, by an overhead crossing at a deep cut, across which it is proposed to erect a steel girder bridge, having a clear span of ninety feet, the lowest portion of which will be twenty-one feet above the top of the rails on the tracks of the said Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-4\">\u201cThat the said Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad Company claims the ownership of a tract of land at the point of crossing, containing about twenty-five acres; bounded on the north and east by lands of John Wilhelm, on the west by lands of Martin Fritz, and on the north by lands of Paul Bush and George Nissel; that said land is not occupied by the said defendant companies for railroad purposes, or used by them for any other purposes, except as it is crossed by them by two tracks running parallel with each other, and which are a part of the main line of the said Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad Company, as shown by the map attached hereto ; that the grade of said tracks is far below the surface of the said land, and said land is not suitable for use by the said defendant companies for yards, switches, sidings, or any other purpose connected with the operation of their said railroad; that said land was hot acquired by the said Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad Company by virtue of their right of eminent domain, but was acquired by purchase; that the appropriation of so much thereof as is necessary for the building of the tracks of the plaintiff company is absolutely necessary to enable it to construct its said railroad between the terminal points defined in its charter, and that this necessity is so absolute that without it the purposes of the incorporation of the plaintiff company will be defeated, and that this necessity arises from the nature and topography of the country, over which, it is unnecessary to say, the plaintiff company has no control.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-5\">\u201c That the plaintiff company have located their said lines across the lands and tracks of the Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad Company as aforesaid, and have appropriated a right of way across the same for the public purposes of its incorporation, to wit, for the necessary building and operation of the main line of its said railroad, in accordance with the terms of its charter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u201c That the said right of way of the said plaintiff company, so located as aforesaid, is sixty feet in width, and crosses the lands of the said Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad Company a distance of five hundred and thirteen feet, more or less, and contains about seventy-one one hundredths acres; that said plaintiff company, on the 24th day of June, A. D. 1895, submitted to the said defendant companies a map of the said right of way so adopted as aforesaid, and also a map and plan for the proposed crossing and bridge over the tracks of said defendant companies, copies of which said maps and plans are hereto annexed and herein referred to and made a part of tins petition, and proposed to agree with the said defendant companies as to the amount of damages payable to them for the appropriation of the said easement as aforesaid, and also as to the manner of crossing their said tracks; but that the said defendant companies refused and still refuse to make any agreement as to the amount of said damages or the manner of the said crossing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-5\">\u201c That the said plaintiff company, J. K. P. Hall and J. A. Hanhauser, as sureties, thereupon made and executed their bond in the sum of $10,000 in favor of said defendant companies, conditioned upon the payment to said defendant companies, their certain attorney, successors, or assigns, of all such damages as the defendant companies shall be entitled to receive after the said amount shall have been agreed upon, or assessed in the manner provided by law, for or on account of the appropriation of the said easement by the said plaintiff company, and the said plaintiff company tendered the said bond to the said defendant companies, who refused to accept the same, whereupon the said plaintiff company, on the 25th day of July, A. D. 1895, served notice upon the said defendant companies that they would offer the said bond to Hon. John R. Kime, one of the judges of the court of common pleas of Elk county, having jurisdiction in respect of the approval of the same for filing and approval, at 10 o\u2019clock A.

The bridge which they allege in this fourth paragraph they propose to erect across the tracks of our railroad is not such a bridge as is re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>quired and will be necessary under the circumstances, if any crossing is allowed at this point as prayed for by the plaintiff. It should be at least twenty-two feet above the top of the rails on the tracks of our road, and a definite plan should be made for the abutments, about which nothing is said in the plaintiff\u2019s bill, fixing them at such a depth as will render it certain that they will not be undermined or disturbed in future necessary operation in widening our tracks.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-5\">Since the filing of the bill the plaintiffs have filed a bond in the court of common pleas of Elk county in the sum of $10,000, with sureties approved by one of the jqdges of said court, which will be ample security for all damages that may be caused to the property of the defendants by the entry upon and occupancy of the land of defendants and the crossing of its right of way and tracks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-6\">The right of a railroad company to corporate rights being established, the right to cross, if necessary or convenient in reaching its terminus, is absolute, and the court can only ascertain the mode. This right is conferred by the first section of article XVII. of the constitution of 1874, which provides that \u201c every railroad company shall have the right with its road to intersect, connect with, or cross any other railroad.\u201d This provision of the constitution does not profess to declare how the crossing shall be made, but it was left to legislative action and judicial supervision to determine the mode of crossing. To this end the act of June 19, 1871, was passed, and gives authority to courts of equity to inquire into any alleged injurious act done by a corporation under a claim of right to the .private rights of individuals, or to the rights or franchises of other corporations; and if such acts are found to have been committed without right, to restrain them. The second section of the same act declares: \u201c When such legal proceedings relate to crossings of lines of railroads by other railroads, it shall be the duty of courts of equity of this commonwealth to ascertain and define by their decree the mode of such crossing which will inflict the least practical injury upon the rights of the company owning the road which is intended to be crossed j and if, in the judgment of such court, it is reasonably practicable to avoid a grade crossing, they shall, by their process, prevent a crossing at grade.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The principle is well settled that the lands or right of way occupied by one railroad company for its corporate purposes may be taken as right of way by another railroad company for crossing purposes: Pennsylvania Railroad Company\u2019s Appeal, 93 Pa. 150; Cake v.

Wellendorf, chief engineer of the plaintiff company, taken at the hearing on the part of plaintiff, establishes that in the location of the Buffalo &amp; St. Mary\u2019s Railroad it is necessary to cross the Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad at the Summit, and that the least practical injury would be done to the rights of the Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad by crossing at that point. And Mr. Roberts, a witness on the part of plaintiff, gives it as his opinion that a steel or iron bridge with a clear .span of sixty feet, placed upon stone abutments built upon foundations three and a half feet below the top of the rail of the tracks of the Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad, and having a height, of twenty-two feet, would give sufficient clearance so as not to be an obstruction, and this would accommodate four tracks of the Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad. No opposing evidence was adduced by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-6\">[We are of the opinion that if the plaintiff company will erect a bridge in conformity with the opinion of Mr. Roberts that no practical injury can be inflicted, as it will be entirely outside of the right of way of the Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad Company, and if any damages are done to the twenty-five acre lot by reason of the occupancy of any part of it by the plaintiff in the construction of its road, the bond already filed will be abundant security, and the damages can be assessed under the act of assembly.] [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-7\">[It is therefore ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the plaintiff company shall be allowed to construct its railroad upon the location adopted by it, as indicated by the map contained in their bill filed, across the roadway and adjoining lands of the defendant companies; that said crossing shall be made over the tracks of said companies by means of a steel-girder bridge having a clear span of sixty feet and a clearance of at least twenty-two feet between the top of the rails of the tracks of said defendant companies and the girder of said bridge, which said bridge shall be of sufficient strength, and shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>placed on stone abutments having a foundation at least three and one half feet below the top of the rail of the tracks of the Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad. This order, however, shall not prevent the defendants from recovering any damages to which they may be legally entitled by reason of the crossing of their said lands by said plaintiff company, in such manner as may be provided by law for the ascertainment and recovery thereof. And an injunction is awarded restraining the said defendant companies from interfering with said plaintiff company, its servants, agents, or employees in the construction and operation of its railroad across the roadway and adjoining lands of said defendant companies on the location aforesaid and in the manner prescribed by this decree.

The necessity for the crossing was made manifest. The right to cross is conferred by the constitution, and the reasonable limits within which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>may be exercised are clearly defined by numerous decisions. Tbe only question before tbe court related to tbe place and manner of crossing. A grade crossing was not desired. The plaintiff proposed to cross by means of a bridge with sufficient span and headway to cause no interference with the defendants\u2019 tracks. The plaintiff\u2019s chief engineer testified that at the point selected for crossing the least injury would be done to the defendants\u2019 property; and the defendants\u2019 chief engineer testified that the point selected was as good as any that could be found in that vicinity, and that a bridge with a clear span of sixty feet and a height of twenty-two feet would not be an obstruction and would give sufficient room for four tracks. This was the only testimony upon the subject. The crossing was directed to be made by a bridge constructed on a plan suggested by the chief engineer of the defendants. The decree entered by the learned judge was clearly right.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">A type-written bill was filed with a certificate by counsel that there had not been sufficient time to print the bill, and that the purposes thereof were urgent and required immediate action. In the notice indorsed on the bill the defendants were required to appear within fifteen days, but there was an omission to require them to answer. The jtiotice indorsed on the printed bill, which was served on the defendants within twenty days, was in exact compliance with the new equity rules, and the court upon hearing found that the omission of the words \u201c and answer \u201d from the notice on the type-written bill filed was a clerical omission, and refused to dismiss the bill as not in conformity with the equity rules. In Cassidy v. Knapp, 167 Pa. 305, the equity rules were disregarded both as to form of notice and manner of hearing. The case had proceeded from the beginning notwithstanding objections urged upon that ground. No attempt was made to correct the error in the form of notice, and the hearing of the motion for -an injunction was under the old rules. The amended rules had been recently adopted, and their effect was not fully understood. It was our purpose in the opinion in that case to call attention to the fact that all equity proceedings were to be governed by these rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In this case there was a manifest intention to comply with the rule as to notice. The notice was regular in form and substance except in the clerical omission of two words, by which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the defendants were relieved of the necessity of filing an answer. The error was in a preliminary matter in a proceeding which has now passed to final hearing and decree. It was inadvertently made, it was harmless in effect, and it was corrected before hearing in the printed copy of the bill served. It is not our intention to relax the rule as stated in Cassidy v. Knapp, supra, but what was said in that case does not apply to a harmless mistake, innocently made and speedily corrected. The ruling of the learned judge of the common pleas was in harmony with the opinion of the present Chief Justice in Brinton v. Hogue, 172 Pa. 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">As the original entry by the plaintiff on the property of the defendants was without authority, no bond having been filed, the affirmance of the decree should be without costs. The decree of the court of common pleas of September 9,1895, is affirmed without costs, and it is ordered that the record costs be paid by the appellee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
