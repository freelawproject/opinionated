John conveyed his undivided interest in two tracts of land to Samuel and Benneville. The conveyance was made by separate deeds. The first deed \u2022contained the following clause :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-7\">\u201c Under and subject to . the payment of a dower of five thousand, three hundred and fifty-five dollars, the interest thereof to be paid annually to Susanna Herbein, the widow of said deceased, and immediately after her death the principal to the heirs and legal representatives of said John Herbein deceased.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-8\">The second deed contained the following clause :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-9\">\u201c Under and subject to the payment of a dower of forfy-four \u2022dollars and fifty cents, the interest thereof to be paid annually to Susanna Herbein, the widow of said deceased, during her natural life, and immediately after her decease the principal to the heirs and legal representatives of said John Herbein, deceased.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-10\">On September 9, 1869, Benneville conveyed his undivided interest in both tracts to Samuel by a deed which contains the following clause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-11\">\u201c The first mentioned tract of land <em>being </em>subject to the payment of a dower of five thousand, three hundred and fifty-five \u25a0dollars, and the last mentioned subject to the payment of a dower of forty-four and fifty-one-hundredth dollars, the interest of both dowers to be paid annually to Susanna Herbein, widow -of said decease (deceased), and immediately after her death the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>principal to the heirs and legal representatives of the said John Herbein, deceased.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-4\">Immediately following the reservation, the deed contains the-following clause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-5\">\u201c Together with all and singular the houses, outhouses, barns, stables, ways, waters, water-courses, rights, liberties, privileges, hereditaments and appurtenances, whatsoever thereto belonging or in any wise appertaining, and the reversions and remainders,, rents, issues and profits thereof; and all the estate, right, title,, interest, property, claim and demand whatsoever, of Benneville Herbein in law, equity, or otherwise howsoever, of, in and to the same and every part thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-6\">Then all the formal parts of the deed follow, including a special warranty without any reference to any restriction or reservation whatever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-7\">The evidence showed that the conveyance was made to defeat Benneville\u2019s creditors. Subsequently Benneville was adjudged a bankrupt, and his assignee in bankruptcy sold his interest in the dower fund to Solomon Schlegel, one of Benneville\u2019s creditors for $990. At this sale Samuel bid against Schlegel, and made no announcement that he claimed the fund..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-8\">\u25a0 The court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-9\">[It appears from the receipt indorsed upon this deed that a certain sum of money was paid as the consideration of this conveyance, which exceeds by about $300 the sum that would be due according to the purchase money fixed in the deed, if the dower interest of Benneville Herbein in the widow\u2019s dower had been reserved as existing to him at the end of the widow\u2019s life, and you are asked, gentlemen, to infer that when these people-dealt with each other, when this deed was made, it was the-intention of the parties to pass to Samuel Herbein the whole of the interest of Benneville Herbein in the land and in his expectancy upon the death of the widow, and that is the question, gentlemen, and about the only question which you will have to-decide in this case. You will have to decide it, gentlemen, in the light of all the evidence that has been given here bearing-upon it, in the light of this reservation in the deed which I have read to you, in the light of that further clause in the deed which I have read to you, in the light of the receipt which was-indorsed upon this deed, and also in the light of all the other-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>circumstances that have been shown. But you will not forget, gentlemen, that, according (as I understand it) to the undisputed evidence in this case, when this deed was made, that is to say, on September 9, 1869, there was no money passed from Samuel Herbein to Benneville Herbein. As I understand it, it is the undisputed evidence in this ease that no money whatever was paid for this conveyance until somewhat over a year later, when \u2019Squire Buskirk had become the assignee in bankruptcy of Benneville Herbein, and then the money was paid to him. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-5\">Now, gentlemen, if this was a voluntary conveyance, that is to say, a conveyance for which no money was paid at the time it was made, then when \u2019Squire Buskirk became the assignee it was his right to do one of two things \u2014 either to have this transaction set aside, to treat it as nothing, or else to insist upon the performance of it according to its terms. It seems he did the latter. The question, therefore, for you to determine is, what was the understanding of the parties at the' time the money was paid, what was the understanding between Samuel Herbein and \u2019Squire Buskirk as to the effect this deed had in passing the interest of Benneville in the dower pf the widow ? You are, of course, to consider also what was the understanding when the deed was made, but the decisive point of inquiry is, when the money was paid, when the transaction was consummated between Samuel Herbein and \u2019Squire Buskirk, what was the effect the transaction had then ? And upon that question, gentlemen, it is your business to consider everything that was said and done at the time, you will consider what the evidence is as to what passed between Mr. Herbein and Buskirk, and you are also to consider the subsequent acts of both the parties to this transaction, the subsequent acts of \u2019Squire Buskirk and also the subsequent acts of Samuel Herbein, and in the light of all this evidence, remembering everything testified to on both sides, you will decide which of these versions is the correct one, and according, as you find, return your verdict in favor of the plaintiffs or defendant.] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AdE\">Verdict for plaintiffs for $1,799.83.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-7\">The court refused a new trial, Ekdlich, J., filing the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-8\">When Benneville Herbein conveyed to Samuel Herbein his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>undivided moiety in the farm left by their father, it is perfectly clear, that, unless newly created by a reservation in the deed (for such is the function of a reservation, which is, therefore, to be distinguished from an exception: Whitaker v. Brown, 46 Pa. 197; Kister v. Reeser, 98 Pa. 1; Moffitt v. Lytle, 165 Pa. 177), there was in him no interest in the dower fund originally charged upon the land: Steckel v. Koons, 102 Pa. 493. It is also true that the clause in Benneville\u2019s deed to Samuel which is relied upon as making that reservation is not found in that portion of the deed where a reservation would properly be looked for, and that the language in which it is couched is not the most apt for such purpose. But where a deed is inartificially drawn, as this one manifestly is, too much stress is not to be laid upon the terms employed, or, as is evidenced by the decision in Ivory v. Burns, 56 Pa. 300, upon the position of any clause indicative of the intention of the parties, the cardinal rule being that the latter is to be effectuated, if lawful, by construing the instrument as a whole and giving force to every part of it: Wager v. Wager, 1 S. &amp; R. <em>374; </em>Means v. Presb. Church, 3 W. &amp; S. 303; Phillips\u2019s App., 93 Pa. 45, and the receipt appended to a deed, as well as the recitals contained in it, being part of it: Pryor v. Wood, 31 Pa. 142. But this case does not depend solely upon the terms of Benneville\u2019s deed to Samuel. It is very clear from the evidence elicited at the trial that no part of the consideration mentioned in it was paid at the time of its execution and delivery, and that the purpose of it was to keep at bay Benneville\u2019s creditors. Upon Benneville\u2019s adjudication as a bankrupt, it became the right of his assignee to annul the transaction : Bump on Bankr., 323, 338, et seq. He did not do thi\u00a7, but held Samuel to his bargain. The real question in this case then is, what was the bargain as understood by the parties at that time? Upon this question, of course, the acts of Samuel, as well as those of Benneville\u2019s assignee within the knowledge of Samuel and unobjected to by him, were competent evidence. From all of them, the jury found that the parties understood that there was a reservation in favor of Benneville of a one-third interest in the principal of the dower originally charged upon the land, and that that interest was assets in the hands of his assignee, capable of being passed from him, by sale, to his vendee. Now, courts will not assume to understand the interests of con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>trading parties better than the parties themselves: Phillips v. Blatehford, 137 Mass. 510. The construction, therefore, which the defendant himself, in his dealings with the assignee, placed upon the deed from Benneville to Samuel, and in accordance with which he permitted the assignee and the plaintiff\u2019s testator to act, is certainly the construction which the court ought to adopt, especially since to reject it would do distinct injury to the plaintiffs, whose testator, if it was wrong, was justifiably misled by defendant\u2019s own apparent acquiescence in it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-5\">It is hardly needful for me to add .that I have not come to this conclusion without full consideration of the ingenious and earnest argument of the learned counsel for the defendant. But under the view I feel myself constrained to adhere to, it would scarcely- be proper, much less profitable, \u2022 to discuss all of his contentions in detail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-6\">There was in the verdict an error of calculation, which, as I understand counsel for both parties, is to be rectified by agreement, so as not to stand in the way of a final disposition of the cause. When that correction is made upon the record, the rule to show cause will be discharged.. For the purpose of enabling it to be made,.the rule to.show cause is continued to January 6, 1896.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-7\">The court entered judgment upon the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-8\">Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-9\">- <em>jError assigned </em>among others was (4) above instruction, quoting it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b529-10\"><em>John S.

Nelson, 167 Pa. 606.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-11\">It is clear that without an express reservation in favor of Benneville, his entire interest, including the alleged dower, passed to Samuel: Steckel v.

Ewalt, 2 Binn. 95; Dorsey v. Jackman, 1 S. &amp; R. 42; Seitzinger v. Weaver, 1 R. 377.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>A habendum stating that the estate is to be held \u201c subject to \u201d or \u201c under and subject to \u201d an incumbrance, or to an estate reserved, or to the performance of any covenants, implies a covenant of indemnity by the grantee to the grantor in respect of such incumbrance, estate or covenants: 9 Am. &amp; Eng.

Even if the entire tracts are subject to the whole dower, it does not follow that Benneville did not pass his interest to Samuel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-5\">The alleged reservation does not sufficiently restrict the effect of the words \u201c grant, bargain and sell,\u201d so as to enable the plaintiffs to recover in this case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b530-6\"><em>Jefferson </em>Snyder, of <em>Baer $ </em>Snyder, <em>P.
