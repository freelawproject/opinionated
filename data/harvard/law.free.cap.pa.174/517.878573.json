The defendants toolc a rule to show cause of action, and why the attachment should not be dissolved. The court refused to dissolve the attachment, and the defendants thereupon appealed from the order refusing to dissolve the attachment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-5\"><em>Greorge P. Pick, Isaac lliester </em>and <em>Charles H. Schaeffer </em>with him, for appellees sur motion to quash appeal.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKJZ\">In Hoppes v. Houtz, 133 Pa. 34, it was held that an order dissolving an attachment issued under the act of 1869 is interlocutory only and not. reviewable in the Supreme Court. See also Hall v. Oyster, 168 Pa. 399; Bough Street Road, 2 S. &amp; R. 418; Bennethum v. Bowers, 133 Pa. 332; Moock v. Conrad, 165 Pa. 586.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-6\">The practice of this court has always been to quash cases prematurely removed from the courts below before final judgment has been entered: Chadwick v. Ober, 70 Pa. 264; Com. v. Snyder, 80 Pa. 57; Wetherald v. Shupe, 109 Pa. 389; Parks v. Watts, 112 Pa. 4.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-7\">An appeal considered as a writ of error is a writ of right, but it lies only after final judgment. The writ of certiorari is the appropriate writ for the removal of a cause before judgment, and the writ of error is the writ which removes it afterwards: Com. v. Simpson, 2 Grant, 440; act of May 22, 1722, sec. 13; 1 Smith\u2019s Law, 140; Com. v. McGinnis, 2 Whart. 112; Com. v. Capp, 48 Pa. 53.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-8\"><em>Emanuel </em>Furth, <em>H. P. </em>Keiser, <em>Jacob Singer </em>and <em>J.

A motion is made to quash the appeal because it is taken from an interlocutory order and that no final judgment has been entered. We consider it beyond all question that the order refusing to dissolve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>attachment is interlocutory only and that hence no appeal will lie at this time. The appeal is a mere substitute for a certiorari and brings up nothing but the record, Hoppes v. Houtz, 183 Pa. 34. The evidence is not before us and there is nothing to show that the court below was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Appeal quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
