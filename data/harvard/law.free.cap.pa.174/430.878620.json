J., filing the following opinion :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-14\">The insolvency of the Mont Alto Iron Company was alleged and admitted when the receiver was appointed. The appointment was not made to bridge over an emergency and continue-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the business of the company, but that the assets of an insolvent concern might be held, preserved and distributed in an equitable manner to and among those entitled thereto. The business of the corporation was the manufacture of charcoal iron. It owned a furnace and a landed estate from which it derived its supply of ore and coal. When the receiver was appointed, it had on hand a considerable quantity of mined ore and charcoal. There was no adequate or compensating market for the raw materials, and it was apparent to the court that if these were to avail the creditors at all, it would have to be by employing them in the manufacture of iron at the company\u2019s furnace. The receiver under authority obtained from the court, continued to operate the furnace until these supplies were exhausted. It is now nearly four years since the receivership began, and as appears by the second account, which is now before us for consideration, nearly all the assets, not including the real estate, have been converted. The fund for distribution arises from the sale of iron, farm products and other personal property, and the main controversy is between the general creditors of the company and the holders of certain bonds amounting to $150,000, which are secured by a mortgage on the real estate. The effort on the part of the general creditors is to exclude the bonds from participation, on the ground that, inasmuch as they do not mature until 1909, their payment is not now demandable. This position mistakes the nature and character of the receivership, and the character of the fund for distribution as well. It may be that where a receiver is appointed to avoid a temporary suspension or interruption of the business, which would likely prove disastrous to all interests, as in case of a railroad, general creditors would be allowed preference over the bondholders, in the net proceeds realized by the receiver from the conduct of the business, on the principle, that the status of all parties in interest is to be preserved with a view to a restoration of the concern to its own proper management. In such cases no injustice is done the bondholders by excluding them from participation in the distribution of the income. But that is not this case. Here the corporation was confessedly insolvent, without, possibility of rehabilitation, and there was but one thing to do, convert its assets and equitably distribute them. The fund for distribution can in no sense be called income or earnings; it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>results from sales of materials, manufactured iron, products from the land or general personal property, all indicating a final winding up of the business of the concern. In said case, the functions of the receiver are hardly distinguishable from those of an assignee, except that the receiver acts at all times under the immediate direction and authority of the <em>court; </em>and indeed the whole proceeding assimilates itself to an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Were this an assignment by the Mont Alto Iron Company, no question could have arisen as to the right of the bondholders to come in upon the fund, notwithstanding their bonds were not due. We fail to see why they should be in less favorable position under a receivership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-5\">The auditor allowed them to participate, and in this we think he was right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-6\">Holding to this view, we can see no reason why the receiver should make any distinction between what was derived from sales of personal property, and what was derived from the land; between what was expended for the conversion of the one, and what was expended in the maintenance and preservation of the other. It is not a case of two distinct funds, each belonging to a distinct class of creditors, but a common fund from which all expenses are to be taken, leaving a remainder in which all creditors are to participate ratably.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-7\">The auditor has allowed the taxes in full which were assessed during the period covered by the receivership. In this we think he was correct also. If the labor and other expenses incident to conducting the business of the furnace and the farms is to he paid by the receiver, why not the taxes ? All are alike debts incurred by the court in the administration of the trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-8\">Exception is taken to several findings of facts by the auditor which, in view of what we have already said, it is not necessary to inquire into. Whatever the truth be with respect to them, the conclusions indicated would in no wise be affected thereby. In other words, the disputed facts are not material.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-9\">We therefore overrule all the exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report, not including however that which relates to the claim of Henry Daniels. The presentation of this claim before the auditor who distributed the balance on a former account, and the acceptance of a pro rata distribution, should not preclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>the claimant from now insisting upon his right to a preference of wages. The auditor should have passed upon his question of right of preference.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-5\">We think his claim fully established by the evidence; but to send the report back for correction in this matter, would delay the distribution of a larger fund. This can be avoided by allowing this claim to await the next or final distribution, and this we propose to do. [And now, March 12, 1895, all exceptions to the report of George D.' McDowell, Esq., auditor, appointed to pass upon exceptions to the second account of David Knepper, receiver of the Mont Alto Iron Co., and make distribution of balance, are dismissed, saving however to Henry Daniels the right to submit his claim for wages as a preferred claim before the auditor who may he appointed to make another and further distribution of the assets of the Mont Alto Iron Co. without prejudice, and the report of the auditor is now confirmed, and the receiver, David Knepper, is ordered to pay out the funds in his hands, in accordance therewith.] [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>among others were (7) decree of the court as above, quoting it; (8) in allowing the mortgage and coupons to participate in the distribution; (9) in allowing the taxes assessed against the real estate to participate in the distribution.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b455-7\"><em>Walter K. </em>Sharpe, of <em>Sharpe \u2021 </em>Sharpe, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxDz\">A receiver is an officer of the court, appointed to receive and preserve the property or fund in litigation, such property is regarded as being in custodia legis: High on Receivers, secs. 1, 2, 134; Robinson v.
