The devise to Francis is in the following terms:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-22\">\u201c To my son Francis I give and bequeath the old Schraok farm. ... In addition thereto he ... . shall have a tract of woodland, .... the Koch tract. . . . My son shall be charged $4,500 for the farm and $200 for the woodland. Francis shall pay annually to my beloved wife the sum of $50.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-23\">A subsequent clause, relating to the devises to said Francis and another son, Charles (the land given to whom was \u201c reckoned to him \u201d at $4,800, and who was also \u25a0 directed to pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>widow 160.00 annually), directs that \u201cthe real estate bequeathed to my sons Francis and Charles shall be for their use and support during their natural lives and at their death shall descend to their children, if any; if no children, then to descend to the brothers .and sisters and their children.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-5\">The devise above quoted, standing alone, manifestly gave Francis a fee simple, both by virtue of the act of April 8, 1888, sec. 9, 2 Purd. D. 2103, P. L. 11, and because of the charge made for its value: Fahrney v. Holsinger, 65 Pa. 388. That being so, and it being, of course, conceded that an absolute gift in one part of a will may be cut down to a life estate by a subsequent clause, Shalters v. Ladd, 141 Pa. 349, evidencing a clear intention to do so, Micldey\u2019s App., 92 Pa. 514, the question arises, what, in view of the whole will, is the effect of the provision last above quoted ? It is the law of this state that any form of words sufficient to show that the remainder is to go by way of descent to those whom the law points out as the general or lineal heirs of the first taker will enlarge the estate for life of the first taker to an estate tail by implication: Potts\u2019 App., 30 Pa. 170; Yarnall\u2019s App., 70 Pa. 335, \u2014 a fee simple under our statute. The direction here is, that, upon Francis\u2019 or Charles\u2019 death, the lands devised to either shall \u201c descend \u201d to their \u201cchildren,\u201d and \u201cif no children\u201d to the brothers and sisters and their \u201c children.\u201d Technically that word is one of purchase and not of limitation: Oyster v. Oyster, 100 Pa. 538. But that it may be construed as a word of limitation where there is anything in the language of the testator clearly inviting such construction cannot be doubtful, since the decision in Guthrie\u2019s App., 37 Pa. 9. The testator uses the word three times in the same clause. The third time he manifestly means issue, the whole line of succession; for there is no limitation over indicating anything short of that. Presumably, he used the same word in the same sense throughout the clause. Moreover, he says that upon the death of the first takers the lands devised to them respectively shall \u201c descend \u201d to their children. The word \u201c descend \u201d ordinarily denotes the vesting of an estate by operation of law in the heirs immediately upon the death of the ancestor: Dove v. Torr, 128 Mass. 38, and its use is referred to in Haldeman v. Haldeman, 40 Pa. 29, as indicative of the character in which the remaindermen are to take, viz: by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>inheritance from the first taker and not as a new stock, \u2014 thus pointing to the first taker as vested with an estate of inheritance and to the construction of the word \u201c children \u201d as a word of limitation. If, however, that word is used in the sense of heirs of the body, or issue, then the phrase, \u201c and if no children,\u201d imports an indefinite failure of issue: Armstrong v. Michener, 160 Pa. 21, and the first takers have the entire fee. This interpretation of the provision in question, it may be added, is not only strengthened, but seems to be required by the declared intention of the testator, that all of his children shall take equal shares under his will, read together with the direction designed to serve that purpose, charging the sons, in the distribution, with the value 'of the fee of the land devised to them. The devises to the daughters, coupled with similar charges, are all of absolute estates, and the scheme of equality requires that those to the sons should be likewise so regarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-5\">And now, to wit, February 10,1896, judgment is entered for plaintiff upon the case stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in entering judgment for plaintiff on case stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b535-7\"><em>H.
