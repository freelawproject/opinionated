But has he satisfied your minds from this correspondence that he did not receive it in full? In other words, that he only received it on account of the indebtedness which existed?] [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-13\">[There is no doubt at all that if Mr. Krauser received this $68.90 knowing that Mr. McCurdy gave it to him for the purpose of closing up this controversy, in other words, that Mr. McCurdy advanced this money as a settlement of an existing controversy between them, and Mr. Krauser understood that it was so offered, and accepted it under those terms, then he would be bound by it; he would be estopped from undertaking to show that it was a mistake, and there was more owing him. But you will say whether, .under the circumstances surrounding this transaction, it was so received by Mr. Krauser.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-14\">You will see it is denied here by Mr. McCurdy that, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>time lie received this bill, this item was on it: \u201c To 11 months\u2019 work at the mill at $35.\u201d He says that that item was not there; that all that was sent him was the bill of $68.90, and, in accordance with that, he sent his check to Mr. Krauser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-5\">[Of course there is a controversy over this question, but that is what Mr. McCurdy says, and that after this bill, in some way or other, came into the hands of Mr. Krauser, either to be receipted, or for some other purpose, he added these words to it. Now, if that is so, and that is Mr. McCurdy\u2019s statement, and we must take it for this branch of the case as he states it, then could he have sent this check in full payment for anything like wages ? It is just drawn for the bill of goods purchased at the sale. Could he have furnished it to Mr. Krauser in payment of wages when his attention had not been called to there being any wages due ?] [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-6\">[You will say, whether or not it could have come into Mr. Krauser\u2019s hands and been accepted by Mr. Krauser, with the knowledge that Mr. McCurdy furnished it to him in full of all demands on his part, against him, Mr. McCurdy; or whether he received it in full settlement of the bill for things purchased at the sale. If, as I have said to you, he received it under those circumstances, as payment of the bill of goods purchased at the sale, he would not be estopped from undertaking to explain how he received it, although it is drawn in full of all demands.] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-7\">[You will say, in view of the correspondence which took place and the testimony offered, under what circumstances Mr. Krauser received this check. If he received it in full, he would be bound by it. If he did not, you will say whether he should be bound by it any further than what it calls for, $68.90.] [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-8\">Defendant\u2019s points were, among others, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-9\">4. [That the plaintiff, having accepted the defendant\u2019s check of May 18,1893, which was by its terms \u201c in full of all demands,\u201d is now estopped from making claim upon the defendant for any indebtedness alleged to have accrued prior to the date of said check. <em>Answer: </em>I cannot affirm that point. I have submitted the question for your consideration, as to whether, under all the evidence in the cause, he is to be estopped.] [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-10\">5. [That the giving and acceptance of the check of May 18, 1893, was a final and full settlement between the parties to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>this suit up to that date, and the plaintiff cannot now claim for wages alleged by him to have been due prior to that date. <em>Answer: </em>I cannot affirm that point either, gentlemen. I leave the question for your consideration to say whether or not it was a final and full settlement under the instructions which I have given you as to the legal effect of the check, and letters and testimony in connection with it.] [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-4\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $893.35.

The plaintiff sues to recover wages and the jury has found that the wages are due. The defendant sought however to defeat a recovery by showing a settlement of all demands before suit brought. For this purpose, he produced his own check drawn in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $68.90, \u201c in full of all demands,\u201d which the plaintiff had retained and used; but the defendant testified that it was drawn to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>for some personal property lie had purchased from the plaintiff and that he did not know at the time of the existence of the claim for wages. The learned judge told the jury that the effect of the check was a question of fact and not of law. If it was drawn and received, with a view to an adjustment of the claim for wages, it would amount to a satisfaction of the demand. But if it was drawn and received as payment in full for the property sold, and for no other purpose, then it would not prevent a recovery for the wages claimed in this action. We are not persuaded that this was error. Indeed we do not see how, in view of the defendant\u2019s testimony, it would have been possible for the learned judge to have treated the question as one of law merely. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
