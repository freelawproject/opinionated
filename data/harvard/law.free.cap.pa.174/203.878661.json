L. 184, relating to the organization of boroughs, the powers of the court are limited to an adjustment of the common indebtedness between the township and borough so that each may levy and collect through its own machinery the amount determined by the court to be its proper share. Both township and borough remain liable to the creditor for the whole of the indebtedness, but as between themselves the amount to be paid by the township and borough respectively is fixed, so that if either pays, or is compelled to pay more than its share, it will be subrogated to the rights of the creditor as to that amount, and be entitled to collect it from the defaulting body. If the whole debt should be charged up to each as a liability, a credit should be given to each for so much as the decree fixes as the share of the other. In effect as between themselves, and for the purpose of striking a balance to ascertain the borrowing power of each, the borough and township will each be thus charged only with the amount charged against it in the decree, but the rights of the creditors remain as before.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b223-5\">Argued Feb. 13, 1896.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AZMn\">Appeal, No. 96, Jan.

D. 1893, and that the whole of the territory of said borough was a part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>of the said township of Upper Darby, plaintiff; that at the time of the incorporation of said borough the total assessment of said township as the basis of the apportionment of the debt and assets, as provided by the act of assembly of June 12, 1878, P.

That when the said parties were before your master, neither the representatives of the borough nor the township were willing to fix a- valuation upon this property and accept it at any valuation that could be agreed upon, and it was deemed fair to both parties that it should be put up at public sale by the master and sold. That on the 27th day of April, A.

L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>65, entitled \u201c An act to regulate the manner of increasing the' indebtedness of municipalities, to provide for the redemption of the same, and to impose penalties for the illegal increase thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-4\">By the fourth section of this act it is provided that: \u201c They .(the township) shall, before issuing any obligation therefor, assess and levy an annual tax, the collection whereof shall commence the first year after the said increase, which tax shall be equal to at least eight per centum of the amount of such increased debt, and which shall be sufficient for, and be applied exclusively to the payment of the interest and the principal of such debt within a period not exceeding thirty years from the date of such increase; and the moneys arising from such tax shall be applied annually and as fast as the same accumulates, to the redemption at par of the said outstanding obligations.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-5\">All of the bonds are dated the second day of May, A. D. 1892, and were taken by the Provident Life and Trust Company of Philadelphia, which still holds and owns $127,000 of the bonds, and the remaining $23,000 of the bonds are held and belong to the various parties. The interest on these bonds is payable half yearly at the rate of five per cent per annum, and all interest has been paid by the said township of Upper Darby to November 1, 1894, for which said township has received credit in the foregoing adjustment or apportionment of the assets and floating or current indebtedness of said township. No part of the principal of the said bonded indebtedness has been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-6\">It is contended on the part of E. A. Price, Esq., solicitor for The Provident Life and Trust Company of Philadelphia, respondent, and for the other respondents who have made answer to the supplemental bill filed, that the apportionment of the bonded indebtedness made in this proceeding, while binding upon the plaintiff and the defendant, cannot be held to limit the liability of either the borough or the township to pay the whole amount of the said bonded indebtedness, or that the payment of the amount ascertained to be the equitable proportion of the said borough, or of said township, will not relieve the one so paying from its liability to the bondholders to pay the indebtedness found to be the equitable proportion of the municipality not so paying.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-7\">The bonded indebtedness of the said township of Upper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Darby was created in 1892, and all tbe proceedings relating thereto of record in the court of quarter sessions of Delaware county were offered and admitted in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-3\">The act of assembly of June 12, 1878 P. L. 184, sec. 8, after specifying the different cases in which said act shall apply, provides as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-4\">\u201cWhenever any borough has been or may hereafter be erected, as aforesaid, or whenever any township has been or may hereafter be entirely merged into more than one borough, as aforesaid, the court of common pleas of the proper county, sitting in equity, shall have power, upon the application of any one or more creditors of said township or townships, or upon the application of the proper authorities of any said township or townships, borough or boroughs or either of them, by a suit or suits in equity, to ascertain the indebtedness of said township or townships, including judgments against the same, at the time of incorporation of each of said boroughs respectively, and to equitably adjust and apportion said indebtedness between said township or townships and borough or boroughs, and between the several boroughs into which any township shall have become merged as aforesaid, and shall thereupon decree the proportion of said indebtedness which each township and borough shall pay; in making said adjustment, as applied to each of said boroughs, reference shall be had to the time of incorporation of such borough, and to the debts then existing, whether since paid or not, and also to the several amounts of township taxes then unexpended; and the said adjustment shall be based upon the assessment of said township or townships for the year in which such borough was incorporated,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-5\">This act of assembly was passed long before the creation of this debt and the issue of the bonds, and consequently the act entered into and became a part of the contract expressed in the bond, and to the mind of your master it was the clear purpose of the act not only to afford a means of adjusting or apportioning the indebtedness between a township and a borough, but also to fix the limit of liability of the respective municipalities. The act is broad and comprehensive in its terms, and your master is unable to place the restricted construction upon it contended for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-6\">It is argued on behalf of the bondholders, that to place this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>construction upon the act operates as a diminution of their security. This, to the mind of your master, is only applicable to the territory answerable for the unproportioned debt, and is not applicable to the security. The debt is apportioned on precisely the same basis as it was created, viz: on the basis of the assessed valuation, and the security for the apportioned debt of each municipality is the same as it was for the whole debt before the apportionment. To concur in the position of the bondholders would practically defeat or frustrate all municipal improvements where it became necessary to increase the municipal indebtedness in order to 'carry out the contemplated improvements. With the liability still existing against either the borough or the township for the payment of the apportioned debt of the other, after the payment of its own apportioned share would render it exceedingly difficult to create any new indebtedness, as the liability still existing might, in many cases, exceed the constitutional limit of municipal indebtedness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-4\">In accordance with the views above expressed, your master apportions said bonded indebtedness of $150,000 as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\">Proportion payable by the township of Upper Darby to the bondholders direct, or to a receiver to be appointed by the court in accordance with the sixth section of the act of 'June 12, 1878,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-6\">P. L. 184, ......$94,800 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-7\">Proportion payable by the borough of Lansdowne to the 'bondholders direct, or to a receiver to be appointed by the court in accordance with the sixth section of the act of June 12, 1878, P.

Your master, therefore, finds that of this $12,000, required by the act to be raised annually, the borough of Lansdowne shall raise . . . ' $4,416 00 And the township of Upper Darby shall raise . 7,584 00 $12,000 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-5\">The master recommended that the township of Upper Darby and the borough of Lansdowne respectively pay the proportions . of indebtedness found by the master to be due by each of them; whereupon the territory included within their respective limits be discharged from all liability for the apportioned debt of the other and that the township pay to the borough the sum of $2,953.15 ; that the township and borough each pay interest on its apportioned share of the bonded debt from November 1,1894; \u2022 that said township shall annually levy and collect a special tax for sinking fund purposes of the sum of $7,584 for the payment of the interest and principal of the bonds; that the borough shall levy and collect for like purposes, a like tax of the sum of $4,416; that the township shall pay the master\u2019s fee, and that the other costs be equally divided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-7\">The following exceptions were filed on behalf of the Provident Life and Trust Company of Philadelphia et al.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-8\">1. Because the master has erred in reporting that the township debt can be apportioned in the manner sought in the bill so as to bind the holders of the bonded debt as well as the township and borough.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-9\">2. Because the examiner has erred in construing tbe acts of assembly bearing on the subject of the apportionment and division of township and borough debt upon the creditors of the township who became such prior to the establishment of the borough.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-10\">3. Because no act of assembly confers any power on the township or borough to cause an apportionment to be made which shall be binding upon creditors who became such prior to the creation of the borough.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-11\">4. Because the master has erred in reporting that the security of the creditors for the debt, contracted before the establishment of the borough, can be lessened or altered against their protest and without their consent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>5.

Because the master\u2019s report does not conform to equity and good faith as between debtor and creditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-4\">The decree of the court was that the exceptions be sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-5\"><em>Error </em>assigned, among others, was above decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-6\"><em>Lewis Lawrence Smith, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkF\">The act of 1878 affects only the remedy: Penrose v.

The powers of the court are limited to an adjustment of the common indebtedness between the township and borough so that each may levy and collect through its own machinery the amount determined by the court to be its proper share. The act gives to the court no power over the creditor. Each body remains liable to him for the whole of the indebtedness; but as between themselves the amount to be paid by the township and borough respectively is fixed, so that if either pays or is compelled to pay more than its share, it will be subrogated to the rights of the creditor as to that amount and be entitled to collect it from the defaulting body. If the whole debt should be charged up to each as a liability, a credit should be given to each for so much as the decree fixes as the share of the other. In effect as between themselves, and for the purpose of striking a balance for the purpose of ascertaining the borrowing power of each, the borough and township -will thus be charged only with the amount charged against it in the decree, but the rights of the creditors remain as before. The decree is affirmed. The costs of the appeal to be paid by the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
