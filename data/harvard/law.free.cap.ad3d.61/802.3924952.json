Coll., </em>25 AD3d 686, 687 [2006]; <em>Savarese v Shatz, </em>273 AD2d 219, 220 [2000]). \u201cIn order to make a prima facie showing, the defendant must establish, inter alia, when the plaintiffs cause of action accrued\u201d <em>(Swift v New York Med. Coll., 25 </em>AD3d at 687). Moreover, in deciding a CPLR 3211 motion to dismiss, \u201ca court must take the allegations in the complaint as true and resolve all inferences in favor of the plaintiff\u2019 <em>(Sabadie v Burke, </em>47 AD3d 913, 914 [2008]).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Construing the facts as alleged in the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the defendants failed to establish their prima facie entitlement to dismissal pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (5) <em>(id.; see Swift v New York Med. Coll., 25 </em>AD3d at 687). Accordingly, the Supreme Court erred in granting the defendants\u2019 motion pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (5) to dismiss the complaint as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The remaining contentions either are improperly raised for the first time on appeal, have been rendered academic by our determination, or are without merit. Skelos, J.P., Dillon, Leventhal and Chambers, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
