To prevail on their motion for summary judgment dismissing the cause of action alleging age discrimination, the defendants were required to demonstrate either that, as a matter of law, the plaintiff cannot establish the elements of intentional discrimination, or that the plaintiff cannot raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the facially legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons proffered by the defendants for their challenged actions were pretextual <em>(see Forrest v Jewish Guild for the Blind, </em>3 NY3d 295, 305 [2004]; <em>Morse v Cowtan &amp; Tout, Inc., </em>41 AD3d 563 [2007]). Here, in opposition to the defendants\u2019 prima facie showing of entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the age discrimination cause of action, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact <em>(see DeFrancis v North Shore Plainview Hosp., </em>52 AD3d 562 [2008]; <em>Johnson v NYU Hosps. Ctr., </em>39 AD3d 817, 818 [2007]; <em>DuBois v Brookdale Univ. Hosp. &amp; Med. Ctr., </em>29 AD3d 731, 732 [2006]).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Similarly, those branches of the defendants\u2019 motion which were for summary judgment dismissing the causes of action alleging unlawful retaliation and constructive discharge were properly granted. The defendants established, prima facie, that the plaintiff did not suffer an \u201cadverse employment action\u201d based upon her engaging in a protected activity <em>(Forrest v Jewish Guild for the Blind, </em>3 NY3d at 313), and that they did not deliberately make her working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person in her position would feel compelled to resign <em>(see Nelson v HSBC Bank USA, </em>41 AD3d 445, 447 [2007]; <em>Thompson v Lamprecht Transp., </em>39 AD3d 846, 848 [2007]). In opposition, the plaintiff failed <em>to </em>raise a triable issue <em>of </em>fact <em>(see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number><em>Keooulay v Transcore, Inc., </em>51 AD3d 874, 874-875 [2008]; <em>Nelson v HSBC Bank USA, </em>41 AD3d at 447; <em>Thompson v Lamprecht Transp., </em>39 AD3d at 848).
