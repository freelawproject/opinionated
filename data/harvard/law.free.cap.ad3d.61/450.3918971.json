Plaintiffs\u2019 explanation for the late submission of their premerger claim was neither a conclusive bar to their assertion that defendant\u2019s advice or failure to respond to their inquiry was the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of their loss, since an informal judicial admission may be explained at trial <em>(see Ficus Invs., Inc. v Private Capital Mgt, LLC, </em>61 AD3d 1, 6 [2009]), nor a basis for judicial estoppel, since their prior position was unsuccessful <em>(see Factory Mut.
