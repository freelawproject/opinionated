By the time the judgment, from which defendant has appealed, was rendered, that question had lost all significance. Instead, the crucial question had become: Is defendant\u2019s failure to pay rent from July 15, 1963, to February 1, 1964, excused by the fact that plaintiff had failed to keep a eotenant from making so much noise that defendant had in effect, been evicted? We are persuaded that the trial court\u2019s negative answer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>last question is supported by the venerable ease of <em>Bilicke </em>v. <em>Janss </em>(1910) 14 Cal.App. 342 [112 P. 201], and so the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The complaint, filed August 20, 1963,' .was .drawn \"in. two counts: The first sought- to recover two month\u2019s rent of $140 each. The second had as its objective an injunction putting a stop to defendant\u2019s harboring a dog on the demised premises. Before the action came to trial the defendant had left the \u2022premises, on August 23, 1963, taking his dog with him, and the need of an injunction disappeared with the dog. But the monthly rent continued to be unpaid, in spite of plaintiff\u2019s endeavors to obtain a new tenant, until February 1, 1964, when a substitute for defendant was secured. Plaintiff was given a judgment for the rent from July 15, 1963, to February 1,1964, in the sum of $910 plus $350 attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The reason that the defendant departed from plaintiff\u2019s apartment had, ostensibly at least, nothing to do with the dog. That which the defendant could take no longer was the noisy tenants who occupied the apartment just below his. They were three in number, a 12-year-old and her parents, who joined in song at all hours, when not joined in noisy quarrels that made sleep impossible. Defendant complained'to plaintiff, the common landlord, and he expostulated with the offending tenant, to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">In <em>Bilicke </em>v. Janss, the venerable case referred to, the action was one for two months\u2019 rent not paid by one who had guaranteed the tenant\u2019s prompt payment of his rent. The defense was that another tenant caused so unpleasant an odor to permeate the leased premises that they became unfit for the use for which rented. But, the plaintiff rejoined: \u201cBy the terms of the lease the tenant covenanted that the landlord should not be liable or accountable for \u2018any damage arising from any act or neglect of any cotenant or other occupant of the same building, or of any owner or occupants of adjacent or contiguous property\u2019.\u201d The appellate court agreed that the smoke was no excuse for the nonpayment of the rent. Referring, we are sure, to the passage just quoted, it declared: \u201cIt expressly provided that, insofar as other tenants and occupants of the building were concerned, the landlord shonld not be accountable for any damages sustained by the lessee by reason of the acts of such other tenants and occupants. Hence, the finding that the leased premises were rendered unfit for the purposes for which they were leased did not itself constitute an ouster.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s, judgment for two months rent was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Turning now to the printed lease attached to and made a part'of the answer in this ease (the lease that governed the parties) we find these words in its third paragraph: \u201cThat said Lessor shall not be liable for . . . any damage arising from acts or neglects of co-tenants, or other occupants of the same building, or of any owners or occupants of adjacent or contiguous property.\u201d One may speculate whether the person who drafted the lease effective in this case plagiarized the words quoted from the lease in <em>Bilicke </em>v. <em>Janss, supra. </em>Whatever the conclusion, the thought is so identical that we find the case in point, and consider its conclusion a proper one.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Jefferson, Acting P.
