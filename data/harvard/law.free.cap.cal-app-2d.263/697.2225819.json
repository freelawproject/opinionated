Code) and a prior felony conviction (\u00a7 11500, Health &amp; Saf. Code); information No. 330167 charged him in count I with possession of marijuana (\u00a7 11530, Health &amp; Saf. Code) and in count II with possession of a restricted and dangerous drug in the nature of amphetamine (\u00a7 11910, Health &amp; Saf. Code) on April 15, 1966, and the same prior felony conviction. On the People\u2019s motion, the informations were consolidated for trial. The cause was heard by the court sitting without a jury. It found defendant guilty on count I (originally No. 329891) of possession of marijuana, a lesser but necessarily included offense (\u00a7 11530, Health &amp; Saf. Code), and on count II (count I of No. 330167) of possession of marijuana and not guilty on count III of having possession of amphetamine, and the prior felony conviction to be true. A new trial was granted as to count II and the judge found defendant not guilty thereon; the motion for new trial was denied as to count I. Defendant appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">On September 20, 1966, the desk sergeant told Officer Wanek, Narcotic Division, and his partner Officer Moody that he had received information from a process server, who was looking for defendant for a violation of bail bond, that defendant was staying at the El Rey Hotel. Officer Moody then obtained defendant\u2019s police photo from, and checked his record in, the Records and Identification <em>Bureau; </em>he showed the photo to Officer Wanek and advised him that there was a felony warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest in Division 40 for a violation of section 11530, Health and Safety Code (possession of marijuana); they also found that defendant had other marijuana arrests and convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">In plain clothes, Officers Wanek, Moody and Tipps then proceeded to the hotel; although the original warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest was not in their possession, they knew that it was in the files, Record and Identification, Police Building. After looking at defendant\u2019s photograph the assistant manag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>er told the officers defendant was registered under the name of Edgar Davis and lived in room 321, then told Mr. Knowles, the desk clerk, to take the officers up to the room. The officers showed the photograph to Knowles who immediately identified defendant as the person who lived in room 321. None of the officers requested Knowles to take them to defendant\u2019s room. According to Knowles, escorting police officers to the room was routine for him, he had done it \u201cover a hundred times. \u2019 \u2019 Knowles got the key to room 321 and took the officers up the elevator to the third floor. The officers walked with Knowles to a door where he (Knowles), without any instruction from them, rapped very loudly two or three times on the door with the key calling \u201cMr. Davis\u201d\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s the room clerk\u201d; Knowles said he always knocked when taking anyone up to a room. Officer Wanek testified that Knowles actually went to the door and knocked before the officers knew which room was defendant\u2019s\u2014\u201cthat was something we had no control over whatsoever\u201d; that the officers did not announce their presence before Knowles knocked and did not draw their guns; that the door was opened by defendant who was still in bed (the room was narrow and defendant reached around and opened the door from the bed) ; that as the door opened he saw defendant sitting on the edge of the bed nude, recognized him from the photograph and, the \u201cinstant\u201d they entered the room, arrested him saying, \u201cTon are under arrest for a felony warrant\u201d; and that then he gave defendant his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">As defendant got up to dress, Officer Wanek following him; he had to step over an open small black satchel-type leather suitcase directly in front of him on the floor in a narrow walkway beside the bed; the lights were on and he saw lying loosely in the suitcase five or six brown paper bags (denoting narcotics) and on top, several tin-foil rolls of what appeared to him to be pills (denoting benzedrine tablets for sale) together with numerous small packages; he asked defendant if he had any narcotics in the apartment and defendant said \u201cNo\u201d; then he said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have any narcotics in here, you won\u2019t mind if we look around?\u201d and defendant replied, 110.K., if you want to. \u2019 \u2019 Officer Moody picked up the suitcase and said, \u201cThere is a lot of marijuana and stufi in this suitcase\u201d; it was lifted onto the bed and the officers found quantities of manicured marijuana and debris (125 grams of seeds), dangerous drugs, 2,000 red gelatin capsules, cigarette papers and a white paper bag in the suitcase packaged exactly like a $10 can of marijuana. A user would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>have rolled as many marijuana cigarettes as were found in the suitcase solely for his own use; the loose marijuana would have made about 165 marijuana cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Defendant\u2019s version of how he came into possession of the suitcase was that he took it from the automobile of a man, who gave him a ride, after he fixed the fan belt for him and found the man asleep; in his room he looked through it and found what it contained. Around 10 p.m. he was asleep when he heard a key turn; he awakened and saw the door open; three men entered and he asked who they were and they said they were officers, \u201cWe have a warrant for your arrest\u201d; he asked what for and they replied, \u201cWe have a warrant for your failing to appear in court, and possession of narcotics \u2019 \u2019; he asked what they meant by coming into his room like that and why they did not knock, and they replied, \u201cWe have a warrant for your arrest; we don\u2019t have to knock\u201d; he asked for whom they were looking and he was told, \u201cLeo Coleman. We got you. Your name is Leo Coleman, Rudy\u201d; he said they were mistaken because his name was not Leo Coleman, \u201cIf you notice on the register, my name is Edgar Davis, Jr.\u201d (defendant\u2019s true name is Leo Coleman).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">There is no merit to appellant\u2019s first claim of error that there was an improper consolidation of the two causes for trial. First, his objection to consolidation is not timely made. On November 17, 1966, 13 days before trial, the People moved for consolidation of the two informations; no objection was made and the motion was granted. The trial started on December 1, 1966; on the third day of trial (December 6, 1966) defense counsel moved to sever,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the motion was denied. Second, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion for severance. (\u00a7 954, Pen. Code; <em>People </em>v. <em>Eudy, </em>12 Cal.2d 41, 46 [82 P.2d 359].) Absent in the record is any justification for an order severing the causes for trial. Two days of testimony had already been completed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>when on the third day of a four and one-half day trial defendant for the first time moved for severance. Nor was \u201cgood cause shown\u201d for or that \u201cthe interests of justice\u201d would be served by an order for severance. All of the offenses charged in the consolidated information are violations of those sections of the Health and Safety Code which denounce the possession of narcotics and dangerous drugs (\u00a7\u00a7 11530.5, 11530, <em>11910); </em>all are similar in that they allege possession (possession for sale of marijuana, possession of marijuana, possession of amphetamine) and all are crimes of the same kind, sort or variety and not, as urged by appellant, unrelated in purpose.  The fact that the offenses charged were committed at different times and places does not deprive the trial court of power to order the consolidation for trial or deny an order for severance if they are of the same class of crimes. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Feigelman, </em>65 Cal.App. 319, 320 [223 P. 579]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McClain, </em>55 Cal.App.2d 399, 402 [130 P.2d 978].)  The time span here is slightly more than five months (April 15, 1966 to September 20,1966)\u2014much shorter than that found in cases in which consolidation was held to be appropriate. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sauer, </em>163 Cal.App.2d 740, 744 [329 P.2d 962] [22 <em>months]; People </em>v. <em>Feigelman, </em>65 Cal.App. 319, 320 [223 P. 579] [13 months].) Third, appellant has made no showing of substantial prejudice to his rights. In a brief argument without reference to the record or citation of authority appellant claims that he suffered prejudice because he had to overcome the stigma of the earlier offense charged in the consolidated information which was unrelated in time and purpose to the later ones. It is incumbent upon an appellant to show substantial prejudice to his rights, and a bald declaration of his counsel is insufficient on which to base error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Duane, </em>21 Cal.2d 71, 78 [130 P.2d 123].)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Not well taken is appellant\u2019s position that the police officers failed to comply with section 844, Penal Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in that they entered his room and effectuated his arrest without announcing themselves, thus the evidence was inadmissible as the product of an unlawful search and seizure. Accepting as true the testimony of Officer Wanek and viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the judgment <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>55 Cal.2d 27, 33 [9 Cal.Rptr. 793, 357 P.2d 1049]), it is readily apparent that the factual situation does not fall within the ambit of section 844, Penal Code, <em>People </em>v. <em>Arellano, </em>239 Cal.App.2d 389 [48 Cal.Rptr. 686], or <em>People </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>61 Cal.2d 268 [38 Cal.Rptr. 1, 391 P.2d 393].</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">When the officers went to the hotel they intended to arrest defendant under the arrest warrant, and did so. They knew there was outstanding a felony warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest for possession of marijuana,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and before going up to his room defendant had been identified for them from a police photo, first by the assistant manager, then by Knowles, as the man occupying room 321. Thus, it is clear that the arrest was not based on any facts learned or observed by the officers <em>after </em>the door opened but on the arrest warrant<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and information lmown and identification made to them before they ever proceeded to the third floor. As a fact, \u201cthe instant [they] walked in that door, actually even before [they] walked in . . . before [they] found the narcotics,\u201d Officer Wanek arrested defendant and said, \u201cYou are under arrest for a felony warrant. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">As to the entry, the trial judge found that \u201cthe hotel clerk in opening the door did not do so under direction of the officers or as agent of the officers, or under their control.\u201d The finding that Knowles acted independently of the officers, is supported by the evidence. The officers at no time had in their possession the key to room 321 nor did they open defendant\u2019s door as in <em>People </em>v. <em>Arellano, </em>239 Cal.App.2d 389 [48 Cal.Rptr. 686], relied upon by appellant. Knowles got the key and kept it in his possession, and was told by the assistant manager to take the officers up to defendant\u2019s room. The officers did not ask the desk clerk to take them or go with them, did not know whether defendant was there and did not know Knowles was going to knock on the door. According to Knowles, who was a defense witness, this was a common occurrence \u201cjust routine\u201d with him and he always knocked ; however, he did not recall whether he opened the door. According to Officer Wanek, \u201cAll we wanted the room clerk to do is tell us which room. Instead, he went to the room and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>knocked on the door before we knew which room we were going to. That was something we had no control over whatsoever.\u201d None of the officers knocked on the door, inserted the key in the lock, did anything toward opening the door or opened the door.- While defendant said that someone else opened it, Officer Wanek testified that defendant himself opened the door. In no manner was Knowles, even if he opened the door, acting as an agent of the officers or under their direction or instructions or on their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">While Knowles\u2019 statement, \u201cIt\u2019s the room clerk,\u201d might be deceptive in that it failed to include the fact of the presence of the police, the evidence demonstrates that Knowles, acting entirely on his own and without police direction, instigation or instruction of any kind, was not an agent of the officers. Thus, if there was any deception in Knowles\u2019 statement it was irrelevant to the subsequent police entry. If there be any subterfuge or ruse on the part of the officers it could only be in their failure to speak out, but the evidence shows that time did not permit them to do so. Knowles rapped on the door and spoke to defendant, and the door opened almost before the officers knew they were at defendant\u2019s door giving them little or no time in which to say anything. Apparently this was also the view of the trial judge for he remarked that, <em>\u201ceven if </em>they used subterfuge\u201d to get in, <em>People </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>61 Cal.2d 268 [38 Cal.Rptr. 1, 391 P.2d 393], would not control because the officers were executing an arrest warrant. In <em>Reeves, </em>the officers had no warrant and employed subterfuge to get codefendant to open the door; the court held that when the officers arrived at the hotel and found Reeves to be registered, they did not have sufficient information to constitute reasonable and probable cause to enter the room without a warrant, thus entry gained by subterfuge rendered the subsequent search and seizure invalid.  It is well established that if prior to entry the officers have reasonable and probable cause to believe defendant has committed a felony, the fact that they resort to trickery, ruse or subterfuge to get the defendant\u2019s door open to arrest him, is immaterial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>149 Cal.App.2d 435, 452 [308 P.2d 821] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>234 Cal.App.2d 662, 679 [44 Cal.Rptr. 661] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hamilton, 257 </em>Cal.App.2d 296, 302 [64 Cal.Rptr. 578].) Surely a valid arrest warrant is equivalent to the probable cause found in the foregoing cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Finally, appellant contends that his girl friend and her girl friend should have been called as witnesses, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>continuance granted for that purpose. On the morning of the last day of trial defense counsel advised 111 have just received a communication<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from my defendant which I would like to read into the record, so everything is clear\u201d; it is \u201cin the nature of a motion\u201d; \u201c [I]t is the opinion of this defendant that this particular person [Muriel Jackson] is a material witness to the ease. She did have some bearing on the case, potentially a rebuttal witness. However, I was unable to locate her, using the facilities available to me.\u201d Defendant\u2019s motion to relieve counsel was denied, then he made various vague accusations<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> against the officers, prosecutor and defense counsel, charging a conspiracy by which his witnesses and others had been bribed. The judge invited him to take the stand and tell what, if any, material evidence was not brought out, but advised defendant it was not necessary for him to do so; Mr. Anderson advised defendant to make no statement because he believed it would be against his (defendant\u2019s) best interest. The objection was sustained and the trial proceeded on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Mr. Anderson, deputy public defender, was able and competent in the defense of his client, even though at times he was burdened with defendant\u2019s interference,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, using available facilities, made an effort to locate Miss Jackson but was unable to do so. He did object to defendant making any statement concerning his charges of bribery but, as pointed out by the trial judge, \u201cthe attorney is in control of the ease.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mattson, </em>51 Cal.2d 777, 798 [336 P.2d 937].) He no doubt felt, and rightly so, that irresponsible accusations could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>do nothing but adversely affect defendant\u2019s best interests. As to the continuance appellant claims the judge should have granted, no abuse of discretion is shown. The record fails to establish the name of the other witness, where the two witnesses resided, what efforts had been made to locate or contact them or obtain their attendance in court, what defendant expected their testimony to be or the materiality of such testimony ; except for the bare allegation of his counsel in his opening brief that \u201capparently this testimony would have cast doubt on the procedure that the police used to enter the appellant\u2019s room and whether or not it was a lawful entry,\u201d there is nothing before this court to support such claim. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Seals, </em>191 Cal.App.2d 734, 739 [13 Cal.Rptr. 7].) The only information given to the trial judge was that defendant\u2019s \u201cgirl friends girl friend could have verified what the clerk stated to her.\u201d Beliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>McCrory, </em>41 Cal. 458, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Plyler, </em>121 Cal. 160 [53 P. 553], is misplaced because in each case affidavits were submitted showing the witnesses\u2019 proposed testimony, if called.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Wood, P.
