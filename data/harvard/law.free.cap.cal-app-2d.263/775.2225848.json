Plaintiff obtained an interlocutory judgment in condemnation covering parcels 39, 40, 41 and 42 described in its second amended complaint. Payments were ordered to be allocated: \u201cto defendants Antonio Macias and Francis L. Macias the sum of $11,250.00. or to defendant Willie Johnson, as Executor of the Will of Ella J. Dotsey, deceased, the sum of $15,100.00, according to the determination of ownership by final judgment in the pending action Los Angeles Superior Court number 765596; to defendant Willie Johnson, as Executor of the Will of Ella J. Dotsey, deceased, Parcel 40\u2014$31,300.00, Parcel 41\u2014$14,000.00, and Parcel 42\u2014$14,600.00 . . .\u201d Willie Johnson, executor of the will of Ella J. Dotsey, deceased, in propria persona appeals from the aforesaid interlocutory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">We noted from the notice of appeal,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the appeal record, and the briefs<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that there were possible irregularities in this case as all indications pointed to a non-lawyer executor of a deceased person\u2019s will prosecuting in propria persona an appeal from a condemnation judgment. Concern arose as to our jurisdiction to hear the appeal when Mr. Willie Johnson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>acknowledged in open court that he was not a member of the State Bar of California nor of any other bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Since threshold questions of jurisdiction and validity of the judgment appeared inescapable, we requested supplementary briefs and heard supplemental oral argument addressed to the issues we shall shortly consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The action was commenced against Ella J. Dotsey, Willie Johnson's mother, for four parcels of real property which she owned or in which she claimed an interest. The original complaint and the lis pendens named only Ella J. Dotsey as a defendant. The first amended complaint named both Ella J. Dotsey and Willie Johnson, conservator of the estate of Ella J. Dotsey. The summons on the first amended complaint and the first amended complaint were served personally on both Ella J. Dotsey and Willie Johnson, conservator of the estate of Ella J. Dotsey on September 16, 1964. Thereafter on September 24, 1964, Willie Johnson, as conservator of the estate of Ella J. Dotsey filed an answer and a cross-complaint, signing the answer, \u201cWillie Johnson Conservator of the Estate of Ella J. Dotsey in pro per\u201d and the cross-complaint, \u201cWillie Johnson in pro per.\u201d No answer for Ella J. Dotsey herself appears to have been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">We skip the various mesne proceedings until we come to a document filed on October 18, 1965, entitled, \u201cSubstitution Of Attorneys\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and an order entitled, \u201cPinal Pre-Trial Conference Order\u201d dated October 20,1965, and filed November 4, 1965, reciting that a pretrial conference was held on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>October 18,196 [5] and setting forth the following order among others, \u201cMr. Willie Johnson, as Executor of the Estate of Ella J. Dotsey, deceased, has been substituted in place of and in stead [sic] of Willia [sic] Johnson, conservator of the Estate of Ella J. Dotsey, by the filing of a substitution of attorneys this date.\u201d Whether this order was intended to be a substitution of parties as well as of attorneys is not clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Thereafter various pretrial and trial proceedings were hqd, including trial of the fair market value issue to a jury, with Willie Johnson, executor of the will of Ella J. Dotsey, deceased, in propria persona conducting the defense, and which resulted in the interlocutory judgment from which this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">We address ourselves to three questions: (1) Is there a valid notice of appeal giving us jurisdiction to entertain this appeal? (2) Did Willie Johnson <em>qua </em>executor or conservator have the right to appear, conduct the trial, and prosecute this appeal in this representative capacity in propria persona? (3.) Should question (2) be answered in the negative, what is the effect upon the judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">We have concluded that the answer to question (1) is \u201cYes,\u201d to question (2), \u201cNo,\u201d and (3) the judgment is invalid. For purposes of convenience and greater clarity, we shall take up the questions in the following order: (2), (1), and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">\n<em>Neither Conservator Nor Executor Can Appear In Propria Persona</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">We have found no California statutory or case authority adjudicating whether a conservator or an executor who is not a licensed lawyer may appear in his representative capacity \u201cin propria persona\u201d in a judicial action or proceeding which is not an integral part of the proceedings within the jurisdiction of the probate court. Neither respondent\u2019s counsel nor Willie Johnson has presented us with any.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">This condemnation proceeding involves the City of Downey\u2019s taking property <em>in invitum </em>in which Ella J. Dotsey in her lifetime and, after her demise, her devisees, heirs, and creditors have a material interest. As such it is not within the jurisdiction of the probate court (see e.g. <em>Central Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 10, 14 [285 P.2d 906]; <em>Estate of Schloss </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 248, 253 [14 Cal.Rptr. 643, 363 P.2d 875] ; <em>Auslen </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 820, 823 [27 Cal.Rptr. 8, 377 P.2d 72]), of which court the conservator, or executor is, in a sense, an appointed officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>The eases from the other jurisdictions appear to he unanimous in holding that in absence of statutory authorization,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> neither an executor, administrator, nor a guardian may appear except through a licensed attorney in proceedings involving matters other than his personal rights as such a representative, e.g. accounting to a probate court. \u201c[A] person who is not a licensed attorney and who is acting as an administrator, executor or guardian cannot practice law in matters relating to his trusteeship on the theory that he is practicing for himself\u201d <em>(Arkansas Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Union Nat. Bank </em>(1954) 224 Ark. 48, 51-52 [273 S.W.2d 408]; accord: <em>In re Otterness </em>(1930) 181 Minn. 254, 258 [232 N.W. 318, 73 A.L.R. 1319]; <em>State Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>(1959) 146 Conn. 556, 558-559 [153 A.2d 453]; <em>Frazee </em>v. <em>Citizens Fid.

Super. 479 [226 A.2d 437, 438-439] holding that a non-lawyer administrator <em>ad prosequendum </em>cannot maintain an action in propria persona for the wrongful death of his son, stated: \u201cWhile we find no case precisely in point, the philosophy of the decided cases is that nominal representatives or even active fiduciaries of the persons in beneficial interest, not themselves lawyers, should not be permitted to conduct legal proceedings in court involving the rights or liabilities of such persons without representation by attorneys duly qualified to practice law. [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">\u201cThe harmful consequences of unlicensed law practice in the present context are strikingly demonstrated by the activities of this plaintiff in this and other cases brought by him in connection with the same occurrences complained of where confusion has reigned supreme because of the many unintelligible, untimely and inappropriate documents he has drawn <em>pro se </em>and served and filed, not to mention the consequent serious prejudice to the substantial rights, if any there be, of the class of persons having beneficial interest in such cases. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>We hold that Willie Johnson neither <em>qua </em>conservator<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> nor <em>qua </em>executor was entitled to appear in propria persona and conduct the trial proceedings below or to prosecute the appeal before this court. We do not decide here the right or capacity of a conservator or an executor to appear in propria persona in probate court proceedings affecting rights personal to his office as executor or conservator to which he has been appointed by the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">It is not clear whether the answer of Willie Johnson, Conservator of the estate of Ella J. Dotsey, was intended to be an answer on behalf of Ella J. Dotsey. It is also ambiguous whether Willie Johnson, executor, was substituted in as a party defendant. There is no doubt, however, of Willie Johnson\u2019s intent to appear on behalf of Ella J. Dotsey and of her estate in a representative capacity. He filed various notices of motions reading, \u201cDefendant Ella J. Dotsey, by Willie Johnson, Conservator of her person and estate, will . . . move . . .' \u2019 or \u201c defendant Ella J. Dotsey, by Willie Johnson, Executor of her Will, intends to . . . . \u201d The substitution of attorneys<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> purports to \u201csubstitute Willie Johnson, Executor of the Estate of Ella J. Dotsey, Deceased, as Attorney of Record, in Pro Per. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Willie Johnson as a non-lawyer appearing in his representative capacity in propria persona did not have the right to appear and defend this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">\n<em>Notice of Appeal Valid</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">The notice of appeal from the interlocutory judgment<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was signed, \u201cWillie Johnson Executor of the Will of Ella J. Dotsey, dec\u2019d\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and was filed within the proper time.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">By virtue of the express wording of rule 1 (a) of the Rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>of Appeal,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we draw a distinction between the capacity of a person acting in propria persona to sign and file a notice of appeal and his capacity to execute and file pleadings, papers, and briefs in both the trial and appellate courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In permitting either the appellant or his attorney to sign the notice, the rule constitutes a liberalization and a distinct departure from the general rule that a party represented by counsel may not file papers in propria persona in the litigation (see e.g. <em>People </em>v. <em>Mattson </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 777, 798 [336 P.2d 937] ; <em>Electric Utilities Co. </em>v. <em>Smallpage </em>(1934) 137 Cal.App. 640 [31 P.2d 412]). Pursuant to its mandate that \u201cA notice of appeal shall be liberally construed in favor of sufficiency,\u201d the words, \u201chis attorney\u201d were construed to include an attorney not of record <em>(Estate of Hultin </em>(1947 ) 29 Cal.2d 825, 832 [178 P.2d 756]) if he actually is an appealing party\u2019s attorney (cf. <em>Edlund </em>v. <em>Los Altos Builders </em>(1951) 106 Cal.App.2d 350, 357 [235 P.2d 28].<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Ehret </em>v. <em>Ichioka </em>(1967) 247 Cal.App.2d 637, 641 [55 Cal.Rptr. 869], the court denied a motion to dismiss because of a defective notice of appeal where one non-lawyer sibling signed the notice for herself and for the other siblings, stating, \u201cIt is true that she could not act as an attorney for her siblings, but the only act with which we are here concerned is the execution of the notice of appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">As the executor of the will of Ella J. Dotsey, deceased, Willie Johnson had the duty of defending the estate from \u201call unjust and illegal attacks made upon it which affect the interests of heirs, devisees, legatees, or creditors\u201d and in that sense he was an \u201caggrieved party.\u201d <em>(Estate of Kessler </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 367, 369 [196 P.2d 559].)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>While one not a party of record to the proceedings below has no standing to appeal <em>(Eggert </em>v. <em>Pacific States Sav. &amp; Loan Co. </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 199, 201 [124 P.2d 815]; <em>Estate of Partridge </em>(1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 58, 59 - 62 [67 Cal.Rptr. 433], both the first and second amended complaint named Willie Johnson, conservator of the estate of Ella J. Dotsey, as well as Ella J. Dotsey, as a party defendant. The final pretrial order substitutes \u201cMr. Willie Johnson, as Executor of the Estate of Ella J. Dotsey, deceased\u201d in lieu of \u201c Willi [e] Johnson, conservator of the Estate of Ella J. Dotsey.\u201d Willie Johnson, executor, was therefore not a stranger to the proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">We hold that Willie Johnson, executor of the will of Ella J. Dotsey, deceased, in propria persona had the capacity to sign and file the notice of appeal, conferring jurisdiction upon this court to make the determination of the issues herein set forth. The rule is to the contrary as to the documents other than the notice of appeal filed in this court, and they must be ordered stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">\n<em>Judgment Invalid</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Malone </em>(1965) 232 Cal.App.2d 531, 537 [42 Cal.Rptr. 888], the appellate court reversed the judgment where a nonlawyer defendant purported to appear and try a condemnation case for himself and for his brother from whom he held a power of attorney. The court there stated, \u201cWhat Carroll purported to do for Paul in place of an attorney was a nullity, and that fact should have been known to the court and to opposing counsel. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">No doubt, by service of the first amended complaint and summons issued thereon upon both Ella J. Dotsey and Willie Johnson as conservator of her estate on September 16, 1964, the court acquired jurisdiction over Ella J. Dotsey and the subject matter of the condemnation proceedings against her. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 411, subd. 4.) However, that does not solve the issue as to the validity of the judgment. Since Willie Johnson neither <em>qua </em>conservator in propria persona nor <em>qua </em>executor in propria persona could appear in the action, the papers and documents which he drafted and purported to file in those capacities should have been stricken. (Cf. <em>Himmel </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1959) 169 Cal.App.2d 97, 100-101 [336 P.2d 996].) But plaintiff\u2019s counsel made no motion to strike, nor did he purport to take any steps to obtain a default judgment. <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1924) 194 Cal. 185, 189-190 [228 P. 15], cited by plaintiff is of no assistance because Ella <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>J. Dotsey was under the disability of conservatorship of her person and her estate and Willie Johnson, a person not admitted to the practice of law, was not competent to waive any defects in procedure on her behalf. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Malone </em>(1965) <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">There was moreover no substitution of Willie Johnson, executor, for Ella J. Dotsey the original defendant, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Willie Johnson, conservator, entered a valid appearance in his own representative capacity. The determination of the legal issues and the trial of the valuation issue all took place after the death of Ella J. Dotsey. Under such circumstances, the judgment was in excess of jurisdiction. <em>(Bliss </em>v. <em>Speier </em>(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 125, 126-127 [13 Cal.Rptr. 847].)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">To give any effect to the judgment in this case would be a condonation of acts constituting both a crime and a possible contempt of court for we have a lay person not a member in good standing of any bar practicing law illegally,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> although perhaps unwittingly. We therefore feel constrained to hold the judgment invalid despite the attendant loss of the effort and time of the trial courts and their attaches. Perhaps some of the determinations reached in the abortive procedures can be salvaged upon retrial by stipulation of counsel or parties validly appearing before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">In view of our disposition of this ease, it becomes unnecessary at this time to discuss the points which were sought to be raised by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">The papers and documents filed in this court, other than the notice of appeal, are ordered stricken, and the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">Kaus, P.
