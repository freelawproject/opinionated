Coleman and Patricia L. Coleman, a minor, by her guardian ad litem, appeal from a judgment entered upon a nonsuit granted in favor of defendant Silverberg Plumbing Company, a corporation, upon plaintiffs \u2019 written opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">The Background</p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">Plaintiffs Carolyn Z. Coleman, the widow, and Patricia L. Coleman, the minor child of Lowell Duane Coleman, deceased, appearing through her mother as guardian ad litem, brought this action against the defendants Lisa Construction Company composed of Violet Estates, Incorporated, a California corporation, and Sand Homes, Incorporated, a California corporation (hereafter LISA), Silverberg Plumbing Company, a corporation,' (hereafter Silverberg), \u00e1nd Harold Stark, also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>known as Hank Stark, doing business as The Stark Company (hereafter Stark). <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">By their verified first amended complaint labelled, \u201cFirst Amended Complaint For Damages (Wrongful Death),\u201d the following causes of action were pleaded: (1) Damages from all defendants for negligence in failing to provide the decedent Lowell Duane Coleman (hereafter Coleman) with a safe place to work and with safe implements and equipment with which to work. (2) Damages from Stark alone under section 3706 of the Labor Code for failing to secure payment of compensation by way of insurance (Lab. Code \u00a7 3700). (3) Damages from all defendants for breach of warranty against defects in a backhoe <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which Coleman was operating and of fitness for its intended use. (4) Damages from all defendants for negligence in the design, manufacture, construction, maintenance and care of the backhoe.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">A pretrial conference was held August 19, 1965. Only a few facts were agreed upon: Coleman died on September 10, 1963, on premises owned by LISA at 19155 Malden Avenue, North-ridge, California. LISA was engaged in the business of erecting tract houses as owner and general contractor for the purpose of selling them. Silverberg was performing plumbing work on such houses pursuant to a written\u2019 contract between LTSA\u2019and\" Silverberg. Coleman was on the premises for the purposeAf operating'a backhoe and his death occurred while operating it.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Apparently the parties were unable to agree upon the issues to be litigated at trial. The record reflects no effort upon the part of the commissioner acting as pretrial judge pro tempore to narrow the issues. Instead, he permitted each counsel to file his separate statement of contentions and issue. By a pro forma order entitled, \u201cPretrial Conference Order (For Routine Cases),\u201d these separate statements were incorporated by reference and made a part of the pretrial conference order. Plaintiffs filed their separate statement consisting of some 19 pages. It proliferated the issues and bypassed possible statute of limitations questions. No objection by Silverberg to its filing nor any request for amendment to the pretrial confer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>ence order, either before or at time of trial, appears in the record. The theories of recovery upon which plaintiffs\u2019 opening statement was bottomed are among those mentioned in their separate statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">On the authority of <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Seaton </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 681 [39 Cal.Rptr. 881, 394 P.2d 697], the three respective counsel appearing for trial stipulated that a jury be deemed impaneled and sworn and that the issue of nonsuit be submitted upon a written opening statement to be filed by plaintiffs. The statement was filed November 3, 1965. Silverberg filed a written motion for nonsuit on November 29, 1965. Trial briefs were filed, the cause submitted, and the motion for nonsuit was granted on January 17, 1966, followed by entry of judgment on February 16, 1966 in favor of Silverberg. Plaintiffs appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Contentions on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 (appellants\u2019) opening statement sought recovery against Silverberg (respondent) upon three theories, which they renew upon this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">1. For wrongful death of Coleman, a presumptive employee of Silverberg, whose death was caused by Silverberg\u2019s presumptive negligence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">2. For Silverberg\u2019s breach of a judicially created duty to refrain from delegating work to purported subcontractors who do not have a contractor's license or who fail to have workmen 's compensation insurance coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">3. For Silverberg\u2019s maintenance of a nuisance in permitting Stark to carry on a business or undertaking without full compensation security.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Silverberg contends that plaintiffs failed to plead and prove lack of insurance coverage necessary to confer jurisdiction upon the superior court to entertain a suit of the type which plaintiffs espouse in their theory No. 1, above, and that no legal liability exists under theories Nos. 2 and 3, advanced by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>No Recovery for Presumptive Negligence of Presumptive Employee</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The theory of recovery for wrongful death of a presumptive employee (Coleman) caused by the presumptive negligence of Silverberg is based upon sections 3700, 3706 and 3708 of the Labor Code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Assuming arguendo that Coleman was Silverberg\u2019s employee, plaintiffs had to plead <em>(Deauville </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1961) 188 Cal.App.2d 535, 540 [10 Cal.Rptr. 511] ; <em>Singleton </em>v. <em>Bonnesen </em>(1955) 131 Cal.App.2d 327, 331 [280 P.2d 481]; <em>Wessell </em>v. <em>Barrett </em>(1944) 62 Cal.App.2d 374, 377 [144 P.2d 656]; <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Wyman </em>(1933) 128 Cal.App. 736, 739 [18 P.2d 354]) and prove that Silverberg violated section 3700 by not carrying the workmen\u2019s compensation required <em>(Wessell </em>v. <em>Barrett, supra; </em>cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(10th Cir. 1935) 78 F.2d 465, 467). We are not here concerned with common law causes of action, in which case it is incumbent on the defendant to plead and prove the employer-employee relationship and workmen\u2019s compensation insurance coverage. <em>(Popejoy </em>v. <em>Hannon </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 159, 173-174 [231 P.2d 484].) A complaint disclosing an employer-employee relationship in this action without negativing the existence of workmen\u2019s compensation insurance would have been subject to a general demurrer. <em>(Burton </em>v. <em>Union Oil Co. </em>(1933) 129 Cal.App. 438 [19 P.2d 9]; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(1949) 95 Cal.App.2d 204, 207 [212 P.2d 591] (dictum).)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Whether or not Silverberg carried the required workmen\u2019s compensation insurance is a question going to the jurisdiction of the superior court to entertain the action for wrongful death. <em>(Scott </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1956) 46 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Cal.2d 76, 83 [293 P.2d 18]; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Minnesota Min. &amp; Mfg. Co. </em>(D.Cal. 1953) 14 F.R.D. 1.) It may be raised by a motion for nonsuit <em>(Scott </em>v. <em>Pacific Coast Borax Co. </em>(1956) 140 Cal.App.2d 173, 177 [294 P.2d 1039]), as Silverberg did. However, jurisdiction is a question of law and it is for the court and not for the jury to determine. <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Hubbell </em>(9th Cir. 1951) 188 F.2d 106, 108, 109; <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Gibbs </em>(1964) 262 N.C. 462 [137 S.E.2d 806, 808-809]; <em>Dolese Bros </em>v. <em>Tollett </em>(1933) 162 Okla. 158 [19 P.2d 570, 571]; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Minnesota Min. &amp; Mfg. Co. </em>(1953) <em>supra, </em>14 F.R.D. 1, 4; see <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(1949) <em>supra, </em>95 Cal.App.2d 204, 208; cf. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1956) <em>supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 76, 83.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">No adequate showing that Silverberg lacked coverage of workmen\u2019s compensation insurance required by section 3700 of the Labor Code was made, nor can it be made.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The motion for nonsuit was properly granted upon this ground. We do not decide whether Coleman was a beneficiary under Silverberg\u2019s policy on this appeal from a nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Strict Liability Denied</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Plaintiffs also urge that one who delegates the performance of work to an independent contractor should be held under strict liability<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to see that the contractor is covered by workmen\u2019s compensation insurance. It is a request that by decisional law the doctrine of strict financial responsibility be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>extended to cover an area where the employer-employee relationship does not exist.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">While courts should not be hidebound by the label, \u201cindependent contractor,\u201d we have concluded that the legal reform sought is one more appropriate for legislative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">11 In the absence of statute so providing, an employee of an independent contractor or subcontractor is not entitled to [workmen\u2019s] compensation from the employer of such independent contractor or subcontractor for injuries suffered.\u201d (99 C.J.S., Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 107, p. 363.) The California eases so hold. <em>(Brietigam </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 849, 852 [236 P.2d 582] (dictum) ; <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1941) 46 Cal.App.2d 526, 529 [116 P.2d 173]; <em>Winther </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1936) 16 Cal.App.2d 131 [60 P.2d 342]; <em>Crown City Lodge </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1935) 10 Cal.App.2d 83 [51 P.2d 143].)</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The authoritative materials relevant to our inquiry are sparse. Citing <em>Salmon </em>v. <em>Kansas City </em>(1912) 241 Mo. 14 [145 S.W. 16, 39 L.R.A. N.S. 328], 27 American Jurisprudence, Independent Contractors, \u00a7 28, p. 508, states: \u201cIt has\u2019 . . . been expressly decided, in respect of the contractor\u2019s financial responsibility, that the employer owes no duty to the t contractor\u2019s servant [who has been injured].\u201d Our research ' has turned up only one reported case which deals with the precise issue posed by plaintiffs, namely, <em>Matanuska Elec. Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(Alaska 1963) 386 P.2d 698, 702-704.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">In <em>Matanuska Elec., </em>recovery was sought upon negligence, rather than upon strict liability. But even upon a negligence theory, it was there held that imposition of financial responsi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>bility upon one employing an independent contractor for injuries to an employee of a contractor not covered by workmen\u2019s compensation insurance should come from the Legislature and not the courts. The Supreme Court of Alaska set forth the following considerations in reaching that holding: (1) \u201c [T]here is a difference between the situation where an innocent passerby or an adjoining property owner is injured or damaged by the independent contractor\u2019s negligence and the case of injury to the contractor\u2019s employee\u201d; (2) the rule sought would not necessarily place the incidents of unfortunate personal injuries upon persons better able to bear the financial burden, because many people who hire contractors for the performance of work \u201care salaried workmen and wage earners of modest means who are inexperienced and uninformed in matters of vicarious liability\u201d; and (3) \u201c [b]efore the courts should be asked to extend liability to the employer of independent contractors for injuries to the contractor\u2019s employees, where none is imposed by statute, it would seem advisable for the responsible state agencies to make a serious attempt to enforce the legal sanctions [criminal and civil]<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> presently provided against the contractor who fails to abide by the law and provide compensation for injured employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AGJ\">In 42 of the other American states, persons situated as the plaintiffs are provided with a remedy under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws whereby those employing eohtraetors~are held liable in the event the contractor himself does not have workmen\u2019s compensation insurance. (See 1A Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1967) (Conditions of Coverage) ch. IX, \u00a7 49.11; 99 C.J.S., Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7\u00a7 107-111, pp. 362-390.)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">In that regard, we have a peculiar situation in California. The Legislature provided for redress against the owner or a general contractor in section 25, chapter 586, Statutes of 1917,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but the section was declared to be unconstitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>tional notwithstanding the November 1918 amendments to section 21, article XX of our state Constitution. <em>(Worswick Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1919) 181 Cal. 550, 560-561 [185 P. 953].) The court followed its earlier decision in <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1919) 180 Cal. 497 [181 P. 788], and the line of cases stemming from <em>Carstens </em>v. <em>Pillsbury </em>(1916) 172 Cal. 572 [158 P. 218], <em>Carstens </em>held it unconstitutional for the Legislature to invest jurisdiction in a' commission [appeals board] type of tribunal to determine compensation liability where there is no common law employer-employee relationship. While thus holding that the liability of an owner or general contractor\u2019s liability for injuries suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>by an uninsured independent contractor\u2019s employee was \u201cnot a liability the enforcement of which the legislature has power to commit to any tribunal other than the regularly constituted courts under article VI [of the state Constitution],\u201d the court reserved decision on the question whether the Legislature otherwise has power to create such liability against one not the immediate employer of the injured workman. <em>(Carstens </em>v. <em>Pillsbury </em>(1916) <em>supra, </em>172 Cal. 572, 580.)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\">When the workmen\u2019s compensation laws were reenacted into the Labor Code in 1937, sections of the previous laws which were of doubtful constitutional validity were omitted. (See 2 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workmen\u2019s Compensation (2d ed., 1967) \u00a7 2.02 [3] [a].)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The desirability of reexamining <em>Carsten </em>and progeny was voiced early in the concurring opinion of Justice Lawlor in <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1919) <em>supra, </em>180 Cal. 497, 503-504. Such a course of action has been urged periodically since then. <em>(State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1941) <em>supra, </em>46 Cal.App.2d 526; Brooks, <em>Tort Liability of Owners and General Contractors for On-the-Job Injuries of Workmen </em>(1965) 13 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 99, 123-124.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since advisory opinions are barred (cf. <em>Clough </em>v. <em>Compton-Delevan Irr. Dist. </em>(1938) 12 Cal.2d 385, 389 [85 P.2d 126]; Witkin, Cal. Procedure (1954), p. 2191), reenactment of a statute of the tenor of section 25, chapter 586, statutes of 1917, would appear necessary to reinquire into the constitutionality of such legislation in the light of changed contemporary conditions and later judicial thinking.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">While the 1917 legislative effort to provide a remedy for persons in plaintiffs\u2019 position was chilled by the courts, nevertheless, it has been held that the type of remedy here sought should come from legislative rather than judicial action. <em>(State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1941) <em>supra, </em>46 Cal.App.2d 526, 530.)  Workmen\u2019s compensation laws \u201care of constitutional and statutory origin\u201d (55 Cal.Jur.2d, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 3, p. 15) and are not derived from common law doctrines malleable to judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>reshaping <em>(Muskopf </em>v. <em>Corning Hospital Dist. </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 211 [11 Cal.Rptr. 89, 359 P.2d 457]). In this posture resulting from the previous action of two coordinate branches of our government, it appears that legislative action is the preferable way to provide a comprehensive system of remedies rather than through piecemeal litigation in the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">We do not have here a situation of one seeking to avoid the onus of carrying workmen\u2019s compensation insurance by resorting in bad-faith to an independent contractor setup. (Cf. <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Contractors State License Board </em>(1948) 85 Cal.App.2d 600, 605 [193 P.2d 979].)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u2022 Plaintiffs claim that Silverberg is charged with constructive knowledge in that a check of the public records would have disclosed that Stark was not licensed and hence Silverberg violated section 7118 of the Business and Professions Code.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Even if Silverberg can be held to such constructive knowledge, the penalty for such violation has been prescribed by the Legislature in that section. The causal nexus between one\u2019s failure to possess a contractor\u2019s license and either injury or financial irresponsibility has not been shown. The \u201csignificant moment\u201d to check is at the time of entering into the contract. <em>(Latipac, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 278, 282, 283 [49 Cal.Rptr. 676, 411 P.2d 564].) Insurance could exist at the moment of contract, and yet there might be no insurance coverage at the time of injury from a number of other causes, e.g. insolvency of the carrier or. lapse of the policy for sundry reasons. If strict financial responsibility is imposed, a check for a contractor\u2019s license at the time of contracting would be immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">No Recovery for Nuisance</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Lifting the phrase, \u201cthe conduct or operation of any business or undertaking without full compensation security, in continuing violation of such policy, is hereby declared to be a nuisance\u201d from section 3712 of the Labor Code,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> plaintiffs contend that their opening statement sets forth a theory of recovery against Silverberg for committing or maintaining a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>nuisance by permitting Stark to operate without workmen\u2019s compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">If Coleman was Silverberg\u2019s employee, there was no nuisance because Silverberg carried the required insurance as earlier pointed out. If Stark was an independent contractor, then Silverberg would have had no control over Stark\u2019s mam ner of conducting business and had no duty to provide workmen\u2019s compensation insurance for the benefit of Stark\u2019s employees. (See <em>ante, </em>pp. 82-85.)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Furthermore, the word \u201cnuisance\u201d appears to be used in a peculiar sense in section 3712. It certainly does not mean a physical interference with enjoyment of property rights which the word \u201cnuisance\u201d normally connotes. Even in the usual sense, it has been said \u201cthat the term \u2018nuisance\u2019 is peculiarly amorphous.\u201d <em>(City of Bakersfield </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 93, 99 [48 Cal.Rptr. 889, 410 P.2d 393].) Here the word refers to the conduct of a business in an unlawful manner, but the business or undertaking referred to is that of the employee\u2019s employer - (2 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workmen\u2019s Compensation (2d ed., 1967) \u00a7 17.05 [3] [a]), and not that of the independent contractor \u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">By the wording of section 3712 itself, only the remedy of abatement of the business or undertaking is provided. The right of enforcing that right is granted only to public enforcement officers, not to private individuals. Most significant is the concluding sentence, \u201cNo finding made in the course of such action [for abatement] shall be binding on the commission [appeals board] in any subsequent proceeding before it for benefits under this division.\u201d This removes reliance on collateral estoppel in a subsequent action. It is an indicium of legislative intent that the section is not to be utilized for the adjudication of compensation benefit claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Absent a showing of a violation of some legal duty imposed upon Silverberg, the use of the word \u201cnuisance\u201d neither increases nor changes plaintiffs' basis for recovery. (Cf. <em>Neuber </em>v. <em>Royal Realty Co. </em>(1948) 86 Cal.App.2d 596, 613 [195 P.2d 501].)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Stephens, Acting P.

No offer of proof otherwise incumbent upon plaintiffs in the normal type of wrongful death action appears in the opening statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Labor Code section 3700: \u201cEvery employer . . . shall secure the payment of compensation in one or more of the following ways: (a) By being insured against liability to pay compensation in one or more insurers duly authorized to write compensation insurance in this State ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ADTV\">Labor Code section 3706: \u201cIf any employer fails to secure the payment of compensation, any injured employee or his dependents may proceed against such employer by filing an application for compensation with the commission [appeals board], and, in addition, may bring an action at law against such employer for damages, as if this division did not apply. <em>\u2019 \u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"ACd\">Labor Code section 3708: \u201cIn such action it is presumed that the injury to the employee was a direct result and grew out of the negligence of the employer, and the burden of proof is upon the employer, to rebut the presumption of negligence.

No contract or regulation shall restore to the employer any of the foregoing defenses.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\"> An interesting discussion as to jurisdiction being a question of law triable to the court rather than to the jury even where the evidence is in conflict is found in <em>Freire </em>v. <em>Matson Nav.

No refutation to tMs statement appears in the record. The opening statement also alludes to a workmen\u2019s compensation insurance policy issued by Travelers Insurance Company to Silverberg. During oral argument, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel conceded, <em>1 \u2018 </em>As far as I know there is a standard employer\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation policy insuring the Silverberg Plumbing Company for workmen\u2019s compensation liability to employees of Silverberg Plumbing Company. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel explains that he uses the term \u201cstrict liability\u201d to mean liability without negligence.

Comment \u201c g \u201d to \u00a7 411: \u201c Financial Responsibility. The rule stated in this Section . . . has no application where the contractor, although competent and careful, is financially irresponsible. [1\u00cd] Cases are lacking in sufficient \u201cnumber to deal with the question whether the employer may ever be responsible to any third person for his failure to exercise care to employ a contractor who is financially responsible, and therefore able to respond, by liability insurance or otherwise, for any damages which he may inflict by his tortious conduct. The Institute expresses no opinion that there is, or that there is not, any obligation upon the employer. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b104-5\">See Labor Code sections 3706, 3707, 3708, 3709, 3710.2, 3712;
