Code, \u00a7 11531). Count I charged both Morales and Velasquez with a sale on April 8, 1966, and count II charged Velasquez only with a sale on April 7, 1966. Each defendant was charged with and admitted priors involving narcotics\u2014Morales had three priors and Velasquez two. Defendants moved for separate trials on <em>Aranda </em>grounds <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aranda, </em>63 Cal.2d 518 [47 Cal.Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265]). The motion was denied and following a joint jury trial, they were found guilty as charged and sentenced to state prison. Defendants filed separate notices of appeal. The present appeal concerns only Morales.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">On April 7, 1966, at about 8 p.m., Reyes and Tryal, state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>narcotics investigators, and one \u201cChico\u201d (Andres Galindo), a former narcotics user who was acquainted with Morales and Velasquez and who was then cooperating with the Colton Police Department, met Velasquez at the Schooner Bar in Bloomington. \u201cChico\u201d introduced the investigators to Velasquez and asked the latter if he could obtain a 11 can of weed. \u2019 \u2019 Velasquez replied, \u201cYes, I have to ask Donny first,\u201d (Morales\u2019 first name was Donald), went to a phone booth, and after a few minutes returned saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go, the guy is waiting for us.\u201d The four (Reyes, Tryal, \u201cChico\u201d and Velasquez) drove to Morales\u2019 home and upon arrival Velasquez entered the house but returned shortly stating that the \u201cguy\u201d did not have proper change. The officers obtained change, Reyes handed Velasquez $16, Velasquez re-entered the house and returned to the car shortly stating, \u201cI have got a very good can, not a very large can, but it is all real pot.\u201d They drove to Velasquez\u2019 apartment where he removed a brown paper bag from his jacket pocket, checked the contents and handed the bag to Reyes, saying, \u201c [T]here better not be any trouble over this because I could [get] off easier by killing a man than going back to jail on selling dope. I am facing 15 years. ...\u201d As the four drove back to the bar, Reyes asked Velasquez if \u201cDonny\u201d could make it for a pound or a \u201ckilo;\u201d Velasquez told the officers to contact him the following evening at the same time and place. The paper bag received by Reyes that evening contained marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">At about 7 :45 p.m. of the following evening, Reyes, Tryal and \u201cChico\u201d again met Velasquez at the Schooner Bar. AYhcn Reyes asked if he could make it for a \u201ckilo,\u201d Velasquez replied, \u2018\u2018 Just a minute, I will call Donny, \u2019 \u2019 went to the rear of the bar to a telephone, returned in a few minutes and said, \u201cDonny is not in, let\u2019s go over and he may be there by the time we get there.\u201d The four again drove to Morales\u2019 home, Velasquez entered the house but returned shortly saying \u201cDonny\u201d was not there. At that moment Morales drove up in his car and parked adjacent to the house. The officers observed Velasquez and Morales converse and, as Velasquez returned to the car, overheard Morales say, \u201cMake sure you are down there because I don\u2019t want to take one with me and have to bring it back.\u2019\u2019.Velasquez entered Reyes\u2019 car and the four returned to the Schooner Bar. Enroute Velasquez said that if \u201cDonny\u201d could obtain two \u201ckilos,\u201d he would let Reyes have one kilo for $100 and that if Morales could only obtain one \u201ckilo,\u201d he would let Reyes have \u201cthree cans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">After they returned to the bar, at about 9 :20 p.m., Velas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>quez told Reyes,-\u201cI will call Donny,\u201d went to a telephone at the rear of the bar and returned in a few minutes saying, \u201c.Donny is on the way. He could only get one kilo, he is bringing three cans.\u201d At his request, Beyes gave Velasquez $40. About 10 p.m., Morales appeared, conversed with Velasquez and the. two left by the rear entrance. Reyes followed and observed Velasquez and Morales go to the latter\u2019s ear and saw Velasquez hand Morales something and Morales reach into the front of his automobile and hand Velasquez a \u201cpaper item.\u201d Reyes met the two at the rear entrance of the bar. While Morales was only a few feet away Velasquez told Reyes that \u201cDonny\u201d was his \u201cconnection.\u201d Velasquez told Reyes that he had \u201c.three cans\u201d and asked him to follow him into the rest room but when someone else entered, suggested that they go. to his. apartment. Upon arriving at Velasquez\u2019 apartment, the latter removed three brown paper bags from his jacket pocket, checked the contents and handed them to Reyes. The contents of the bags were identified as marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Morales testified in substance as follows: He did not see Velasquez on April 7. On the night of April 8, he returned from a shopping trip and as he was taking groceries into his house, he observed Velasquez talking to an unidentified individual but when he, Morales, came out of the house the third person was gone. He conversed briefly with Velasquez who said he was going to the Schooner Bar that evening and Morales said he might meet him. The subject of marijuana was not discussed. While he was in the bar that evening, he remembered leaving his keys in his car so he went out to get them. He encountered Velasquez who accused him of taking out his girl; they exchanged a few words; he removed the keys from his car; the two shook hands and they re-entered the bar. There was no delivery of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Velasquez testified in substance as follows: When he met Reyes on April 7, he had been unemployed for some time. \u201cChico\u201d told him that he could earn some money by providing a \u201cconnection\u201d for Reyes and displayed $50 in cash. \u201cChico\u201d said that Reyes had been convicted of a narcotics offense in Sacramento and was in San Bernardino looking for a new \u201cconnection.\u201d At the insistence of \u201cChico\u201d and Reyes, Velasquez agreed to make a call to Arlington. After making the call, he told Reyes that they could meet the unidentified man at \u201cDonny\u2019s\u201d house. On arriving at Morales\u2019 home,. Velasquez met the unidentified man in the backyard, obtained a bag of marijuana, and subsequently delivered it to Reyes. On April 8, he again called the unidentified individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>in Arlington and arrangements were made to. meet him at Morales\u2019 home. When they arrived, the man was there and Velasquez obtained from him \u201cthree cans\u201d of marijuana. At that moment Morales arrived and the two discussed going to the Schooner Bar. That evening he encountered Morales at the rear of the bar; a discussion ensued concerning Velasquez\u2019 girl friend; the two shook hands; and they returned to the bar through the rear entrance. No narcotics transaction occurred between Velasquez and Morales.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Defendant Morales contends (1) the court erred in denying his motion for separate trial; (2) extrajudicial statements made by Velasquez which implicated Morales were erroneously received; (3) the court abused its discretion in denying his motion for continuance; (4) the evidence was' insufficient to support his conviction; (5) the prosecutor was guilty of prejudicial misconduct; and (6) the court erred in denying his motion to visit the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The first three points raised by defendant are all premised on the theory that the extrajudicial statements implicating him, made by Velasquez out of Morales\u2019 presence, constituted inadmissible hearsay insofar as the latter was concerned. He, therefore, contends that under the rules enunciated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 518, his motion for' a' separate trial should have been granted, or in the alternative,'those portions of Velasquez\u2019 extrajudicial statements which implicated him should have been deleted.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The People contend that the statements were admissible against Morales under an exception to the hearsay rule which permits a declaration of a conspirator, made while participating in a conspiracy to commit a crime and in furtherance of that conspiracy to be received against a co-conspirator if there is independent proof of the existence of a conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">The exception is a well established rule of evidence. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1223<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ferlin, </em>203 Cal. 587, 599 [265 P. 230] ; <em>Laurel </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>255 Cal.App.2d 292, 297 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>[63 Cal.Rptr. 114]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hardeman, </em>244 Cal.App.2d 1, 39-40 [53 Cal.Rptr. 168], cert. den. 387 U.S. 912 [18 L.Ed.2d 634, 87 S.Ct. 1700]; Witkin, Evidence (2d ed. 1966) pp. 492-493; 4 Wigmore, Evidence [3d ed.] \u00a7 1079 McCormick Evidence, pp. 521-522.)  The admissibility ox the declaration of a eo-eonspirator. is not affected by the fact that the indictment or information- fails to charge a conspiracy. <em>(Lee Dip </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1937) 92 F.2d 802-803, cert. den. 303 U.S. 638 [82 L.Ed 1099, 58 S.Ct. 526] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Duran, </em>57 Cal.App.2d 363, 371 [134 P.2d 305]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Ferlin, supra, </em>203 Cal. 587, <em>599; People </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>12 Cal.App.2d 7, 15 [54 P.2d 770].) Ordinarily there must be some proof of a conspiracy before the declarations of the co-conspirator may be received but the trial court may, where it deems that the circumstances so require, relax the rule and permit the declarations\u2022 to be received first, subject to the establishment of the existence of a conspiracy by independent evidence. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1223; <em>People </em>v. <em>Calhoun, </em>50 Cal.2d 137, 144 [323 P.2d 427]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ferlin, supra; People </em>v. <em>Neighbors, </em>218 Cal.App.2d 593, 596 [32 Cal.Rptr. 473] ; 4 Wigmore, Evidence [3d ed.] \u00a7 1079, pp. 999-1000.)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">If the statements implicating Morales were admissible against the latter as declarations of a conspirator against a co-conspirator, the principles enunciated in <em>Aranda, supra, </em>would be inapplicable. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gant, </em>252 Cal.App.2d 101, 110 [60 Cal.Rptr. 154]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hardeman, supra; </em>Witkin, Cal.Criminal Procedure, 1967 Supp., p. 51.) <em>Aranda, supra, </em>was directed against extrajudicial statements implicating a co-defendant which were otherwise inadmissible against the nondeclarant defendant. The court held that an admonition to the jury that such statements should be considered only as against the declarant failed to provide adequate protection to the codefendant. In the present -case, if Velasquez\u2019 statements implicating Morales were admissible against the latter as a declaration of a conspirator admissible against a eo-eonspirator, a separate trial would not afford Morales any greater protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Defendant contends that the principles announced in <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 518, must be deemed to extend to declarations of a conspirator admissible against a \u2022 co-conspirator because there was evidence in that case that the defendants were engaged in a conspiracy. However, the extrajudicial statements involved in <em>Aranda </em>were those made by the eodefendant during his interrogation, by officers after arrest. Thus, even assuming that a conspiracy had existed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>such declarations would have been inadmissible against the non-declarant.  Confessions or admissions of a co-conspirator made to officers after his apprehension and arrest are not in furtherance of the conspiracy and do not fall within the exception to the hearsay rule. <em>(Fiswick </em>v. <em>United States, </em>329 U.S. 211, 217 [91 L.Ed. 196, 200-201, 67 S.Ct. 224]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Luker, </em>63 Cal.2d 464, 476 [47 Cal.Rptr. 209, 407 P.2d 9] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>40 Cal.2d 483, 489 [254 P.2d 501].)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The decisive issue, therefore, is whether, independent of the declarations of Velasquez, there was sufficient proof of a conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The elements of conspiracy are (1) an agreement; (2) specific intent; (3) unlawful objective; and (4) overt act. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aday, </em>226 Cal.App.2d 520, 533 [38 Cal.Rptr. 199], cert. den., 379 U.S. 931 [13 L.Ed.2d 343, 85 S.Ct. 329] ; 1 Witkin (1963) Cal. Crimes, p. 99.)  The existence of an agreement may be shown by circumstantial evidence. (Bom<em>pensiero </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>44 Cal.2d 178, 184 [281 P.2d 250] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Olf, </em>195 Cal.App.2d 97, 107 [15 Cal.Rptr. 390]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Massey, </em>151 Cal.App.2d 623, 651 [312 P.2d 365].) It is not necessary to show that the parties met and actually agreed to undertake the performance of an unlawful act or that they had previously arranged a detailed plan for its execution. (Pe<em>ople </em>v. <em>Cockrell, </em>63 Cal.2d 659, 667 [47 Cal.Rptr. 788, 408 P.2d 116], cert. den. 389 U.S. 1006 [19 L.Ed.2d 604, 88 S.Ct. 568] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Calhoun, supra, </em>50 Cal.2d 137, 144; <em>People </em>v. <em>Massey, supra, </em>p. 651.) There need be no showing of a direct association by the members of the conspiracy. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cockrell, supra, </em>p. 667; <em>People </em>v. <em>Olf, supra, </em>p. 105.) \u201cThe agreement may be inferred from the conduct of defendants, mutually carrying out a common purpose in violation of a penal statute.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cockrell, supra, </em>p. 667; <em>People </em>v. <em>Causey, </em>220 Cal.App.2d 641, 653 [34 Cal.Rptr. 43].)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">The evidence heretofore summarized, together with all reasonable inferences favorable to the People which may be drawn therefrom, independent of the declarations made by Velasquez, constituted sufficient foundational proof of the existence of. a conspiracy to permit the introduction of extrajudicial statements made by Velasquez implicating Morales.  The foundational requirement may be met without establishing a conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt or even by a preponderance of the evidence; only prima facie evidence of the fact is required. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Steccone, </em>36 Cal.2d 234, 238 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>[223 P.2d 17] (disapproving language in <em>People </em>v. <em>Doble, </em>203 Cal. 510, 517 [265 P. 184], indicating requirement of greater amount of proof); <em>People </em>v. <em>MacEwing, </em>216 Cal.App.2d 33, 44 [30 Cal.Rptr. 476]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>185 Cal.App.2d 59, 73-74 [8 Cal.Rptr. 91]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Massey, supra, </em>p. 642; 4 Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 1079.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Independent of the declarations of Velasquez, the evidence shows that Eeyes was introduced to Velasquez for the purpose of making a purchase of marijuana; Velasquez made a phone call; following the call they went to Morales\u2019 home where Velasquez was provided with $16 in cash, entered the house, returned and at his apartment removed a package containing marijuana which he delivered to Beyes; the next evening when Eeyes asked Velasquez for \u201cone kilo,\u201d the latter again made a phone call, they went to Morales\u2019 house, Velasquez and Morales conversed, and Morales was overheard to' say to Velasquez, \u201cMake sure you are down there, because I don\u2019t want to take one with me and have to bring it back;\u201d after they returned to the bar Velasquez made another phone call and requested $40 which Eeyes paid; when Morales entered the bar, the two went out to Morales\u2019 vehicle where Velasquez handed Morales something and Morales reached into his car and handed Velasquez a \u201cpaper item\u201d and Velasquez thereafter delivered 3 bags of marijuana to Eeyes.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The, evidence was sufficient to raise an inference that an agreem\u00e9nt existed between Velasquez and Morales to sell marijuana. \u201cIt has been held that persons can be prosecuted as conspirators if, by buying, selling, or doing some other act, they knowingly participated in a general plan to place narcotics in\u2022 the hands of ultimate users. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Aviles, </em>274 F.2d 179, 188; <em>Leyvas </em>v. <em>United States, </em>264 F.2d 272, 273 et seq.; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>262 F.2d 415, 417-418; <em>United States </em>v. <em>De Fillo, </em>257 F.2d 835, 838.) \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Van Eyk, </em>56 Cal.2d 471, 479 [15 Cal.Rptr. 150, 364 P.2d 326].) In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rich, supra, </em>the court, after pointing \"'out that the sufficiency of evidence relative to the establishment of a- conspiracy must be viewed against a background \u00f3f the type of crime involved, stated at p. 418:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">\u2018 \u2018 If there be knowledge by the individual defendant that he is a participant in a general plan designed to place narcotics in the hands of ultimate users, the courts have held that such persons may be deemed to be regarded as accredited members of the conspiracy. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Cockrell, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 659, in concluding that the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>conspiracy to sell marijuana, the court stated at p. 668:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">\u201cHere the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, discloses that the Cockrells were in possession of a large quantity of marijuana, that on two occasions Miss Phillips obtained marijuana at the home of the Cockrells for sale to Greene, and that each of the Cockrells participated in one or both of the sales to Greene. This evidence is sufficient to show an agreement between the Cockrells and Miss Phillips to sell marijuana and overt acts in furtherance of that agreement. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>256 Cal.App.2d 463 [64 Cal.Rptr. 59], cited by defendant, is not controlling. The issue here involved was not considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">The record discloses that the jury was properly instructed that it must not consider an alleged conspirator\u2019s declaration against a co-conspirator unless it first determines from other independent evidence that a conspiracy existed. Morales complains that the court should have instructed the jury, as in <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>40 Cal.2d 483, that the statements could only be considered against Velasquez. Reliance upon <em>Roberts </em>is misplaced, however, because it related to extrajudicial statements made by a co-conspirator to arresting officers after he had been apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Defendant contends that it was error to receive statements made by Velasquez on April 7 because there was no independent evidence of a conspiracy at that time and Morales was not charged with the sale made that day. The contention is without substance. Though ordinarily proof of the existence of a conspiracy should precede proof of the declaration of the co-conspirator, the court may, in its sound discretion, reverse the order of proof. In the instant case there was no abuse of discretion. The declarations made by Velasquez on April 7 were in furtherance of the conspiracy and were clearly relevant to prove that Morales made the sale on April 8. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Causey, supra, </em>220 Cal.App.2d 641, 654; <em>People </em>v. <em>Temple, </em>15 Cal.App.2d 336, 339 [59 P.2d 417].)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">There is no merit in the contention that the court abused its discretion in denying Morales a continuance. The chronology of the court proceedings reveals the following: May 12, 1966 Indictment filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">May 18, 1966 Mr. Novaek appeared for defendant and requested a continuance to permit further discovery. The matter was continued to June 1.</p>\n<p id=\"ATMF\">June 1, 1966 Motion made to dismiss under section 995,</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>June 17, 1966 Motion denied and continued to June 20 for a hearing on motion for severance.</p>\n<p id=\"AmE\">June 20, 1966 Motion for severance on <em>Aranda </em>grounds heard and denied and trial set for June 22.</p>\n<p id=\"Am6\">June 22, 1966 Matter reset for trial for June 27.</p>\n<p id=\"AGo\">June 27, 1966 Mr. Novack renewed motion for severance which was denied and the matter was set for trial for June 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">June 29, 1966 Matter trailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">June 30, 1966 Reset for July 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">July 11, 1966 Trial commences.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">Defendant was thus afforded ample opportunity to prepare for trial. His claim that he was surprised by the prosecutor's theory of conspiracy is not substantiated by the record. The record reveals that on Juno 20 at the hearing on the motion for severance, the district attorney argued that <em>Aranda </em>was inapplicable because the People intended to proceed on the theory of a conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">The contention that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction is likewise without merit. There was substantial evidence to support the verdict. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Newland, </em>15 Cal.2d 678, 681 [104 P.2d 778].)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-15\">Defendant contends that certain questions and remarks by the prosecutor constituted prejudicial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-16\">During the cross-examination of \u201cChico,\u201d he was asked where he resided. The prosecution's objection on the ground that it was irrelevant and immaterial \u201cfor the purpose of witness\u2019 safety\u201d was sustained. Defendant contends that the quoted portion of the objection constituted misconduct in that it implied that \u2018 \u2018 Chico\u2019s \u2019 \u2019 life would be endangered if defendants were not convicted. He also contends that the implication was further emphasized by the prosecutor during the direct examination of Officer Tryal by propounding the question whether he (Tryal) was in the district attorney\u2019s office the previous day with 11 Chico \u2019 \u2019 and whjr he was ordered to remain with him. Tryal\u2019s answer was \u201cTo protect Galindo [Chico].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-17\">The remark of the district attorney in support of his objection to defendant\u2019s question relating to \u201cChico\u2019s\u201d residence was non-prejudieial. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the remark was made in bad faith for the purpose of suggesting to the jury that the witness\u2019 life would be endangered if defendants were not convicted. Nor does defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>suggest that the court\u2019s ruling sustaining the objection deprived him of a constitutional right of confrontation and cross-examination. (See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>390 U.S. 129 [19 L.Ed.2d 956, 88 S.Ct. 748].) In <em>Smith, supra, </em>the Supreme Court held that the denial of a right to cross-examine an informer-witness respecting his true name and place of residence constituted a denial of due process where the informer who made the purchase of a narcotic was the only witness for the prosecution and the case turned on his credibility as against that of defendant. In the present case, \"Chico\u2019s\" testimony was substantially the same as, and merely corroborated, the testimony previously given by Officers Beyes and Tryal.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The testimony of Officer Tryal that he had been instructed to remain with \u201cChico\u201d in the district attorney\u2019s office to protect him was properly received. Earlier, during the cross-examination of \u201cChico,\u201d defense counsel elicited from him the fact that he was alone with Tryal in the district attorney\u2019s office \u201cyesterday morning.\u201d Although on cross-examination, \u201cChico\u201d denied discussing the case while he was with Tryal, Tryal\u2019s testimony was proper to rebut any inference that the two were together for the purpose of rehearsing 1' Chico\u2019s \u2019' testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Defendant contends the court erred in denying his motion for a jury view of the Schooner Bar as well as his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Penal Code, section 1119, states in relevant part: \u201cWhen, in the opinion of the court, it is proper that the jury should view the place in which the offense is charged to have been committed, or in which any other material fact occurred, . . . it may order the jury to be conducted in a body, in the custody of the sheriff, marshal or constable, as the case may be, to the place, or to such property. . . . \u201d A jury view rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge and his determination will not be disturbed absent a showing of abuse. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wong Hing, </em>176 Cal. 699, 705 [169 P. 357] ; <em>People </em>v.

In the present case there is nothing in the record which discloses an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">McCabe, P.
