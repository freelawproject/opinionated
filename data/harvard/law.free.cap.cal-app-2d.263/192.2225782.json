Code), two counts of receiving stolen property (\u00a7 496, Pen. Code) and one prior felony conviction (\u00a7 666, subd. 3, Pen. Code). He and all counsel waived trial by jury of the cause and the prior; the judge found defendant guilty on. the two burglary counts and acquitted him of receiving stolen property. Defendant\u2019s motion for new trial was denied and the prior conviction was found to be true; he appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">\" Kurt Scholz was summoned by police to his place of business at 221 South La Brea around 3 a.m. on July 3, 1966; a window was .broken and glass was on the floor; a radio set, record player and typewriter were missing. Jerry Kapeink, located at. the same address operating a driving school, was summoned by police \u00f3n July 3, 1966, around 4 or 5 a.m.; a window had been broken. Gustave Duschnes had an adding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>machine in Kapcink\u2019s office; he next saw it at the police station on July 4,1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Around 3 a.m. on July 3, 1966, Officers Oakes and Alexander were in the vicinity of Pico and Crenshaw, 3 miles from 221 South La Brea; their attention was drawn to defendant\u2019s vehicle traveling about 50 miles an hour in a 35-mile zone; while trying to clock the vehicle the officers observed the trunk open about one-third; they turned the red lights on the vehicle and defendant pulled over to the curb and stopped; the partly opened trunk was tied down with a light string and they saw through the opening what appeared to be business machinery and turntables. When the officers approached defendant he appeared to be extremely nervous and jittery, was sweating profusely, and spoke hesitatingly in a shaky voice. The officers asked him about the machinery in the trunk; defendant said he had been to a jam session in Hollywood, but further questioning established that he did not know the address or the name of those present or the name of any of the pieces of recording equipment, and Imew nothing about the business machines; the typewriter had a sheet of letterhead paper in the roller containing the name and address of a business concern on La Brea.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Defendant testified that on his way to the home of his ex-wife he saw the machinery stacked by the curb like trash in the 700 block of Crenshaw and loaded it into the trunk which he locked; he denied that he was exceeding the speed limit when stopped by the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Inasmuch as several issues raised by appellant relate to his overall claim that he was denied the right to representation by counsel, we refer briefly to the four counsel who appeared for him. At the trial (September 22, 1966) defendant was represented by Mr. Matzger, deputy public defender. After reading the testimony taken at the trial, we conclude, as did the judge, that Mr. Matzger did \u201cthe best he could with a very very bad factual situation.\u201d On October 14, 1966, on defendant\u2019s motion, Mr. Matzger was relieved and N. Garrett substituted as attorney of record; probation and sentence were continued to October 21, 1966. On October 21, 1966, Mr. Wyatt, appearing for defendant, moved for a new trial; the motion was denied, and Mr. Wyatt advised the court that defendant indicated to him he wanted him relieved as counsel; defendant then represented himself, the prior felony conviction was found to be true, and on defendant\u2019s motion probation and sentence were continued to November 15, 1966. Meanwhile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>defendant retained H. Clay Jacke who apparently resigned. Thereafter defendant personally moved for, and was granted, several continuances of probation and sentence\u2014to November 25 and December 9, 1966; during this time, in propria persona, he filed three petitions for writ of habeas corpus\u2014on November 14, November 30 and December 1, 1966, all of which' were denied. On December 9, 1966, defendant told the court he wanted a lawyer \u201cwho can walk the water\u201d; the judge said he knew of none who \u201ccan walk the water\u201d or \u201cwork miracles\u201d but \u201cIf you wish me to appoint counsel for the purpose of sentencing, I will.\u201d Defendant responded in the negative but the judge persisted: \u201cYou do not want a lawyer at this time?\u201d and defendant said, \u201cNo, sir, I do not.\u201d Defendant was arraigned for. judgment and again the judge said, \u201cThis is the time, if you wish, to tell me that I should appoint another lawyer for you if you desire\u201d; defendant replied that he did want a lawyer. The judge who pronounced judgment was not the trial judge and was unaware of defendant\u2019s previous experience with various counsel, thus he appointed the public defender; Mr. Matzger, who was in the courtroom, told him that in view of defendant\u2019s accusations against the public defender\u2019s ofSce private counsel should be appointed, but that defendant had hired and fired several private counsel. After further discussion defendant\u2019s request was denied on the ground that he had had a public defender and discharged two [three] private lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Appellant\u2019s claim that he was denied a jury trial on the prior felony conviction is without merit. On September 22, 1966, when the cause was called for trial defendant was arraigned on the prior felony conviction alleged in the information to be a violation of \u201cPenal Code, section 666.3.\u201d He denied the truth of the allegation, then properly waived Ms right to a trial by jury on both the main cause and the prior. The trial commenced and just after the first prosecution witness, Kurt Scholz, was sworn, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">\u201cThe Court: What section was that the alleged prior, Counsel ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">\u201cMr. Harrison: 666.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">11 The Court : There is no such section. There is a subdvision of Section 666, but there is no 666.3. Are you talking about Subdivision 3 of the Section?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-10\">&lt; \u00a3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-11\">\u2019 . \u201cMr..Harrison : Is that the proper one,-your Honor, 666.3?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-12\">*1 The Court : Petty theft with a prior petty theft ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\u201cMr. Harrison: That is what we are talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">\u201cMr. Matzger: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">\u201cMr. Harrison: The People move to amend the allegation with respect to the prior to strike Section 666.3 therefrom and substitute in the place and stead thereof 666, Subdivision 3, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">\u20181 The Court : I will grant your motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\">\u201cLet\u2019s go ahead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Appellant claims he was deprived of a jury trial on the issue of the prior because no waiver of a jury trial was taken after the amendment and his prior waiver does not <em>apply; </em>and that he should have been rearraigned on the prior.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">It is apparent that a typographical error was made in the preparation of the information and corrected by amendment by interlineation\u2014\u201c666.3\u201d was crossed out in ink and \u201c666, sub. 3\u201d written above it. No new offense was substituted <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>170 Cal.App.2d 159, 166 [338 P.2d 536]), nor was the change a substantial one <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smylie, </em>217 Cal.App.2d 118, 122 [31 Cal.Rptr. 360]) requiring either a new arraignment or jury waiver. Nor has appellant made a showing that any substantial right was prejudiced, and for good reason <em>\u25a0 </em>when he waived his right to a jury on the prior felony conviction, alleged in the information to be a violation of section 666.3, Penal\" Code, he thought he was waiving a jury on the issue of whether he had been convicted of \u2018 \u2018 petty theft with a prior petty theft,\u201d and in fact, he was. This is supported by defense counsel\u2019s admission, before the court called attention to the typographical error, that \u201cwe are talking about\u201d the crime of \u201cpetty theft with a prior petty theft\u201d as defined in section 666, subdivision 3, Penal Code, even though alleged as section 666.3, and defendant\u2019s subsequent failure to object to the amendment, mention arraignment or jury waiver thereon, or request a jury trial on the amended allegation. Even when the issue of the prior came before the trial judge for determination a month later, defendant made no mention of a jury trial although he engaged in an extensive discussion with the court and asked numerous questions. While the record shows that several months after the determination of the prior and after defendant was arraigned for judgment by another judge, he stated he would \u201clike a jury trial on [the] prior\u201d (considering this as another motion for new trial, the court denied the same), read in the context of the full colloquy between the court and defendant, it is clear that the statement had no connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>with the issue of jury waiver he now raises; it amounted to nothing more than a last effort to delay pronouncement of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Appellant says he was denied the right to counsel because (1) he \u201cnever personally stated that he wished to dismiss Mr. Wyatt as counsel, \u2019 \u2019 the court did not advise of his right to counsel and while representing himself the court found the allegation of the prior felony conviction to be true; and (2) sentence was pronounced while he was representing himself even though he made \u201crepeated demands\u201d of the court for counsel. Page after page of reporter\u2019s transcript of proceedings had subsequent to the trial attest the unlimited patience exhibited by the judge to a defendant whose obvious purpose was to delay the pronouncement of judgment and sentence. Carefully he advised defendant of his right to counsel, explained legal procedures, granted numerous continuances, repeatedly asked him if he wanted counsel and afforded him every opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">As to Mr. Wyatt\u2019s dismissal on October 21, 1966, he appeared for defendant and moved for a new trial. After denial of the motion Mr. Wyatt advised the judge he had read the probation officer\u2019s report, and called his attention to the fact that a determination of the prior was still pending. The minutes showed that evidence on the prior had been offered at the trial (Exh. 5) ; while waiting for the exhibit, Mr. Wyatt further advised the judge that defendant asked him to ask the court for a continuance of sentence, then \u201cTour Honor, he [defendant] has indicated that he would like to relieve me as counsel.\u201d The court relieved Mr. Wyatt and asked defendant if he also wanted a continuance of the determination of the prior but defendant answered, \u201cToday is fine.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>read to defendant Exhibit 5<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and asked, \u201cDo you have anything to say as to the matter of whether or not you were so convicted and so sentenced?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">\u201cMr. Wyatt : Submitted, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">\u201cThe Court: No, he is representing himself. He has relieved you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">\u201cMr. Wyatt : Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">\u201cThe Defendant: Oh, wait a minute. When I asked for this, your Honor, didn\u2019t you say you wouldn\u2019t have this and you wouldn\u2019t let me dismiss the counsel? I am under the impression that is what you said. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">\u201cThe Court: You told me, sir, you wanted to dismiss your counsel and I said 'All right, you can represent yourself, \u2019 and now you are representing yourself. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">Defendant did not take issue with the judge on the matter of his [defendant\u2019s] dismissal of Mr. Wyatt, interposed no objection to the discharge of Mr. Wyatt as his counsel and made no request for other counsel; instead, knowing he was representing himself, he undertook to do so without further comment. He asked the court why it was necessary to \u201cbring . . .up\u2019\u2019 the prior, and there followed a lengthy explanation by the court detailing the procedure; the colloquy is found in 10 pages of reporter\u2019s transcript. Meanwhile Mr. Wyatt asked to be excused and the court excused him; defendant made no objection. After further argument the court found the alleged prior to be true and continued the cause for judgment and sentence. Then the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-12\">\u201cThe Defendant: The fundamental of the Court is to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>an attorney through all proceedings of the trial and the Court ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">\u201cThe Court: Pardon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">\u201cThe Dependant : Isn\u2019t it right for the defendant to .have a lawyer or a counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">\u201cThe Court : Yes, you had a lawyer and you fired him. You fired two of them. You fired the Public Defender, and you got Mr. Wyatt, and you just fired Mr. Wyatt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">\u201cIt is your right to be represented at all times by an attorney at all stages of the proceedings against you.\u201d The court advised defendant that at the time of sentence he could be represented by counsel, \u201cBut as I say, you said you didn\u2019t want to have a lawyer, you discharged your lawyer, so I allowed you to discharge him. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">The defendant did not say \u201cI want to dismiss Mr. Wyatt,\u201d but it is abundantly clear that he wanted to discharge Mr. Wyatt and did so. Defendant\u2019s intent to dismiss his counsel is supported by his silence and lack of objection on the many occasions the matter was discussed, his subsequent conduct and his concession at the time of sentence that he had requested Mr. Wyatt be relieved; and the court was warranted in discharging Mr. Wyatt as defendant's counsel and allowing him to proceed in propria persona. In the light of defendant\u2019s prior experience with the public defender and two private counsel and his conduct in court, we find it difficult to ascribe any degree of good faith to his present claim that because the judge did not advise him of his right to be represented by counsel at the time the issue of the prior was determined he did not know he was entitled to an attorney. Further, it appears that defendant was agreeable to having the issue of the prior disposed of, for the court asked him if he wanted the proceeding to be continued with the judgment and sentence but he answered,1 <em>\u2018 </em>Today is fine. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">At the time of pronouncement of judgment and sentence (December 9,1966) the court said, \u201cYou also previously requested that your new counsel be relieved from this matter; am I correct as to that?\u201d and defendant answered, \u201cAs far as I understand, your Honor, yes.\u201d Then the court said, \u201cWell, is it your desire that you proceed without counsel?\u201d Defendant said no, that it was not, and asked permission to say something; he criticized the deputy public defender and the trial judge and leveled an accusation to the judge on the bench of taking \u201can oath to represent the People.\u201d A lengthy colloquy followed in which defendant equivocated when asked if he wanted a lawyer\u2014first he said he did, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>he said he did not, then he said he did;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the judge appointed the public defender. Mr. Matzger, who was in the courtroom, spoke up, \u201cI understand that Mr. Gary hired Niles Garrett and fired Niles Garrett. He hired H. Clay Jacke. Mr. Jacke resigned. In view of the accusations of Mr. Gary against the Public Defender\u2019s office, I think perhaps a private attorney would be in order.\u201d The judge asked defendant why he was dissatisfied with Garrett and Jacke.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">\u201cThe Court: The Court has to make a finding that you think you want a lawyer in good faith and not merely for the purpose of delaying these proceedings. There have been three separate lawyers here that you fired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">\u201cThe Dependant: If the Court will listen just one moment. I inquired for a Bar Association lawyer back in July, July 24th. It is clearly stated that I didn\u2019t want anyone associated with the State or other court and this is the reason I am standing before the Court at this particular time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>\u201cThe Goubt: I think there is nothing for the Court to do but proceed with the sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">\"The probation report having recommended that probation be denied on Count I, you are sentenced to the State Prison for the term prescribed by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">\u201cThe Defendant: Without a lawyer? Your Honor, I would like to have one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">\u201cThe Coubt: The record will note that you have again requested a lawyer. The record will also note that it is this Court\u2019s finding that you were represented at the trial by the public defender, that you terminated his services, that you subsequently attained <em>[sic] </em>the services of Mr. Garrett. . . . Mr. Jacke, and you terminated him. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">No legitimate reason for discharge of any of his counsel was advanced by defendant in the court below. The record reflects no justification for relieving the public defender. In fact, it appears from the reporter\u2019s transcript of the trial proceedings that the public defender properly and ably represented defendant at the trial.  Defendant must accept counsel appointed by the court, and if that counsel performs satisfactorily defendant must either accept his services or proceed in propria persona. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>232 Cal.App.2d 716, 723 [43 Cal.Rptr. 188].) However, before undertaking his own representation, defendant retained and discharged three private counsel. We have no doubt that when Mr. Wyatt was relieved and defendant proceeded in propria persona on the hearing for determination of the prior, he intelligently waived counsel. Further, between October 21, 1966, and December 9, 1966, he made no effort to obtain a lawyer, all the while in propria persona filing three separate petitions for writ of habeas corpus; in fact, he was not even sure he wanted counsel at the time of pronouncement of judgment and sentence.  Where defendant has intelligently waived counsel, the burden is on him to take some affirmative action to reinstate his right thereto. In such instance a motion for assistance of counsel would be directed to the sound discretion of the court. <em>(In re Turrieta, </em>54 Cal.2d 816, 821 [8 Cal.Rptr. 737, 356 P.2d 681].)  It should be noted that on December 9, 1966, there was nothing left for the court to do but pronounce judgment and sentence; motion for new trial had long before been made and denied and a prior felony conviction determined to be true. We find no abuse of the court\u2019s discretion and no violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights in denying his request for counsel and allowing him to proceed on his own at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>a stage when there was virtually nothing remaining to be done in the way of representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Appellant\u2019s contention that there is no evidence in the record that he was represented by counsel or made a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel at the time he was convicted of the prior felony (petty theft with a prior petty theft), thus the judgment should be reversed insofar as it determines that he suffered a prior felony conviction will not be considered for the first time on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>66 Cal.2d 390, 396-398 [58 Cal.Rptr. 1, 426 P.2d 161].)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Without merit is appellant\u2019s claim that he never testified on the issue of the prior. The record shows that he was afforded several opportunities to present whatever evidence he had on the issue of the prior felony conviction. On two separate occasions the judge asked him if he had any evidence to submit on the issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We note that while defendant was still represented by Mr. Wyatt the issue of the prior was raised and in Mr. Wyatt\u2019s presence the court asked defendant if he wanted a continuance of the determination of the prior and defendant stated, \u201cToday is fine\u2019\u2019; after the judge read Exhibit 5 to defendant and the first time asked him if he had anything to say as to the matter of whether he had been so convicted and sentenced, Mr. Wyatt stated to the court \u2018 \u2018 Submitted.\u2019\u2019 Inasmuch as the court had relieved Mr. Wyatt the judge addressed himself to defendant; defendant told him he \u201chad quite a few things in this matter\u2019\u2019 he would like to discuss and proceeded to do so at great length. Obviously he had no evidence to submit and offered none.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Wood, P.
