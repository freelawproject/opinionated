We find the support required for this \u201cdrastic\u201d method of obtaining a judgment quite lacking, and we are reversing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">It appears that plaintiff and some companions were visiting Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, on the evening of June 24, 1965, when, about 10 o\u2019clock, they were advised that they should leave, as the place was about to be closed. They heeded the warning and while on their way to the parking lot, lights were suddenly extinguished. The plaintiff kept on her way and fell, with the standard consequences: she \u201cwas injured in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>her health, strength and activity. \u2019 \u2019 The city takes the position that plaintiff has no cause of action against it: first, because it was under no legal obligation to furnish lights at the location where, and when, plaintiff needed them; and, secondly, because plaintiff was contributorily negligent in continuing on her way when she could not see.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Procedurally, the ease had progressed to the point where the plaintiff had a first amended complaint, filed December 15, 1965, to which the defendant city had filed an answer, setting up several affirmative defenses. Then the defendant filed its \u201cMotion for Summary Judgment\u201d which actually was a notice warning that a motion for such a judgment would be made \u201cupon the grounds that Plaintiff has no cause of action against this defendant, there being no duty owed to the Plaintiff by the Defendant, and the Plaintiff is barred from recovery being negligent as a matter of law.\u201d The \u201cmotion\u201d went on to announce that \u201cSaid motion will be made and based upon this Notice, all of the pleadings, records and papers on file herein, upon the Deposition of the Plaintiff, filed herewith, and the Declaration of Leon Hall and Exhibit \u2018A\u2019, attached herewith. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Several questions ask themselves at this point. Just what was the relation of the city to Griffith Observatory and the paths and area that surround it? What lights are there that, when on at night, afford help to visitors between the observatory and the parking lot? Were they turned off, and if so, .by whom?</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">We turn back to the pleadings to see if any of these questions were disposed of there. In the first amended complaint plaintiff alleged in paragraphs VI and VIII, that: \u201cVI. At all times mentioned herein, the area and sidewalk on the grounds of the Griffith Observatory and the parking lot contiguous thereto was, and is, public property within said city. . . . VIII. At all times mentioned herein, defendant city maintained lights on said property which illuminated the area between the Griffith Observatory building and the parking lot contiguous to the grounds thereof.\u201d These allegations were denied by the city in its answer. When this issue comes to be decided it will be remembered, of course, that every public building in a city is not the city\u2019s responsibility; it may, for example, be a law library, under the jurisdiction of a special board. A light in a public area in a city may or may not be placed and operated by the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Now we turn to the \u201cfacts\u201d made to appear in support of the motion of the city for a summary judgment. The jud,g<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>ment appealed from, we must keep in mind, was not one entered after a trial, but on defendant\u2019s motion for a summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Leon Hall, in his declaration September 27, 1966, tells us [italics added] :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-6\">\u201cThat I <em>am </em>the Associate Director of the Griffith Park Observatory, Department of Recreation and Parks, City of Los Angeles.\u201d He continues by relating that 10 years earlier, at which time his relation to the city is not given, he had \u201cinstigated, planned and caused to be installed certain lights for the illumination of a Monument existing in the center of the walkway approaching the Griffith Park Observatory Building.\u201d Attached to Hall\u2019s declaration as an exhibit is a drawing dated July 14, 1966, which he declares \u201cis a reasonable and fair representation of the roadway of Western Canyon Road where said roadway meets the walkway leading to the Griffith Park Observatory.\u201d The exhibit serves the purpose of Mr. Hall, that is, to emphasize that the six lights turned upward on the monument, were casting no light directly on the area below. But the sketch also shows two 11 foot 5-inch light posts, one on the west and one on the east side of the monument, next to a strip of \u201crock and oil pavement.\u201d The exhibit fails to indicate the location of the parking lot. No doubt the sketch would prove useful used before a jury, but on this motion for a summary judgment it raises more questions than it answers, with no more help than Hall\u2019s declaration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s \u201caffidavit,\u201d unsigned, consisting of a few more than 50 pages of the usual court reporter\u2019s work, contains far more \u201cI didn\u2019t notice\u201d and \u201cnot that I know of\u201d answers to questions asked her than of answers that are helpful in support of a motion for a summary judgment. It was taken on March 15, 1966, and we have gone through it in search of helpful statements. Her examination is introduced by the words: 1 \u2018 Called as a witness on behalf of the Defendant City; \u2019 \u2019 called, no doubt, in the hope that she would say something that would support the city\u2019s motion for a summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Skipping plaintiff\u2019s driver\u2019s license number and similar statistics, we learn: She has been to Griffith observatory on two previous occasions, at nighttime. They parked on the parking lot. When they came out of the observatory they noticed some statuary, \u201clike a monument, I think.\u201d It was illuminated. 1 \u2018 Any other lights on when you came out . . . ? \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>\u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d . . . \u201cIs there a paved walkway leading from the entrance of the observatory building to the parking lot?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d As they approached the parking lot, almost to the monument, the lights went out on the monument. \u201cThen what happened?\u201d \u201cAnd then we kept on walking and I stepped right off into space and went down on my knee. . . .\u201d \u201cAt the time that the lights went off at the monument, did you stop or pause? Did you continue walking ? \u201d \u201c I don\u2019t remember that. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">\u201cAfter the lights went off, did you have any difficulty in seeing ahead?\u201d \u201cYes. It\u2014just like\u2014well, a dark room when you turn out the lights.\u201d \u201cWere there any lights in the parking lot?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d ... \u201cDo you know what caused you to fall?\u201d \u201cJust dark and I didn\u2019t see the curb. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The deposition and declaration, added together, failed to furnish grounds on which to grant the city\u2019s motion for a dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s complaint and the entry of a summary judgment. Certainly it cannot be said that as a matter of law, plaintiff was contributorily negligent in doing what her companions also did, that is, not sit down and wait for daylight to rescue them, but try to get on to their car, even in the darkened condition. Possibly, on a trial, she will be found to be negligent, but the facts that we have do not foreclose a finding of \u201cnegligence not proven. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">As to the questions touching on the city\u2019s duty and the possibility that it was breached, it cannot be said that no question of fact remained unsettled. As stated in a multitude of cases, we find it said in <em>Dudum </em>v. <em>City of San Mateo </em>(1959) 167 Cal.App.2d 593, 598 [334 P.2d 968, 971] :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-7\">\u201cWe are limited to the facts shown by the affidavits <em>(Kimber </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.2d 914 [265 P.2d 922]), and are to determine only whether the facts so shown give rise to a triable issue <em>(Coyne </em>v. <em>Krempels, supra, </em>36 Cal.2d 257 [223 P.2d 244]). The summary judgment procedure is drastic and should be used with caution. <em>(Eagle Oil &amp; Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Prentice, </em>19 Cal.2d 553, 556, [122 P.2d 264].) We conclude that, under the rules applicable to summary judgments, the affidavits here do not negate the existence of a triable issue of fact, and that the case must be tried rather than determined on a motion for summary judgment. \u2019'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">We take as ours the last sentence quoted. The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Piles, P. J., and Jefferson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b793-15\">Retired judge of the superior court sitting under assignment by the Chairman of the Judicial Council</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
