Exercising jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a), we DENY the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-18\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-19\">Herrera is a native and citizen of Mexico who entered the United States without inspection in November 1999. In 2003, the Department of Homeland Security commenced removal proceedings against Herrera because his presence violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Herrera, however, claimed eligibility for adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i) based on his April 2001 \u25a0 marriage to a United States citizen.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-20\">In September 2006, an immigration judge found Herrera inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and ineligible for adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(i). Nonetheless, the judge granted a waiver of inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(v) after concluding Herrera\u2019s removal would cause extreme hardship to his wife and child.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>The government appealed this decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The BIA affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s determination that Herrera\u2019s inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) prevented his adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(f) to that of lawful permanent resident. But the BIA reversed the immigration judge\u2019s determination that Herrera qualified for a \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(v) inadmissibility waiver. Herrera then filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">On appeal, Herrera argues the BIA: (1) erred in finding that inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) barred his adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident under \u00a7 1255(f); (2) violated equal protection when it denied his adjustment of status petition; and (3) erred in reversing the immigration judge\u2019s \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(v) extreme hardship waiver. We address each argument in turn.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">A. Adjustment of Status</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">Herrera\u2019s primary challenge is to the BIA\u2019s determination that, absent a waiver, his inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) prevents an adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\u00ae. Because our jurisdiction extends to \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law,\u201d \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), this argument is properly before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-11\">Section 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) states that an alien who \u201chas been unlawfully present in the United States for one year or more ... is inadmissible,\u201d and may only apply for admission ten years after departure or removal. Section 1255\u00ae, however, permits certain aliens who entered the United States illegally to adjust their status to that of lawful permanent residents.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Herrera concedes his inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II), but argues he is nevertheless eligible for a \u00a7 1255\u00ae adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">Although our circuit has not addressed the interplay of these specific statutes, the BIA has held that, absent a waiver, aliens inadmissible under \u00a7. 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) do not qualify for a \u00a7 1255\u00ae adjustment of status. <em>See In re Lemus-Losa, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 373 (BIA 2007). The government argues the BIA\u2019s construction of \u00a7\u00a7 1255\u00ae and 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) in <em>Lemus-Losa </em>is entitled to deference under <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number><em>Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), and Herrera\u2019s appeal therefore fails. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">We review BIA legal determinations de novo. <em>Niang v. Gonzales, </em>422 F.3d 1187, 1196 (10th Cir.2005). We defer, however, to BIA constructions of immigration statutes when those statutes are \u201csilent or ambiguous\u201d on the question at issue and the BIA\u2019s reading is neither \u201carbitrary, capricious, [n]or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d <em>See Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 844, 842-45, 104 S.Ct. 2778; <em>see also INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 424, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999). Upon review, we conclude \u00a7\u00a7 1255\u00ae and 1182(a) are ambiguous and that the BIA\u2019s construction of them in <em>Lemus-Losa </em>was reasonable. We thus defer to Lemus-Losa\u2019s conclusion that inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) prevents adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">\n<em>1. Ambiguity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">We need not wrestle much with whether \u00a7\u00a7 1255\u00ae and 1182(a) are ambiguous for <em>Chevron </em>purposes. As explained below, applying the statutes\u2019 plain language would render \u00a7 1255\u00ae a nullity. <em>See Mora v. Mukasey, </em>550 F.3d 231, 237-38 (2d Cir.2008). Unable to rely on the statutes\u2019 plain language, therefore, we cannot \u201cascertain[whether] Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue.\u201d <em>See INS v. Cardozar-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 447 \u2014 18, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987) (quoting <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843 n. 9,104 S.Ct. 2778).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">Paragraph (1) of \u00a7 1255\u00ae provides that an alien who \u201centered ... without inspection\u201d may apply to adjust his immigration status to that of a lawful permanent resident. \u00a7 1255(i)(l). Paragraph (2), however, permits the Attorney General to \u201cadjust the status of the alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence\u201d only if, among other things, \u201cthe alien ... <em>is admissible </em>to the United States for permanent residence.\u201d \u00a7 1255(i)(2)(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">A problem immediately arises because \u00a7 1182(a) defines aliens who enter the United States without inspection as <em>in </em>admissible. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae (\u201cAn alien present in the United States without being admitted ... is inadmissible.\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, although \u00a7 1255(i)(l) permits aliens who \u201centered ... without inspection\u201d to apply for adjustment of status, \u00a7 1255(i)(2)(A)\u2019s requirement that such aliens also be \u201cadmissible\u201d means none of them will qualify absent a waiver. <em>See Mora, </em>550 F.3d at 235; <em>Ramirez-Canales v. Mukasey, </em>517 F.3d 904, 908 (6th Cir.2008). Put another way, a plain reading of the statutes would make entry without inspection \u201cboth a qualifying and a disqualifying condition for adjustment of status.\u201d <em>In re Briones, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 355, 362 (BIA 2007).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>Applying the plain language of the statutes in this situation risks rendering \u00a7 1255(i) a nullity. But this is unacceptable here, as nullifying \u00a7 1255(i) would \u201cfrustrate\u201d Congress\u2019s intent rather than \u201cgive [it] practical effect.\u201d <em>See United States v. Heckenliable, </em>446 F.3d 1048, 1051 (10th Cir.2006). Not wanting to read \u00a7 1255\u00ae as a nullity but unable to infer from the statutory language the way in which \u00a7 1255\u00ae implicitly waives unlawful presence as a ground for inadmissibility, we find the statute ambiguous. <em>See Mora, </em>550 F.3d at 237-38; <em>Morterar-Cruz v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 246, 253 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe precise reach of section 1255(i)[ ] is an implicit statutory ambiguity the executive branch is authorized to fill.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">\n<em>2. BIA Reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">To avoid rendering \u00a7 1255\u00ae a nullity, the BIA reads it as an implicit waiver of inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a), but <em>only </em>for those aliens who fall under paragraph (6)(A)(i) of the statute \u2014 i.e., \u00a7 1182(a)\u2019s general inadmissibility provision. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae (stating that \u201c[a]n alien present in the United States without being admitted ... is inadmissible.\u201d); <em>Briones, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 364-65; <em>Lemus-Losa, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 378-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">The authority to read the statute this way, according to the agency, comes from the \u201csavings clause\u201d at the very beginning of \u00a7 1182(a). This savings clause states that <em>\u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided in this chapter, </em>aliens who are inadmissible ... are ineligible ... to be admitted to the United States.\u201d \u00a7 1182(a) (emphasis added). In the BIA\u2019s view, \u00a7 1255(i)(l) falls within the scope of the savings clause and is thus an implicit waiver of the admissibility prerequisite. <em>Briones, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 364-65; <em>Mora, </em>550 F.3d at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">For the other more specific paragraphs in \u00a7 1182(a), including \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) applying to Herrera, \u00a7 1255\u00ae does <em>not </em>ordinarily permit adjustment of status. <em>See Lemus-Losa, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 378-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-10\">The BIA explains this disparate treatment of the \u00a7 1182(a) provisions by noting that while \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae applies <em>generally </em>to aliens who are present unlawfully, the other \u00a7 1182(a) provisions apply <em>specifically </em>to aliens present illegally who have also done something else \u2014 for example, they have repeatedly violated the immigration laws, \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C), or (like Herrera) have accrued a certain period of unlawful presence, \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II). <em>See Briones, </em>24 I. &amp; N. at 365; <em>Lemus-Losa, </em>24 I. &amp; N. at 379; <em>Mora, 550 </em>F.3d at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-11\">Whether \u00a7 1255\u00ae should be read as (1) waiving inadmissibility only under the general \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae, or (2) waiving inadmissibility under the more specific \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) as well, cannot be inferred clearly from the text of the immigration laws alone. The question is whether the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1182(a) in <em>Lemus-Losa </em>is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d <em>See Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-12\">In <em>Lemus-Losa^ </em>the BIA gave three primary reasons to interpret \u00a7 1255\u00ae as allowing aliens covered by the general \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae to apply for adjustment of status, but not aliens covered by the more specific \u00a7 1182(a) (9) (B) (i) (II).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-13\">First, the BIA noted the purpose of \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) was to \u201cpunish individuals who seek admission ... <em>after having previously accrued a period of unlawful </em>presence.\u201d <em>Lemus-Losa, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 379 (emphasis in original). According to the BIA, this suggests Congress went out of its way to distinguish between those simply \u201cpresent in the United States without being admitted,\u201d \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae, and ' those who, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>\u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II), have accrued a longer period of unlawful presence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Second, distinguishing between \u00a7 \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae and 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) is \u201cconsistent with the overall purpose of section [1182](a)(9) \u2018to compound the adverse consequences of immigration violations by making it more difficult for individuals who have left the United States after committing such violations to be lawfully admitted thereafter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Rodarte, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 905, 909 (BIA 2006)). Thus, making a \u00a7 1255\u00ae adjustment unavailable to aliens who are inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) accounts for the structure and language of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">Third, this interpretation is faithful to Congress\u2019s overall scheme of expressly waiving inadmissibility grounds where such waivers are intended. The BIA noted that \u201cin every case where Congress has extended eligibility for adjustment of status to inadmissible aliens, it has done so unambiguously.\u201d <em>Lemus-Losa, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 378 (citing <em>Briones, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 367). Congress\u2019s \u201cfailure to expressly provide an exception to the section [1182](a)(9)(B)(i)(II) inadmissibility\u201d was, in the BIA\u2019s opinion, \u201csignificant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For example, <em>Lemus-Losa </em>noted that on two separate occasions Congress had \u201cexpressly provided\u201d for a waiver of \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B) inadmissibility. <em>Id. </em>(citing the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, Pub.L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2192, <em>amended by </em>Pub.L. No. 105-139, 111 Stat. 2644 (1997), and the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1998, tit. IX, Pub.L. No. 105-277, 112 Stat. 2681-538). \u201cThe fact that Congress deemed it necessary to provide such waivers\u201d for these particular adjustment applicants, <em>Lemus-Losa </em>observed, \u201cbolster[ed]\u201d the view that inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) does not qualify one for a \u00a7 1255\u00ae adjustment of status. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">The BIA\u2019s reasoning in <em>Lemus-Losa </em>was neither arbitrary, capricious, nor manifestly contrary to the statute. As the agency\u2019s analysis indicates, the language and structure of the relevant statutes\u2014 along with Congress\u2019s specific waivers in certain instances \u2014 -reasonably suggest Congress considers aliens who accrue a period of unlawful presence more culpable than those immigration violators who do not, and are thus less deserving of relief under \u00a7 1255\u00ae. Hence, we do not think the agency unreasonably interpreted \u00a7 1255\u00ae as extending relief to aliens who are inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae, but not to those who are also inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II). <em>See Mora, </em>550 F.3d at 239 (finding the same with regard to the nearby \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I)); <em>Ramirez-Canales, </em>517 F.3d at 910 (same); <em>Morterar-Cruz, </em>409 F.3d at 255-56 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">To the extent Herrera argues that our opinion in <em>Padilla-Caldera v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir.2005), requires that we find Herrera eligible for adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255\u00ae, we find the authority distinguishable. <em>Padillar-Caldera </em>addressed a separate provision\u2014 \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) \u2014 and did not have the benefit of guidance from the BIA in resolving the statutory ambiguity. Significantly, the BIA has specifically disagreed with <em>Padillar-Caldera </em>in its subsequent decision in <em>Briones, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 355 (finding adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255\u00ae unavailable to aliens inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I)). Even if <em>PadillarCaldera </em>were directly on point, it would be of limited value in light of the BIA\u2019s later statutory guidance. <em>See Nat\u2019l Cable &amp; Telecomms. Ass\u2019n v. Brand X Internet Servs., </em>545 U.S. 967, 982, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 162 L.Ed.2d 820 (2005) (holding a circuit court must apply <em>Chevron </em>deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute regardless of the circuit court\u2019s contrary precedent, provided the court\u2019s earlier prece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>dent was an interpretation of a statutory ambiguity); <em>see also </em>Sarah Ignatius <em>&amp; </em>Elisabeth S. Stickney, <em>Immigration Law and the Family </em>\u00a7 12:25 n. 5 (2009) (noting that \u201c[b]efore relying on <em>Padillar-Caldera, </em>practitioners should make sure it is still good law as the Tenth Circuit may revisit this issue in light of the ... <em>Briones </em>[ ] decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">Because Herrera does not dispute his inadmissibility pursuant to \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II), and because the BIA\u2019s determination that such inadmissibility precludes \u00a7 1255(i) relief was reasonable under <em>Chevron, </em>the agency did not err in denying Herrera\u2019s application for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">B. Equal Protection</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">The government contends Herrera has waived his equal protection argument because his brief fails to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a). In particular, it argues, the brief lacks an argument setting forth his contentions and the appropriate supporting authorities. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">We find these deficiencies fatal to Herrera\u2019s equal protection claim. Equal protection comprises a substantial portion of the opening brief, but nowhere does Herrera articulate his specific contentions, the action he is challenging, or how the government specifically violated his rights. Instead, the brief cites to cases only tangentially relevant to the one before this court, reviews irrelevant allegations of immigration abuses by the government, and makes policy arguments beyond the court\u2019s purview. We have previously declined \u201c[to] make arguments for [the appellant] that it did not make in its briefs,\u201d <em>O\u2019Neal v. Ferguson Const. Co., </em>237 F.3d 1248, 1257 n. 1 (10th Cir.2001), and decline to do so here as well. Herrera has therefore waived his equal protection argument. <em>See Becker v. Kroll, </em>494 F.3d 904, 913 n. 6 (10th Cir.2007) (an issue \u201cinsufficiently raised in the opening brief is deemed waived\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-10\">C. The \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(v) Hardship Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-11\">Herrera also contends the BIA erred in reversing the immigration judge\u2019s grant of a waiver under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(v). This provision permits waiving inadmissibility when an alien has a United States citizen family member and refusal of admission would result in \u201cextreme hardship\u201d for that family member. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(v). The government argues this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision to deny Herrera\u2019s request for waiver, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-12\">Our jurisdiction in this case arises under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a), but it is limited in several aspects. The language of \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(v) itself reflects one of these limitations. Under the statute, \u201c[t]he [BIA] has <em>sole discretion \u201d </em>to invoke a waiver, and <em>\u201c[n]o court </em>shall have jurisdiction to review a decision or action by the [BIA] regarding a waiver under this clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-13\">The INA\u2019s general jurisdiction statute would yield the same result, as it prohibits courts from reviewing \u201cany ... decision or action of the [BIA] ... the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the [BIA].\u201d \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). We have construed this restriction broadly, finding that it \u201capplies to all discretionary decisions enumerated in the relevant subchapter of Title 8 regardless of the context in which the decisions were made.\u201d <em>Yerkovich v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 990, 994-95 (10th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-14\">In light of these restrictions on our jurisdiction, we decline to address Herrera\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s waiver determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">In sum, we DENY the government\u2019s motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 31 for failure to prosecute. We also find the BIA interpreted ambiguous provisions of the immigration laws in a reasonable way, entitling <em>Lemus-Losa </em>to <em>Chevron </em>deference and rendering Herrera ineligible for a \u00a7 1255(i) adjustment of status. Finally, we decline to address Herrera\u2019s equal protection and \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(v) waiver arguments. Herrera\u2019s petition for review is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">. The INA is codified under Title 8 of the United States Code. For purposes of convenience here, we cite only to the latter. Thus, INA \u00a7 242(a) is cited as 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a); INA \u00a7 245\u00a9 is cited as 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\u00a9; and INA \u00a7 212(a)(9) is cited as 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">. Section 1255\u00a9 permits aliens who entered the United States without inspection to apply for adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident provided they meet certain requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1023-22\">. Under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II), an alien who has been unlawfully present in the United States for more than one year is inadmissible and may only apply for admission ten years after departure or removal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1023-23\">. Immigration judges may waive inadmissibility if refusing an alien\u2019s admission would result in \"extreme hardship\u201d to the alien's spouse, parent, or child residing in the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(v).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">. The government has filed a motion to dismiss this appeal for failure to prosecute because Herrera missed filing his brief by the original deadline. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 31(c) (allowing an appellee to move for dismissal if the appellant fails to file a timely opening brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">The untimely filing of a brief is not a jurisdictional defect and we have discretion to excuse a late filing. <em>Burnham v. Humphrey Hospitality Reit Trust, Inc., </em>403 F.3d 709, 712 <em>(10th </em>Cir.2005); <em>Hutchinson v. Pfeil, 211 </em>F.3d 515, 517 n. 1 (10th Cir.2000). Indeed, absent an allegation by the opposing party that it suffered prejudice because of the delay, we generally allow such filings. <em>See Burnham, </em>403 F.3d at 712 (holding that a party could file its brief approximately two months late). The government has not alleged any prejudice from this delay and we exercise our discretion to permit the late filing. The motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute is therefore denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">. The statute provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-15\">[A]n alien physically present in the United States ... who ... has entered the United States without inspection!)] who is the beneficiary ... of ... a petition for classification under [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154] that was filed with the Attorney General on or before April 30, 2001[,] and ... who, in the case of a beneficiary of a petition for classification ... that was filed after January 14, 1998, is physically present in the United States on December 21, 2000 ... may apply to the Attorney General for adjustment of his or her status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-16\">\u00a7 1255(i)(l).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">. The provision of \u00a7 1182(a) cited here, paragraph (6)(A)(i), is the statute\u2019s general inadmissibility provision. But \u00a7 1182(a) also has more specific inadmissibility provisions that apply to particular subgroups \u2014 such as the \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) provision applicable to aliens (like Herrera) who have accrued a certain amount of time in the country illegally.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">. Th\u00e9 apparently conflicting provisions result from Congress\u2019s adoption of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546. <em>See Briones, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 362-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-13\">In the pre-IIRIRA regime, aliens who entered the country without inspection after having been deported could be deemed \"inadmissible\u201d depending on the circumstances, and thus barred from adjusting their status under \u00a7 1255(i). But aliens who otherwise had entered the country illegally were deemed \"deportable,\u201d not \"inadmissible,\u201d and so were not barred from adjusting their status under \u00a7 1255(i). <em>See id. </em>The IIRIRA, however, declared that aliens who entered the country without having been inspected or paroled are deemed \u201cinadmissible.\u201d <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 301(c)(1), 110 Stat. 3009-578; <em>Briones, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 363.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
