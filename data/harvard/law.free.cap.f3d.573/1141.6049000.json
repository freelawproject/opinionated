On appeal, he contends that the evidence should have been suppressed because Georgia law enforcement officers lacked authority to arrest him in Florida. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">A federal grand jury returned an indictment against Goings, charging him with possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(iii), and (b)(1)(C). Goings filed a motion to suppress evidence seized from him at the time of his arrest. He asserted that, on June 15, 2007, members of the Thomas County, Georgia\u2014 Thomasville Narcotics/Vice Squad went to his Thomasville residence after learning that he had four outstanding arrest warrants. Upon their arrival, they observed Goings drive away from the residence, at which point they activated the blue lights on their vehicle and pursued him. A high-speed chase ensued, and the officers pursued Goings over the Florida state line. The officers ultimately arrested Goings after he crashed his vehicle and attempted to flee, at which point they found narcotics and cash on his person and at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">Goings argued that, although Florida law allowed officers to arrest an individual outside of their jurisdiction when in fresh pursuit, that law was inapplicable because there was no interstate compact between Thomas County, Georgia, and Leon County, Florida. The government responded that the arrest was legal under Florida law because the officers were in fresh pursuit and, contrary to Goings\u2019s argument, interstate compacts \u201conly become relevant when there is no fresh pursuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-6\">Goings filed a supplemental motion to suppress, in which he asserted that the pursuing officers had been advised by their supervisor to discontinue the chase into Florida. As a result, Goings argued that the arrest was not permitted under the fresh pursuit doctrine because the officers were not \u201cduly authorized\u201d to continue their pursuit into Florida. The government responded that the officers were never instructed to discontinue their pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-7\">At the suppression hearing, the district court asked defense counsel to address the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Virginia v. Moore, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1598, 170 L.Ed.2d 559 (2008). Defense counsel acknowledged that <em>Moore </em>appeared to hold that it was irrelevant whether state law prohibited the arrest, but he nonetheless expressed frustration with the logic of the decision. Relying on <em>Moore, </em>and without hearing any testimony, the court issued the following ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-9\">The principle that the Supreme Court has adopted is that when there is probable cause to believe that a person has committed an offense, then arresting the person does not violate the Fourth Amendment. It may violate other laws or regulations, but those don\u2019t require suppression of evidence in a federal criminal proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1160-10\">Alternatively, the court also found that the arrest was authorized under the fresh pursuit doctrine. Goings subsequently pled guilty, pursuant to a written plea agreement, preserving the right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion. The court ultimately sentenced Goings to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-12\">\u201cIn reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we review the findings of fact for clear error and the application of law to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Mercer, </em>541 F.3d 1070, 1073-74 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 954, 173 L.Ed.2d 150 (2009). In <em>Moore, </em>the Supreme Court addressed \u201cwhether a police officer violates the Fourth Amendment by making an arrest based on probable cause but prohibited by state law.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 1601. In that case, the officers arrested the defendant for driving with a suspended license, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>though state law only authorized them to issue a summons. <em>Id. </em>at 1602-03. As a result, the defendant argued that the drugs found in his possession during a search incident to that arrest should have been suppressed, but the Supreme Court \u201cconclude[d] that warrantless arrests for crimes committed in the presence of an arresting officer are reasonable under the Constitution,\u201d explaining \u201cthat while States are free to regulate such arrests however they desire, state restrictions do not alter the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protections.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1607.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">In this case, Goings argues that the district court erred by denying his suppression motion only on the ground that, the arrest leading to the discovery of the evidence violated Florida law. However, the district court correctly found that, under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Moore, </em>it was irrelevant for purposes of the Fourth Amendment whether Goings\u2019s arrest violated state law, so long as it was supported by probable cause. <em>See id. </em>at 1608 (\u201cWhen officers have probable cause to believe that a person has committed a crime in their presence, the Fourth Amendment permits them to make an arrest .... \u201d). In this respect, Goings effectively concedes on appeal that his arrest was supported by probable cause, and he does not otherwise challenge the court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion. Accordingly, we need not address whether the arrest violated Florida law, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
