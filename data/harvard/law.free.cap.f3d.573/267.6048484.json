Specifically, Shafer admitted to \u201ccausfing] an eleven-year-old boy to undress and engage in sexually explicit conduct, including, but not limited to, masturbation and the lascivious exhibition of his genitals and pubic area. [Shafer] produced seven (7) digital images of the sexually explicit conduct using materials which had been shipped and transported in interstate and foreign commerce, including, but not limited to, a Sony Mavica brand digital camera that was manufactured outside of the State of Michigan.\u201d Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 14-15 (Indictment at 1-2). Shafer\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the district court clearly erred at sentencing when it imposed a two-level enhancement pursuant to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) (2006). After we issued an opinion in this case, the Government presented in a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc a new argument that we did not have occasion to consider in our initial review. In light of this new argument, we provided Shafer an opportunity to respond to the Government\u2019s position, and we conducted further research regarding the legislative purpose behind the statute at issue in this case as expressed in the statute\u2019s legislative history. Having thoroughly reviewed these additional materials, we now AFFIRM Shafer\u2019s sentence. We withdraw our prior opinion and issue this amended opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-15\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURE</p>\n<p id=\"b295-16\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. Shafer and codefendant Kurt Amundson (\u201cAmundson\u201d) operated a licensed foster-care home in Michigan. On June 20, 2006, the Van Bur\u00e9n County, Michigan, Sheriffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Department received information from C.J., a minor boy in Shafer\u2019s and Amundson\u2019s care, and C.J.\u2019s father, that pertained to child pornography and other illegal conduct involving Shafer and Amundson. C.J. stated that, while he was under Shafer\u2019s and Amundson\u2019s care, he and other boys would join Shafer and Amundson in the hot tub at the residence. On one occasion, C.J. saw Amundson and Shafer in the hot tub with J.G., another minor ward of Amundson and Shafer, and B.H.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a minor boy; everyone in the hot tub was naked. C.J. also reported finding pornographic pictures on Shafer\u2019s and Amundson\u2019s computers, but denied having any inappropriate contact with either Shafer or Amundson.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">On June 29, 2006, law-enforcement officials executed a search warrant on Shafer\u2019s and Amundson\u2019s home, seizing various computers, floppy disks, DVDs, CDs, videotapes, and an external hard drive. Shafer was the primary user of one computer, which contained 144 images of suspected child pornography dating from November 2003, to April 5, 2006. In total, the search uncovered \u201c20 images of child pornography production; 25,086 images of child pornography; and 1,244 child pornographic videos.\u201d J.A. at 194 (Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) at 9 \u00b6 35).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Of the images discovered, several included images of B.H. either naked or exposing his genitals or buttocks. One picture, taken when B.H. was eleven years old, depicted B.H. masturbating. B.H. was thirteen years old at the time these photos were discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">On June 6, 2007, a grand jury returned a six-count indictment charging Shafer and Amundson with sexually exploiting children. Law-enforcement officials arrested Shafer and Amundson on June 7, 2007. Pursuant to a proffer agreement, the FBI interviewed Shafer on July 18, 2007. At that time, \u201cShafer admitted molesting B.H. since he was approximately 8 years old.\u201d J.A. at 195 (PSR at 10 \u00b6 47). Shafer believed this molestation occurred \u201conce every two weeks over a five or six year period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Shafer further detailed specific instances in which he and Amundson molested B.H. Shafer also admitted to sexually assaulting other children, but denied ever having sexual intercourse with J.G.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">On July 25, 2007, Shafer pleaded guilty to count one of the indictment, enticing a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purposes of producing visual depictions of such conduct and which were produced using material which had been shipped and transported in interstate and foreign commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a), and consented to the forfeiture allegation under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2253(a)(1) and (a)(3) expressed in count six. Count one specifically stated that Shafer \u201ccaused an eleven-year-old boy to undress and engage in sexually explicit conduct, including, but not limited to, masturbation and the lascivious exhibition of his genitals and pubic area\u201d and produced seven \u201cdigital images of the sexually explicit conduct us<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ing materials which had been shipped and transported in interstate and foreign commerce.\u201d J.A. at 14-15 (Indictment at 1-2).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">A PSR was ordered and provided to Shafer prior to sentencing. The PSR calculated Shafer\u2019s base offense level as 32 and imposed multiple enhancements. Shafer raised several objections to the PSR in a sentencing memorandum. Most important for purposes of this appeal, Shafer objected to a two-level enhancement awarded pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.1 (b)(2)(A), which applies when \u201cthe offense involved ... the commission of a sexual act or sexual contact.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A). Shafer argued that both the term \u201csexual act\u201d and the term \u201csexual contact\u201d require one individual to touch another individual and thus do not encompass self-masturbation.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The district court responded to Shafer\u2019s objections at Shafer\u2019s sentencing hearing on December 10, 2007. During argument regarding the \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) enhancement, Shafer conceded that there was evidence \u201cthat he personally had direct physical contact with BH of a sexual nature but not with respect to the offense of conviction.\u201d J.A. at 120 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 24). The district judge overruled Shafer\u2019s objection to the \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) enhancement, finding two grounds to support imposing the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">First, the district judge found that, although \u201csexual act,\u201d as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(2), requires one individual to make contact with another individual, the plain language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(3) defining \u201csexual contact\u201d is broader, covering self-masturbation when done with the intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of either the person masturbating or a person watching. Specifically, the district judge stressed that \u00a7 2246(3) defined \u201csexual contact\u201d to include \u201cthe intentional touching ... of the genitalia ... of any person\u201d and that \u201ca person masturbating is caught touching the genitalia of any person, namely, his or her own.\u201d J.A. at 125 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 29). The district judge further found that a person can masturbate \u201cwith the intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person,\u201d as required by \u00a7 2246(3), \u201cand the desire of any person could include the [desire of the] person masturbating, or in this case could include the [desire of the] people filming [the masturbation], namely, [Shafer].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Second, the district judge found that, for purposes of this case, \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) is not limited to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">the specific offense of conviction. Rather, I think, to say that the offense, not the offense of conviction, involved the commission of a sexual act or sexual contact implies more and suggests that the entire pattern of conduct involving at least a particular minor victim, such as BH in this case, ranging from earliest evidence of that at age 8 to the offense of conviction at age 11, is all part and parcel of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">J.A. at 126 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 30). The district judge elaborated that \u201cgrooming conduct was an admitted part of what was going on here. This was not sex by force; it was sex by trust. And that involves ongoing acts and ongoing contact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district judge concluded that \u201canything related to that particular minor victim in the house of the codefendants as part of their overall relationship is fair consideration for application of that guideline under 2G2.1[(b)](2)(A), and so that\u2019s an alternative basis, and the Court is holding that the enhancement would apply.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">After ruling on all of Shafer\u2019s objections, some of which were sustained and are not at issue in this appeal, and awarding a one-level reduction pursuant to the Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>ment\u2019s motion for departure, the district court recalculated Shafer\u2019s offense level to be 41, with a criminal history category of I. The applicable guidelines range is 324 to 405 months; however, due to the 360-month statutory maximum for the offense to which Shafer pleaded, Shafer\u2019s guidelines range was set at 324 to 360 months. The district court sentenced Shafer to 360 months of imprisonment. Shafer timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Shafer contends that the district court erred when it imposed the two-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) because he asserts that: (1) \u201csexual contact\u201d does not include self-masturbation and (2) Shafer did not commit any \u201csexual contact\u201d that can be considered \u201crelevant conduct\u201d for purposes of the enhancement. We disagree with Shafer\u2019s first assertion, and we conclude that the self-masturbation at issue in the instant case constitutes \u201csexual contact\u201d sufficient to support the district court\u2019s imposition of an enhancement under \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A). We therefore need not and do not reach the district court\u2019s alternative \u201crelevant conduct\u201d justification for the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">We review the sentencing court\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines de novo and the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Conrado, </em>304 F.3d 593, 607 (6th Cir.2002) (citing <em>United States v. Swiney, </em>203 F.3d 397, 401 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>530 U.S. 1238 (2000)). \u201c \u2018A matter requiring statutory interpretation is a question of law requiring de novo review, and the starting point for interpretation is the language of the statute itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Dedman, </em>527 F.3d 577, 584-85 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>49 F.3d 251, 251 (6th Cir.1995)) (second set of internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cAbsent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, th[e statutory] language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.\u201d <em>Consumer Prod. Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">B. Self-Masturbation and the Scope of \u201cSexual Contact\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">Shafer contends that the term \u201csexual contact\u201d does not include self-masturbation. Neither party provided the court with any caselaw addressing whether self-masturbation is covered by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(3)\u2019s definition of \u201csexual contact.\u201d We also were unable to locate such a case in any circuit. Thus, this issue of statutory interpretation appears to be a question of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">Section 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) of the Sentencing Guidelines states that \u201c[i]f the offense involved ... the commission of a sexual act or sexual contact, increase [the base offense level] by 2 levels.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A). \u201cSexual act\u201d and \u201csexual contact\u201d are defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2246(2) and (3), respectively. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) applic. n. 2. \u201cSexual act\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as \u201cthe intentional touching, not through the clothing, of the genitalia <em>of another person </em>who has not attained the age of 16 years with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(2)(D) (emphasis added). Section 2246(3) defines \u201csexual contact\u201d as \u201cthe intentional touching, either directly or through the clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of <em>any person </em>with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>any person.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(3) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The Government argues that, although the statutory term \u201csexual act\u201d does not include self-masturbation because it does not involve the touching of another, the statutory term \u201csexual contact\u201d is a broader term that encompasses the sexual touching of oneself. This argument has merit. Section 2246(3) clearly states that \u201csexual contact\u201d involves certain intentional touching of \u201cany person.\u201d \u201cAny person\u201d includes a person touching himself or herself. <em>See </em>Merriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 53 (10th ed.1995) (defining \u201cany\u201d as \u201cEVERY \u2014 used to indicate one selected without restriction\u201d). This argument is strengthened by the fact that the definition of \u201csexual act\u201d requires the touching \u201cof another person.\u201d \u00a7 2246(2)(D). \u201cAnother person\u201d clearly requires at least two individuals to be involved in the act. Thus, because Congress chose to use different language when defining \u201csexual contact,\u201d it seems clear that Congress intended not to limit \u201csexual contact\u201d in the same way it limited \u201csexual act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In his initial briefing before us, Shafer asserted that, because Congress failed to \u201cspecifically include self-masturbation in the definition of \u2018sexual contact,\u2019 \u201d we should not \u201cinvade the role of Congress and define statutory terms,\u201d and contended that we should hold that \u201csexual contact,\u201d like \u201csexual act,\u201d requires one person to touch another person. Shafer Br. at 14. However, nothing in \u00a7 2246(3) supports a holding that more than one person must be involved for \u201csexual contact\u201d to occur. Simply because the statute does not specifically state that self-masturbation qualifies as \u201csexual contact\u201d does not mean that Congress intended for such an activity to be excluded, especially when self-masturbation falls squarely within the language of \u00a7 2246(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">Furthermore, the legislative history of \u00a7 2246(3) does not evidence \u201ca clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary.\u201d <em>Consumer Prod., </em>447 U.S. at 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051. Rather, according to the Report of the House Committee on the Judiciary, the Sexual Abuse Act of 1986 (\u201cthe Act\u201d), of which \u00a7 2246(3) is a part, was drafted with the intention of \u201creaching] all forms of sexual abuse of another.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 99-594, at 11 (1986), <em>as reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6186, 6191. The activity at issue in this case \u2014 the coerced self-masturbation by a minor child \u2014 is a form of sexual abuse of another. Moreover, the Act was \u201cdrafted broadly to cover the widest possible variety of sexual abuse,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 12, further solidifying our belief that self-masturbation is encompassed by the term \u201csexual contact.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that \u201csexual contact,\u201d as defined by \u00a7 2246(3), in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>eludes self-masturbation, as long as the other requirements of the statute are satisfied.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">C. The Intent Element of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The statutory requirements for \u201csexual contact\u201d also include two intent elements. The first, which is not at issue in the instant appeal, is the requirement that there was \u201cthe intentional touching ... of the genitalia\u201d of B.H. by B.H. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(3). There is no debate here regarding whether B.H. intentionally touched his own genitalia, and thus the first intent requirement is satisfied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The question before us is the second intent requirement of \u00a7 2246(3), i.e., that there be \u201ctouching ... of the genitalia ... of [B.H.] <em>with an intent to </em>abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.\u201d \u00a7 2246(3) (emphasis added) (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe intent clause\u201d). In regards to this latter question, the Government has raised an argument in its petition for rehearing that it did not raise before the panel during our initial consideration. Thus, before we can decide the intent-clause issue, we must first determine whether this issue is properly before us on petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">1. Scope of Petition for Rehearing</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">In their initial briefings before us, neither party addressed the intent clause with any amount of specificity. Indeed, the Government\u2019s only mention of the intent clause suggested that it believed, as did the panel originally, that the intent clause referred to the intent of the toucher, in this case B.H.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-12\">In the context of this case, the term \u201csexual contact\u201d includes the intentional touching of B.H.\u2019s genitalia <em>by B.H., with an intent to </em>arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person. The sexual desires could be B.H.\u2019s or, to the extent that they were aroused by watching, the sexual desires could be Defendant Shafer and Defendant Amundson\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">Gov\u2019t Br. at 17 (emphasis added). At oral argument, the panel extensively questioned the Government on the intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>clause. The Government initially asserted that the intent clause referred to B.H.\u2019s intent and that the requisite intent could be gleaned from the fact that B.H. was self-masturbating. The Government then briefly contended that, although the statute requires that the person doing the touching perform that act intentionally, the intent clause of the statute refers to the defendant\u2019s intent. Upon further questioning, however, the Government quickly abandoned this argument in favor of its earlier position \u2014 that B.H.\u2019s intent was the pertinent inquiry and that such intent could be inferred from the act of self-masturbation. Even though the parties had not briefed the issue of the intent clause and the panel made abundantly clear during oral argument that intent was an important issue in this case, neither party sought to submit subsequent letter briefs. Furthermore, the Government made no real attempt to dissuade the panel from an interpretation of the intent clause requiring a court to look at the intent of the individual doing the touching to determine if \u201csexual contact\u201d occurred, and this was the reading of the intent clause that we adopted in our initial opinion. Applying that reading of the statute, we concluded that there was no evidence that B.H. self-masturbated with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of himself or any onlooker. We vacated Shafer\u2019s sentence and remanded, noting that \u201cour holding does not preclude the district court from making the necessary finding of intent on remand.\u201d <em>United States v. Shafer, </em>557 F.3d 440, 446 (6th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Having lost on this issue, the Government, in its petition for rehearing, asserts for the first time that our approach to the intent clause is flawed when read in light of the legislative history surrounding the Act, and that the intent clause of \u00a7 2246(3) refers to the defendant\u2019s intent, regardless of whether the victim or the defendant is the person doing the touching of the genitalia.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Shafer counters that our initial interpretation of the intent clause, requiring that the person who is doing the touching, in this case B.H., must have the specific intent to \u201cabuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person,\u201d is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">We typically do not consider arguments raised for the first time in a petition for rehearing. <em>Costo v. United States, </em>922 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>F.2d 302, 302-03 (6th Cir.1990) (\u201cGenerally, an argument not raised in an appellate brief or at oral argument may not be raised for the first time in a petition for rehearing.\u201d); <em>Gen. Accident Fire &amp; Life Assurance Corp. v. Smith &amp; Oby Co., </em>274 F.2d 819, 819 (6th Cir.1960) (noting that, on rehearing, a panel may disregard a theory of counsel that \u201cwas not discussed in the original brief\u2019); <em>see also Easley v. Reuss, </em>532 F.3d 592, 593-94 (7th Cir.2008) (\u201cPanel rehearing is not a vehicle for presenting new arguments, and, absent extraordinary circumstances, we shall not entertain arguments raised for the first time in a petition for rehearing.\u201d). This rule reflects the dictate of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 40(a)(2), which requires that a party\u2019s petition for rehearing \u201cstate with particularity each point of law or fact that the petitioner believes the court has overlooked or misapprehended and ... argue in support of the petition.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 40(a)(2). As the Seventh Circuit explained, \u201c[i]t goes without saying that the panel cannot have \u2018overlooked or misapprehended\u2019 an issue that was not presented to it.\u201d <em>Easley, </em>532 F.3d at 593. Thus, Rule 40(a)(2) prevents us from considering arguments raised for the first time in a petition for rehearing under most circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"> This rule is not, however, absolute. As the <em>Easley </em>panel noted, a panel may choose to entertain a new argument on rehearing if \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d are present. <em>Id. </em>at 594; <em>accord United States v. Patzer, </em>284 F.3d 1043, 1045 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cA ease must involve extraordinary circumstances [to] justify our considering on petition for rehearing[ ] issues which were not previously presented.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (first alteration in original)). We find that this case presents such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Escobar Ruiz v. INS, </em>813 F.2d 283 (9th Cir.1987), is instructive. In <em>Escobar Ruiz, </em>the panel initially held that \u201cthe former Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504 (1982) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 (1982), appliefd] to immigration proceedings before the immigration judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284. For the first time in its petition for rehearing, \u201cthe government claim[ed] that deportation proceedings are not adversary adjudications within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504 of the EAJA,\u201d and referred the panel to a subsection of \u00a7 504 that supported such an argument. <em>Id. </em>at 285. The panel noted that it \u201cordinarily [would] not consider for the first time on rehearing issues not presented by the parties in their briefs on appeal,\u201d but that this case met the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d exception to that rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">Our initial decision that Escobar Ruiz may be entitled to attorney\u2019s fees is the first by any court to consider the question whether the EAJA applies to immigration proceedings, and it is likely that numerous claims will be made in reliance on the opinion we issued. The new legal issue raised by the government goes to the heart of our decision. If the government\u2019s argument regarding the term \u201cadversary adjudication\u201d in section 504 is correct, then the EAJA does not apply to immigration proceedings and all attorney\u2019s fees claims arising out of such proceedings should be dismissed. Under these circumstances, permitting an improper interpretation of the EAJA to stand as the controlling precedent in our circuit would constitute a disservice to all parties concerned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 285-86. The panel further noted that it was \u201cconvinced that the government\u2019s failure to present the issue at the proper time was inadvertent or negligent rather than willful,\u201d and that, \u201c[a]ll in all, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>... [it] ha[d] before [it] one of those special situations [in which] a belatedly raised issue may be considered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286 (internal quotation marks omitted) (sixth alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The circumstances of Escobar\u25a0 <em>Ruiz </em>are identical to the circumstances of the instant case. Specifically, as noted above, we are the first panel to interpret \u00a7 2246(3) in regard to self-masturbation. Thus, our decision in this case will likely act as a guide to other panels across the country that are presented with this issue in the future. Moreover, our decision is binding precedent in this circuit. <em>See Bonner v. Perry, </em>564 F.3d 424, 430 (6th Cir. 2009) (holding that \u201c[a] panel of this Court cannot overrule the [published] decision of another panel\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (first alteration in original)). As in <em>Escobar Ruiz, </em>the Government\u2019s new argument goes to the heart of our initial holding and, if we were incorrect- in that holding, allowing that holding to stand \u201cwould constitute a disservice to all parties concerned.\u201d <em>Escobar Ruiz, </em>813 F.2d at 286. Additionally, we do not believe that the Government\u2019s failure to raise this argument previously was at all willful; rather, we believe that the Government\u2019s error was likely due to oversight <em>or </em>negligence. Therefore, we conclude that this case presents \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d sufficient to allow us to consider the Government\u2019s new argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">2. The Intent Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">As demonstrated by our initial opinion, when reading the language of \u00a7 2246(3) in isolation, one can make a logical argument that the intent clause refers to the intent of the individual doing the touching.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, the Government\u2019s new contention as to the proper interpretation of the intent clause \u2014 that the clause refers only to the intent of the defendant, regardless of whether the victim or the defendant does the actual touching \u2014 finds substantial support in the legislative history of \u00a7 2246(3). According to the Report of the House Committee on the Judiciary, the purpose of the Act was \u201cto modernize and reform Federal rape statutes.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 99-594, at 6 (1986), <em>as reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6186, 6186 (\u201cHouse Report\u201d). The House Report noted that, to accomplish this purpose, the Act \u201cdefin[es] the offenses so that the focus of a trial is upon the conduct of the defendant, <em>instead of </em>upon the conduct <em>or state of mind of the victim. </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10 (emphases added). Moreover, the House Report stresses that \u201ceach offense set forth in [the Act] describes ... the state of mind that the <em>defendant </em>must have had.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13 (emphasis added). Thus, the legislative purpose was to make the victim\u2019s intent irrelevant to any prosecution for sex crimes under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">In a prototypal sex-crime case, the natural reading of the intent clause would not conflict with this underlying purpose because typically it is the defendant who is engaged in the prohibited touching, rather than the victim. This is likely the scenario that Congress had in mind when it drafted \u00a7 2246(3). However, as this case illustrates, prohibited sexual contact under \u00a7 2246(3) includes instances where the defendant does not actually touch the victim, but rather causes the victim to touch himself or herself in a sexual manner. In such cases, which appear to be rare,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the natu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>ral reading of the intent clause runs contrary to the purpose of the statute because interpreting the intent clause to require inquiry into the intent of the toucher would involve a court delving into the \u201cstate of mind of the victim.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 99-594, at 10. This would conflict with Congress\u2019s clear expression of purpose in the House Report that the defendant\u2019s intent, not the victim\u2019s intent, is the critical factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Under these circumstances, where the text of a statute conflicts with the statute\u2019s clear purpose, the natural reading of the statute is properly informed by the underlying purpose and the overall framework of the Act. <em>Bob Jones University v. United States, </em>461 U.S. 574, 586, 103 S.Ct. 2017, 76 L.Ed.2d 157 (1983); <em>see also Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., </em>458 U.S. 564, 571, 102 S.Ct. 3245, 73 L.Ed.2d 973 (1982) (noting that, \u201cin rare cases [where] the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters, [the drafters\u2019] intentions must be controlling\u201d); <em>United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., </em>489 U.S. 235, 244, 109 S.Ct. 1026, 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989) (same). In light of the statements regarding' intent contained in the House Report, we must conclude that the legislative history of \u00a7 2246(3) and the Act as a whole make clear that the intent of the victim is not a valid inquiry for the court. Instead, the intent of the criminal defendant is determinative in deciding whether \u201csexual contact\u201d as defined in \u00a7 2246(3) has occurred. Thus, to comply with Congress\u2019s purpose in a case such as this one, where the conduct in question involves the defendant causing self-masturbation by the victim, we hold that the court should look to the intent of the defendant involved, not the intent of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">In this case, Shafer pleaded guilty to enticing a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purposes of producing visual depictions of such conduct. The sexually explicit conduct in question is the self-masturbation of B.H. Applying the proper interpretation of the intent clause, to uphold the district court\u2019s imposition of the \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) enhancement, we must conclude that Shafer caused B.H. to self-masturbate with the intent of Shafer being to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of some person \u2014 either himself or B.H. or someone else. The district judge made no express findings regarding Shafer\u2019s intent. Under the facts of this case, however, it is reasonable to infer that Shafer\u2019s intent was to arouse or gratify either his own sexual desires or those of B.H. Shafer admitted that there was evidence that he had had \u201cdirect physical contact with BH of a sexual nature.\u201d J.A. at 120 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 24). More important, Shafer is an adult who understands the implications of the sexual act he caused B.H. to perform\u2014 that self-masturbation is an act meant to invoke a sexual response in the performer or a viewer. Given these facts, it is proper to infer that Shafer had the intent necessary to categorize B.H.\u2019s self-masturbation as \u201csexual contact,\u201d thereby supporting the \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) enhancement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We, therefore, affirm Shafer\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Because, under the circumstances of this case, B.H.\u2019s self-masturbation constitutes \u201csexual contact,\u201d we conclude that the district court did not err in imposing a \u00a7 2G2.1 (b)(2)(A) enhancement in calculating Shafer\u2019s sentence upon his conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a) by causing a child to engage in sexually explicit conduct, including self-masturbation, for the purposes of producing visual depictions of such conduct. Therefore, we AFFIRM Shafer\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b296-6\">. B.H.'s mother, a friend of Shafer, had asked Shafer and Amundson to \u201cact as a 'Big Brother' \u201d to B.H. J.A. at 198 (Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\u2019\u2019) at 13 \u00b6 62). There is no evidence that B.H. was a ward of Shafer or Amundson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b296-7\">. Contrary to Shafer\u2019s assertion, J.G. claimed that Shafer and Amundson \" 'licked [J.G.\u2019s] penis and made [J.G.] lick theirs; and made [J.G.] put [J.G.\u2019s] privates in their butts.' \u201d J.A. at 198 (PSR at 13 \u00b6 61). J.G. further alleged that Shafer and Amundson \" 'put their privates in [J.G.\u2019s] butt, and even though it hurt .... (pause) they held [J.G.] down, and that\u2019s when they hurt [J.G.\u2019s] arm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(ellipsis and (pause) alterations in PSR). No charges were filed against Shafer relating to this accusation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\">. Section 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) also requires that the offense \"involved\u201d a \"sexual act\u201d or \"sexual contact.\u201d In the instant case, it is obvious that the offense \"involved\u201d the act of self-masturbation, and Shafer does not argue otherwise. Thus, we need not and do not decide the parameters of the term \"involved\u201d as used in \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\">. Shafer makes much of the case of <em>United States v. Starr, 486 </em>F.Supp.2d 940 (N.D.Iowa 2007). However, <em>Starr </em>considered only whether the definition of \u201csexual act\u201d covers self-masturbation, finding that self-masturbation was not a \"sexual act\u201d because Congress's use of the phrase \"of another\u201d in the definition of \u201csexual act\u201d limited the conduct that could be considered a \"sexual act\u201d to conduct that involved \"some physical contact between the defendant and another person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 947. As Shafer admits, <em>Starr </em>did not address the definition of \"sexual contact.\u201d Shafer Br. at 14. Shafer does not explain why <em>Starr </em>is relevant, and we could not find any language in that case that would be helpful in resolving the instant appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b300-7\">. This is the same conclusion that we reached in our first opinion. Although the vast majority of Shafer\u2019s original briefing before us contended that self-masturbation was not encompassed by the term \"sexual contact,\u201d Shafer did not dispute our earlier determination in his response to the Government\u2019s petition for rehearing, nor did Shafer file his own petition for rehearing. Thus, for purposes of the instant opinion, this conclusion now does not appear to be disputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b300-8\">. Moreover, because the term \"intentional touching\u201d is not at issue in the instant case, the Government's reliance on <em>United States v. Sagg, </em>125 F.3d 1294 (9th Cir.1997), in its petition for rehearing is misplaced. In <em>Sagg, </em>the defendant entered the bedroom of his sleeping ten-year-old stepdaughter, wrapped her hand around his penis, and ejaculated, all while the child remained asleep. <em>Id. </em>at 1295. The defendant was charged with Abusive Sexual Contact under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)(1), which criminalizes, among other things, causing an individual to engage in \"sexual contact\u201d as defined by \u00a7 2246(3) under certain circumstances. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. The defendant argued that no \"sexual contact\u201d occurred because his stepdaughter was unconscious when her hand touched his penis and thus the touching could not be intentional. <em>Sagg, </em>125 F.3d at 1295. The Government countered \"that the \u2018intentional\u2019 touching required by the statute referred to the defendant's mental state,\u201d not the victim\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>The Ninth Circuit, focusing solely on the issue of whether the touching was intentional, agreed with the Government, and held that \"[t]he defendant intentionally caused his sleeping stepdaughter to touch his genitalia, and he did so with the intent to gratify his sexual desire.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1296. <em>Sagg </em>did not address the further intent element of \u00a7 2246(3) discussed below, and thus <em>Sagg </em>does not aid in our resolution of that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b301-5\">. For two reasons we find ironic the Government\u2019s complaint in its petition for rehearing that, \"[wjithout the benefit of briefing from the parties, the panel, <em>sua sponte, </em>raised the issue of intent and found that the \u2018plain language\u2019 of \u00a7 2246(3) requires that\u201d the toucher possess the requisite intent. Gov\u2019t Pet. for Reh\u2019g at 8-9. First, it was the Government that forcefully argued in its original brief that the plain reading of \u00a7 2246(3) encompassed self-masturbation and that \u00a7 2246(3) \"said what it meant and meant what it said.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. at 17. The Government did not abandon its plain-meaning argument until it realized that the natural consequence of that position would be unfavorable to the Government in this case. The Government\u2019s attempt to chastise the panel now for agreeing with the Government\u2019s earlier position is disingenuous.</p>\n<p id=\"AtH\">Second, and more important, it is the Government\u2019s burden to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that all of the elements of \u00a7 2G2.1 (b)(2)(A), including both of the intent elements of \u00a7 2246(3), are present in order to support the imposition of the enhancement at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Feinman, </em>930 F.2d 495, 500 (6th Cir. 1991) (\u201cIn cases where the applicability of an enhancement provision is contested, the government bears the burden of establishing the enhancement factors by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Wheaton, </em>517 F.3d 350, 367 (6th Cir.2008) (stating that it is the Government\u2019s burden to prove the elements of an enhancement). Thus, the Government dropped the ball in this case by failing in its initial brief to articulate an interpretation of the intent clause that accounted for the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b303-8\">. As used in this opinion, the intent clause refers to the following language: \"touching ... of the genitalia ... of any person <em>with an intent to </em>abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.\" \u00a7 2246(3) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b303-16\">. As we explained above, the issue of whether \u201csexual contact\u201d includes self-masturbation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>an issue of first impression in any circuit. The dearth of cases on this issue strongly suggests that causing self-masturbation by a victim is not a common occurrence in the realm of federal sex crimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\">. As we explained above, self-masturbation clearly falls within the language of \u00a7 2246(3) and is a type of sexual abuse under certain circumstances, such as those presented by the instant case. However, it is important to stress that \u00a7 2246(3) does not itself criminalize any activity; \u00a7 2246(3) merely provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the definition of \"sexual contact.\" Not all occurrences of \"sexual contact\u201d are criminal. Other sections of Title 18 describe the precise circumstances under which \"sexual contact\" is a criminal act under Federal law. <em>See, e.g., </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. Here we hold only that in the circumstances of this case, where defendant Shafer caused a minor to self-masturbate to fulfill the defendant\u2019s impermissible intent, the \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) enhancement applies because \"the offense involved ... sexual contact.\u2019.\u2019 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b305-6\">TARNOW, District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AZV\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">I agree with Judge Moore\u2019s opinion, and I write in concurrence to emphasize the importance of legislative history.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
