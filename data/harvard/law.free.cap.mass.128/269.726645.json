The attestation clause was as follows: \u201cIn witness whereof we, the said Sarah Wetherbee, and Nehemiah A. Weth erbee, husband of said Sarah Wetherbee, in token of relinquishment of his right in the above-named premises, have hereunto set our hands and seals this fourteenth day of June, in the yeai of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight.\u201d The deed was signed and sealed by the grantor and her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-13\">The deed of the land to Sarah Wetherbee was dated March 2, 1858, when she was a married woman, and did not declare that the conveyance was to her sole and separate use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The judge ruled that the deed to the demandant passed no title to her, for the reason that the husband of the grantor did not join in the conveyance; and found for the tenant.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A33v\">If the wife had acquired her title to the land before the St. of 1857, <em>c. </em>249, by deed in common form, and not expressed to be to her sole and separate use, it might be doubted whether her husband could have been deemed to have so joined in her mortgage to the plaintiff as to make it valid. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>59, \u00a7 2. <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>1 Met. 542. <em>Jewett </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>10 Allen, 68. <em>Wales </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>13 Allen, 213. <em>Agricultural Bank </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>4 How. 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">But by the St. of 1857, <em>c. </em>249, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, any real or personal property since \u201c coming to a married woman, by descent, devise or bequest, or the gift of any person except her husband,\u201d remained her sole and separate property; and might be sold and conveyed by her as if she were unmarried; and the husband was not required to join in, but it was sufficient that he should \u201c assent in writing \u201d to, a conveyance of her real estate. These provisions were reenacted in the General Statutes, with the addition of the words \u201cor grant\u201d after the word \u201cgift.\u201d Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>108, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3, 10. Following the definition of Blackstone, \u201c Gifts or grants of personal property are thus to be distinguished from each other, that gifts are always gratuitous, grants are upon some consideration or equivalent,\u201d it has been intimated, though not decided, that, as applied to personal property, the terms of the General Statutes are more comprehensive than those of the statute of 1857. 2 Bl. Com. 440. <em>Spaulding </em>v. <em>Bay, </em>10 Allen, 96, 98. But as applied to real estate, the words \u201cgive,\u201d \u201cgift,\u201d \u2014 <em>do, donum, </em>\u2014 have never been limited to gratuitous conveyances; and it has accordingly been adjudged that, as regards real estate, the word \u201c give \u201d in the statute of 1857 is equivalent to the words \u201cgive or grant\u201d in the General Statutes, and includes a conveyance to the wife for a pecuniary consideration. Go. Lit. 384 <em>a. </em>2 Inst. 276. 2 Bl. Com. 300. <em>Dow </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>4 Gray, 468. <em>Libby </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>117 Mass. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>In the case at bar, the wife, having acquired her title by deed since the statute of 1857, might convey it without her husband joining as a grantor; and the insertion of his name in the last clause of the mortgage, with his signature and seal, manifest the \u201cassent in writing,\u201d which was all that was requisite to make it valid. <em>Hills </em>v. <em>Bearse, </em>9 Allen, 403. <em>Child </em>v.
