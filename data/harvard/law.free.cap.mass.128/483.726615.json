The declaration was as follows: \u201c And the plaintiff says the defendant owes her $25, for the use and occupation of a certain tenement hired of the plaintiff by the defendant.\u201d Annexed to the declaration was a bill of particulars, in which the defendant was charged with \u201c rent of house 81 Chapman Street, one month in advance, from May 1,1879, to June 1, 1879, $50,\u201d and credited with \u201c Cash, $25.\u201d Writ dated May 29, 1879. Answer, a general denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-8\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Putnam, </em>J., the plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that the defendant hired the house in question of the plaintiff, in the early part of 1878, at the rate of $600 per annum, payable $50 per month in advance, on the first day of each month; that the defendant occupied through May 1879, and paid the rent monthly, either on the first day or in the early part of each month, except in May 1879; and that, about May 5, she paid the plaintiff $25 on account of that month\u2019s rent, and had paid none since. The defendant\u2019s evidence tended to contradict the plaintiff\u2019s only in respect to the terms of payment; and to show that the rent was not payable in advance, on the first day of each month, but that the defendant might pay it at any time during the month. The plaintiff, on cross-examination, admitted that she did not demand the rent on the first day of each month, nor on May 1, 1879; but she testified that it might have been on May 2 that she called; that the defendant told her to come again in a few days; and that she went on May 5, and received the $25 credited in the account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>This was all' the evidence in the case; and the defendant asked the judge to rule as follows: \u201c 1. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence is insufficient to support a verdict for the plaintiff. 2. All of the evidence in the case is insufficient to support a verdict for the plaintiff. 3. The plaintiff\u2019s failure to demand the rent upon the first day of the month is a waiver of her right to demand it in advance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-4\">The judge declined so to rule; and instructed the jury that it was a question of fact for them, whether the agreement was made as the plaintiff alleged; that, if it was, the plaintiff was entitled to recover; that if it was not so made, or if there was reasonable doubt about it, she was not entitled to a verdict ; and that, if the defendant agreed to pay the rent in advance, the fact that the plaintiff did not call for it on May 1 would not preclude her from recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-5\">.The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $25; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-6\"><em>J. W. </em>Pickering, for the defendant. 1. An action for use and occupation will not lie to recover rent due in advance, before the expiration of the month for which it is sought to be recovered.

No demand of the rent on the day it fell due was necessary to entitle the plaintiff to maintain an action therefor. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
