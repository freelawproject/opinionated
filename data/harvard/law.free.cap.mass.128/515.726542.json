The judge so <em>ruled; </em>and the plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b536-5\"><em>J. C. Park, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A79\">The defendant\u2019s agreement is contained in a sealed instrument, and is a covenant. The plaintiff stands in Williams\u2019s place and stead, with all his rights, as well as subject to all his obligations. There is a privity between the plaintiff and the defendant. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Aldrich, </em>19 Pick. 449. <em>Torrey </em>v. <em>Wallis, </em>3 Cush. 442, and cases cited.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b536-6\"><em>G.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZh\">The agreement to repair buildings upon land adjoining the defendant\u2019s, being contained in a deed poll to her, and not being under her seal, is not a covenant, and this action is in the nature of assumpsit on the promise implied from the acceptance of the deed.\" <em>Maine </em>v. <em>Cumston, </em>98 Mass. 317, 320, and cases cited. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to maintain the action against an assign of the promisor. <em>Parish </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>3 Gray, 516. <em>Bronson </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>108 Mass. 175, 186. And it is quite clear that it cannot be maintained in the name of an assign of the promisee. <em>Standen </em>v. <em>Chrismas, </em>10 Q. B. 135. <em>Bickford </em>v. <em>Parson, </em>5 C.
