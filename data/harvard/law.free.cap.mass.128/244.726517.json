At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Allen, </em>J., the plaintiff offered evidence tending to prove that he was struck upon the head by the defendant with the butt of a whip; and called Luther B. Morse, a physician, who testified that he attended the plaintiff immediately after the injury. The witness was then asked by the plaintiff, against the defendant\u2019s objection, whether there were any complaints of suffering made by the plaintiff at the time. The judge allowed the witness to testify to such complaints made as statements of symptoms to him as attending physician. The witness also testified that he attended upon the plaintiff for several weeks after the injury, making several visits during that time. He was then asked by the plaintiff, against the defendant\u2019s objection, whether there were indications or symptoms of suffering during those visits. The judge allowed the question to be put, and the witness testified to such indications.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-8\">The plaintiff testified in his own behalf; and, to affect his credibility as a witness, the defendant offered in evidence a record, which showed that the plaintiff had been indicted for an assault, to which he pleaded guilty, and that, on acknowledgment of satisfaction and payment of costs, he was discharged on probation. The plaintiff objected to its admission; and the judge excluded it. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-9\"><em>G. W. Searle &amp; J. L.

They are not to be considered as mere hearsay, if made with a view to be acted on in a matter of grave personal concernment, in relation to which the party has a strong and direct interest to adhere to the truth. <em>Barber </em>v. Merriam,, 11 Allen, 322. All other visible symptoms and indications manifesting pain and suffering stand upon the same ground. The weight and value of such evidence are for the jury to determine in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Under the statute provision that the conviction of a witness of any crime may be shown to affect his credibility, (Gen. Sts. <em>g. </em>131, \u00a7 13; St. 1870, <em>e. </em>393, \u00a7 3,) it has been decided that the term \u201c conviction \u201d is used in a sense including the judgment of the court, and that a plea of guilty, without such final judgment, is not sufficient. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gorham, 99 Mass. 420. The record offered to impeach the credit of the witness does not show any such judgment, but only that he was discharged on probation. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lockwood, </em>109 Mass. 323, 330; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dowdicans Bail, </em>115 Mass. 133; <em>Partridge </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>120 Mass. 403. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
