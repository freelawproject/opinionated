Fronting on this way they erected four houses and one house whose front abutted partly on the way. They also purchased a parcel of land adjoining their other land in part, and on which was a private way called D. Court, running from the highway towards the rear of the land. Subsequently they divided both parcels among themselves by a deed of partition, excluding that part over which the way ran. In this deed, one of the boundary lines was described as running \u201c to land left and now used for a passageway in C. Court; \u201d other lines were described as running by \u201cthe way\u201d or by \u201cthe way or court;\u201d monuments were described as being at a certain distance from the houses in \u201csaid court;\" the houses were described as being \"in C. Court;\u201d and the width of the way in different places was stated. The deed also provided that all of the land first bought, not therein conveyed, should \u201che left and alwaj's lie open as a way for the common use and benefit of both of said parties and their said respective estates; \u201d and that the \u201c court \u201d should be continued over the land last bought to D. Court, and that each party should have a right of way over D. Court \u201c for the common use and benefit of themselves and of their respective estates;\u201d that each party might make sidewalks \u201cin the said court\u201d in front of the lots assigned to him, and maintain steps in front of the houses, \u201c so as the said sidewalk and steps shall never be extended or widened to obstruct the convenient passing of carriages in said court.\u201d On one of the lots conveyed by this deed was a house the front of which abutted on C. Court for only a few feet, the rest of the front abutting on the grantee\u2019s land set off to him in the same deed. He subsequently conveyed this house by a deed which did not contain the usual clause, \u201cwith all privileges and appurtenances,\u201d and which described the house as being \u201cNo. 4 in C. Court,\" and conveyed it by metes and bounds, the front line being \u201c on a line with the front of said house,\u201d together with the land in front of the house, under the stone steps \u201c with a right to pass and repass on foot and with horses and carriages to said house and land through said C.

Andrews, as tenants in common. They laid out over the land a private way, which ran from Newbury Street in a southeasterly direction about a hundred and fifty feet, and then turned at a right angle and ran in a southwesterly direction, parallel to Washington Street; and\u00f3n this way erected a block of four houses and another house standing by itself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-8\">On May 1, 1806, David Soley and John Larkin, who derived their title from John Soley, respectively conveyed to Ebenezer T.

One of the boundary lines was described as running \u201c by the ivay or court aforesaid,\u201d and two of the other lines as running \u201c by said way.\u201d This deed also conveyed to Andrews the land conveyed to Andrews by Larkin and Soley, and recited that this land had been previously conveyed to Andrews alone, but in trust for Thomas as to one moiety thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-5\">The deed of partition also contained these clauses: \u201c And it is hereby further covenanted, granted and agreed by and between the said parties to these presents, that all that part of the above-mentioned land conveyed to them by said Jonathan Mason, and which is not herein above assigned, set off and released to either of said parties, shall be left and always lie open for the passageway or court aforesaid, for the common use and benefit of both of said parties and their said respective estates. And also that so much of the land above mentioned formerly belonging to John Soley, deceased, as lies opposite to the southwest end of said way or court shall be in like manner left and always lie open as a way for the common use and benefit of both of said parties and their said respective estates, so that said court shall be continued in a straight line across the land formerly belonging to said Soley, to Demming\u2019s Court above mentioned, and also that each of said parties shall retain and have an equal right of way in and over said Demming\u2019s Court for the common use and benefit of themselves and of their said respective estates. And it is further agreed by and between said parties, that each party may make sidewalks in the said court, in front of the several parcels of land above assigned to them, respectively, in said court, and may also make and maintain convenient and necessary steps in front of their respective houses, and of any houses that may be hereafter built on said court, so as the said sidewalks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>and steps shall never be extended or widened to obstruct the convenient passing of carriages in said court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-4\">A plan used at the hearing showed that the front of the most northerly of the two houses set off to Andrews abutted upon Central Court, as laid out in the deed of partition, seven feet and two inches, and the remainder of the front abutted upon lai.d set off to Andrews by the same deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-5\">On March 28, 1808, Thomas conveyed to Andrews the first parcel of land set off to Thomas in the partition deed, fronting on Newbury Street and running back to Central Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-6\">On April 24, 1824, Ebenezer T.

By the deed of partition between Thomas and Andrews, executed in 1806, merely a passageway was laid out. The land was \u201c always to lie open for the passageway or court aforesaid; \u201d a portion of the Soley land was also to lie open \u201cas a way;\u201d each party was to have an equal \u201cright of way\u201d over Demming\u2019s Court; and sidewalks and steps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>in Central Court were never to be extended so as to obstruct the convenient passing o\u00ed carriages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-4\">2.

In the deed from Andrews to Homes, under which the plaintiffs claim, the front boundary is on a line with the house, the land under the steps is conveyed, \u201c with a right to pass and repass, on foot and with horses and carriages, to said house and land, through said Central Court, at all times;\u201d and this is all. The grantor is so careful to guard and qualify the rights given to the grantee, that he omits the words \u201c privileges and appurtenances.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-5\">As the plaintiffs have not a right to light and air, but merely a right of way, and as this right of way has not been interfered with, there should be judgment for the defendants. <em>Atkins </em>v. Bordman, 2 Met. 457.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b362-6\">Lord, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxR\">In this case there is no material fact in dispute between the parties. The controversy is solely as to their respective rights in law, upon undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">In 1803 the whole of the land, on which are the passageway in question and the estates of the plaintiffs and defendants, was owned in equal parts by Isaiah Thomas and Ebenezer T. Andrews, as tenants in common in fee simple. Between 1803 and 1806 they had laid out this passageway, and had so wrought or constructed it as to indicate to a great extent its nature and purposes. A single building and a block of buildings had been erected fronting upon it, and sidewalks of brick, if not then actually made, were evidently in contemplation, as appears not only from the width of the court, but from the first deed of conveyance by Andrews of the estate now owned by the plaintiffs, in which the sidewalks are particularly mentioned, and provision made for their being kept in repair; and between such actual or contemplated sidewalks was a passageway left suitable for carriages and vehicles drawn by horses or other animals. After this had been done, Thomas and* Andrews, in 1806, by their deed of partition, conveyed to each other their respective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>moieties in certain portions of the undivided property, so that each came to own his respective share in severalty; and then, for the first time, this passageway was accurately defined and described, and that description and the use to which it was then devoted are quite decisive of the character of the way.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">On referring to the partition deed of 1806, it will be observed that, in bounding the first parcel which is to be held in severalty, the phrase is used \u201cthence running to land left and now used for passageway in Central Court; \u201d and the next reference is in these words: \u201c from the block of four houses built by said Thomas and Andrews in Central Court; \u201d and, again, \u201c distant from the single house built by them in said court.\u201d And so through the whole partition deed, although the way is sometimes referred to simply as a way, yet when it is designated in any mode, it is called Central Court; and the deed itself provides that that way, as first located, \u201c shall be left and always lie open for the passageway or court aforesaid for the common use and benefit of both the said parties and their said respective estates,\u201d and there was the further covenant between them as to the land as purchased in the name of Andrews, but in the interest of both, that so much of such land \u201c as lies opposite to the southwest end of said way or court shall be in like manner left and always lie open as a way for the common use and benefit of both of said parties and their said respective estates, so that said court shall be continued in a straight line across the land formerly belonging to said Soley, to Demming\u2019s Court above mentioned, and also that each of said parties shall retain and have an equal right of way in and over said Demming\u2019s Court for the common use and benefit of themselves and of their respective estates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">It is thus manifest from this partition deed that the laying out of Central Court was for the purpose of bringing into use and into the market certain back or rear lands in such manner as that the same could properly and advantageously be used as dwellings or residences. A portion of the land thus divided by this deed of partition was in 1824 sold by Andrews to one Homes, who subsequently conveyed it to Salisbury, the father of the first-named plaintiff, and their rights in respect to said court were afterwards a subject of dispute before this court, in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>of <em>Salisbury </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>19 Pick. 250; and Chief Justice Shaw, with his usual fertility and exhaustiveness of discussion, has expounded the principles upon which instruments of this kind are to be construed, which not only throw much light upon, but, in our judgment, settle the rights of the parties to this controversy. The result of that exposition is, that not only every clause and phrase in a deed, but every word, is presumed to have been used for some purpose and to accomplish some result, and that result is the intention of the parties; and while no evidence is competent to show that the parties meant something different from what the ordinary import of their language expresses, yet where the language used is of doubtful import, and where the precise purpose and intent of the parties is not expressly defined in words, the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction, \u201c such as the actual condition and situation of the land, buildings, passages, water-courses, and other local objects, in order to give a definite meaning to language used in the deed, and to show the sense, in which particular words were probably used by the parties, especially in matters of description,\u201d are always proper to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Applying these principles, we' have no doubt that the intention of the parties to that deed of partition was to establish what in cities is technically known as a court, and that that court was to be of the higher class of courts, not confined to one single mode of access and egress, but to be so connected with other avenues as that there might be passage through it, and not simply entrance into it with return only in the same mode as entered upon. It is clearly manifested also by said conveyance that the parties to it intended, not only that the buildings erected upon it should be fit for residences, but that the class and character of such residences had been indicated by the fact that they had jointly, while owning in , common, built not only a single dwelling-house, but a brick block of four dwelling-houses; and that their purpose was to bring the remaining land into the same use, by themselves or their grantees, by attaching to their entire lands that court for the common use and benefit of themselves and their respective estates. And the language used by them has a peculiar force and significance in this respect. It says nothing of a right of way, or right to pass and repass either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>over and through it or to or from any particular estate, but its language is especially adapted to the constitution of an open court partaking largely, if not entirely, of the nature of a public street. The language is: \u201c And it is hereby further covenanted, granted and agreed by and between the said parties to these presents, that all that part of the above-mentioned land conveyed to them by said Jonathan Mason, and which is not hereinbefore assigned, set off and released to either of said parties, shall be left and always lie open for the passageway or court aforesaid, for the common use and benefit of both of said parties and their said respective estates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">The use and benefit of such a court became, therefore, attached to every part of their respective estates, and a grant of any part of the estate, even without express words, would carry such use and benefit as appurtenant to the land, and could not be detached from the land itself except by contract. It is therefore clear that this is not simply a right of way in the plaintiffs, and attached to their estate, but their right is to the use and benefit of an open court, and that right extends as well to the. light and air above as to actual travel upon the surface of the earth; and, without the evidence of the tenant that the sun is now wholly excluded from the house in the afternoon, while formerly there were several hours of sunshine, the erection of such a structure, as that erected by the defendants is conceded to be, is of itself an infringement of the plaintiffs\u2019 right, and a nuisance to their estate, which they have a right to have abated.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\n<em>Decree for the plaintiffs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
