Pitman, J. overruled the motion. The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-10\"><em>J. Brown, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AR1\">contended that, the St. of 1869, <em>c. </em>415, making the keeping of intoxicating liquors with intent to sell the same an offence, being repealed by the St. of 1875, <em>c. </em>99, and the latter statute not enumerating this among the offences mentioned, the motion to quash should have been granted.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-11\"><em>G. Marston, </em>Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Ahd\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5k\">The St. of 1875, <em>c. </em>99, \u00a7 1, provides that \u201cno person shall sell, or expose, or keep for sale, spirituous or intoxicating liquors, except as authorized in this act.\u201d The complaint in the case at bar alleges that the defendant, at the time and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>place named, \u201c did keep intoxicating liquors with intent to sell the same in this Commonwealth,\u201d he not being authorized to sell the same. The allegation of the complaint is equivalent to an allegation in the words of the statute, that the defendant did at the time and place named \u201c keep for sale \u201d intoxicating liquors without authority. Each allegation imports that he kept the liquors with the present intent to sell them when called for by purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. O\u2019Keefe, 123 Mass. 252, the complaint was in the same form as in the case at bar, and it was held that the allegation was substantially the same as an averment in the words of the statute, and that the defect in the form of the allegation furnished no ground for arresting judgment. Unless the two allegations are essentially the same, the defect would be equally fatal upon a motion in arrest of judgment as upon a motion to quash the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">We are of opinion that the defendant\u2019s motion to quash was rightly overruled. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
