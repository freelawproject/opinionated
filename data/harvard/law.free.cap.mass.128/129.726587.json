It was agreed that the note was made payable to the cashier for the accommodation of the plaintiff; and that neither the bank nor the cashier had any interest therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-5\">The plaintiff contended that the above offer of proof was not competent.

If the ruling was correct, judgment was to be entered on the verdict; otherwise, the verdict to be set aside and a new trial granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-6\"><em>F.

The evidence which he sought to introduce was for the purpose of showing that this written contract was not the real contract\" between the parties; that the note was merely a memorandum; and that certain certificates of stock described in the note as collateral security should operate as payment of the note at its maturity, if it were not previously paid. This evidence could not be received without doing violence to the ruli <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>that oral evidence cannot be admitted to alter a written contract, or to annex to it a condition or defeasance not appearing in the contract itself. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>12 Met. 138. <em>St. Louis Ins.
