The case was submitted to the Superior Court, and, after judgment for the defendant, to this court, on appeal, on an agreed statement of facts in substance as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-5\">The plaintiff was duly appointed a police officer of the defendant on January 7, 1877, at the commencement of the municipal year, and was detailed for and performed regular patrol duty as night watchman until the appointment of a new police force upon the organization of the city government for 1878. He was paid at the rate of $2.25 per day of ten hours\u2019 service, and twenty-five cents for each hour of extra service until February 12, 1877, and thereafter at the rate of two dollars per day, and twenty cents per hour for extra time, he claiming that he was entitled to receive pay at the former rate. On November 14, 1865, the city council passed a joint resolution that \u201cthe pay of the night watch shall be at the rate of two dollars and twenty-five cents per night, commencing with the 1st day of September, 1865.\u201d In a joint resolution of the city council passed December 1,1875, fixing the compensation of city officers for the year 1876, it was provided that \u201cthe compensation of the day police and night patrolmen shall be at the rate of two dollars and twenty-five cents per day of ten hours, when employed, payable monthly, extra hours and temporary service to be paid for at the rate of twenty-five cents for each hour.\u201d No other action appears to have been had by the city council in regard to the pay of the day or night police. From September 1, 1865, to February 12, 1877, the patrol police were paid at the rate of $2.25 per day and twenty-five cents for each additional hour of service.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-6\">On February 12, 1877, the board of mayor and aldermen adopted the following order: \u201c That the pay of the regular day and night patrol shall be two dollars per day and twenty cents per hour for all extra time that they may be employed.\u201d Of this order the plaintiff had due notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Since the organization of the city government under its charter in 1853, the police force has heen appointed and reconstituted at the commencement of each municipal year, and has consisted of a regular day patrol and a regular night patrol.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-4\">Section 8 of the city charter provides as follows: \u201c The executive power of the said city generally, and the administration of the police, with all the power heretofore vested in the selectmen of Lawrence, shall be vested in and may be exercised by the mayor and' aldermen as fully as if the same were herein specially enumerated. The mayor and aldermen shall have full and exclusive power to appoint a constable and assistants, or a city marshal and assistants with the powers and duties of constables, and all other police officers, and the same to remove at pleasure. . . -.
