Answer, a general denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-7\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Pitman, J., without a jury, the plaintiff offered evidence of sales of liquor to her husband, after notice to the defendant, by Hiram Emerson, the bar-keeper of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-8\">The defendant did not controvert this evidence; but offered evidence tending to show that, after such notice, he did not personally make any sales to the plaintiff\u2019s husband; and that he ordered Emerson not to sell to him, and, if any sales were made by Emerson, it was without the knowledge and consent of the defendant; and asked the judge to rule that, \u201c if the defendant forbade his servant making sales of liquor to the plaintiff\u2019s husband, and the defendant\u2019s servant nevertheless made such sales without the knowledge and consent of the defendant, the defendant is not liable in this action by reason of the acts of his servant.\u201d The judge declined so to rule, and found for the plaintiff.

But if the servant goes outside the scope of his employment, and does a wrongful act, for a purpose of his own, and not in the performance of his master\u2019s business, the master is not responsible for such act. <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Newmarch, </em>12 Allen, 49. <em>Ramsden </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany </em>Railroad, 104 Mass. 117. <em>Hawks </em>v. Charlemont, 107 Mass. 414. <em>Hawes </em>v. Knowles, 114 Mass. 518. <em>Levi </em>v. Brooks, 121 Mass. 501. The fact that the act done is contrary to an express order of the master will not exonerate him. <em>Philadelphia Reading Railroad </em>v. <em>Derby, </em>14 How. 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">We see no reason why the general principle which governs the responsibility of the master for the acts of his servant should not apply in the case at bar. The action is brought under a statute which makes that a tort which was not so before, and provides for the recovery of damages against the tortfeasor. The tort consists in selling intoxicating liquor to one who has the habit of using it to excess, after notice of his habit and a request from his wife not to sell such liquor to him. The defendant engages in the business of selling liquor voluntarily. He chooses to intrust the details of the business to a servant. If he forbids the making of sales to the intemperate person, and his servant negligently, through forgetfulness of the instruction given him, or through a failure to recognize the person, continues to make sales to that person, there is no reason why the defendant should not be responsible for the wrongful act. The sale is his sale, made in the performance of his business, and is an act within the general scope of the servant\u2019s employment. The ruling which the defendant asked was properly refused. It does not state a combination of circumstances which would relieve the master from responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">It is to be borne in mind that this is a civil action, and that the rules which govern it differ from the rules which govern criminal proceedings. <em>Roberge </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>124 Mass. 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">What would he the result if it appeared that the servant, knowing the instruction given by his master, made the sales with the intention of disobeying him, and for his own purposes, and not for the purpose of doing his master\u2019s business, we have not considered, because that question is not before us. And we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>have treated the ruling asked for as intended to present the case of instructions given to the servant in good faith; for it would hardly be contended that instructions not to sell, which both master and servant understood to be a mere form of words, exonerated the master from the consequence of a wrongful sale made by the servant. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
