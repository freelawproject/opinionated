The defendant filed a declaration in set-off for $27.20. The trial justice before whom the action was commenced gave judgment\" for the plaintiff for $22.57 on September 21, 1878, and the defendant on September 23 appealed, and entered into a recognizance, with sureties, reciting his appeal from that judgment \u201cto the next Superior Court to be holden at Lowell within and for the county of Middlesex on the first Monday of September, 1878,\u201d and conditioned that the defendant should \u201c prosecute his appeal at said Superior Court with effect, and pay all intervening damages and costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-7\">In the Superior Court, the action was entered at September term 1878. At December term 1878, the plaintiff filed an answer to the defendant\u2019s declaration in set-off. At March term 1879, the attorneys for both parties signed an agreement to put the action on the trial list for that term; and, at the trial, the plaintiff moved to dismiss the appeal, because the appellant had not recognized to the plaintiff with sufficient surety or sureties, in accordance with the provisions of the St. of 1877,_ <em>c. </em>236. Putnam, J., overruled the motion; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions, which, after judgment for the defendant in the sum of $2.80, were entered in this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-8\"><em>G.

But at December term 1878 of the Superior Court, being the term at which the appeal should by law have been entered, and the appeal having been theretofore entered and being actually before that court, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>filed an answer to the defendant\u2019s declaration in set-off, and thereby waived any right to move to dismiss the appeal for such defects. Whether any action could be maintained on the recognizance, or whether the appeal was duly taken, is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
