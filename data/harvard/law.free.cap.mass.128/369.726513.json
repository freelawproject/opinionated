McAllister, who was seised in fee of the demanded premises, conveyed the same in mortgage to Ezra Holden. On December 27, 1873,, the demandant brought suit against McAllister, and attached all his real estate in this county. On March 3, 1874, the mortgage above mentioned was discharged, and the discharge was duly recorded. On December 10, 1875, McAllister conveyed the demanded premises to the tenant, by warranty deed, which was duly recorded the next day. On June 1, 1876, the demandant recovered judgment in his suit against McAllister for damages and costs, and on June 14 execution was duly issued on said judgment, and placed in the hands of an officer, who, on June 28, 1876, took on the execution \u201c all the right in equity \u201d which McAllister had on December 27, 1873, \u201cof redeeming\u201d the mortgaged estate, and conveyed to the tenant \u201c all the right in equity which the said George H.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7H\">The St. of 1874, <em>c. </em>188, has changed the law so far as to authorize an estate not subject to mortgage to be levied upon by sale instead of by extent, but not so far as to authorize the officer to levy upon, advertise and sell such an estate as an equity of redemption, or to sell less than the entire estate which is at the time of the beginning of the levy bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>by the lien of the attachment. In this case, by the discharge o\u00ed the mortgage, after the attachment and before the levy, the equity of redemption had ceased to exist; the advertisement that the right to be sold on execution was an equity of redemption only, tended to limit to the prejudice of the debtor the sums bid at the sale; and the deed of the officer, being in terms limited to the right in equity, which had ceased to exist and which could not be revived by any act of his, was a nullity, and passed no title to the purchaser. <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>M\u2019Gaw, </em>15 Pick. 82. <em>McGregor </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>10 Cush. 526. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Hayward, </em>12 Cush. 344. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>106 Mass. 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
