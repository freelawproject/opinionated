By consent of parties, the matter was referred to a committee under the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>43, \u00a7 34, whose return to the Superior Court, under \u00a7 40, set forth that the highway was, after due notice, located by the county commissioners on September 27, 1876, and the location duly recorded, but no award of damages was made to any one; that, in December 1876, the highway was accepted by the county commissioners, and an order issued by them to the clerk to draw liis warrant on the treasurer of the county for the payment of certain sums to various persons named, in full for all damages allowed them on account of the location of different highways in different towns. Among these names were those of two persons whose lands were taken for the highway in question, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>name of <em>the </em>petitioner did not appear. The return further stated that in the opinion of the committee the petition was not filed in season, and the petitioner was not entitled to any damages, but that if in the opinion of the court he was entitled to any damages, they assessed the damages in the sum of $120.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-4\">The Superior Court ordered judgment for the <em>respondent; </em>and the petitioner appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-5\"><em>C.

Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>43, \u00a7 22. When a highway is laid out, the commissioners are required in their return thereof to state the damages estimated by them, and the share of each person separately. Gen. Sts. <em>a. </em>43, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 14. But it is provided that they shall not order such damages to be paid until the land has been entered on for the purpose of constructing the way. It has been decided that the fact that no damages are allowed in the return of location is equivalent to a statement that, in the opinion of the commissioners, no damages have been sustained. It is treated as a judgment against the <em>claim; </em>and if a party is aggrieved thereby, he must petition for a jury within the time limited, or be deemed to acquiesce in the judgment. <em>Monagle </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>8 Cush. 360. <em>Hildreth </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>11 Gray, 345, 352. The limit of one year, within which application to revise must be made, has reference to the time of making the final order laying out the road, which is required to be recorded as such. <em>Wood </em>v. Quincy, 11 Cush. 487, 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">In the case at bar, the final order laying out the way was adopted by the commissioners on September 27, 1876, and duly recorded. An application for a jury might have then been made, notwithstanding the provision which forbids the issuing of an order for the payment of damages, and takes away from the landowner the right to demand the same, until the land is entered on. It has been so decided by this court. <em>Harding </em>v. <em>Medway, </em>10 Met. 465. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>5 Gray, 31. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>The petition in this case was not filed until after the expiration of a year from the passing of the final order of location.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The petitioner relies on the order to the clerk, passed in December following, by which the latter was required to draw his warrant on the treasurer of the county for the payment of damages to the persons named in it. He contends that the date of this order fixes the time from which the period of limitation is to be reckoned. But this was not an order, or any part of an order, of location. It does not purport to be even an assessment of damages. It is simply an order for the payment of damages to the persons named, under \u00a7 14; an order which could not be legally passed, unless there had been a previous final order of location, accompanied by an assessment of damages, and an entry on the land for the purpose of construction. The list which accompanies the order contains the names of those who appear to be entitled to damages by the location of several different roads under several different petitions, including some who were damaged by the road here in question. The records show no assessment of damages whatever on account of the laying out of this road; and the order for the payment of damages to any one seems to have been unwarranted and irregular. But whether it were so or not, the result, as to the petitioner and his rights, is not affected thereby. See <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>9 Gray, 88. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
