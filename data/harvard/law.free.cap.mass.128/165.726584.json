Geagan, one of the plaintiffs, testified as follows: \u201c The defendant came and said he had a person whom he wanted to get a store for. I said we could not trust strangers. The defendant then said that all persons he sent he would be responsible for, and pay their bills. I said, if he would do that, he could have the goods.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-9\">Marcus M. Leonard testified that he was employed by the plaintiffs at the time the goods were sold, and delivered the goods to Mrs. Dewire; that the defendant asked him if he had left the goods there, and he said it would be all right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-10\">Stephen Cuttle testified that he was employed by the plaintiffs at the time the goods were sold; that the defendant came to the store and said, \u201c Mrs Dewire is coming; let her have what goods she wants, and I will be responsible for them; I will be accountable for her debt. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-11\">Edward Barrett testified that the defendant, after the suit was commenced, said he considered himself responsible until the 10th or 12th of August, and at that date he told somebody not to give Mrs. Dewire any more goods on his account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>John D.

There was evidence, proper to be considered by the presiding justice who tried the case without a jury, tending to show that the goods for which this suit is brought were sold upon the sole credit of the defendant, and that he was liable as an original promisor, and not as a guarantor. Upon this question, the finding of the justice is conclusive, and we cannot revise it.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
