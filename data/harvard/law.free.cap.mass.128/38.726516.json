The case was submitted to the Superior Court, and, after judgment for the plaintiffs, to this court on appeal, on an agreed statement of facts in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-4\">The agreement declared on was duly made between the plaintiffs and the defendant; and a deed of the land named therein properly executed and acknowledged by the plaintiffs was tendered by them to the defendant within one week from the date of the agreement. John Dove died in 1876,'seised in fee simple of the land described in the agreement, and leaving a will, the sixth clause of which was as follows: \u201c Sixth. I devise to those of my daughters who shall not have married at my decease all the residue of my real estate, to have and to hold the same to them and the survivor of them for their lives and during the life of such survivor, they and the survivor of them continuing unmarried. The marriage of any one of my daughters who take under this item shall terminate her interest and life estate under this devise. After the marriage or death of my surviving daughter taking under this item, the estate herein devised shall descend to those persons who may then be entitled to take the same as my heirs.\u201d The land described in the agreement is part of the residue of the estate under the above clause; and is not needed for the payment of debts and legacies. Two of the plaintiffs were the only daughters of John Dove who had not married at the time of his decease, and they have not since married; and no conveyance or other incumbrance has been made or suffered by any of the plaintiffs since the decease of the testator. The defendant refused to accept the deed on the sole ground that, under the sixth clause of the will, the deed did not convey a good title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-5\">If, upon the foregoing facts, the deed conveyed the title called for by the agreement, judgment was to be entered for the plaintiffs for $50; otherwise, for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-6\"><em>S. </em>Lincoln, Jr., (S. <em>B. </em>Ives, Jr. with him,) for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-7\"><em>L.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayc\">The decision of this case depends upon the true construction of that clause of the will of John Dove by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>which, after devising the residue of his real estate to his daughters and the survivor of them until death or marriage, he provides as follows: \u201cAfter the marriage or death of my surviving daughter taking under this item, the estate herein devised shall descend to those persons who may then be entitled to take the same as my heirs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The word \u201c then \u201d is here inserted, not as in <em>Long </em>v. <em>Black-all, </em>3 Ves. 486, in <em>Sears </em>v. Russell, 8 Gray, 86, and in <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>Luddington, </em>104 Mass. 193, by way of description of the persons who are to take, but by way of defining the time when they shall come into the enjoyment of that which is devised to them. The word \u201c surviving \u201d is not superadded, as in <em>Hulburt </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>16 Mass. 241, and in <em>Olney </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>21 Pick. 311; nor is the devise to those who would have been the testator\u2019s heirs at law if he had died at that time. But the testator declares it to be his will that the estate \u201cshall descend to those persons who may then be entitled to take the same as my heirs.\u201d A devise to \u201cheirs,\u201d or \u201cheirs at law,\u201d is always construed as referring to those who are such at the time of the testator\u2019s death, unless a different intent is plainly manifested by the will. <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Bradstreet, </em>3 Allen, 587. <em>Minot </em>v. <em>Tappan, </em>122 Mass. 535. The application of this rule to the present case is fortified by the use of the word \u201c descend,\u201d which ordinarily denotes the vesting of the estate by operation of law in the heirs immediately upon the death of the ancestor. Upon a view of the whole clause, we are of opinion that it manifests the intention of the testator to have been, that, after the particular estates which he had specifically given by his will should have failed, the law should take its course, and his estate go to his heirs, as if he had made no further disposition. <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Downes, </em>9 H. L. Cas. 1. <em>Mortimer </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>7 Ch. D. <em>322; S. C. nom. Mortimore </em>v, <em>Mortimore, </em>4 App. Cas. 448. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
