The demandant also put in evidence a mortgage deed of the demanded premises from a third person to itself, in which it was described as a corporation, and a subsequent deed executed by the tenant, which recited that the demandant was the holder of that mortgage, and in which he agreed to pay the mortgage debt to <em>\u201c </em>said corporation.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that there was evidence of the corporate existence of the demandant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b478-13\">Basements and restrictions cannot be recovered or enforced hi a writ of entry, and need not be set forth therein.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b478-14\">By the Gen.

The demandant, in its declaration, alleged that, \u201c being seised of said premises in fee within twenty years now last past, it ought to be in quiet possession thereof, but the said tenant hath since unlawfully entered and holds the demandant out.\u201d Plea, <em>nul disseisin. </em>No replication or joinder of issue was filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-6\">The Superior Court, at April term 1879, came in on April 1, and on May 9, when this case was called for trial, had actually been in session twenty-eight days, and the same persons had been serving as jurors during all this time. The tenant interposed the following challenge to the array: \u201cAnd now comes the said Louis W. Burnham, in his proper person, when the jury is about to be empanelled to try the issue in the above-entitled cause, and says that the said jury is an illegal jury, and each juror drawn is not a legal juryman, and not competent to serve otherwise, because more than thirty days have elapsed since said jury was first empanelled to try causes at this present term, and more than thirty consecutive days have elapsed since each and every juryman upon said panel entered upon the first day of his service at this term, and that each and every of said jurors has served more than thirty days this term, if the time of service is legally computed.\u201d No replication to this challenge was filed, nor was any suggestion made that issue had not been joined on the challenge, but it was immediately overruled by <em>Bacon, J., </em>upon its being read.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-7\">At the trial, one Brown testified that he was clerk of the plaintiff corporation, and that two books which he produced were the records of the corporation kept by him. These books were not otherwise offered in evidence; but no objection was made to them as not being in evidence until the motion for a nonsuit, as hereinafter mentioned; and they remained on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>witness stand during the trial, and were taken into the jury-room without the knowledge of the tenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-4\">The demandant put in evidence the following deeds: 1st. A mortgage deed dated July 8,1871, with condition for the payment of $10,000 in five years, with interest, from Joseph Swallow to \u201cthe Provident Institution for Savings in the town of Boston, a corporation established by authority of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\u201d of the parcel of land described in the writ, \u201cwith all rights, easements, privileges and appurtenances to the same belonging, and subject to the restrictions set forth in the original deed from the Boston Water Power Company, recorded with Suffolk deeds, lib. 843, fol. 98.\u201d 2d. A deed from the tenant, dated April 2, 1877, reciting that \u201cthe Provident Institution for Savings in the town of Boston \u201d is the holder of that mortgage (describing it), and that the tenant, being the owner of the equity of redemption, \u201c has requested the said corporation\u201d to grant further time for the payment of the mortgage debt; and that the \u201csaid corporation\u201d has agreed to extend the time; and by which the tenant covenanted with the \u201c said corporation \u201d to pay the mortgage debt at the expiration of the extended term, together with accrued interest and any moneys paid by the \u201csaid corporation for taxes, insurance and other necessary charges on the mortgaged premises.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-5\">There was no other evidence that the demandant was a corporation, and no evidence as to the rights, easements, privileges, appurtenances and restrictions mentioned in the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-6\">The tenant introduced no testimony, but rested his case upon the demandant\u2019s evidence, and asked the judge to direct a non-suit for the following reasons: \u201c The demandant has not proved a better title in itself. First. Because it has not shown or attempted to prove its own corporate existence. Second. Because the two- books (about which the witness Brown was interrogated) were not themselves offered in evidence. Third. Because there is a fatal variance between the writ and declaration and the Swallow mortgage in the description of the property which is the subject of the action. Fourth. Because at the time the demandant closed its evidence and rested its case, it had not joined issue with the tenant.\u201d The judge overruled the motion for a nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>The tenant requested the following instruction to the jury: 16 The demandant is not entitled in this case to recover for the vent of said premises of the tenant, nor for any taxes or insurance paid by the demandant, if any, because there are no allegations in the demandant\u2019s writ and declaration to base any such claim upon.\u201d The judge declined to give this instruction; \u201c but gave one of an opposite character; and told the jury not to include any taxes, because they were paid before entry for foreclosure ; and further instructed them that, as the tenant had shown no title other than naked possession, the demandant must show that his title is better than the naked possession of the tenant, and need show nothing more than such better title to entitle him to recover the possession.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-3\">The jury returned a verdict for the demandant, and assessed damages in the sum of $360.82; and \u201cto all the rulings and action of the court as to the challenge to the array, to the motion for nonsuit, to the instruction prayed for, to the instructions actually given, and to the action as to the two books aforesaid,\u201d the tenant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b481-4\"><em>P. H Hutchinson, </em>for the tenant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b481-5\"><em>F. C. Welch, </em>for the demandant, was heard on the question of damages only.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b481-6\">Gray, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Az7\">1. By the St. of 1873, <em>c. </em>44, it is enacted that \u201cno person shall serve as a traverse juror in the county of Suffolk more than thirty days at any one term of court, unless for the purpose of finishing a case commenced within that time.\u201d The \u201c thirty days \u201d here intended are manifestly days on which the court is in session, and on which jurors may be called upon to serve. Upon the facts stated in the bill of exceptions, therefore, the challenge to the array set forth no legal ground of objection to the jury, and the tenant suffered no prejudice by the summary and informal manner in which it was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">2. There was evidence of the corporate existence of the demandant ; 1st. In the books of records produced by its clerk and proved by his testimony; and 2d. In the description of the demandant as a corporation in the mortgage referred to and affirmed in the deed executed by the tenant himself. <em>Worcester Medical Institution </em>v. <em>Harding, </em>11 Cush. 285. <em>Williamsburg Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Frothingham, </em>122 Mass. 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>3. There was no variance in the description of the property demanded. Easements and restrictions cannot be recovered or enforced, and need not be set forth, in a writ of entry. Stearns on Real Actions, 150. <em>Proprietors of Locks &amp; Canals </em>v. <em>Nashua &amp; Lowell </em>Railroad, 104 Mass. 1. The objection made at the argument, that the demandant had not alleged his seisin to be in mortgage, was not taken at the trial, when it might have been cured by amendment, if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">4. By the practice act, the case was at issue when the plea was filed, and no formal joinder of issue by the demandant was needed. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>129, \u00a7 28; c. 134, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">5. The instruction as to the proof of title was all that the case required. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>134, \u00a7 7. There does' not appear to have been any evidence or pretence of title in the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">6. The instruction as to rent was correct. Under the statutes of the Commonwealth, the demandant in a writ of entry is entitled to recover rents and profits, although not specifically demanded in the writ. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>134, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 14. <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>6 Cush. 265, 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">7. But neither party having moved for conditional judgment, judgment was to be entered in the common form, and the demandant could not recover for insurance. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>140, \u00a7 4. As the instructions given allowed the demandant to recover for insurance, the tenant\u2019s exceptions must be sustained and a new trial granted as to damages only, unless the demandant (as was intimated at the argument) elects to remit all damages and take judgment for possession of the land, in which case the entry will be <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">Upon the delivery of this opinion, the demandant elected to remit all damages, and judgment was entered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
