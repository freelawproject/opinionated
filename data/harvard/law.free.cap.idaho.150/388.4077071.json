JONES, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b417-22\">I. Nature of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b417-23\">David D. Smith appeals from the district court\u2019s decision to deny his request for costs and attorney fees he incurred while compelling Washington County to issue him a residential building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-24\">II. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b417-25\">In the fall of 2006, David D. Smith, the appellant, bought an eighty-acre parcel near Midvale, Idaho. Sometime in early 2007, Smith sought a permit from the Washington County Board of Commissioners (the \u201cBoard\u201d) to build a house on his property, which the County Planning and Zoning Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) refused. The Commission voted against granting the permit because it believed that, under the Wash<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>ington County Zoning Ordinance and the International Fire Code, Smith\u2019s driveway was too narrow to allow fire equipment to reach his property. After several months of delay, the Board also refused to grant Smith\u2019s permit, again on the grounds that his driveway violated fire-safety regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">On May 23, 2008, Smith sought mandamus relief from the district court, which instead treated his motion as a petition for judicial review. In its Memorandum Decision and Order, the district court reversed the Board and ordered it to grant Smith his building permit. It found that the Board had delayed Smith\u2019s application for too long and had denied the permit arbitrarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Smith then requested an award of attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12-117, -120(3), and -121. The district court denied Smith\u2019s request under all three provisions, finding that the County\u2019s defense of the case \u201cwas not frivolous,\u201d but rather was \u201ca matter of confusion.\u201d In their briefs on appeal, the parties disputed whether I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12-117, -120(3), and -121 entitle Smith to attorney fees that he incurred in compelling the County to issue his building permit, although at oral argument Smith expressly disavowed his claims under \u00a7\u00a7 12-120(3) and -121. The parties nonetheless still disagree over whether, under I.C. \u00a7 12-117, the County acted with a reasonable basis in law and fact in denying the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">III.Issues on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">1.

Whether Smith is entitled to attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">IV.Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">\u201cThe interpretation of a statute is a question of law over which this Court exercises free review.\u201d <em>Doe v. Boy Scouts of Am., </em>148 Idaho 427, 430, 224 P.3d 494, 497 (2009). Determining the meaning of an attorney-fee statute and whether it applies to the facts are issues of law that this Court freely reviews. <em>J.R. Simplot Co. v. W. Heritage Ins. Co., </em>132 Idaho 582, 584, 977 P.2d 196, 198 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-15\">V.Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b418-16\">A. Smith Is Not Entitled to Any Attorney Fees Under I.C. \u00a7 12-117 in the District Court or on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b418-17\">Smith seeks attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117. Before 2010, this section provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-18\">Unless otherwise provided by statute, <em>in any administrative or civil judicial proceeding </em>involving as adverse parties a state agency, a city, a county or other taxing district and a person, <em>the court </em>shall award the prevailing party reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, witness fees and reasonable expenses, if <em>the court </em>finds that the party against whom the judgment is rendered acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKv\">I.C. \u00a7 12-117(1) (2009) (emphasis added). This Court originally interpreted this provision to permit administrative agencies to award attorney fees at the administrative level if the losing state agency acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law. <em>E.g. Stewart v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Welfare, </em>115 Idaho 820, 822, 771 P.2d 41, 43 (1989); <em>Rural Kootenai Org., Inc. v. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, </em>133 Idaho 833, 845-46, 993 P.2d 596, 608-09 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-19\">In <em>Rammell v. Idaho State Department of Agriculture, </em>this Court overruled these prior decisions, holding that a court could not award attorney fees for an administrative proceeding. 147 Idaho 415, 422-23, 210 P.3d 523, 530-31 (2009). The decision rested in part on the fact that the statute only allowed \u201cthe court\u201d to award fees, not an agency. <em>Id. </em>at 422, 210 P.3d at 530. The Court in <em>Rammell </em>also had to determine whether the phrase \u201cin any administrative or civil judicial proceeding\u201d encompassed appeals from administrative decisions. Instead of interpreting that term to mean \u201cany administrative proceeding or civil judicial proceeding,\u201d the Court found that it only meant \u201cany administrative judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422-23, 210 P.3d at 530-31. Reading \u00a7 12-117 to apply to administrative judicial proceedings permitted courts to award fees in petitions for review from administrative decisions. <em>Id. </em>at 423, 210 P.3d at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>The unstated reason for interpreting the phrase \u201cadministrative or civil judicial proceeding\u201d to apply to appeals of administrative decisions, and not to administrative proceedings themselves, is that there is no statutory mechanism for the courts to intervene in an administrative proceeding. A court\u2019s authority to award attorney fees attaches only after there is a proceeding before a court relating to an administrative action \u2014 i.e., an action for judicial review\u2014 because administrative proceedings and judicial proceedings are wholly separate types of legal actions. An \u201cadministrative proceeding\u201d is \u201c[a] hearing, inquiry, investigation, or trial before an administrative agency.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>51 (9th ed.2009). By comparison, a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d is simply defined as \u201c[a]ny court proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1324. Because the pri- or version of \u00a7 12-117(1) authorized courts to award fees in \u201cany administrative or civil judicial proceeding,\u201d it was evident that the courts of this state were to have some power to award attorney fees in judicial actions relating to administrative proceedings. Since the Legislature provided no mechanism for courts to award fees in administrative proceedings, it must have only meant to allow fee awards in <em>appeals </em>from administrative decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In response to <em>Rammell, </em>the Legislature amended I.C. \u00a7 12-117, applying it retroactively to cases filed and pending as of June 1, 2009, the date the opinion was released. Act of March 4, 2010, ch. 29, 2010 Idaho Sess. Laws 49, 49-50. Idaho Code \u00a7 12-117(1) now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">Unless otherwise provided by statute, <em>in any administrative proceeding or civil judicial proceeding </em>involving as adverse parties a state agency or political subdivision and a person, <em>the state agency or political subdivision or the court, as the case may be, </em>shall award the prevailing party reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, witness fees and other reasonable expenses, if it finds that the nonprevailing party acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">The intent of the amendment was apparently to enable the prevailing party in an administrative proceeding to receive attorney fees when frivolous conduct has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Thus, as amended, I.C. \u00a7 12-117(1) does not allow a court to award attorney fees in an appeal from an administrative decision. First, to be an \u201cadministrative proceeding,\u201d this action would have to be before an agency. This case was originally styled as an application for a writ of mandate, which the district court correctly treated as a petition for judicial review. Even if this were an administrative proceeding, the amendment does not allow courts to award attorney fees anyway. It empowers only \u201cthe state agency or political subdivision, or the court, as the case may be,\u201d to award the fees. As described above, no mechanism exists for courts to intervene in administrative proceedings to award attorney fees. By using the phrase \u201cas the case may be,\u201d the Legislature indicated that only the relevant adjudicative body \u2014 the agency in an administrative proceeding or the court in a judicial proceeding \u2014 may award the attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">This action is also not a \u201ccivil judicial proceeding.\u201d A civil action must be \u201ccommenced by the filing of a complaint with the court.\u201d I.R.C.P. 3(a)(1). Since this is a petition for judicial review, a proceeding that does not commence with a complaint filed in court, the courts cannot award fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Sanchez v. State, </em>143 Idaho 239, 243, 141 P.3d 1108, 1112 (2006) (holding that a petition for judicial review is not a civil action); <em>Neighbors for Responsible Growth v. Kootenai Cnty., </em>147 Idaho 173, 176 n. 1, 207 P.3d 149, 152 n. 1 (2009) (same). As Chief Justice Eismann recently noted, \u201c[a] civil judicial proceeding would be a civil lawsuit filed in court, and an administrative judicial proceeding would be the appeal of an administrative proceeding to a court.\u201d <em>Lake CDA Invs., LLC v. Idaho Dep\u2019t of Lands, </em>149 Idaho 274, 285 n. 6, 233 P.3d 721, 732 n. 6 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">The new delineation in \u00a7 12-117(1) between administrative proceedings and civil judicial proceedings aligns with the preexist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>ing division of authority to define the rules of procedure for each type of legal action. As the Legislature has acknowledged, this Court has the inherent power to prescribe rules of procedure \u201cin all the courts\u201d of this state. I.C. \u00a7 1-212. The Court therefore may adopt rules of procedure \u201cin all actions and proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1-213. The Legislature has also enacted the Idaho Administrative Procedure Act, I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 67-5201 to 67-5228, which prescribes the manner in which contested administrative eases will be conducted, provides the procedure for administrative review, and authorizes judicial review of final agency orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The Legislature therefore must also have intended to abrogate the part of <em>Rammell </em>that interpreted \u00a7 12-117 to allow courts to award fees in petitions for judicial review. Again, <em>Rammell </em>read the prior version of \u00a7 12-117 to allow fees in \u201cadministrative judicial proceedings,\u201d which included petitions for review of administrative decisions. By separating \u201cadministrative proceedings\u201d from \u201ccivil judicial proceedings,\u201d the Legislature signaled that the courts should no longer be able to award fees in administrative judicial proceedings such as this one. We presume that when it amended \u00a7 12-117(1), the Legislature was aware of the prevailing judicial interpretation of that statute and specifically chose to change that interpretation. <em>State v. Maybee, </em>148 Idaho 520, 529, 224 P.3d 1109, 1118 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">B. Smith Is Not Entitled to Fees Under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) or \u00a7 12-121 in the District Court or on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In his opening brief on appeal, Smith requested attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120(3) and 12-121. Idaho Code \u00a7 12-120(3) mandates fees to the prevailing party in a \u201ccommercial transaction,\u201d while \u00a7 12-121 provides the court with general discretion to award attorney fees to the prevailing party in civil actions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At oral argument, Smith\u2019s attorney expressly waived any claim for fees under these provisions. Even if he had not, I.C. \u00a7 12-117 \u201cis the exclusive means for awarding attorney fees for the entities to which it applies.\u201d <em>Potlatch Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Potlatch Sch. Dish, </em>148 Idaho 630, 635, 226 P.3d 1277, 1282 (2010); <em>see also State v. Hagerman Water Right Owners, Inc., </em>130 Idaho 718, 723, 947 P.2d 391, 396 (1997) (\u201cI.C. \u00a7 12-117 provides the exclusive basis upon which to seek an award of attorney fees against a state agency.\u201d); <em>Johnson v. Blaine Cnty., </em>146 Idaho 916, 929, 204 P.3d 1127, 1140 (2009) (holding that fees for a petition for judicial review of a county\u2019s decision are not awardable under I.C. \u00a7 12-121). As noted above, I.C. \u00a7 12-117 specifically provides for attorney fees in actions against the counties, so it governs this ease exclusively. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 12-117(4)(b). Smith therefore cannot receive attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120(3) or 12-121.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">C. Smith Is Not Entitled to Costs in the District Court</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">The district court below did not rule on Smith\u2019s request for costs, which is tantamount to a denial. <em>L &amp; W Supply Corp. v. Chartrand Family Trust, </em>136 Idaho 738, 745 \u2014 46, 40 P.3d 96, 103-04 (2002). Costs are awarded according to the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure. I.C. \u00a7 12-101. Rule 54 provides that \u201ccosts shall be allowed as a matter of right to the prevailing party or parties, unless otherwise ordered by the court.\u201d I.R.C.P. 54(d)(1)(A). \u201c[T]he decision to award any costs to the prevailing party in a civil action is entirely within the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Caldwell v. Idaho Youth Ranch, Inc., </em>132 Idaho 120, 127, 968 P.2d 215, 222 (1998) (citing <em>Zimmerman v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc., </em>128 Idaho 851, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>857, 920 P.2d 67, 73 (1996)). In exercising its discretion, however, the district court must identify \u201cwhich party to an <em>action </em>is a prevailing party.\u201d I.R.C.P. 54(d)(1) (emphasis added). As stated above, a civil action is one that is commenced \u201cby the filing of a complaint.\u201d I.R.C.P. 3(a)(1). This case began with an application for a writ of mandamus that was treated as a petition for judicial review of an administrative decision. Since this is not a civil action, Smith is not entitled to costs under I.R.C.P. 54(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">VI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Smith is not entitled to any attorney fees in this petition for review of an administrative decision. The decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b421-6\">Chief Justice EISMANN, Justices BURDICK, J. JONES and HORTON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-7\">.
