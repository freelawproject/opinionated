Ginther argues that his firing was not due to misconduct in connection with his employment. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">Ginther went to work for Boise as a flexo operator on August 24, 2006.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ginther\u2019s responsibilities included performing pre-start and set-up procedures and quality cheeks, as well as in-process quality checks to ensure the flexo was printing properly. Part of these checks and procedures included printing a single box, called a set-up box, before beginning a print run. This was done to verify that the flexo\u2019s set-up conformed to the customer\u2019s specifications before printing the complete order. Some orders consisted of several thousand boxes, necessitating a pre-start cheek to prevent the operators from accidentally producing large batches of non-conforming boxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-15\">During his employment with Boise, Ginther\u2019s supervisors initiated several disciplinary actions against him for failing to adhere to established quality assurance procedures. These disciplinary actions culminated in a document referred to by the parties as the \u201clast chance agreement.\u201d This document, signed by the parties on August 18, 2008, addressed an incident wherein Ginther printed several thousand non-conforming units. According to the agreement, Ginther could have avoided the problem if he had followed Boise\u2019s quality control procedures. The agreement specified that Ginther would, as a condition of his continued employment, \u201cfollow all rules, policies and procedures,\u201d and that he understood any failure to do so would \u201cresult in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.\u201d This was to be Ginther\u2019s \u201cone last opportunity to improve\u201d his performance, as Boise had previously disciplined Ginther on two occasions for \u201cquality/performanee issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-16\">On October 9, 2008, Ginther contacted his supervisor to report a print quality problem, which he had since remedied. As Ginther\u2019s supervisor attempted to isolate the defective boxes, he noticed that all the boxes Ginther and his assistant had produced up to that point shared the same printing defect. The supervisor asked to see Ginther\u2019s set-up box <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>in order to verify that the flexo had been set properly prior to beginning the print run. Ginther produced a defect-free set-up box. The supervisor compared the defective boxes with a box printed by the previous shift, and noticed the same defect on the boxes printed by the earlier shift. The supervisor then concluded that Ginther had run the set-up box <em>after </em>correcting the problem, and was attempting to conceal his failure to conduct a pre-run quality assurance check as required by Boise policy. The supervisor asked Ginther\u2019s assistant if this was so, and the assistant confirmed the supervisor\u2019s suspicions.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Boise terminated Ginther on October 14, 2008, for failing to abide by the terms of the last chance agreement and for dishonesty in giving the supervisor the defect-free set-up box instead of admitting that he had not run a set-up box prior to running the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The Idaho Department of Labor (\u201cDepartment\u201d) denied Ginther\u2019s claim for unemployment compensation benefits, holding that Ginther was ultimately responsible for ensuring that the quality check was performed, he had failed to do so, and this failure constituted misconduct in connection with Ginther\u2019s employment as Ginther\u2019s conduct fell below a standard of behavior Boise had the right to expect.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Ginther appealed the Department\u2019s decision to the Department\u2019s Appeals Bureau, arguing that Boise policy placed the responsibility for conducting the quality assurance checks on both the operator and the assistant, and that Boise therefore should not have held him solely accountable for the error. The Appeals Bureau scheduled a telephonic hearing, and served Ginther with a notice of hearing via U.S. mail on December 8, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">Several documents were admitted at the outset of the hearing, referred to in the transcript as Exhibits I through 6.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although Ginther should have been provided copies of the proposed exhibits along with the notice of telephonic hearing, the certificate of service only reflects that Ginther was served with the notice of hearing. Ginther disputes ever having received copies of the exhibits. At the hearing, when the appeals examiner indicated that she was admitting Exhibits 1 through 6, Ginther did not object. The only indication from Ginther during the hearing that he did not have the exhibits was a statement he made while questioning a witness that he could not \u201cseem to find that paper____\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">The appeals examiner found that Boise discharged Ginther \u201cfor misconduct in connection with employment as defined by \u00a7 72-1366(5) of the Idaho Security Law\u201d and that Boise\u2019s unemployment account was not chargeable for experience rating purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">Ginther appealed the appeals examiner\u2019s decision to the Idaho Industrial Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>(\u201cCommission\u201d), arguing that he never received copies of the exhibits the examiner admitted into the record, and thus he had not had a fair hearing. He wrote in his appeal that he noticed the documents were missing prior to the conclusion of the hearing, but that he did not bring it to anyone\u2019s attention because the hearing was almost over. He also reiterated his argument that both he and his assistant were responsible for the quality assurance procedures, and thus he should not be deprived of unemployment compensation benefits because of the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">The Commission denied Ginther\u2019s claim, finding both that Ginther received a fair hearing and that Boise had discharged Ginther for misconduct and thus he was not eligible for unemployment compensation benefits. Ginther timely appealed from this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">When reviewing a decision by the Commission, this Court is generally limited to questions of law. Idaho Const. Art. V, \u00a7 9. In reviewing factual decisions by the Commission, this Court\u2019s review is limited to determining whether the Commission\u2019s findings are supported by substantial competent evidence. I.C. \u00a7 72-732(1). The Court does not reweigh evidence or consider whether it would have reached a different conclusion based upon the evidence presented. <em>Uhl v. Ballard Med. Prod., Inc., </em>138 Idaho 653, 657, 67 P.3d 1265, 1269 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Whether the government has violated a citizen\u2019s right to due process is a question of law, which this court freely reviews. <em>Neighbors for a Healthy Gold Fork v. Valley Cnty., </em>145 Idaho 121, 127, 176 P.3d 126, 132 (2007) (citing <em>Cowan v. Bd. of Commrs. of Fremont Cnty., </em>143 Idaho 501, 510, 148 P.3d 1247, 1256 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The Commission\u2019s determination whether an employee\u2019s behavior constituted misconduct is a factual determination that the Court will uphold if the determination is supported by substantial and competent evidence. <em>Folks v. Moscow Sch. Dist. No. 281, </em>129 Idaho 833, 836, 933 P.2d 642, 645 (1997) (citing <em>Welch v. Cowles Publishing Co., </em>127 Idaho 361, 364, 900 P.2d 1372, 1375 (1995)). This Court has defined \u201csubstantial and competent evidence\u201d as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Folks, </em>129 Idaho at 836, 933 P.2d at 645 (quoting <em>Welch, </em>127 Idaho at 365, 900 P.2d at 1376). While conflicting evidence may exist in the record, the Court does not disturb the Commission\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>McAlpin v. Wood River Med. Ctr., </em>129 Idaho 1, 5, 921 P.2d 178, 182 (1996) (citing <em>Ross v. Tupperware Mfg. Co./Premark, </em>122 Idaho 641, 643, 837 P.2d 316, 318 (1992)). The Court will view all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the party who prevailed before the Commission. <em>Higgins v. Larry Miller Subaru </em>\u2014 Mitsubi<em>shi, </em>145 Idaho 1, 4, 175 P.3d 163, 166 (2007) (citing <em>Neihart v. Universal Joint Auto Parts, Inc., </em>141 Idaho 801, 802-03, 118 P.3d 133, 134-35 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">A. Ginther has failed to properly advance his claim of error regarding the admission of the exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">In his initial briefing before this Court, the sole issue that Ginther identified and argued is his claim that the Commission erred in its detei\u2019mination that he was discharged for misconduct in connection with his employment. Ginther did, however, refer to the failure to provide him a copy of the exhibits in his statement of facts. In its responsive brief, the Department characterized the failure to provide Ginther with copies of proposed exhibits as a claimed procedural due process violation. The Department noted that Ginther had not cited \u201cany propositions of law or legal authority to support his contention\u201d and argued that this Court should not consider the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">When the appeals examiner informed the parties that she was admitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>the exhibits, Ginther failed to object. He thus waived any right to raise the issue of the admission of the exhibits on appeal. \u201cA litigant may not remain silent as to claimed error during a prior proceeding and later raise his objections for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Hoppe v. McDonald, </em>103 Idaho 33, 35, 644 P.2d 355, 357 (1982). Further, although the Department may well have accurately discerned a potential claim of a procedural due process violation, Ginther did not advance this claim as an issue on appeal nor did he support the claim with legal argument or citation to authority. \u201cWe will not consider issues cited on appeal that are not supported by propositions of law, authority, or argument.\u201d <em>Callaghan v. Callaghan, </em>142 Idaho 185, 190, 125 P.3d 1061, 1066 (2005). For these reasons, we will not address the effect of the failure to provide copies of proposed exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">B. The Commission\u2019s finding that Boise discharged Ginther for misconduct in connection with his employment was supported by substantial competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Ginther argues that the Commission erred in its determination that he was discharged for misconduct in connection with his employment. A discharged employee is not entitled to unemployment benefits if he is \u201cdischarged for misconduct in connection with his employment.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-1366(5). Both the Idaho Administrative Code and this Court define misconduct as \u201c(1) a willful, intentional disregard of the employer\u2019s interest; (2) a deliberate violation of the employer\u2019s rules; or (3) a disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has a right to expect of its employees.\u201d <em>Chapman v. NYK Line N.A., Inc., </em>147 Idaho 178, 182, 207 P.3d 154, 158 (2009) <em>(quoting Quinn v. J.R. Simplot Co., </em>131 Idaho 318, 321, 955 P.2d 1097, 1100 (1998)); IDAPA 09.01.30.275.02 (2010). The Idaho Administrative Code provides that \u201c[t]he test for misconduct in \u2018standard of behavior cases\u2019 is ... (i) [wjhether the claimant\u2019s conduct fell below the standard of behavior expected by the employer; and (ii) [w]hether the employer\u2019s expectation was objectively reasonable in the particular case.\u201d IDAPA 09.01.30.275.02.C (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u201cThere is no requirement that the employee\u2019s disregard of the employer\u2019s expected standard of behavior must have been subjectively willful, intentional, or deliberate.\u201d <em>Welch v. Cowles Publishing Co., </em>127 Idaho 361, 364, 900 P.2d 1372, 1375 (1995) <em>(citing Matthews v. Bucyrus-Erie Co., </em>101 Idaho 657, 659, 619 P.2d 1110, 1112 (1980)). Whether the discharge for misconduct is work-related is a factual determination. <em>Chapman, </em>147 Idaho at 182, 207 P.3d at 158 <em>(citing Beaty v. City of Idaho Falls, </em>110 Idaho 891, 892, 719 P.2d 1151, 1152 (1986)). The burden of proving misconduct is on the employer. <em>Id.; </em>IDAPA 09.01.30.275.01 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">The test first requires the fact finder to answer two questions: (1) whether the employer had a standard of behavior it expected of the claimant, and (2) whether the claimant\u2019s behavior fell below that standard. According to the evidence admitted before the appeals examiner, Boise expected and required Ginther to perform the set-up and quality assurance checks before beginning a print run. These cheeks were in place to verify the flexo was operating and configured correctly and to prevent operators from printing non-conforming units. Testimony at the hearing established that Ginther was a qualified operator of this machine. Boise introduced evidence indicating that Ginther and/or his assistant would have discovered the October 9, 2008, error prior to initiating the run if one of them had completed the required checks. Ginther\u2019s assistant testified that Ginther did not run a set-up box until after they discovered the error. Although Ginther provided conflicting testimony, there was substantial competent evidence supporting the Commission\u2019s determination that Ginther did not perform \u2014 or ensure that his assistant performed \u2014 the set-up and quality assurance checks prior to initiating the print run in question. Thus, the Commission reasonably concluded Ginther\u2019s conduct fell below the standard of behavior Boise expected of Ginther.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>There was substantial competent evidence supporting the Commission\u2019s conclusion that Boise\u2019s expectations were reasonable. Boise\u2019s internal operating criteria for flexo operators required the operator to perform all pre-start quality and in-process quality cheeks. Ginther had been an operator for \u201ca while\u201d and understood the process and procedures he was supposed to follow. Boise had previously disciplined Ginther on at least two occasions for his failure to follow quality assurance procedures. The last chance agreement, which Ginther signed, explicitly admonished Ginther to perform his quality cheeks and that failure to do so could result in his termination. There was testimony that one of the previous incidents for which Ginther had been disciplined had cost Boise $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Ginther argues that it was not reasonable for Boise to expect him to perform the quality cheeks himself because he alone did not bear the responsibility for performing them. Rather, both he and his assistant collectively bore that responsibility. Based upon evidence presented at the hearing, the Commission found that Ginther was ultimately responsible for ensuring that the quality checks were performed. Based upon the testimony provided by Ginther\u2019s supervisor, we find that there was substantial competent evidence supporting this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Ginther also argues that Boise\u2019s disciplinary procedures were unreasonable because Boise never should have placed him on the last chance agreement in the first place. Ginther asserts that he was not at fault in one of the incidents that preceded the last chance agreement. Therefore, Ginther argues that it was not reasonable for Boise to place him on a last chance agreement and subsequently fire him for violating its terms. Ginther\u2019s argument is misplaced. The question before the Commission and this Court is not whether Boise\u2019s decision to terminate Ginther was wise or just; rather, the question for resolution is whether Boise terminated him for misconduct in connection with his employment. In the context of these proceedings, the last chance agreement is relevant only to the extent that it unambiguously communicated to Ginther that Boise expected him to comply with quality control procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Ginther argues that this Court should rule that \u201csimple performance errors on an overworked and under-trained production line worker do not qualify as misconduct under the unemployment benefits statute.\u201d We are unable to do so. To adopt this request, we would have to make a factual determination that the conditions of Ginther\u2019s employment were such that Boise\u2019s expectation of compliance with its quality control procedures was unreasonable. In our view, this factual question is governed by the second prong of the misconduct analysis under IDAPA 09.01.30.275.02.C. The Commission\u2019s factual determinations reflect its consideration of the evidence on this point. The Commission considered Ginther\u2019s testimony that Boise had reduced the crew on his machine down from three people to two in the preceding year, that the flexo was not operating properly on October 9, that Boise had inadequately trained him to operate that particular machine, and that the employees at Boise were under pressure to meet production quotas. Despite this testimony, the Commission did not find Boise\u2019s expectation that Ginther would perform his quality assurance cheeks under such conditions to be objectively unreasonable. As the Commission addressed the factual question Ginther now wishes this Court to answer differently, we are not free to substitute our view of the evidence for that of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Because substantial and competent evidence supports the Commission\u2019s factual findings, we affirm the decision to deny Ginther\u2019s claim for unemployment insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">Ginther has failed to properly advance any claim of error regarding the admission of evidence before the appeals examiner. Substantial competent evidence supported the Commission\u2019s decision to deny Ginther\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>claim for unemployment insurance benefits. We therefore affirm. Costs to Respondents.</p>\n<judges id=\"b178-4\">Chief Justice EISMANN and Justices BURDICK, J. JONES and W. JONES concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-13\">. Ginther inaccurately named \"Boise Cascade Corporation\u201d as the employer in this case. Ginther was employed by Boise Paper Holdings, L.L.C., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boise, Inc. at the time of his discharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b173-17\">. \"Flexo\u201d refers to a flexographic printing press. Flexography is a variant of letterpress printing and a popular method of applying print to cardboard boxes. <em>Handbook of Print Media </em>29-30, 145-50 (Helmut Kipphan ed., 2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\">. Our review of the exhibits reveals that Ginther would have been familiar with the contents of most of these documents. Exhibit 1 was the notice of telephonic hearing before the Appeals Bureau in which Ginther participated. Exhibit 2 described the procedures governing the appeals hearing. Exhibit 4 was the initial notice to Ginther from the Department informing him that his application for unemployment insurance benefits had been denied. Exhibit 5 was Ginther\u2019s request for an appeals hearing. Exhibit 6 detailed Ginther\u2019s wage history while employed by Boise.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Exhibit 3 is actually several documents, evidently supplied by Boise. The first page of the exhibit is a copy of an email sent to Ginther notifying him of the reasons for his termination. The second and third pages are written statements from Ginther\u2019s assistant and supervisor describing the events of October 9, 2008. The fourth page is a copy of the \u201clast chance agreement.\u201d The fifth page relates to an earlier incident in which Ginther was disciplined as a result of a defective print run. The sixth through eleventh pages outline the job functions of a flexo operator. Thus, it appears that the only documents that may have been new to Ginther were the statements of his supervisor and assistant. Both testified at the appeals hearing and were cross-examined by Ginther.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b174-14\">. The Commission indicates in its decision that the audio recording of the hearing reflects that the appeals examiner \"went through the exhibits with the parties\u201d and that Ginther \"did not object or raise a concern that he was missing any of the exhibits.\u201d The audio recording is not in the record before this Court and the transcript of the hearing does not reflect this discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
