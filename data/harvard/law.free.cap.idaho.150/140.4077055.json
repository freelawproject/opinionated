The Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Health and Welfare had obtained in a prior action a final child support order stating that the appellant was the father of the child. The Department later brought this action to terminate his parental rights on the ground that he was not the father of the child without seeking to set aside the prior order. Because there was no statutory basis for terminating appellant\u2019s parental rights, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">When Child was born, his Mother and John Doe were living together but were not married. Child\u2019s birth certificate filed a few days later did not identify his father, but he was given John Doe\u2019s surname.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">When he was about eight months old, Child was taken to the hospital with physical injuries that were indicative of child abuse. On October 21,2008, he was taken into custody by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (Department) and was placed into foster care. On the same day, Mother told Department\u2019s social worker that John Doe was not Child\u2019s father, but she claimed not to know who the father was.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">On October 23, 2008, this action was filed under the Child Protective Act. In an affidavit of a Department social worker filed with the petition, the social worker stated that the biological father of Child was unknown and recounted that both Mother and John Doe had stated that John Doe was not Child\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">On the same day that the child protection proceedings were commenced, Mother and John Doe signed under oath an \u201cAcknowledgement of Paternity Affidavit\u201d stating that John Doe was Child\u2019s biological father. They then filed that document with the Bureau of Health Statistics and Vital Records, which is part of Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">On October 31, 2008, the court issued an order giving temporary custody of Child to Department. The court\u2019s factual findings supporting the order included the finding that Mother and John Doe had told Department\u2019s social worker that John Doe was not Child\u2019s biological father and that Mother denied knowing the name of the biological father or how to contact him.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">Child remained in Department\u2019s custody, and the proceedings in this case continued under the Child Protective Act. A report filed on November 8,2008, by a Department social worker named a man whom the social worker believed may be Child\u2019s biological father. The social worker contacted him, and he acknowledged that he likely was Child\u2019s biological father, but he would not agree to submit to a paternity test.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">Department commenced a separate court action against Mother and John Doe to require them to pay child support for Child. A final order in that case was entered on February 17, 2009. It stated that Mother \u201cis the legal mother\u201d and Jron Doe \u201cis the legal father\u201d of Child, and it ordered both of them to pay support for Child.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">On May 4, 2009, Department filed a petition in this action to terminate the parental rights of Child\u2019s biological father. He had previously executed a consent to termination, and on May 12, 2009, a judgment was entered terminating the parent and child relationship between him and Child.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">On October 28, 2009, Department filed a petition in this action to terminate the parent and child relationship between Child and both Mother and John Doe. The petition alleged that John Doe was Child\u2019s \u201cLegal Father\u201d and that Department sought termination because John Doe \u201cis not the biological father of the child.\u201d It alleged that Mother\u2019s parental rights should be terminated because she \u201chas been incarcerated and is likely to remain incarcerated for a substantial period of time during the child\u2019s minority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">The matter was tried to the court, and on June 18, 2010, it entered an order granting the petition to terminate. The court found that the parent and child relationship between John Doe and Child should be termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>nated because he was not the biological father of Child and termination was in Child\u2019s best interests. The court found that Mother\u2019s parental rights should be terminated because she had abused and neglected Child and termination of her rights was in Child\u2019s best interests. On June 18, 2010, the court entered a judgment terminating \u201cthe parental rights\u201d of Mother and the \u201c \u2018legal father\u2019 status\u201d of John Doe. He timely appealed to this Court, but Mother did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The only issue on appeal is whether the magistrate court erred in terminating the parent and child relationship between John Doe and Child. John Doe contends that he is the father of Child based upon the order entered in the child support proceeding and that Department failed to prove any statutory ground for tern^nating his parental rights. Department counters that John Doe is not a parent because he is not the biological father of Child and that the final order it obtained against John Doe for child support did not establish that he was the parent of Child, even though the order stated that he \u201cis the legal father\u201d of Child. Department did not explain how John Doe could be the \u201clegal father\u201d but not the parent of Child or how he could be liable for child support if he was not a parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The Termination of Parent and Child Relationship Act, Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 16-2001 through 16-2015, provides for terminating the parent and child relationship. Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 16-2003 &amp; 16-2010(1). In order to terminate a parent and child relationship, there must be a parent. The Act defines a \u201cparent,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and by doing so it excludes other relationships with a child from being that of a parent. The issue raised by the parties is whether John Doe is a parent of Child.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">John Doe cannot meet the statutory definition of \u201cparent\u201d applicable to proceedings to terminate a parent and child relationship because he is neither Child\u2019s adoptive nor biological father. Idaho Code \u00a7 16-2002(ll)(b), (e) &amp; (d). His only basis for asserting he is Child\u2019s parent is that the final child support order obtained by Department stating that he \u201cis the legal father\u201d of Child precludes Department from relitigating the issue of paternity in this ease. <em>See Waller v. State, Department of Health and Welfare, </em>146 Idaho 234, 192 P.3d 1058 (2008), and Idaho Code \u00a7 7-1124. The magistrate did not rule upon the preclusive effect of that order. We need not address that issue because the judgment below must be reversed regardless of the legal effect of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">If the child support order determined, as between Department and John Doe, that he is a parent of Child, Department was required to prove a statutory ground for terminating that parent and child relationship. Termination \u201crequires two findings: first, that one of the statutory bases for termination is shown and, second, that termination of parental rights is in the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Doe v. Doe, </em>149 Idaho 392, 396, 234 P.3d 716, 720 (2010); Idaho Code \u00a7 16-2005(1). The statutory grounds for termination are listed in Idaho Code \u00a7 16-2005(1). It is undisputed that there was no statutory ground for terminating John Doe\u2019s parental rights and that the magistrate did not find any statutory ground for termination with respect to him. In the final judgment, the magistrate terminated \u201cthe parental rights\u201d of Mother and \u201cthe \u2018legal father\u2019 status\u201d of Father. It is not clear what the magistrate meant by \u201c \u2018legal father\u2019 status.\u201d If that equates with parental rights, Department failed to prove any statutory basis for terminating those rights, and the judgment must be reversed. <em>In re Adoption of Doe, </em>143 Idaho 188, 141 P.3d 1057 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-14\">If the child support order did not establish, as between Department and John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Doe, that John Doe is Child\u2019s parent, then the judgment terminating his parental rights must still be reversed. \u201cThe underlying premise in a parental rights termination action ... is that the defendant parent has some parental right to his or her child, which should be terminated____Only after a parental interest has been identified can a court properly evaluate whether this interest may be terminated.\u201d <em>Doe v. Roe, </em>142 Idaho 202, 204-05, 127 P.3d 105, 107-08 (2005). If a party in a termination proceeding is not a parent, a court cannot terminate his or her nonexistent parental rights. The court can only enter an order stating that the person has no parental rights. <em>Id. </em>at 207-08, 127 P.3d at 110-11. The judgment entered by the court in this ease did not state that John Doe had no parental rights. It stated that the court terminated his \u201c \u2018legal father\u2019 status,\u201d whatever that was. Therefore, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">In this proceeding brought by Department, the magistrate could not determine that John Doe had no parental rights without addressing the effect of the final order in the child support case. The final judgment stating that the court terminated John Doe\u2019s \u201c \u2018legal father\u2019 status\u201d could be read as vacating the child support order stating that he \u201cis the legal father\u201d of Child. However, the magistrate expressly held that it was not doing so. It stated that it assumed the State would move to set aside the child support order in another proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">It is also possible that the magistrate intended the term \u201clegal father status\u201d to mean some legal relationship other than that of a parent. The magistrate found that \u201cthe fraudulently secured Order of Child Support creates an \u2018interest\u2019 in the child which this court shall treat as a lawful one until the Child Support Order is set aside by a separate action.\u201d The magistrate also referred to John Doe\u2019s \u201clawful \u2018interest\u2019 in this child.\u201d It is unclear what this interest is, but a proceeding under the Termination of Parent and Child Relationship Act does not provide for terminating some relationship other than that of a parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">The judgment of the magistrate court terminating appellant\u2019s \u201c \u2018legal father\u2019 status\u201d is reversed. We award costs on appeal to appellant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b171-10\">Justices BURDICK, J. JONES, W. JONES and J. Pro Tem KIDWELL concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-8\">.
