Nature of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b730-14\">Respondent Dr. Samuel Jorgenson, M.D., negligently performed a spinal surgery on Appellant Patrick Stuard on July 15, 2004. Stuard\u2019s symptoms subsided after the surgery and Dr. Jorgenson did not realize he had negligently operated at the wrong spinal level until over two years later. The parties dispute whether, for purposes of the two-year statute of limitations, the cause of action accrued at the time of the surgery or instead at the time the mistake came to light because of a second injury, when the error was discovered. Stuard appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Dr. Jorgenson. The district court held that the cause of action accrued at the time of the negligent surgery, and was therefore barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-18\">II. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b730-19\">On July 15, 2004, Dr. Samuel Jorgenson performed a spinal surgery on Patrick Stuard. Stuard had suffered an on-the-job injury on or about March 1, 2004. In performing the surgery, Stuard was placed under anesthesia, his back was cut open to expose his spine, tissue and disk material of the spine was removed, holes were drilled into Stuard\u2019s spine and a plate was installed to permanently stabilize and support the spine. Dr. Jorgenson was supposed to operate on the T6-7 spinal level but instead performed the operation on the T5-6 level.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Jorgenson did not realize at that time that he had operated on the wrong level. Stuard had several follow up visits with Dr. Jorgenson as well as x-rays after the surgery, in which Dr. Jorgenson did not determine that he had operated at the wrong level. The chest x-rays were ordered for the routine purpose of determining whether any material had shifted or come loose, to see if any spinal fractures had developed, and to see if any screws had torn out.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While the record indicates that an MRI would have, and eventually did, reveal the surgery was performed at the wrong level, Dr. Jorgenson did not order one until September 20, 2006, after the second injury occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>During the first post-operative office visit on August 4, 2004, Dr. Jorgenson took x-rays and noted that Stuard\u2019s \u201coriginal pain [was] relieved with surgery.\u201d At the second visit on August 18, 2004, the office assistant conducting the visit noted that the post operative course was proceeding as expected. At the next visit on September 1, 2004, Dr. Jorgenson wrote that Stuard had told him that \u201chis preoperative symptoms [were] completely relieved,\u201d and on September 29, 2004, Dr. Jorgenson reported that Stuard \u201ccontinues to be completely asymptomatic from his left side.\u201d On November 1, 2004, and February 25, 2005, Dr. Jorgenson took more x-rays of Stuard and again found that Stuard\u2019s pain was resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">Stuard suffered a second work-related injury on August 31, 2006 and began to experience pain. Dr. Jorgenson performed an MRI on Stuard\u2019s spine on September 20, 2006. Sometime after that MRI, the workers compensation nurse case manager finally brought to Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s attention that he had operated on the wrong level. Dr. Jorgenson stated in his deposition that he did not have knowledge that he had operated at the wrong level until after Stuard\u2019s September 28 and October 9 visits in 2006. On October 27, 2006, Dr. Jorgenson ordered another MRI and finally determined conclusively that he had operated at the wrong level. Dr. Jorgenson testified in his deposition that he informed Stuard of this fact on November 20, 2006, stating in his deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">I told him that we had intended to operate on the T6-7 level. And it appears from the x-rays that we had inadvertently operated on the T5-6 level. As a consequence, he still had the same pathology and same herniation at the T6-7 level as he had</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">Stuard then consulted Dr. Tyler Frizzell, M.D., who performed surgery to remove the plate and some of the hardware from the T56 level and execute the correct procedure at the T6-7 level.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">Stuard filed an application for the convening of a prelitigation screening panel with the Idaho State Board of Medicine on April 2, 2007. He filed his Complaint and Demand for a Jury Trial for medical malpractice against Dr. Jorgenson on February 14, 2008.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Jorgenson answered, raising the statute of limitations as a defense. Stuard filed an Amended Complaint on December 10, 2008 and Dr. Jorgenson answered. Dr. Jorgenson filed a motion for summary judgment on February 17, 2009, arguing that the action was barred by the statute of limitations contained in I.C. \u00a7 5-219(4), which was granted by the district court. The court held that the action accrued at the time of the surgery because the ongoing presence of the herniated disk, and the other injuries from the surgery itself, were objectively ascertainable at that time, and therefore the action was barred. It also held that the foreign-object exception did not apply to the hardware installed at the wrong level, and even if it did, the action was still untimely because the Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial were not filed until February 14, 2008. Judgment was entered on July 14, 2009, and Stuard timely filed a notice of appeal. Stuard filed a Motion for Reconsideration arguing that the action was timely if the foreign-object exception applied because the filing of a Prelitigation Claim with the Idaho State Board of Medicine tolls the statute of limitations under I.C. \u00a7 6-1005.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court issued an Amended Memorandum Decision and Order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>limiting its holding regarding the foreign-object exception to the determination that it did not apply, and maintaining its other holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">III.Issues on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">1. Whether there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether \u201csome damage\u201d was \u201cobjectively ascertainable\u201d at the time the first surgery was negligently performed such that the action accrued at that time under I.C. \u00a7 5-219.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">2. Whether the locking plate and other hardware installed at the wrong spinal level constitute a \u201cforeign object\u201d under I.C. \u00a7 5-219, such that the discovery rule would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">IV.Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d I.R.C.P. 56(c). \u201cIf the evidence reveals no disputed issues of material fact, then only a question of law remains, over which this Court exercises free review.\u201d <em>Watson v. Weick, </em>141 Idaho 500, 504, 112 P.3d 788, 792 (2005). When there is conflicting evidence as to when the cause of action accrued, the issue is one for the trier of fact. <em>Id. </em>The statute of limitations is an affirmative defense and the defendant has the burden of establishing the elements necessary to establish the defense. <em>Hawley v. Green, </em>117 Idaho 498, 504, 788 P.2d 1321, 1327 (1990).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-10\">Within two (2) years ... An action to recover damages for professional malpractice, or for an injury to the person, or for the death of one caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another, including any such action arising from breach of an implied warranty or implied covenant; provided, however, when the action is for damages arising out of the placement and inadvertent, accidental or unintentional leaving of any foreign object in the body of any person by reason of the professional malpractice of any hospital, physician or other person or institution practicing any of the healing arts or when the fact of damage has, for the purpose of escaping responsibility therefor, been fraudulently and knowingly concealed from the injured party by an alleged wrongdoer standing at the time of the wrongful act, neglect or breach in a professional or commercial relationship with the injured party, the same shall be deemed to accrue when the injured party knows or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been put on inquiry regarding the condition or matter complained of; but in all other actions, whether arising from professional malpractice or otherwise, the cause of action shall be deemed to have accrued as of the time of the occurrence, act or omission complained of, and the limitation period shall not be extended by reason of any continuing consequences or damages resulting therefrom or any continuing professional or commercial relationship between the injured party and the alleged wrongdoer, and, provided further, that an action within the foregoing foreign object or fraudulent concealment exceptions must be commenced within one (1) year following the date of accrual as aforesaid or two (2) years following the occurrence, act or omission complained of, whichever is later. The term \"professional malpractice\" as used herein refers to wrongful acts or omissions in the performance of professional services by any person, firm, association, entity or corporation licensed to perform such services under the law of the state of Idaho. This subsection shall not affect the application of section 5-243, Idaho Code, except as to actions arising from professional malpractice. Neither shall this subsection be deemed or construed to amend, or repeal section 5-241, Idaho Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">V.Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b732-13\">\u201cAn action to recover damages for \u2018professional malpractice\u2019 must be commenced within two years after the cause of action has accrued.\u201d <em>Conway v. Sonntag, </em>141 Idaho 144, 146, 106 P.3d 470, 472 (2005); I.C. \u00a7 5-219(4).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The cause of action accrues \u201cas of the time of the occurrence, act or omission complained of\u2019 unless it is based upon leaving a foreign object in a patient\u2019s body or fraudulent concealment of damage. I.C. \u00a7 5-219(4). Fraudulent concealment is not alleged here. If the \u201cforeign object\u201d exception applies, the cause of action only accrues once the plaintiff \u201cknows or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been put on inquiry\u201d of the injury. I.C. \u00a7 5-219(4). Otherwise, \u201c[i]n most cases, the act or omission complained of and the injury to the plaintiff occur at the same time, particularly in the medical context.\u201d <em>Davis v. Moran, </em>112 Idaho 703, 708, 735 P.2d 1014, 1019 (1987). However, this Court has held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>there must be \u201csome damage\u201d before the action begins to accrue. <em>Lapham v. Stewart, </em>137 Idaho 582, 586, 51 P.3d 396, 400 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">A. The Action Accrued at the Time the First Surgery Was Negligently Performed Because \u201cSome Damage\u201d Was \u201cObjectively Ascertainable\u201d at That Time.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Assuming first that the \u201cforeign object\u201d exception does not apply, this Court has recognized that a professional malpractice action only accrues once there has been \u201csome damage.\u201d <em>Conway, </em>141 Idaho at 146, 106 P.3d at 472; <em>Streib v. Veigel, </em>109 Idaho 174, 178, 706 P.2d 63, 67 (1985). In <em>Davis v. Moran, </em>this Court stated that the damage must be \u201cobjectively ascertainable.\u201d 112 Idaho at 709, 735 P.2d at 1020. In that case, the Court explained that \u201cobjectively ascertainable\u201d means \u201cthat objective medical proof would support the existence of an actual injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 709 n. 4, 735 P.2d at 1020 n. 4.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Subsequent decisions by this Court have recognized that \u201c[t]he existence of \u2018objectively ascertainable injury<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is simply an analytical tool to be used in determining when \u2018some damage\u2019 has occurred.\u201d <em>Conway, </em>141 Idaho at 146-47, 106 P.3d at 472-73 (citing <em>Lapham, </em>137 Idaho at 587, 51 P.3d at 401). \u201c[T]he \u2018some damage\u2019 that has occurred must be damage that the client could recover from the professional in an action for malpractice.\u201d <em>City of McCall v. Buxton, </em>146 Idaho 656, 659, 201 P.3d 629, 632 (2009). Further, the statute makes clear that any \u201ccontinuing consequences\u201d of the act or omission do not extend the limitations period. I.C. \u00a7 5-219(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Stuard argues he did not suffer any damage until Aug. 31, 2006, the date of his second work-related injury, because he did not have any symptoms or knowledge of the negligence of Dr. Jorgenson until that time. The facts of this case are admittedly unique, in that neither party can explain why Stuard\u2019s symptoms subsided when his herniated disk injury was not correctly treated. However, this Court has made very clear that \u201c[w]hether there was some damage, or whether that damage was objectively ascertainable, does not depend upon the knowledge of the injured party\u201d because such dependence would effectively create a discovery rule, which the legislature has expressly rejected. <em>Lapham, </em>137 Idaho at 587, 51 P.3d at 401. Therefore, subjective knowledge of Stuard\u2019s injury is not relevant to the determination of when \u201csome damage\u201d occurred under Idaho\u2019s clear legislative direction and the case law following it. <em>See Chicoine v. Bignall, </em>122 Idaho 482, 487, 835 P.2d 1293, 1298 (1992). Stuard seems to equate \u201csymptoms\u201d with \u201cdamage.\u201d However, symptoms are by nature subjective, and therefore are not determinative in an \u201cobjective\u201d analysis such as the one this Court has stated is the standard for evaluating the accrual of a professional malpractice claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">In its decision, the district court noted the damages that occurred because of the negligent surgery, including the removal of healthy tissue and the installation of hardware at the wrong level. The fact that these injuries occurred was not disputed. There may have been additional consequences of Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s negligent surgery in the failure to recognize his mistake in his subsequent visits with Stuard, but the consequences from Stuard and Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s continuing relationship do not extend the lim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>itations period. I.C. \u00a7 5-219(4) (\u201c[T]he limitation period shall not be extended by reason of any continuing consequences or damages resulting therefrom or any continuing professional or commercial relationship between the injured party and the alleged wrongdoer.\u201d). The negligent act was the performance of the surgery at the wrong level. The injury was the removal of healthy tissue and installation of medical hardware at the wrong level. Idaho Code \u00a7 5-219 does not allow for a separate statute of limitation for each injury that occurs from the negligence, it allows for one cause of action that accrues once the act and injury have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Stuard argues in his brief that the lack of medical records in the evidence depicting that the surgery was negligently performed at the wrong level indicate that there was not some damage that was objectively ascertainable. The language of <em>Davis </em>defining \u201cobjectively ascertainable\u201d to mean \u201cthat objective medical proof would support the existence of an actual injury,\u201d means that the existence of the injury is capable of being objectively ascertained. <em>Davis, </em>112 Idaho at 709 n. 4, 735 P.2d at 1020 n. 4. To allow for accrual to begin only once the parties have been put on notice of the damage, or in other words, once the damage is actually \u201cascertained\u201d would effectively create a discovery rule, which the legislature has rejected. Dr. Jorgenson provided expert testimony in the form of a sworn affidavit that the injury was objectively ascertainable at the time of the surgery. He also stated in his deposition that because the surgery was performed at the wrong level, Stuard \u201chad the same pathology and same herniation at the T6-7 level as he had before.\u201d Stuard has not provided any conflicting expert testimony to state that the injury was not objectively ascertainable at that time, or that the negligence and ensuing injury to Stuard because of that negligence did not exist or would not have been discovered had an MRI been taken immediately following the surgery. According to the evidence in the record, the injury was thus \u201cobjectively ascertainable\u201d at the time of the surgery, because had objective medical proof in the form of an MRI been ordered, it would have shown the surgery was performed at the wrong level, and that Stuard had suffered damages as a result of its performance at the wrong level.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">Stuard suffered objectively ascertainable damages from the surgery itself. As shown in the documentation of the surgery, Stuard\u2019s back was cut into, healthy tissue was negligently removed, and a locking plate, screws, and other hardware were negligently placed at the wrong spinal level. Had Stuard\u2019s claim survived the motion for summary judgment and gone to trial, he likely would have asked for compensation for these damages from the negligent surgery.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, these damages satisfy the \u201csome damage\u201d standard. <em>Buxton, </em>146 Idaho at 659, 201 P.3d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">Therefore, the district court properly concluded that there was no genuine issue of fact that the cause of action accrued on July 15, 2004, the date of the negligently performed surgery. In its original decision, the district court failed to recognize that I.C. \u00a7 6-1005 tolls the statute of limitations \u201cupon the filing of a request for a prelitigation screening panel, during the time the claim is pending before the panel, and for thirty days thereafter.\u201d <em>Conway, </em>141 Idaho at 146, 106 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>P.3d at 472. Thus, in order not to be barred by the statute of limitations, the prelitigation screening request or the Complaint must have been filed by July 15, 2006. The prelitigation screening request was not filed until April 2, 2007, and the Complaint was not filed until February 14, 2008. Therefore, Stuard\u2019s claim for medical malpractice is barred. While this application is indeed harsh given that Stuard did not himself know the operation was negligently performed, his arguments are better to be taken up with the legislature in the adoption of a discovery rule for all medical malpractice claims. This Court has no power to create such a rule by judicial fiat. The statute and this Court\u2019s ease law, as it stands, are clear that the statute of limitations accrues once some damage that is objectively ascertainable occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">The Dissent likens this case to this Court\u2019s application of the \u201csome damage\u201d rule in two legal malpractice cases, <em>Chicoine </em>and <em>Buxton. </em>However, the financial injuries suffered as a result of the alleged legal malpractice in those cases are distinguishable from the personal injury suffered as a result of the medical malpractice in this case. In <em>Chicoine, </em>the Court found that Chicoine could not have suffered any damages as a result of the lawyer\u2019s negligence in not timely filing a motion for new trial until this Court reversed the district court\u2019s grant of the motion for new trial, because the grant of the new trial insulated Chicoine from any damages caused by the untimely filing. <em>Chicoine, </em>122 Idaho at 487, 835 P.2d at 1298. Essentially, no injury had been caused by Chicoine\u2019s lawyer\u2019s malpractice so long as Chicoine was assured of a new trial, and therefore he could not yet have suffered any damages as a result of the negligence. Had the grant of the motion for new trial never been reversed, Chicoine would not have been able to bring his legal malpractice claim. In <em>Buxton, </em>the Court held that \u201cthe existence or effect of any alleged negligence on the part of the City\u2019s Attorneys regarding their legal advice and strategy depended upon the outcome of the litigation against the City\u201d that was brought as a result of that bad advice. 146 Idaho at 663, 201 P.3d at 636. The Court reasoned that \u201cit would be difficult to conceive of a situation in which the City could have recovered on a malpractice claim against its Attorneys had the City prevailed in the litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662, 201 P.3d at 635. Basically, should the City have won those lawsuits it would have had no injury as a result of the bad legal advice under which to bring a negligence claim. The case at hand is distinguishable from both of those cases because an injury occurred immediately as a result of the medical malpractice of Dr. Jorgenson: the opening of the body by incision, the removal of otherwise healthy tissue and the installation of hardware at the wrong level. Stuard had a medical-malpractice claim for these injuries and the damage from them as soon as the negligent surgery occurred. His claim thus accrued at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">B. The Locking Plate and Other Hardware Installed During Surgery Do Not Constitute a Foreign Object Under I.C. \u00a7 5-219 Because They Were Intentionally Left in Stuard\u2019s Body.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">Stuard argues that the locking plate and other hardware installed into Stuard\u2019s spine at the wrong level constituted a \u201cforeign object\u201d under I.C. \u00a7 5-219. The foreign object exception contained within I.C. \u00a7 5-219 provides that the discovery rule will apply to the \u201cplacement and inadvertent, accidental or unintentional leaving of any foreign object in the body of any person.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 5-219(4). Under the discovery rule, the statute of limitations would only accrue once \u201cthe injured party knows or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been put on inquiry regarding the condition or matter complained of.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">The locking plate and other hardware are not a foreign object because they were intentionally left in Stuard\u2019s body. In the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Ogle v. De Sano, </em>107 Idaho 872, 693 P.2d 1074 (CtApp. 1984), the court found that an I.U.D.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> was not a foreign object because it was \u201cintentionally placed in a woman\u2019s body with her consent, ... has a continuing medical function, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>... will be removed when its function is no longer needed.\u201d 107 Idaho at 875, 693 P.2d at 1077. Therefore, the court reasoned, I.C. \u00a7 5-219(4) excludes from the definition of foreign objects \u201csuch devices deliberately placed in the body, with the patient\u2019s knowledge and consent, which are within the body intentionally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Idaho Code \u00a7 5-219, by its very language, contemplates that the \u201cleaving\u201d of the object in the body must be \u201cinadvertent, accidental or unintentional.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 5-219. This Court accordingly adopts the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding in <em>Ogle </em>that a medical device which is placed in the body intentionally for the purpose of medical treatment is not a \u201cforeign object\u201d under the statute. <em>Accord Hall v. Ervin, </em>642 S.W.2d 724, 726-28 (Tenn.1982) (exception does not apply to an object which had been deliberately implanted in the body); <em>Hills v. Aronsohn, </em>152 Cal.App.3d 753, 199 Cal.Rptr. 816, 823-24 (1984) (substance or object that is intentionally introduced into the body for therapeutic purposes is not a \u201cforeign object\u201d); <em>LaBarbera v. N.Y. Eye &amp; Ear Infirmary, </em>91 N.Y.2d 207, 668 N.Y.S.2d 546, 691 N.E.2d 617, 620-21 (1998) (stent placed in body for medical purposes not a \u201cforeign object\u201d); <em>Goldsmith v. Houmedica, Inc., </em>67 N.Y.2d 120, 500 N.Y.S.2d 640, 491 N.E.2d 1097, 1098-99 (1986) (prosthetic device implanted in patient\u2019s hip not a \u201cforeign object\u201d); 61 Am.Jur.2d <em>Physicians, Surgeons, Etc. </em>\u00a7 302 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">This Court\u2019s prior decisions regarding the \u201cforeign object\u201d exception also support the view that the object must be negligently <em>left </em>in order for the exception to apply. <em>See Billings v. Sisters of Mercy, </em>86 Idaho 485, 497-98, 389 P.2d 224, 232 (1964) (gauze sponge inserted during surgery negligently left there); <em>Stoner v. Carr, </em>97 Idaho 641, 642-44, 550 P.2d 259, 260-62 (1976) (surgical needle negligently left in patient\u2019s abdomen); <em>Reis v. Cox, </em>104 Idaho 434, 438-40, 660 P.2d 46, 50-52 (1982) (fragment from a medical drain negligently left in body). The Court of Appeals noted in <em>Ogle </em>that in each of these instances, the \u201cforeign object\u201d was \u201cleft in the patient\u2019s body from previous operations.\u201d <em>Ogle, </em>107 Idaho at 875, 693 P.2d at 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Stuard argues that because the locking plate and other hardware were installed as a result of Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s negligence, they were \u201cinadvertently left.\u201d However, the statute and case law cited require that the inadvertence be in the <em>leaving </em>of the foreign object, not in the performance of the surgery. The statute already applies to malpractice cases, and thus every defendant under the statute will have already acted negligently, and the language of inadvertence in the foreign object exception in the statute would simply be redundant under Stuard\u2019s view. Dr. Jorgenson intentionally placed the locked plate and other hardware into Stuard\u2019s body and intentionally left it in his body. The fact that he acted negligently in placing them at the wrong level does not trigger the foreign object exception under the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Further, the hardware was placed into Stuard\u2019s body with his consent and for a medical purpose. While the hardware was not intended to be installed at the wrong level, it was intended to serve a medical purpose to fuse the spine together. Stuard has not included a copy of the informed-consent form in the record, and therefore we cannot speculate as to whether it contained limiting language as to his consent. He admits he consented to the surgery and to the placement of the hardware within his body for the medical purpose of fusing his spine and treating his herniated disk, albeit not at the wrong level. Therefore, this Court holds that the foreign object exception does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Neither party requests attorney fees on appeal and accordingly none will be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">VI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">This Court affirms the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Stuard\u2019s malpractice action accrued at the time of the surgery because some damage was objectively ascertainable at that time. Further, the \u201cforeign object\u201d exception does not apply because the locking plate and other hardware were intentionally left within the body for the purpose of medical treatment.

JONES, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ATc\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">I concur with Part V.B of the Court\u2019s opinion regarding the \u201cforeign object\u201d issue but dissent with regard to Part Y.A regarding the \u201csome damage\u201d issue. There are simply too many unanswered questions to make the determination that some damage was objectively ascertainable on July 15, 2004, when Dr. Jorgenson operated on Mr. Stuard (the \u201cfirst operation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Interestingly enough, both parties claim that Mr. Stuard sustained injury as a result of the first operation. Mr. Stuard asserts injury to support his claim for medical malpractice. Dr. Jorgenson asserts injury to support his statute of limitations defense. The parties dispute, however, whether the injury was objectively ascertainable as of the date of the first operation. Perhaps we should take the parties\u2019 claims of injury at face value and ignore contrary inferences that starkly appear from the record. Unfortunately, neither party has submitted competent sworn testimony to support their respective positions. Therefore, the Court is left with a rather skimpy record upon which to make its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Based on the slender record before the Court, there does appear to be a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Mr. Stuard suffered an injury at the time of the first operation. Mr. Stuard did not go to Dr. Jorgenson simply to have an operation at the T6-7 level of his spine. Rather, he went to Dr. Jorgenson because he was experiencing pain. The operation performed by Dr. Jorgenson, even though it may have been performed at the wrong level, appears to have alleviated that pain. Therefore, without competent evidence to so indicate, it cannot be conclusively assumed for the purposes of summary judgment that Mr. Stuard suffered an injury at the time of the operation. Nothing in Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s deposition testimony explains what damage resulted from the operation. He does not assert that another operation was necessitated by virtue of what he did or did not do in the first operation. At the deposition he testified \u201cAs a consequence [of the operation], [Mr. Stuard] still had the same pathology and same herniation at the T6-7 level as he had before. And that\u2019s what I believe is causing his current symptoms.\u201d We do not know what Dr. Jorgenson means by \u201ccurrent symptoms\u201d since his deposition was taken on September 19, 2008, and Mr. Stuard was operated upon at T6-7 by Dr. Tyler Frizzell on March 21, 2007. We do know that Mr. Stuard was in the same condition with respect to T6-7 after the first operation as he was before that operation. There is no competent evidence in the record to establish that Mr. Stuard suffered an injury by leaving T6-7 in the same condition it was in prior to the first operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">Neither party has addressed the issue of how Dr. Jorgenson could have performed the first operation without concluding that something was amiss. In other words, if the MRI taken prior to the operation disclosed a disk protrusion at T6-7, wouldn\u2019t Dr. Jorgenson have been somewhat surprised to find no disk damage when he was actually performing the operation? Could he have had no suspicion at that time that he may have blundered? Of interest is the fact that Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s operative report, detailing what occurred during the operation, indicates that after the disk was removed, \u201ca moderate sized fragment of disk was encountered and removed---- There was additional calcified disk in this area. This was slowly removed ... until it appeared to be flat.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The fact that Dr. Jorgenson actually removed a piece of fragmented disk and some calcified disk from the T5-6 level, even though it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>the intended level, could very well be the reason that Mr. Stuard\u2019s pain was alleviated by the operation. It would be reasonable to infer on summary judgment that Dr. Jorgenson actually performed a service to Mr. Stuard by repairing the disk at T5-6, even though by accident. It is difficult to infer that Mr. Stuard suffered injury from the operation simply because the operation was done on the wrong area when it did, in fact, relieve his symptoms. Nothing in the record indicates that Mr. Stuard would have needed additional medical treatment for his initial pain symptoms had he not sustained a second injury that resulted in the discovery that the first operation was apparently performed in the wrong place.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Furthermore, the only evidence in the record regarding the injury Mr. Stuard allegedly suffered on the date of the first operation is the self-interested and conclusory testimony of Dr. Jorgenson himself. In his affidavit, Dr. Jorgenson states that the operation resulted in objectively ascertainable injury without explaining exactly what that injury might be. The sum total of affidavit testimony on the issue reads, \u201cThe operation ... caused objectively ascertainable injuries and some damages ...\u201d The affidavit preparer was obviously familiar with the language of the medical malpractice cases, if not the rule requiring facts, instead of conclusory statements, in a summary judgment affidavit. I.R.C.P. 56(e); <em>Dulaney v. St. Alphonsus Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>137 Idaho 160, 164, 45 P.3d 816, 820 (2002) (In a medical malpractice ease, statements that are conclusory do not satisfy either the requirement of admissibility or competency under Rule 56(e)). Dr. Jorgenson goes on to state that his operative report sets forth the injuries and damages caused by operating at the wrong spinal level. However, nothing in the operative report explains what injury occurred by virtue of the operation. In fact, as mentioned above, the operative report indicates that Dr. Jorgenson took steps during the operation that could have resulted in Mr. Stuard\u2019s pain being alleviated.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s argument that there may have been some healthy bone and flesh removed during the operation does not establish that there was an injury. As a matter of fact, there is no competent evidence in the record to support this contention. Dr. Jorgenson gave no testimony in this regard. He merely states that the \u201cinjuries and damages\u201d are set forth in his operative report, leaving it to the Court to ponder the report and speculate what might or might not have been injurious. Indeed, there is no testimony in the record explaining how what was done or not done in the first operation might have been injurious or the cause of damage to Mr. Stuard. Neither is there any testimony indicating that the second operation by Dr. Frizzell was necessitated as a result of the first operation. The only document in the record indicating what occurred at the second operation is Dr. Frizzell\u2019s operative report which is attached to the affidavit of Mr. Stuard\u2019s attorney. The report was not prepared by the attorney, it makes no mention of the first operation and, without foundation or authentication, the report is mere inadmissible hearsay. For all we know from the record, the second operation was necessitated by Mr. Stuard\u2019s second injury, which occurred on August 31, 2006, and had nothing to do with what did or did not occur in the first operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">While Mr. Stuard would have to prove an injury resulted from Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s negligence, if this case were to be remanded for trial,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether he suffered an injury at the time of the first operation, making summary judgment inappropriate on statute of limitations grounds at this stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Even if Mr. Stuard can be said to have sustained an injury at the time of the first operation, there is no credible evidence in the record suggesting that such injury was objectively ascertainable at that time. Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s testimony that the erroneous locale of the operation could have been objectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>ascertained by an MRI taken shortly after the operation is of questionable credibility because of the fact that Dr. Jorgenson himself could not ascertain the error the first two times he reviewed the MRI taken on September 20, 2006. \u201cSummary judgment is not proper where the depositions and affidavits raise any question as to the credibility of witnesses,\u201d and where the testimony of the witness is material. <em>J.R. Simplot Co. v. Bosen, </em>144 Idaho 611, 615, 167 P.3d 748, 752 (2006) (quoting <em>Athay v. Stacey, </em>142 Idaho 360, 368, 128 P.3d 897, 905 (2005)). Issues that turn on credibility should be reserved for determination by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Specifically, Dr. Jorgenson testified during his deposition that he reviewed the September 20 MRI online with Mr. Stuard during his visit on September 28, 2006. When Dr. Jorgenson was asked whether he \u201cnote[d], then, on September 28 that [his] surgery had been at the wrong level,\u201d Dr. Jorgenson answered \u201cno.\u201d When Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s counsel was asked during oral argument before this Court why Dr. Jorgenson could not tell from the MRI that the operation had been performed at the wrong level, counsel conceded he could provide no explanation. Dr. Jorgenson met with Mr. Stuard again on October 23, 2006. Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s notes from that visit state, \u201c[r]eview of [Mr. Stuard\u2019s] MRI does document a T6-7 disk protrusion as well as T7-8 foraminal disk protrusion off to the left.\u201d These notes indicate that the September 20 MRI results showed a protrusion at the site Dr. Jorgenson believed he had operated on and fixed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, when asked whether he realized during the second review of the MRI that his surgical procedure was performed at the wrong level, Dr. Jorgenson answered \u201cno.\u201d When confronted with this inconsistency at his deposition, Dr. Jorgenson stated, \u201c[i]n reviewing that note, I believe that\u2019s a typographical error. I believe what it should say is he had a T6-7 fusion____ Because I didn\u2019t discuss the level of the fusion.\u201d Therefore, although Dr. Jorgenson met with Mr. Stuard three times<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> after the September 20 MRI was taken, and reviewed the MRI at least twice, he testified he was still unable to determine that he had operated on the wrong level of Mr. Stuard\u2019s spine.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> According to Dr. Jorgenson, it was not until a nurse case manager, who had reviewed the radiologist\u2019s report with regard to the MRI,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> contacted him regarding the discrepancy in the levels that he was finally aware that he may have operated on the wrong level. Dr. Jorgenson then ordered another MRI, which he testified that he reviewed and was able to finally determine that he operated on the T5-6 level instead of the T6-7 level.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s testimony that Mr. Stuard\u2019s injury was objectively ascertainable from reading an MRI is certainly of questionable credibility because Dr. Jorgenson himself failed to ascertain the mistake at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>least twice from reading the September 20 MRI. The infirmities in Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s testimony lend themselves to the drawing of one of three reasonable inferences: (1) Dr. Jorgenson lacked adequate foundation to testify as to whether the injury was objectively ascertainable and his affidavit and deposition testimony should have been disregarded,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (2) he was qualified to make such a determination, but the injury was not truly objectively ascertainable; or (3) the injury was objectively ascertainable, but Dr. Jorgenson concealed the injury until found out by the nurse case manager.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Regardless of which of the three is true, summary judgment is not appropriate because the inconsistencies in Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s deposition testimony and affidavit raise a question as to his credibility. Dr. Jorgenson is certainly a material witness because his affidavit and deposition testimony are the only evidence in the record addressing whether the erroneous locale of the operation was objectively ascertainable.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Consequently, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Stuard, the evidence is insufficient to support a grant of summary judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">In my mind, there is an additional reason to decline affirmance of the summary judgment and that relates to the \u201csome damage\u201d rule that has evolved in medical malpractice eases. The some damage rule in medical malpractice eases is not consistent with the some damage rule in legal malpractice cases and the legal malpractice standard simply makes more sense. Some damage in the legal malpractice sense means ascertainable monetary damage resulting from injurious conduct on the part of the professional. In medical malpractice cases it has been interpreted to mean anything from some injury to the body, without regard to whether the same may be compensable in a damage suit, all the way to actual out-of-pocket monetary damages. Application of the some damage rule in medical malpractice eases is in stark contrast to the application of the some damage requirement in legal malpractice cases. There does not seem to be any logical reason for treating the some damage requirement differently in medical malpractice cases than in legal malpractice cases, which require objective <em>proof </em>supporting the existence of some compensable damage. For example, in <em>Chicoine v. Bignall, </em>an attorney defended Chicoine in a lawsuit that ultimately resulted in a jury verdict for damages against Chicoine. 122 Idaho 482, 482, 835 P.2d 1293, 1293 (1992). The attorney timely filed a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (J.N.O.V.), and later filed a motion for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>The district court granted the J.N.O.V. motion, but this Court reversed on appeal. <em>Id. </em>On remand, the district court considered and granted the motion for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>On appeal for the second time, this Court reversed the grant of the new trial on the ground that Chicoine\u2019s attorney had failed to timely file the motion. <em>Id. </em>Several months later, Chicoine brought an action for malpractice against his attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>ney. <em>Id. </em>Even though it was clear Chicoine\u2019s attorney had been negligent and that Chieoine had incurred attorney fees in defending the action after his attorney\u2019s negligent act of failing to timely file the motion for a new trial, this Court held \u201cthere was no objective proof of some damage to Chieoine until this Court reversed the order granting a new trial____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487, 835 P.2d at 1298. The Court noted that \u201c[ujntil then, the order granting the new trial, in effect, protected Chieoine from any damage. So long as the trial court\u2019s order stood, Chieoine was entitled to a new trial, despite the untimeliness of the motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, until a claimant has a definitive basis for seeking monetary damages, there is no accrual of the legal malpractice claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Similarly, in <em>City of McCall v. Buxton, </em>the City of McCall entered into a construction contract with St. Clair. 146 Idaho 656, 657, 201 P.3d 629, 630 (2009). St. Clair encountered various delays during the course of the construction, and the City concluded St. Clair was not in compliance with the terms of the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 658, 201 P.3d at 631. On the alleged advice of its attorneys, the City terminated its contract with St. Clair. <em>Id. </em>Wausau, which had issued a performance bond on behalf of St. Clair, hired a replacement contractor to complete the work pursuant to the contract. <em>Id. </em>The City concluded that the replacement contractor\u2019s work was deficient and, on the alleged advice of its attorneys, the City decided to withhold payment to Wausau for its replacement contractor and hire another contractor. <em>Id. </em>In December of 2001, Wausau sued the City for wrongfully withholding payment. <em>Id. </em>In January of 2002, the City began incurring expenses as a result of defending the Wausau action. <em>Id. </em>St. Clair later filed a cross-claim against the City. <em>Id. </em>After a trial on the merits of St. Clair\u2019s and Wausau\u2019s claims, a jury awarded damages against the City. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The City subsequently brought a malpractice action against its attorneys alleging, in part, that the attorneys negligently advised the City to terminate its contract with St. Clam and withhold payment from Wausau. <em>Id. </em>In reversing the district court\u2019s conclusion that these claims were barred by the statute of limitations, this Court held that \u201cunder the circumstances of this case, the existence or effect of any alleged negligence on the part of the City\u2019s Attorneys regarding their legal advice and strategy depended upon the outcome of the litigation against the City by Wausau and St. Clair. There would not be objective proof of actual damage until that occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663, 201 P.3d at 636. This was true even though the City was already well aware of conduct giving rise to a claim for professional malpractice and had already been incurring costs associated with defending the actions against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">These eases demonstrate that in the context of legal malpractice, the Court requires some actual, objective proof of monetary damage before the statute of limitations period is commenced. In <em>Chicoine, </em>the act of filing the late motion for a new trial was itself wrong. However, there was no objective proof that there was any monetary damage until the appellate court reversed the district court\u2019s grant of the new trial. In other words, the adverse court ruling against Chicoine demonstrated that some damage had occurred. In <em>Buxton, </em>even though it clearly appeared that the Buxton firm may have breached its duty to the City and even though the City was accruing costs associated with defending the resultant lawsuit, this Court was not willing to say some damage had occurred until a verdict was entered against the City. Until there was an actual finding that the City was monetarily liable to Wausau and St. Clair, there was only a potential risk that the attorney\u2019s actions would result in any damage to the City. Similarly in this case, there has been no credible testimony from a qualified doctor indicating that Mr. Stuard was damaged and that some remedial measures were necessary to repair that damage. Based on the lack of credible medical testimony we are left to speculate as to whether and when Mr. Stuard may have sustained a compensable injury. Therefore, I would hold that, pursuant to this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Chicoine </em>and <em>Buxton, </em>there must be some credible medical evidence demonstrating that some damage of a monetary nature \u2014 in this case, an injury to Mr. Stuard\u2019s body that <em>required </em>the outlay of monetary resources to repair \u2014 occurred be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>fore I would find that the statute of limitations begins to run in a medical malpractice action.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">This principle regarding some damage was applied by this Court in <em>Hawley v. Green, </em>117 Idaho 498, 788 P.2d 1321 (1990). In that case, Hawley received three chest x-rays between 1979 and 1983, each of which was reviewed by a different doctor. <em>Id. </em>at 499, 788 P.2d at 1322. Even though the x-rays revealed that Hawley had a tumor in her lower neck and chest area, each of the three doctors failed to diagnose it. <em>Id. </em>at 500, 788 P.2d at 1323. Hawley did not learn of the tumor until several years later when a different doctor diagnosed it after reviewing an x-ray of her chest. <em>Id. </em>After the tumor was surgically removed, Hawley learned the tumor was malignant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Hawley then filed a medical malpractice action against the doctors for negligently failing to diagnose the tumor. <em>Id. </em>The district court found that \u201csince Hawley\u2019s tumor was visible on the X-rays from 1979 through 1983, there was objectively ascertainable damage at that time, and the statute began to run no later than 1983____\u201d <em>Id. </em>On appeal to this Court, Hawley argued that because there was no evidence presented before the district court regarding whether the tumor was in fact malignant when the doctors failed to diagnose it, there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether damage occurred at that time. <em>Id. </em>at 503, 788 P.2d at 1326. This Court found that the statute of limitations had not expired, noting that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoF\">the record in the present ease does not contain any evidence to show that any damage was occurring at the time the defendants failed to diagnose Hawley\u2019s tumor. The only facts that are established and uneontroverted in this record are that the tumor was evident on the X-rays taken between 1979 and 1983. There is no evidence in the record one way or another concerning whether during 1979-83 the tumor was progressive, malignant, harmful or in any manner dangerous at this point in time. While we might speculate, as the district court apparently did, that the tumor was progressive, malignant, or otherwise dangerous, the record does not establish that as an uncontradicted factual matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 504, 788 P.2d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">This case is similar to <em>Hawley </em>because, just as there was no evidence establishing that the mere existence of the tumor was harmful to Hawley, there is no evidence here indicating that the mere fact that the surgery was done at the wrong level was harmful to Mr. Stuard. In fact, even though Dr. Jorgenson operated on the wrong level of Mr. Stuard\u2019s spine, Mr; Stuard\u2019s pain was alleviated and his symptoms were cured. Although this Court might speculate that Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s mistake of operating at the wrong level caused him some harm, there is no evidence in the record to establish that determination as an uncontradicted fact. For purposes of summary judgment, we are required to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of Mr. Stuard and, therefore, I cannot say there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Mr. Stuard suffered some damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">I would vacate the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Dr. Jorgenson and remand for determination of the unanswered questions that manifest themselves from the skimpy record before the Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b742-12\">Justice BURDICK concurs.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b737-9\">. During oral argument before this Court, Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s counsel was asked why Mr. Stuard\u2019s pain was relieved, even though the operation was performed at the wrong level. Counsel indicated that it was either because Mr. Stuard had not really been suffering pain, implying that he was malingering, or that the pain was alleviated by the placebo effect. He could offer no other reason. Apparently, it did not occur to him that the first operation resulted in the removal of disk material that may have been causing the pain from which Mr. Stuard was seeking relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b738-5\">. Presumably, he would have to either show that he suffered injury by virtue of Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s failure to remedy the alleged problem at T6-7 or that he suffered injury at T5-6 as a result of the operation performed at that level. Further, he would need to establish that the injury was objectively ascertainable within the limitations period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b739-5\">. Dr. Jorgenson originally planned to operate on the T6-7 level to repair Mr. Stuard\u2019s herniated disk, or disk protrusion, but he erroneously operated on the T5-6 level. As such, if the MRI truly did show, as Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s notes indicate, that there was still a protrusion at the T6-7 level, Dr. Jorgenson would have been on notice that there was still some herniation at the T6-7 level and the operation had actually been done at the T5-6 level. Curiously, Dr. Jorgenson claims this was a typographical error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b739-6\">. Dr. Jorgenson also met with Mr. Stuard on October 9, 2006. Neither the deposition testimony nor Dr. Jorgenson's notes indicate whether the MRI results were reviewed again during this visit, but Dr. Jorgenson testified that as of the October 9 visit, he was still unaware that the surgery had been performed at the wrong level.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b739-7\">. It is also worth noting that, according to Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s testimony, the several x-rays taken after the surgery showed only a portion of Mr. Stuard\u2019s spine and, therefore, \"he did not have the ability to count levels and to accurately assess the actual levels where the hardware was placed.\u201d However, Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s notes dated February 25, 2005, state \u201cPlain films taken in our office today show fusion at T6-7 level with an anterior plate.\" This statement in Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s notes, indicating that the level in which the fusion was located was discernible from the plain films, is in apparent conflict with his testimony that the levels could not be discerned from plain x-rays. This further demonstrates concern about Dr. Jorgenson\u2019s credibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b739-14\">.Dr. Jorgenson testified that although he reviews his own MRIs, he also uses a radiologist\u2019s interpretation of the MRI results. The record indicates that both Dr. Jorgenson and the nurse case manager reviewed the radiologist\u2019s report regarding the September 20 MRI, but for some reason that report is not in the record, nor was any testimony from the nurse case manager.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b740-5\">. Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e) provides that \"[s]upporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify about the matters stated therein.\u201d If two reviews of an MRI were not sufficient for Dr. Jorgenson to identify the error in the operation, even though a nurse reviewing the radiologist's report of the same images was able to discern the mistake, then Dr. Jorgenson was seemingly not competent to testify on the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b740-6\">. This latter inference may be supported, to an extent, by the fact that Dr. Jorgenson failed to indicate in his report of the operation his failure to find a disk protrusion at the level he was operating upon when he was actually inside of Mr. Stuard's back. Curiously, Mr. Stuard has not claimed that Dr. Jorgenson knowingly concealed the alleged mistake, which might have been a more convenient way to avoid the statute of limitations problem.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b740-9\">.Of interest is the fact that Mr. Stuard's attorneys filed a Plaintiffs\u2019 Expert Witness Disclosures on March 25, 2009, approximately a month and a half prior to the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, wherein they disclosed that their medical expert, Dr. Frizzell, who performed the second operation, was expected to testify that Mr. Stuard\u2019s \"damages and harm ... did not become objectively ascertainable ... until after he suffered a second on-the-job injury on or about August 31, 2006.\u201d This statement, of course, is not competent evidence and, indeed, was not offered in opposition to the motion for summary judgment. It is not clear why an affidavit from the expert was not obtained and produced in opposition to the summary judgment motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
