NATURE OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b261-28\">Gary Kazda applied for and was granted a conditional-use permit by the Nez Perce County Planning and Zoning Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>(the \u201cCommission\u201d) in order to develop a Tuscan Wedding and Event Center (\u201cEvent Center\u201d) on a five-acre parcel of land. Appellant Mary Krempasky, who lives near the parcel, challenged the Commission\u2019s decision in the district court. The district court affirmed the Commission\u2019s grant of the permit. Krempasky appeals to this Court, alleging several violations of I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">On July 22, 2008, Kazda filed an application with the Commission for a conditional-use permit (titled \u201cCUP-2008-3\u201d) to develop the Event Center on a five-acre parcel. Kazda also proposed building a home on the property, but the residence was not to be used in the commercial venture. The purpose of the Event Center was to hold weddings and other similar outdoor events. The application included, among other supporting documents, a narrative from Kazda describing the Event Center and its compliance with the Nez Perce County Comprehensive Plan Land Use Designation (the \u201cComprehensive Plan\u201d), as well as a traffic study comparison completed by Kazda\u2019s engineer which concluded that traffic would not be negatively affected by the Event Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Krempasky lives in a single-family residence located next to a residential subdivision directly adjacent to the proposed Event Center. Nez Perce County Planning and Building staff prepared a review of the application and a recommendation (the \u201cStaff Report\u201d). The Staff Report found that the Event Center met the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan and also met the criteria contained in Nez Perce County Ordinances 72cc and 72z,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and thus recommended that CUP 2008-3 be approved as a conditional use.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">A public hearing regarding the permit was held on September 16, 2008. Kazda and his engineer Brad Marshall both testified as to the compliance of the application with the Comprehensive Plan, and also discussed the issues of noise and traffic of concern to residents. Ten residents, including Krempasky, testified regarding their opposition to CUP 2008-3, particularly their shared concerns of noise and traffic. The residents provided no actual evidence to support these fears or concerns. Kazda and Marshall offered testimony in rebuttal, again speaking to the neighbors\u2019 concerns of noise and traffic, and answered questions from residents in attendance and from the Commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">The Commission then deliberated extensively based on the information contained in the Staff Report, the testimony in opposition, the testimony in favor, and the petition in opposition signed by forty residents, and voted unanimously to approve the application, but to lower the maximum decibel level from seventy-five to sixty-five in order to accommodate the concerns about noise. As required by Nez Perce County Zoning Ordinance 72z, and I.C. \u00a7 67-6535, a written version of the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law was prepared. An initial attempt to adopt them at a meeting on October 21, 2008 failed because a quorum was not reached, but the Findings and Conclusions were officially adopted at a special meeting of the Commission held November 10, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">On November 24, 2008, Krempasky filed an appeal of the Commission\u2019s decision to the Nez Perce County Commissioners, who subsequently held an administrative hearing pursuant to \u00a7 14.3(B) of Ordinance 72z. The Board reportedly decided not to accept jurisdiction of the case because the Commission had made its decision fairly. Krempasky filed a petition for judicial review to the district court on January 30, 2009, and after oral argument, the district court affirmed the grant of the permit and held that the decision of the Commission was not an abuse of discretion or based on unlawful procedure. Krempasky now appeals the decision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>district court, alleging the Commission violated I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">III.ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">1. Whether the decision to grant CUP 2008-3 prejudiced Krempasky\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">2. Whether the decision to grant CUP 2008-3 violated Krempasky\u2019s due-process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">3. Whether the decision to grant CUP 2008-3 was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">4. Whether the decision to grant CUP 2008-3 was made upon unlawful procedure or was not supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">5. Whether either party is entitled to attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">IV.STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">\u201cThe Local Land Use Planning Act (LLUPA) allows an affected person to seek judicial review of the approval or denial of a land use application, as provided for in the Idaho Administrative Procedures Act (IDA-PA).\u201d <em>Evans v. Teton Cnty., </em>139 Idaho 71, 74, 73 P.3d 84, 87 (2003); I.C. \u00a7 67-6521(1)(d). Krempasky is an \u201caffected person\u201d because she has \u201can interest in real property which may be adversely affected by the issuance or denial of a permit\u201d authorizing development. I.C. \u00a7 67-6521(1)(a). A local agency making a land use decision, such as the Planning and Zoning Commission, is treated as a government agency under the IDAPA. <em>Evans, </em>139 Idaho at 74, 73 P.3d at 87 (citing <em>Urrutia v. Blaine Cnty., </em>134 Idaho 353, 357, 2 P.3d 738, 742 (2000)). On appeal from a decision of the district court acting in its appellate capacity from an agency decision under the IDAPA, this Court reviews the agency record independently of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Stevenson v. Blaine Cnty., </em>134 Idaho 756, 759, 9 P.3d 1222, 1225 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-16\">However, this Court will not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact and will defer to the agency\u2019s findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>This Court also gives a strong presumption of validity to the zoning body\u2019s application and interpretation of its own zoning ordinances. <em>Evans v. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, </em>137 Idaho 428, 431, 50 P.3d 443, 446 (2002). The decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission will only be overturned if it violates a substantial right of a party and its findings: (a) violate statutory or constitutional provisions; (b) exceed the agency\u2019s statutory authority; (c) are made upon unlawful procedure; (d) are not supported by substantial evidence in the record; or (e) are arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3); <em>Price v. Payette Cnty. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>131 Idaho 426, 429, 958 P.2d 583, 586 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-19\">V.ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b263-20\">A. The Decision to Grant CUP 2008-3 Is Affirmed Because Krempasky Fails to Show Prejudice to a Substantial Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-21\">In order to prevail, Krempasky must show not only that I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3) was violated in one of the ways enumerated in the statute, but also that a substantial right has been prejudiced. I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(4); <em>Price, </em>131 Idaho at 429, 958 P.2d at 586. Krempasky only briefly addresses any prejudice to a substantial right, by alleging in a conclusory manner that her property rights have been prejudiced by the grant of the permit because of \u201cnoise, commercial traffic and a disproportionately large building in the residential area.\u201d However, she does not provide any applicable authority to support the allegation that these complaints constitute prejudice to a substantial right. She relies on <em>Lane Ranch Partnership v. City of Sun Valley, </em>145 Idaho 87, 91, 175 P.3d 776, 780 (2007), which holds only that an inability to properly access or develop one\u2019s land because of the denial of a permit prejudices a substantial property right. Further, the district court expressly found that Krempasky \u201chas not met the second prong of her burden, which is to show a substantial right of the Petitioner has been prejudiced by the granting of the permit,\u201d and Krempasky failed to challenge this finding on appeal. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>this Court need not review it. <em>Kirk-Hughes Dev., LLC v. Kootenai Cnty. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>149 Idaho 555, 558, 237 P.3d 652, 655 (2010). Krempasky fails to sufficiently allege how her substantial rights are prejudiced by the permit and thus this Court affirms the grant of CUP 2008-3 on those grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">B. Krempasky Waived Her Due Process Argument Because It Was Not Raised Below.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Krempasky argues that she was deprived of due process because the decision of the Commission to grant CUP 2008-3 was based on prejudgment bias. In particular, Krempasky argues that \u201call of the Planning and Zoning Commissioners had concluded that the conditional use application was going to be approved regardless of what the neighbors indicated\u201d at the public hearing. This Court has held that \u201c[djeeisions by a zoning board applying general rules or specific policies to specific individuals, interests or situations, are quasi-judicial in nature and subject to due process constraints.\u201d <em>Eacret v. Bonner Cnty., </em>139 Idaho 780, 784, 86 P.3d 494, 498 (2004) (citing <em>Cooper v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Ada Cnty., </em>101 Idaho 407, 411, 614 P.2d 947, 951 (1980)). Further, \u201c[bjias of a board member renders his participation in the due process hearing constitutionally unacceptable.\u201d <em>Eacret, </em>139 Idaho at 784, 86 P.3d at 498 (citing <em>Johnson v. Bonner Cnty. Sch. Dist. No. 82, </em>126 Idaho 490, 494, 887 P.2d 35, 39 (1994)). Here, Krempasky argues that the entire Commission was biased because it had already made its decision before the public had a chance to comment at the hearing. She states that comments made by the Chairman and individual Commission members \u201crise to the level of injecting into the process such a bias that Ms. Krempasky did not receive the process due.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Krempasky did not raise this due-process argument below, and the district court made no ruling on it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIt is well established that in order for an issue to be raised on appeal, the record must reveal an adverse ruling which forms the basis for an assignment of error.\u201d <em>Whitted v. Canyon Cnty. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, </em>137 Idaho 118, 121, 44 P.3d 1173, 1176 (2002) (citations omitted). \u201c[I]ssues not raised below but raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered or reviewed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122, 44 P.3d at 1177 (citations omitted). Thus, Krempasky waived this argument on appeal and this Court will not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">C. The Commission\u2019s Decision to Grant CUP 2008-3 Was Not Arbitrary, Capricious, or an Abuse of Discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">Krempasky argues that the Commission\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion under I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3). She argues that the Commission failed to exercise any discretion, and uses the same statements made by the Chairman and individual Commissioners regarding the application\u2019s compliance with the Comprehen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>sive Plan that she used in her due process argument above to support this argument as well. <em>See supra, </em>n. 2 (listing the comments). So long as the Commission \u201cperceived the issue in question as discretionary, acted within the outer limits of its discretion and consistently with the legal standards applicable to the available choices, and reached its own decision through an exercise of reason,\u201d it did not abuse its discretion. <em>Haw v. Idaho State Bd. of Med., </em>143 Idaho 51, 54, 137 P.3d 438, 441 (2006). Here the Commission recognized and exercised its discretion by allowing for evidence and testimony from both sides, and weighing that evidence and testimony in light of the goals of the Comprehensive Plan and requirements of Ordinances 72z and 72ce, before ultimately concluding that the application met the criteria required by the ordinances, and should be granted. While Krempasky and the other residents presented no actual evidence to support their fears and concerns regarding the Event Center, Kazda provided ample evidence in the form of reports and testimony from his engineer, as well as several other supporting documents Kazda attached to the application. The Commission properly exercised its discretion in weighing this evidence and determining that the application should be granted. The Commission also recognized and exercised its discretion in lowering the maximum decibel level that Kazda initially applied for from seventy-five decibels to sixty-five decibels to accommodate the concerns of the residents. Thus, this Court finds that the Commission did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Krempasky argues that the decision of the Commission was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission did not analyze and correctly apply the Comprehensive Plan to the application. She argues that the Comprehensive Plan does not allow for a commercial venture in a \u201ctransitional\u201d area. This Court has held that while requirements of applicable ordinances are binding on a body rendering a zoning or permit decision, a comprehensive plan is not. <em>Urrutia v. Blaine Cnty., </em>134 Idaho 353, 357-58, 2 P.3d 738, 742-43 (2000). A comprehensive plan reflects the \u201cdesirable goals and objectives, or desirable future situations\u201d of the use of land. I.C. \u00a7 67-6508. \u201c[A] comprehensive plan does not operate as legally controlling zoning law, but rather serves to guide and advise the governmental agencies responsible for making zoning decisions.\u201d <em>Urrutia, </em>134 Idaho at 357-58, 2 P.3d at 742-43. The purpose of the Comprehensive Plan here is \u201cto guide future growth in a manner consistent with the reasons people enjoy living and working in Nez Perce County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Here, the parcel in question was located in a \u201ctransitional\u201d zone under the Comprehensive Plan. The Comprehensive Plan states that \u201ctransitional lands\u201d are designated for \u201cmixed-use\u201d and to provide opportunities for \u201cresidential locations near employment, shopping and city services.\u201d The Commission did not act arbitrarily or capriciously because it discussed at the public hearing the other types of commercial ventures in Nez Perce County located in similar areas to the proposed Event Center, and how those ventures had impacted the community. The Commission properly used the Comprehensive Plan as a guide, and was not bound by the \u201cresidential\u201d language contained in its designation for transitional lands. \u201cTransitional lands\u201d are set up for mixed-use, and thus it was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion to find that the Event Center was still in line with the general purpose stated in the Comprehensive Plan. Further, the Commission found that the Event Center met the specific Land Use Goal # 3 of the Comprehensive Plan, \u201c[t]o provide for areas of human habitation and commercial activity in ways that will restrain urban sprawl, protect the human and natural environment, and insure adequate support by public facilities.\u201d As required by this Court\u2019s precedent, the Commission \u201cextensively reviewed the comprehensive plan, considering both the positive and negative aspects of [the] proposal ... [i]n the end, the [Commission] determined that the proposed use was harmonious and in accordance with the comprehensive plan.\u201d <em>Whitted, </em>137 Idaho at 123, 44 P.3d at 1178. Therefore, this Court finds the decision to approve the permit using the Comprehensive Plan as a guide was not arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>D. The Commission\u2019s Decision to Grant CUP 2008-3 was Based on Lawful Procedure and There Is Substantial Evidence in the Record to Support the Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Krempasky argues that the decision to grant CUP 2008-3 was based on unlawful procedure and not supported by substantial evidence because the Commission did not make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law, and rather just approved the findings and conclusions of the Staff Report. A finding of fact is \u201ca determination by a judge, jury, or administrative agency of a fact supported by evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>708 (9th ed., 2009). The Findings of Fact entered by the Commission on November 10, 2008, were supported by substantial evidence in the record, including the testimony taken by both sides at the public hearing, the Staff Report, the traffic and noise reports, and the other documents submitted along with the application. The Commission stated at the start of its Findings of Fact that it had \u201cconsidered as part of the record of the proceeding the entire record and file of the application for a Conditional Use Permit, and furthermore, considered any and all information, whether oral or written, that was received at the time and place of the public hearing presented by the Applicant or other interested persons.\u201d Thus, the totality of evidence considered by the Commission in support of its Findings and Conclusions was substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Krempasky also argues that because the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law were not entered simultaneously with the grant of CUP 2008-3 at the public hearing, but rather were adopted at a special meeting of the Commission on November 10, 2008, that this was an unlawful procedure. However, she cites no authority that states that the findings and conclusions must be entered simultaneously with the adoption, or that not doing so is unlawful. Rather, Ordinance 72z requires only that a decision made pursuant to the authority of the Ordinance, such as this one, shall include which ordinances and standards were used to evaluate the application and \u201cthe reasons for approval or denial, including the relevant criteria and standards of the Comprehensive Plan, the facts relied upon, and the rationale for the decision.\u201d Nez Perce County, Idaho, Ordinances, Zoning Ordinance 72z, at 61 (2008). Each of these requirements is properly included in the Commission\u2019s decision dated November 10, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">Further, the Commission followed lawful procedure in considering the mandatory criteria for a conditional-use permit. Under the Idaho Code, a conditional-use permit may be granted if the conditional use is \u201cpermitted by the terms of the ordinance\u201d and \u201cwhen it is not in conflict with the [comprehensive] plan.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-6512. Ordinance 72cc amends Ordinance 72z \u201cto allow commercial special events centers as a conditional use in all zoning districts,\u201d subject to the seven criteria contained within. Nez Perce County, Idaho, Ordinances, Zoning Ordinance 72cc, at 1 (2008) [hereinafter Ordinance 72cc].<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>While a decision to approve a permit is not required to strictly conform to a comprehensive plan, it must conform to the requirements of an applicable ordinance. <em>Urrutia, </em>134 Idaho at 358-59, 2 P.3d at 743-44. The Commission here properly followed the law in evaluating each criterion of the applicable ordinance, Ordinance 72z as amended by Ordinance 72cc, concluding that the application met each one, and further concluding that the application did not conflict with the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Krempasky also argues that the failure of the Commission to consider the home occupation provision of Ordinance 72z constituted unlawful procedure. However, under Ordinance 72z, in order for the home occupation provision to apply, the \u201cprofessional or commercial activity for financial gain\u201d must be \u201ccarried on within the residence.\u201d Ordinance 72z, at 9. Kazda stated that the residence to be built on the five-acre parcel would not be involved in the Event Center, and therefore the commercial activity would not be earned on within the residence. As a result, the Commission was correct in declining to address the home occupation provision. Thus, this Court finds that the decision to grant CUP 2008-3 was based on both substantial evidence and lawful procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">E. No Attorney Fees Are Awarded on Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Krempasky asks for attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117(1) as a prevailing party. Krempasky is not the prevailing party and even if she were, \u201cI.C. \u00a7 12-117(1) does not allow a court to award attorney fees in an appeal from an administrative decision.\u201d <em>Smith v. Washington Cnty., </em>\u2014 Idaho -, 247 P.3d 615, 2010 WL 5093625, at *3 (2010). Thus, no fees are awarded to her under that section. Nez Perce County requests an award of fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-121. A party can only be awarded attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121 in a \u201ccivil action.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 12-121. This is a petition for judicial review from an administrative decision and thus is not a civil action. <em>Goodman Oil Co. v. Scotty\u2019s Duro-Bilt Generator, Inc., </em>147 Idaho 56, 59, 205 P.3d 1192, 1196 (2009). Thus, no attorney fees will be awarded to Nez Perce County.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">This Court affirms the decision of the district court and upholds the grant of CUP 2008-3. Krempasky fails to show that her substantial rights have been prejudiced. She waived her due process argument by failing to raise it below. Further, the decision to grant CUP 2008-3 did not violate Krempasky\u2019s due process rights, was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion, and was based on lawful procedure and supported by substantial evidence. No attorney fees are awarded on appeal. Costs to the Respondent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b267-14\">Chief Justice EISMANN, Justices BURDICK, J.

Krempasky makes no claim that Kazda\u2019s application should have been considered under the previous version of the ordinance, which did not provide for event centers, and we therefore express no opinion on the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-6\">. The first comment Krempasky points to in her brief was made by the Chairman in the context of the application meeting the criteria of the Comprehensive Plan. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">But if they meet it, and the sad part is that the comprehensive plan in this particular case doesn\u2019t fit well with the community around it. Having said that, we can't take a comprehensive plan, in my view, and put it together and put it out there for people to use and then when someone doesn\u2019t like it we go in and move the target and go, this is what we want you to do but when you get here we're going to move it over here. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a prudent thing to do, because that\u2019s what the comprehensive plan is there for. It\u2019s in writing. We\u2019ve all approved it here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The other comments she points to were made by unknown speakers. The first was in response to the Chairman\u2019s call to vote on the application once the Commission had finished deliberating on the noise issue. The speaker answered, \"Yes, I don't think we have much choice anyway,\u201d and another stated, \"I don\u2019t think we have much of a choice, honestly.\u201d However, immediately after those statements, the Chairman and Commissioners deliberated even further on possible ways to limit the sound and traffic while still staying within the guide of the Comprehensive Plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b264-14\">. Krempasky did not allege a due process violation in her Petition for Judicial Review.
