It was noticed to be tried before the court and a jury, and placed on the calendar; when it was reached in its order, the defendant did not appear. The plaintiff obtained an order, which recited the defendant\u2019s failure to appear, and directed the plaintiff\u2019s damages to be assessed by a jury before the sheriff. Such an assessment was made, and the defendant now moves that it be vacated, and the cause restored to its place on the calendar.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b660-9\">Bosworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXS\">An issue of fact, in an action for the recovery of specific personal property, \u201c must be tried by a jury,\u201d unless a jury trial be waived, as provided in section 266, or a reference be ordered, as provided in sections 270 and 271 of the Code. (Code, section 253.) Such issues must be tried before a single Judge, (section 254.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Fotice of trial must be given ten days before the term begins, (Id. section 256.) That having -been given, the party giving it may bring it to trial, when reached in its order on the calendar, (section 258.) If the notice of trial also expresses an intention to take an inquest, one may be taken at the opening of the court, on any day after the first day of the court. It must then be tried by a jury, before a Judge of the court, unless the plaintiff elects to treat the defendant\u2019s non-appearance as a waiver of the right to a trial by jury, and in such case it must be tried before the court. Probably no authority can be found for ordering a cause, in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>issues of fact are joined, to be tried by a sheriff\u2019s jury. (2 R. S. 409, \u00a7\u00a74, 5, 6, 7, 8; id. 419, \u00a753.)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The assessment of damages by the sheriff\u2019s jury must be vacated, and the cause restored to its place on the calendar.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
