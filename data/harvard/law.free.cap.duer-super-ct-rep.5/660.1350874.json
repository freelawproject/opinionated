It then proceeds thus:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-9\">\u201c And this defendant further says, that on or about the 20th of October, 1856, the said plaintiffs, without the knowledge or consent of the defendant, took and appropriated to their own use eighty-seven and a half gallons of whiskey, belonging to this defendant, of the value of $2.75 per gallon, which this defendant claims to offset against the plaintiff\u2019s claim herein, and also five gallons of gin, worth.the sum of $1.50 per gallon, and this defendant denies that he is indebted to the plaintiffs in any sum or amount, wherefore he demands that the complaint herein be dismissed, with costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-10\">The plaintiff moves to strike out this part of the answer, as \u201cirrelevant and redundant,\u201d because it is not matter constituting a counterclaim, or a defence, either total or partial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b668-11\"><em>George O.

(Code, section 152.) The fact that the plaintiffs wrongfully took and converted to their own use property of the defendant, constitutes a good cause of action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>As a defence is irrelevant, because it cannot be made available in this action, it does not give a right of set-off. (2 R. S., 354, \u00a7 32, sub. 1.) It does not create a demand arising on contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">It does not constitute a counter-claim, because it does not arise out of contract, nor out of the transaction set forth in the complaint, as the foundation of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, nor is it connected with the subject of their action. The motion must be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
