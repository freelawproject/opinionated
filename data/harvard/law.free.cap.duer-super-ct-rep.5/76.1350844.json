The plaintiff covenanted to instruct one of the. defendants in the art of manufacturing porcelain and incorruptible teeth, and to furnish him with his recipes therefor. The agreement also contained the following clause: \u201cAnd the party of the first part will not carry on, or cause to be carried on by any person with whom he shall be interested, the manufacture of porcelain teeth, or impart the knowledge of manufacturing the same to any person, other than as aforesaid.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b84-6\">It was alleged, in the complaint, that the said art of manufacturing porcelain teeth, in which the defendant was to be instructed, was a secret of the plaintiff, and known to be such by the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b84-7\"><em>Held, </em>on demurrer, that the covenant in question was valid, and not one in restraint of trade.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b84-8\"><em>Quere, </em>as to the effect of one covenant, void, as against public policy, being united in the same instrument with a valid covenant ?</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b84-9\">Ruling of the judge at, Special Term, that, ordinarily, it will not vitiate the whole contract, not passed upon by the court at General Term.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b84-10\">(Before Dueb, Boswobth and Slosson, J.J.)</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b84-11\">October term, 1855.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-12\">The case arose upon an appeal from an order of Justice Hoffman at Special Term, overruling a demurrer to a complaint, and giving judgment against the defendants, unless they should answer and pay costs within twenty days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-13\">The statements of the complaint, and the points raised, are fully set forth in the opinion of the Judge at Special Term, which is as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-14\">The questions arise upon an agreement, dated the twenty-ninth day of December, 1853, made between the present plaintiff and defendants. By that agreement, the plaintiff engaged to sell to the defendants \u201call his right, title and interest, in the manufacture and sale of porcelain or mineral teeth hitherto held by him in the city of New York, with all his porcelain teeth contained in the d\u00e9p\u00f3ts, with the moulds, machinery, and materials used in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>nection with such manufactory, and also the good-will of the business,\u201d upon the terms therein specified. The good-will was estimated at the sum of $8,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-5\">The mill and materials, including biscuit teeth, were to be inventoried at theiz actual \u25a0 cost; the othez tools and fixtures, at fifty per cent, below their cost: all the stock and merchantable teeth, at fifty per cent, below their then retail prices, viz., pivot and plate teeth ten cents each, and gum teeth twenty cents each.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-6\">The periods and amounts of the payments are then specified. And it was covenanted, that the sale of the good-will of the business, tools, fixtures, and materials, should not be perfected, nor a bill of sale therefor executed, until the payment of $10,000; and of the first-mentioned instalment, agreed to be paid on or before the thirty-first of July, 1854, various particulars, as to the mode of payment, are there stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-7\">The instrument contains the two following clauses\u2014\u201c and it is further agreed by the parties hereto, that the party of the first part shall, from the 2d day of January next to the 31st of July, 1854, give directions and instructions to Adrian Giberton, one of the parties of the second part, in the art of manufacturing porcelain, or incorruptible teeth, and also his receipts for the fabrication of the same, and that the party of the first part, will allow and permit the said John Binsse, the other party of the second part, to be present at the tuition of the said Adrian Giberton in the art of manufacturing the teeth as aforesaid, and that the said party of the first part will not carry on, or cause to be carried on by any person with whom he shall be interested, the manufacture of porcelain teeth, or impart the knowledge of manufacturing the same to any person other than as aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-8\">The amended complaint contains the following passage, which was not in the original complaint\u2014\u201c and the said plaintiff avers, that the mode of manufacturing the said porcelain teeth, mentioned in the agreement aforesaid, in the art of manufacturing which the said plaintiff agreed to instruct the said defendant, Giberton, and the manufacture of which, in and by said agreement, the said plaintiff agreed not to carry on, or cause to be carried on by any person with whom he should be interested, and the knowledge of manufacturing which teeth, said plaintiff, in and by the same agreement, stipulated not to impart to any person other than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>said defendant, was a secret with the said plaintiff, and the said defendant knew it was when said agreement was made.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\">The want of an allegation of this nature is understood to have been the ground of the allowance of the demurrer to the original complaint. It was supposed that it did not sufficiently appear on the face of the instrument that a secret was disposed of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-6\">With the present allegation, the case appears to be a very plain one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-7\">The cases of <em>Bryson </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>(1 Sim. &amp; Stewart, 74,) and <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jarvis, </em>(10, p. 118,) seem decisive. Here is the sale of a business secret, and an engagement by the vendor not to use that secret in conducting any business himself. The validity of this covenant is to my mind clear. See, upon the subject of such covenants generally, <em>Ramine </em>v. <em>Irving, (7 </em>Marn. &amp; Graing, 976,) and <em>Mullan </em>v. <em>May, </em>(11 Meeson &amp; Welsby, 633.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-8\">The case presents another question which was adverted to by the Chancellor in <em>Jarvis </em>v. <em>Peck. </em>I had decided that case as Assistant Vice-Chancellor, (see Hoffman\u2019s Reports, 497,) and placed the decision on the ground that there was a large consideration for the bond, entirely independent of the covenant supposed to be in restriction of trade. ' The Chancellor, upon the appeal, notices some cases in support of this view, but deemed it unnecessary to pass upon it. (See 10 Paige, 119.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-9\">In the present case, the consideration was a sale of the good-will, which the parties estimate at $8,000, and of the stock of materials and tools, as well as of teeth already made, of a large, though unascertained value. The question is, whether, if the particular covenant is void, the contract may not still be sustained upon these considerations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-10\">In addition to the numerous authorities cited in the opinion in Hoffman\u2019s Reports, and those referred to by the Chancellor, the following may be <em>noticed:\u2014Oheseman </em>v. <em>Naseby, </em>in the House of Lords, (1 Br. P. C. 234,) settled that a bond given by a hired servant or apprentice, not to exercise the trade of a linen draper after the expiration of her time of service, at any place within half a mile from the dwelling house of the party, or any other house, she should remove to, was valid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-11\"><em>Price </em>v. <em>Green, </em>(16 Meeson &amp; Welsby, 347,) applied the same principle to a covenant, and determined that where the covenant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>was not to practice .the trade of a perfumer in London or \"W est-minster, or within six hundred miles from the same respectively, the covenant was void as to the latter clause, but good as to the cities. In this case, the distinction is noticed betwen void and illegal covenants. The stipulation as to the six hundred miles was of the former class. The fact was also adverted to, that the whole covenant, doubtless, formed the consideration for the payment of the \u00a31,500, the amount given; but it was answered, that the rest of the restriction formed a sufficient consideration for the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-5\">This decision followed and supported that of <em>Mullan </em>v. May, (11 Meeson &amp; Welsby, 643.) In this case, the doctrine upon these covenants in restraint of trade, is stated and explained by Baron Parke, as carefully as in any case of which I am aware. The chief test is, whether the contract will be prejudicial or not to the .public interest. It was held in the case, that a covenant that the party should not carry on the business of a surgeon-dentist in London was valid, but the further restriction, \u201cor in any of the towns or places in England or Scotland, where the plaintiffs, or the defendant, on their account, might have been practicing before the expiration of his service,\u201d (as an assistant,) was void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-6\">It cannot be questioned that in many cases much difficulty must attend the application of this doctrine. In the present case, for example, probably the principal consideration of the contract was the agreement to abstain from carrying on the business, or instructing others in it. If this is void, and cannot be enforced, it would be hard to sustain the contract on the ground of the other portions of the consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-7\">This view was considered by Baron Parke in <em>Price </em>v. <em>Green, </em>before stated, and the rule of that, and the many other cases seems to be, that if a sufficient valuable consideration remained, after rejecting the illegal one, to support the contract, the court would enforce it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-8\">On both grounds, I am of opinion that the demurrer must be overruled, and judgment be rendered for the plaintiff upon the same, with liberty to answer in twenty days.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-9\">Jordan, for the appellants and defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-10\">Archer, for the respondent and plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Aau\">We concur in the decision of the Judge at Special Term overruling the demurrer, and giving judgment for the plaintiff. We consider that he is clearly right in the first point stated in his opinion, viz., That the covenant not to use the secret mode of conducting the business, or manufacturing the teeth, was valid in itself. We do not find it necessary to consider the other important question raised by the learned Judge, as to the effect of a union in the same instrument, of a covenant prohibited by law, or against public policy, with another of a perfectly valid character, and express, therefore, no opinion upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Order affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
