This action was called in its order on the calendar, and the plaintiff arid the defendants who had appeared in the action, submitted their proofs.\" The action is brought by the plaintiff, against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>three defendants, to compel the specific performance of their joint contract, to purchase land of the plaintiff, and pay a part of the price on the day fixed for the delivery of the deed, and secure the balance by their bond, and by their mortgage of the premises in question, payable at a future day. That day had not arrived, at the time of the trial. On its being discovered that only two of the defendants had appeared in the action, and that the third had neither appeared, nor been served with process, the Judge suggested his doubts, whether the action was in a condition to be tried, and to admit of a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, which could be enforced. Opportunity was given to the counsel of either party to refer the court to authorities on the subject.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b675-5\">E. <em>S. Vanwinkle and H. S. </em>Cowdrey, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b675-6\"><em>D. </em>E. <em>Wheeler, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b675-7\">Bosworth, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Arz\">on a subsequent day, held, that the action is not in a condition to be tried. The defendant, who has not appeared, or been served, is not before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">A judgment that he execute such a bond and mortgage as the contract calls for cannot, rightfully, be rendered, nor enforced, as against him, if rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">A complete determination of the controversy cannot be had, without the presence of the third defendant. Service of a summons upon him, or his appearance in the action is indispensable. (Code, \u00a7 122.)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">The trial which has been had must be treated as a nullity. The defendant, who has not been, must be served with process. When the action is in a condition, as against all the defendants, to be tried, it must be regularly noticed for trial, and be tried, as if no attempt to try it had been made.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
