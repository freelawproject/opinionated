The question presented is whether the imposition of a conservatorship without a finding of incompetency deprives the conservatee of the capacity to contract. We conclude that, subject to the limitations of Probate Code section 1858, it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">On August 25, 1967, defendant Ralph Davis, Jr., petitioned for appointment as conservator of the estate of Ralph Davis, Sr. The petition alleged that Davis, Sr., was over the age of 80 and unable properly to care for his property, a sizable estate with a net worth of $1.8 million. The court appointed defendant as a temporary conservator, and on October 25, 1967, named a committee of five, including defendant, as permanent conservators. The temporary conservatorship continued until the court issued letters of conservatorship for the five committee members on January 15, 1968. The petition did not allege, nor did the court find, that Davis, Sr., was either insane or incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Davis, Sr., was a graduate and former director of the Wisconsin Mining School, now the Wisconsin State University-Platteville. On January 6, 1968, he attended a stadium fund raising dinner in Platteville, Wisconsin at which time he signed a written agreement pledging $150,000 on a matching basis, for construction of a stadium for his alma mater.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereupon the university, unaware that Davis, Sr., was a conservatee, widely publicized the pledge in order to solicit matching contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">On September 10, 1968, the conservators filed in the probate court a petition for an order to show cause why the conservators should not be instructed to rescind the pledge, but, on September 21, 1968, before the petition could be heard, Davis, Sr., died. The court appointed defendant as executor of the estate. Representing the Wisconsin State University<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Platteville, plaintiff filed a claim in probate for $150,000, and upon defendant\u2019s rejection of the claim, commenced the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Defendant filed a demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s complaint, contending in part that the mere existence of a conservatorship deprived the deceased conservatee of the capacity to enter into a pledge agreement.  The trial court overruled the demurrer; defendant then moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the complaint failed to state a cause of action for the reasons set forth in the demurrer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court denied that motion. Defendant then renewed his motion for judgment on the pleadings, alleging that the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in <em>Place </em>v. <em>Trent</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 526 [103 Cal.Rptr. 841], filed August 29, 1972, after denial of the original motion, required the court to grant the motion.  The trial court granted the renewed motion, entering judgment on the pleadings in favor of defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Prior to 1957, a petition for guardianship presented the only procedure available for a party to assume administration of the estate of an adult unable to manage his affairs (Prob. Code, div. 4). Except in the case of minors, a guardianship requires both allegation and proof of the insanity or incompetency of the proposed ward. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1460.)  A ward under a guardianship lacks the capacity to enter into a contract <em>(Hellman Commercial T. </em>&amp; <em>S. Bk. </em>v. <em>Alden </em>(1929) 206 Cal. 592, 608-609 [275 P. 794]).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Believing that the stigma of the label \u201cincompetent\u201d discouraged persons unable to conduct their affairs from seeking appointment of a guardian, the State Bar of California recommended, and the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>established, the new protective relationship of conservatorship. These efforts resulted in 1957 in the addition to the Probate Code of a fifth division, consisting of sections 1701 through 2207 (Stats. 1957, ch. 1902, \u00a7 1) establishing probate conservatorships.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The legislative history<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> indicates that both the State Bar and the Senate Judiciary Committee intended that the new relationship achieve two major objectives. The first was the establishment of the conservator-ship as an alternative to guardianship to avoid, as we have noted, the \u201cstigma\u201d of the label \u201cincompetency.\u201d In such a situation a conservator is merely another linguistic designation for a guardian.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The second objective of the new statute was to extend its embrace to those who would otherwise find themselves without legal protection.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>The Legislature achieved this objective by providing that the court could appoint a conservator for a person who was neither insane nor incompetent, but who, for a variety of other reasons, needed direction in the management of his affairs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, clearly, the Legislature designed the conservatorship statute to cover a much more extensive category of eligible persons than the more limited guardianship law.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">In view of the fact that the Legislature sought to accomplish by its conservatorship structure both the avoidance of the stigma of incompetency and the inclusion of a wider class, we must decide whether the Legislature intended that the conservatee who had not been adjudicated incompetent should nevertheless lose his capacity to. enter into a contract. Although <em>Place </em>v. <em>Trent, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.3d 526, held that in this respect the conservatee could not be distinguished from the ward in his inability to contract, we do not believe that the legislative history confirms this identity. As we shall show, this court has recognized a distinction between conservatee and ward; furthermore, we shall point out that section 1858 expressly upholds the conservatee\u2019s limited power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>to contract and, finally, that the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5000 et seq.) likewise recognizes such restricted power of the conservatee.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">In our past treatment of the present problem we have linked the incapacity to contract under Civil Code section 40 with an adjudication of incompetency. Thus in <em>Hellman Commercial T. &amp; S. Bk. </em>v. <em>Alden, supra, 206 </em>Cal. 592, we held that a ward\u2019s incapacity to contract stems from Civil Code section 40 which reads, as amended, in pertinent part, \u201cSubject to Sections 1561 and 1910 of the Probate Code, and subject to Part I (commencing with Section 5000) of Division 5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code after his incapacity has been judicially determined, a person of unsound mind can make no conveyance or other contract, nor delegate any power or waive any right, until his restoration to capacity....\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n                   As we explained, when \u201ca court has regularly adjudged one to be incompetent, he thereby becomes incapable of making a valid contract, and it is deemed to be void, not because he is unable, unassisted, to properly care for his property, or lacked understanding of the nature and effect of the particular transaction, but because the decree of incompetency is notice to the world of his incapacity to make a valid contract.\u201d (206 Cal. at p. 604.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\"><em>Hellman </em>has accordingly determined that an adjudication of <em>incompetency </em>presupposes a lack of capacity to understand the nature and effect of a contract. (206 Cal. at p. 605.) Noting that Code of Civil Procedure section 1764 authorizes a court to appoint a guardian for a person who is either insane or incompetent, the <em>Hellman </em>court concluded that such an appointment is an adequate Adjudication of incompetency, and hence also of incapacity under Civil Code section 40. (206 Cal. at pp. 604-605.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">The argument that a conservatee lacks capacity to contract would necessarily, if it has any statutory source at all, stem from Civil Code section 40. Yet, inasmuch as <em>Hellman </em>holds that <em>it is the </em>finding of <em>incompetency </em>that serves notice of a person\u2019s incapacity under Civil Code section 40, conservatees who have <em>not </em>been adjudged incompetent should not be bound by that section\u2019s proscriptions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>The fact that a conservatee has at least a limited power to contract is further evidenced by the 1963 amendment to section 1858<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Stats. 1963, ch. 1549, \u00a7 1, p. 3132), which provides in part that \u201cThe conservator shall pay debts incurred by the conservatee during the conservatorship for the necessaries of life. ... The conservator shall pay any other debts incurred by the conservatee during the conservatorship only if they appear to be such as a reasonably prudent person might incur.\u201d This section quite clearly indicates that a conservatee retains power to contract, subject to the conservator\u2019s right to disaffirm unreasonable contracts other than those involving the purchase of necessaries which cannot be dis-affirmed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>\n                   This section also provides that if the conservator entertains any doubt as to the propriety of the debt he may petition the court for instructions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If all contracts of a conservatee, like those of a ward, were void, the protections of amended section 1858 would be totally unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Although defendant attacks this interpretation by urging that the term \u201cdebts\u201d in section 1858 should be construed to include only liability for \u201cnon-consensual\u201d debts such as tort and quasi-contractual obligations, we believe that such a construction of the statute is strained. Nothing supports the hypothesis that the Legislature intended so abnormal a restriction of a commonly used word.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (Welf. &amp; Inst, Code, \u00a7 5000 et seq.) also manifests the Legislature\u2019s recognition that conservatees retain a limited capacity to contract under probate conservatorships. Dealing with the mentally disordered person and chronic alcoholic, this act provides that such an individual may be placed under a conservatorship identical to those set forth in the Probate Code for conservatorships. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5350.) Implicitly recognizing a conservatee\u2019s right to contract, section 5357 provides that all conservators appointed under the act shall have all the general powers possessed by probate conservators and such additional powers, if any, that a court could grant under probate conservatorships. The section also provides: \u201cThe report [<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] shall also recommend for or against the imposition of each of the following disabilities on the proposed conservatee: . . . (b) The right to enter into contracts. The officer may recommend against the person having the right to enter specified types of transactions or transactions in excess of specified money amounts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">If all conservatees were already presumed incapable of contracting, clearly this provision would be inappropriate.  The provision cannot properly be read to mean, as defendant suggests, that a conservatee only retains a right to contract under sections 1861 (allowances) and 1910 (wages), which the court under the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act can then limit and restrict. This interpretation cannot stand because the court, under sections 1861 and 1910, already retains the discretion to limit and restrict the conservatee\u2019s right to dispose of those funds, if any. (See fn. 12, <em>supra.) </em>Thus the only natural interpretation of Welfare and Institutions Code section 5357 is that the conservatee does, indeed, have some right to contract, which is defined pursuant to the Probate Code, -and that under the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act this right may not be totally obliterated but only restricted by explicit judicial declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Finally, we do not accept defendant\u2019s contentions that recognition of-the conservatee\u2019s right to contract will frustrate the purposes of the Conservatorship Act and render unmanageable the administration of conservatorships. The fact that two persons co-manage property does not necessarily mean that the property thereby becomes unmanageable. Many types of relationships are premised upon co-management. (E.g., tenancy in common, joint tenancy, community property.) In some situations, in fact, the conservator will more likely play the role of supervisor rather than co-manager as in the case of a conservatee, not adjudged an incompetent, who has entered into reasonable contracts. The Legislature surely accepted the fact of co-management when it determined that a conservatee cannot totally be deprived of the right to contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Nor will our affirmation of the power of the conservatee to contract or cpnvey property, subject to supervision and review by the probate court, defeat the primary purpose of the conservatorship, i.e., a means to enable a competent person legally to assist the conservatee in the management of his property. <em>(Conservatorship of Stewart </em>(1969) 276 Cal.App.2d 211, 214 [80 Cal.Rptr. 738].) Since the transfer of property and the incurrence of contracts undertaken by the conservatee remain subject to supervision and review by the probate court (\u00a7\u00a7 1858, 1862), the .conservatee retains the protection of the conservatorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">In sum the scheme provides for a flexible and adequate protective relationship that enables the competent conservatee, who for some reason is unable properly to care for his property, to enter into a valid contract, upon the condition that it \u201cappear to be such as a reasonably prudent person might incur.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> If a proposed conservator harbors reservations about the proposed conservatee\u2019s competency he may simply ask the court to render a specific finding that the conservatee is a person \u201cfor whom a guardian could be appointed\u201d in order that this conservatee, like a ward, be incapable of contracting. (\u00a7 1751.) On the other hand, if a proposed conservatee is competent, no reason compels a total abolition of his right to contract,  We therefore disapprove language in <em>Place </em>v. <em>Trent, supra, </em>to the effect that a conservatee is necessarily incapable of making a valid contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Conservatorship is a modern legal mechanism conceived to meet a realistic human desire to avoid the stigma of incompetency; the courts should permit its plenary use, unimpaired by the debilitating interpretation that strips the competent conservatee of the limited power to contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The judgment is reversed. The case is remanded to the superior court with instructions to set aside its order granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Wright, C. J., McComb, J., Mosk, J., Sullivan, J., Clark, J., and Richardson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-8\">\u201cJanuary 6, 1968</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">\u201cI, Ralph E.

Conservatorships would be an alternative to guardianships in some instances and would provide the benefits of a conservator in certain others wherein guardianships are not now permissible. Many elderly or ill persons are reluctant to ask that a guardian be appointed to conduct their affairs because of the label of \u2018incompetent\u2019 which attaches to them under the present law. The proposed legislation, by eliminating all reference to \u2018incompetency,\u2019 seeks to overcome this reluctance. Various changes from guardianship proceedings are also made in procedure. . . .\u201d (Mull &amp; Farley, <em>1957 Legislative Progress </em>(1957) 32 State Bar J. 13, 23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In its report to the Senate the Senate Judiciary Committee distinguished conservator-ships from guardianships in the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">\u201cThe State Bar explained the purpose of the bill, as introduced, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">\u201cConservatorship</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">\u201cSenate Bill No. 1045 would add an entirely new division (Division 5) to the Probate Code, creating and defining the office of conservator and the concept of conservatorship.

Section 1460 reads, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201cAny superior court. .. may appoint a guardian for ... an insane or an incompetent person, who is a resident of this State. As used in this division of this code, the phrase \u2018incompetent person,\u2019 \u2018incompetent,\u2019 or \u2018mentally incompetent,\u2019 shall be construed to mean or refer to any person, whether insane or not, who' by reason of old age, disease, weakness of mind, or other cause, is unable, unassisted, properly to manage and take care of himself or his property, <em>and </em>by reason thereof is likely to be deceived or imposed upon by artful or designing persons.\u201d (Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">By contrast, the class of persons for whom a conservatorship may be established is much broader. Section 1751 identifies potential conservatees and reads in pertinent part: \u201c. . . the superior court . . . shall appoint a conservator of the person and property or person or property of any adult person who by reason of advanced age, illness, injury, mental weakness, intemperance, addiction to drugs or other disability, or other cause is unable properly to care for himself or for his property, <em>or </em>who for said causes or for any other cause is likely to be deceived or imposed upon by artful or designing persons, or for whom a guardian could be appointed under Division 4 of this code, or who voluntarily requests the same and to the satisfaction of the court establishes good cause therefore ....\u201d (Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Thus, while a person who is insane or incompetent would readily fall within the definition of a conservatee in section 1751, many of the other classes of persons for whom a conservatorship might be established are not at all to be regarded as either insane or incompetent. In <em>Hillman </em>v. <em>Stults </em>(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 848, 873 [70 Cal.Rptr. 295], the conservatee was .mentally competent. There the court held that the imprisonment or parole of a felon \u201cwith a consequent limitation of civil rights is a cause or disability within the meaning of the conservatorship law of 1957.\u201d In <em>Conservatorship of Stewart </em>(1969) 276 Cal.App.2d 211 [80 Cal.Rptr. 738], the court appointed a conservator for a conservatee with his consent because he had suffered a heart attack and, by reason of anticipated surgery, contemplated that he would be unable to continue his business during his recuperation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Probate Code section 1561 provides that the wages of an employed adult ward subject to a guardianship shall not be subject to the guardianship estate. Section 1910 contains a similar provision with respect to the wages of an employed adult conservatee. Welfare and Institutions Code section 5000 et seq. is the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, which provides for the involuntary detention of mentally disordered persons for evaluation and treatment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>objective of procedural clarity and does not touch the conservatee\u2019s powers. Code of /Civil Procedure section 372, relating to actions by persons under guardianship, was amended to provide that for the purposes of that section, \u201creference to \u2018incompetent person\u2019 shall be deemed to include \u2018a person for whom a conservator may be appointed.\u2019 \u201d That amendment was a part of a package of code amendments sponsored by the State Bar to revise and reconcile Probate Code sections 1431 and 1510 dealing with the compromise or other collection of litigated claims on behalf of minors and incompetent persons. (See 37 State Bar J. 585, 597 (1962); 38 State Bar J. 485, 500 (1963); <em>id. </em>780.) Since any money or property recovered by or on behalf of a conservatee should be collected and held by- the conservator, it was convenient and proper to classify conservators with guardians in those code sections. This 1963 amendment dealt only with the procedural problem there involved and did not affect the status of the conservatee in any other aspect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b82-10\">The 1963 amendment to Code of Civil Procedure section 372, providing that reference to an incompetent person includes the conservatee, rests upon the legislative</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Section 1858 reads in pertinent part as follows: \u201cThe conservator shall pay . . . any debts incurred by the conservatee before creation of the conservatorship; and he shall pay any debts incurred by th\u00e9 conservatee after the creation of the conservatorship, except that ability to continue to provide the conservatee with the necessaries of life, out of the estate, shall not be impaired. The conservator shall pay debts incurred by the conservatee during the conservatorship for the necessaries of life . . . and shall pay any other debts incurred by the conservatee during the conservatorship only if they appear to be such as a reasonably prudent person might incur.
