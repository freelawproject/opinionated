J.</author>\n<p id=\"Apc\">We issued an order to show cause in response to a petition for writ of habeas corpus prepared in propria persona by Frank Haygood, an inmate of the California State Prison at Folsom, alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>that the Department of Corrections and the Adult Authority had acted unlawfully in refixing certain of the terms to which he has been sentenced and in revoking credit for time served on another. Counsel was appointed for petitioner. His review of conviction and sentencing data relative to petitioner\u2019s confinement led him to conclude that additional issues should be raised on petitioner\u2019s behalf. By leave of the court a supplemental petition was filed and respondent Department of Corrections has replied to both the original and supplemental petitions, which we shall hereinafter refer to in the singular as the petition. We have concluded, based on the undisputed facts set out in the petition and the return thereto, that petitioner\u2019s terms as fixed by the Adult Authority (Authority) had been fully served prior to the date upon which the Authority last purported to extend them, and that notwithstanding any erroneous legal conclusions that may have influenced the Authority when it fixed those terms, petitioner is entitled to be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">In 1946 petitioner was convicted of escape in violation of Penal Code section 4532.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was sentenced to the term prescribed by law which was then a term of imprisonment not exceeding 10 years. It is undisputed that petitioner was discharged from this \u201coriginal\u201d term on June 29, 1953.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">On March 24, 1949, petitioner was convicted of five counts of forgery in violation of section 470. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of 1 to 14 years\u2019 imprisonment. These \u201cA\u201d terms<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were concurrent with the \u201cO\u201d (original) term and commenced on April 1, 1949, when petitioner was delivered to the custody of the Department of Corrections.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>On April 23, 1956, petitioner was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon in violation of section 12021. The o\u00edfense was committed while petitioner was serving his \u201cA\u201d terms on parole. He was sentenced to a term not exceeding five years. This \u201cB\u201d term, which was concurrent with the \u201cA\u201d terms, commenced April 25, 1956. Although its records reflect no discharge from the \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d terms, but instead indicate service of more than 23 years on the 14-year maximum \u201cA\u201d terms and 18 years on the 5-year maximum \u201cB\u201d term, before this court respondent concedes that the maximum duration of the \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d terms was approximately April 1963 and May 1961, respectively. The Department of Corrections and the Adult Authority should, therefore, correct their records accordingly to reflect petitioner\u2019s discharge from the \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">On or about December 21, 1958, however, while he was still serving the \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d terms, petitioner escaped from a prison camp and shortly thereafter participated in a robbery. He was prosecuted first for the robbery and on January 5, 1959, was convicted and sentenced to a term of not less than one year for violation of section 211. This \u201cC\u201d term, which was concurrent with the then uncompleted \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d terms, commenced January 8, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Petitioner then pleaded guilty to escape in violation of section 4531, which has since been repealed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Two prior convictions charged in the information\u2014the 1949 forgery and the 1956 concealed weapon convictions\u2014were stricken prior to the plea. He was sentenced on April 14, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In sentencing petitioner for the escape the court orally recited that \u201che be committed to the state prison for the term prescribed by law, the sentence to run at the time he would otherwise have been discharged.\u201d The abstract of judgment, which erroneously included the stricken prior convictions, properly reflected the oral pronouncement of judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>After printed language which read, \u201cIt is ordered that the sentences shall be served in respect to one another as follows,\u201d a section intended to apply only to sentences on multiple counts in the same judgment, the following typewritten entiy appears: \u201cSentence to commence at the time said defendant would otherwise have been discharged.\u201d Following the printed entry \u201cand in respect to any prior incompleted sentence(s) as follows\u201d a typewritten entiy states, \u201cSame as above.\u201d The instructions on the printed form direct the court to enter there its ruling on whether the new term is to be \u201cconcurrent or consecutive to all incomplete sentences from other jurisdictions.\u201d Notwithstanding the sentencing judge\u2019s use of the statutory language of section 4531 that the term commence when petitioner \u201cwould otherwise have been discharged\u201d from the terms he was serving at the time of the escape, i.e., the \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d terms, the Department of Corrections and'the Adult Authority treated the escape term as consecutive not only to the \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d terms that petitioner was serving at the time of his escape, but also to the \u201cC\u201d term for the robbery he committed <em>after </em>the escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">On October 8, 1970, after petitioner had served the maximum permissible number of years on the \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d terms, the Adult Authority fixed petitioner\u2019s \u201cC\u201d term at 10 years, and entered on its records an \u201cadministrative\u201d discharge of the \u201cC\u201d term retroactive to January 8, 1969, the date upon which he had completed service of 10 years on that term. At the same time the Authority fixed petitioner\u2019s \u201cD\u201d term at five and one-half years with a discharge date of July 8, 1974, and set a parole date of December 14, 1970. The Authority intended by this order to cause the \u201cD\u201d term to commence retroactively as of January 8, 1969, the date of the discharge from the \u201cC\u201d term.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The Authority suspended petitioner\u2019s parole on January 7, 1972. By operation of Adult Authority policies then in effect, that suspension automatically caused any incompleted terms to be refixed at maximum. On March 14, 1972, in conjunction with the formal revocation of parole, the Authority again fixed the \u201cC\u201d term at 10 years, and this time fixed the \u201cD\u201d term at 6 years with a January 8, 1975 expiration date. Petitioner was again released on parole, but on April 27, 1973, his parole was suspended, again causing his terms to be refixed at maximum. On December 13, 1973, parole was' formally revoked. His terms have not been refixed at less than maximum since that date. Although petitioner had served the period from January 8, 1969, to April 27, 1973, on his \u201cD\u201d term, the effect of refixing his \u201cC\u201d term at the life maximum, according to respondent, was to deny him any credit on the \u201cD\u201d term because that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>term could not commence until his discharge from the \u201cC\u201d term. Therefore, although 16 years have passed since petitioner was sentenced on the escape conviction, and even though he had once been given credit for service of over 4 years on that term, respondent now considers him to be serving only the \u201cC\u201d or robbery term. According to respondent, his \u201cD\u201d or escape term has not commenced. Thus petitioner, having once reached the goal of \u201cadministrative discharge\u201d from his \u201cC\u201d term, and having embarked on service of his \u201cD\u201d term, like Sisyphus finds himself back again at the beginning, destined to endlessly repeat his own odyssey through the term-fixing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Petitioner challenges his continued imprisonment and respondent\u2019s assertion of authority over him on several grounds, but the first is dispositive. He claims that the \u201cD\u201d term was consecutive <em>only </em>to the \u201cA\u201d (forgeiy) and \u201cB\u201d (concealed weapon) terms and was concurrent with the \u201cC\u201d (robbery) term. He argues that the order of the sentencing judge did not purport to make the \u201cD\u201d term consecutive to the \u201cC\u201d term, and that even had the judge attempted to order that the \u201cD\u201d term be consecutive to the \u201cC\u201d term, he lacked authority to do so. Following this theory he reasons that his \u201cC\u201d term expired on January 8, 1969, as determined by the Adult Authority action of October 8, 1970, fixing it at 10 years. Based on the action of the same date fixing his \u201cD\u201d term at five and one-half years, he reasons that this term, too, has expired since it commenced on the date he would otherwise have been discharged from the \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d terms he was serving at the time of the escape. Whether the \u201cD\u201d term commenced in 1963 upon expiration of the statutory maximum of fourteen years for the \u201cA\u201d term or in 1961 based on expiration of the eight-year \u201cA\u201d term and five-year \u201cB\u201d term that had been fixed by the Authority on October 6, 1958, and upon which expiration presumably he \u201cwould otherwise have been discharged\u201d need not be decided, since under either approach the five-and-one-half year \u201cD\u201d term which the Authority set on October 8, 1970, would have been served no later than 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Respondent contends that it continues to have jurisdiction over petitioner because he has not yet been discharged from either the \u201cC\u201d or the \u201cD\u201d term. Relying on <em>In re Cowen </em>(1946) 27 Cal.2d 637 [166 P.2d 279], and <em>In re Byrnes </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 843 [198 P.2d 685], it argues first that the \u201cD\u201d term is consecutive to the \u201cC\u201d term, and that since consecutive terms are considered to be a single, continuous term of imprisonment it was proper to refix petitioner\u2019s \u201cC\u201d term even after he had been \u201cadministratively discharged\u201d therefrom because he had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>yet completed the \u201cD\u201d term. Alternatively, respondent argues that if because the \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d terms are concurrent rather than consecutive, <em>Cowen </em>and <em>Byrnes </em>do not control, it still has jurisdiction over petitioner even though he had already served five and one-half years at the time the term was fixed in 1970 because the term was refixed at the life maximum on April 27, 1973, prior to the <em>expiration date </em>that had been set earlier.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Respondent further argues that even though petitioner had served the full term it had fixed, it nonetheless has jurisdiction over petitioner because when it fixed the \u201cC\u201d and. \u201cD\u201d terms at ten and five and one-half years respectively on October 8, 1970, it was under a misapprehension as to petitioner\u2019s legal status and did not intend to waive jurisdiction over him.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The Adult Authority is empowered to \u201cdetermine and redetermine\u201d (\u00a7 3020) the duration of the imprisonment of any person sentenced under the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law. (\u00a7 1168.) With regard to prisoners serving consecutive terms, section 3021 provides: \u201cWhen a prisoner has imposed upon him two or more cumulative or consecutive sentences, the Adult Authority may determine and redetermine after the expiration of six months of his first sentence, what length of time he shall serve on all such cumulative or consecutive sentences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Section 2940 also specifies, however, that: \u201cWhere the Adult Authority is authorized to fix and refix the term of imprisonment of a prisoner, such prisoner shall be discharged from custody upon the completion of said term so fixed or refixed and if the Adult Authority fails to fix the term of imprisonment the prisoner shall be discharged upon the completion of the maximum punishment provided by law for the offense for which the prisoner was convicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Respondent does not dispute petitioner\u2019s claim that by its express language section 4531 mandated that the term for escape commence \u201cat the time he would otherwise have been discharged,\u201d nor does respondent deny that in sentencing petitioner the court used the statutory language, or that petitioner was serving only the \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d terms at the time he escaped. Respondent concedes that section 4531 requires only that the escape term commence at the time of petitioner\u2019s discharge from the \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d terms. It is suggested, however, that the sentencing judge was not so limited because application of the mandatory consecutive term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>provision of section 4531 does not limit the court\u2019s power under section 669<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to order a term to be consecutive to any prior incompleted terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Even were we to assume that the sentencing judge, who used the language of section 4531 and made absolutely no reference to the robbery (\u201cC\u201d) term,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> intended that the escape term be consecutive to the robbery term, we could not adopt the construction of section 4531 suggested by respondent. The section, as does section 4530 now,, required that an escape term commence at the time the escapee would have been discharged from the terms he was serving at the time of the escape. It is impossible for such a term to begin both at that time and at another, later time when the prisoner has earned a discharge from a term imposed subsequent to the escape. The specific provisions of section 4531 must therefore prevail over the general provisions -of section 669. It was happenstance that petitioner was tried first for the robbery committed after the escape. Had he been convicted and sentenced for the olfenses in the order of their commission the question could not have arisen. In imposing the sentence for robbery the judge then could have ordered that the robbery term be consecutive to the escape term,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>w.ho sentenced petitioner for the escape had no more discretion to make the term consecutive to any term or terms other than those being served by petitioner at the time of the escape than he had to order that a mandatory consecutive term be concurrent with those terms. (See <em>In re Sandel </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 412, 416 [50 Cal.Rptr. 462, 412 P.2d 806]; <em>In re Shull </em>(1944) 23 Cal.2d 745, 749-750 [146 P.2d 417]; <em>In re Tinsley </em>(1960) 178 Cal.App.2d 15, 17 [2 Cal.Rptr. 642].)</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Apparently recognizing that it has misinterpreted the 1959 escape judgment, and that its treatment of the \u201cD\u201d term as consecutive to the \u201cC\u201d term has been erroneous, respondent asserts that since a prisoner has no right to a term fixed at less than maximum petitioner will not be denied due process if it is now permitted to refix the \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d terms because the prior discharge was inadvertent and it did not' intend to waive jurisdiction over petitioner. Alternatively respondent argues that it should be permitted to do so because petitioner had not completed serving the lS'A-year \u201ctotal term\u201d (i.e., the 10-year \u201cC\u201d (robbery) term and the S'/a-year \u201cD\u201d (escape) term), when the \u201cC\u201d term was refixed at life in 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Respondent\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. The Authority did not purport to fix a \u201ctotal term,\u201d nor does it have the power to do so. Terms are to be fixed individually. Respondent suggests that <em>In re Allen </em>(1965) 239 Cal.App.2d 23 [48 Cal.Rptr. 345], supports its claim that its lack of intent to waive jurisdiction may be considered in determining the effect of the 1970 action fixing petitioner\u2019s terms. There, however, the petitioner was undergoing consecutive terms. At a time when he had completed service of the first term (which had a statutory maximum of 10 years, as fixed by the Authority at 2 years and 9 months so as to establish a retroactive administrative discharge, and was serving the second term which had been fixed at the statutory maximum of 5 years), the court set aside the latter term on grounds that it violated the proscription of multiple punishment of section 654.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Before that time, however, petitioner had violated his parole and the Authority had refixed both terms at maximum. The petitioner argued that he was entitled to his immediate release since he had already been administratively discharged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>from the first term before it was r\u00e9fixed at maximum. The court rejected that claim holding that because petitioner had not yet served either the \u201ccontinuous term\u201d of seven years and nine months fixed by the Authority or the maximum term for either of the offenses at the time the Authority refixed his terms at maximum it had not lost its power to do so. As is apparent <em>Allen </em>does not hold that a lack of intent to surrender jurisdiction over a prisoner has any effect on the finality an order fixing a term acquires once the term <em>as fixed </em>has expired. <em>Allen </em>was predicated on the theory that consecutive terms constitute a single, continuous term of imprisonment and may be refixed at any time until the longest has expired or the statutory maximum has been served. <em>(In re Cowen, supra, </em>27 Cal.2d 637; <em>In re Byrnes, supra, </em>32 Cal.2d 843.)</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Respondent\u2019s further reliance on cases related to the relinquishment of physical custody to another jurisdiction in support of its assertion of further jurisdiction over this petitioner is misplaced. Those cases did not involve the term-fixing functions of the Authority or the statutory mandate of section 2940 that a prisoner be discharged upon the expiration of his term as fixed or refixed by the Authority. No exception to this mandate exists for actions taken under an erroneous interpretation of either the applicable law or the provisions of a judgment. Only if the discharge were unauthorized by law, as in the case of a prisoner undergoing a life sentence, could the Authority continue to assert jurisdiction. In other cases, once a term has expired, the Authority has no power to revive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Petitioner\u2019s \u201cC\u201d (robbery) term was fixed at 10 years on October 8, 1970. Since he had already served that length of time, and since he was not- serving a consecutive term, that action irrevocably terminated the \u201cC\u201d term as of January 8, 1969. On October 8, 1970, the Authority also fixed the \u201cD\u201d (escape) term at five and one-half years. Since the \u201cD\u201d term commenced upon expiration of the \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d terms, which occurred no later than March 24, 1963, the action of October 8, 1970, also terminated the \u201cD\u201d term and petitioner was entitled to be discharged from both terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">The writ is granted. Respondent is ordered to discharge petitioner from custody upon the finality of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">McComb, J., Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., Sullivan, J., and Richardson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Unless otherwise stated, all statutory references are to sections of the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b823-8\">For reference purposes, the Department of Corrections designates the term or terms under which a prisoner is first received as his original or \u201cO\u201d term.

In the cases specified in Sections 648, 667, and 668, the punishments therein prescribed must be substituted for those prescribed for a first offense, if the previous conviction is charged in the indictment and found by the jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>CLARK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aib\">I dissent from the majority\u2019s unwarranted interference with the Adult Authority\u2019s term-fixing discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The Legislature has conferred broad discretion on the Authority to fix terms of incarceration and parole on the merits of each case. <em>(In re Grey </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 554, 556 [114 Cal.Rptr. 104, 522 P.2d 664].) \u201cThe members of the Adult Authority presumably are selected for their, experience and expertise in the field of prisoner rehabilitation; the Authority\u2019s discretionary determinations are not to be lightly overridden.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">When the Authority had indisputable jurisdiction over petitioner for the rest of his life, it tentatively determined he should serve an additional three years and nine months in prison and on parole prior to discharge. The majority does not contend this determination constituted an abuse of discretion; in light of petitioner\u2019s dismal record, such a contention would be frivolous. Nevertheless, overriding the Authority\u2019s determination that this repeated felon and parole violator was not ready for release, the majority treats the Authority\u2019s action as retroactively discharging petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Because of petitioner\u2019s incorrigible conduct, the facts of this case are complex. But briefly: On 8 October 1970, the Adult Authority fixed petitioner\u2019s two life-maximum terms. Petitioner\u2019s \u201cC\u201d term (robbery) was fixed at 10 years, to run concurrently with his \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d terms, resulting in retroactive discharge of the \u201cC\u201d term on 8 January 1969. Petitioner\u2019s \u201cD\u201d term (escape) was fixed at five and one-half years, to run consecutively to his \u201cA,\u201d \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d terms. As the majority concedes, \u201cThe Authority intended by this order to cause the \u2018D\u2019 term to commence retroactively as of January 8, 1969, the date of the discharge from the \u2018C\u2019 term.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p. 807.)</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">The majority concludes the Adult Authority misconceived the legal effect of the \u201cD\u201d term. According to the majority, the \u201cD\u201d term was consecutive to the \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d terms, but not to the \u201cC.\u201d Under this theory, petitioner began serving an indeterminate sentence on the \u201cD\u201d term in either 1961 or 1963, rather than 1969. Accordingly, fixing the \u201cD\u201d term at five and one-half years in 1970 granted petitioner a retroactive discharge of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">However, the Authority clearly did not intend to retroactively discharge the \u201cD\u201d term. It intended to fix a term that would expire <em>in the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>future, five and one-half years after the \u201cC\u201d term expired in 1969. Although the Authority technically may have been unable to treat the \u201cD\u201d term as consecutive to the \u201cC\u201d term, it certainly had the power to establish a tentative discharge date for the \u201cD\u201d term by using as a reference point the discharge date fixed for the \u201cC\u201d term.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">I would deny the writ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
