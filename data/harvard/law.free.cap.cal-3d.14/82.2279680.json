(Pen. Code, \u00a7 1538.5, subd. (o).)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">In <em>Flack </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 981 [59 Cal.Rptr. 872, 429 P.2d 192], we considered whether seizure of motion picture film alleged to be obscene without a search warrant or prior judicial determination of obscenity violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Marcus </em>v. <em>Search Warrant </em>(1961) 367 U.S. 717 [6 L.Ed.2d 1127, 81 S.Ct. 1708], and <em>A Quantity of Books </em>v. <em>Kansas </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 205 [12 L.Ed.2d 809, 84 S.Ct. 1723],<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>concluded \u201cWithin the precinct of the First Amendment, only the requirement that a search warrant be obtained prior to any search and seizure assures a free society that the sensitive determination of obscenity will be made judicially and not <em>ad hoc </em>by police officers in the field.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) <em>(Flack, </em>at p. 992 of 66 Cal.2d.) We determined that \u201cwith the exception of a situation involving a legitimate emergency, even if the search is contemporaneous with an arrest, a search warrant must be secured prior to any search for or seizure of material alleged to be obscene \u201d (Fns. omitted.) <em>(Id. </em>at p. 991.)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The United States Supreme Court has recently reiterated these same principles. In <em>Roaden </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1973) 413 U.S. 496 [37 L.Ed.2d 757, 93 S.Ct. 2796], a county sheriff viewed a sexually explicit film at a local drive-in theatre, determined it to be obscene, and in the course of arresting the defendant seized a copy of the film as evidence. The court proceeded from the premise that \u201cA seizure reasonable as to one type of material in one setting may be unreasonable in a different setting or with respect to another kind of material. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(id </em>at p. 501 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 763].) Thus \u201cThe seizure of instruments of a crime, such as a pistol or a knife, or \u2018contraband or stolen goods or objects dangerous in themselves,\u2019 . . . are to be distinguished from quantities of books and movie films when a court appraises the reasonableness of the seizure under Fourth or Fourteenth Amendment standards.\u201d <em>(Id </em>at p. 502 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 763].) In applying the special rules governing seizure of allegedly obscene materials the majority reaffirmed the holdings in <em>Marcus, Quantity of Books, </em>and <em>Lee Art Theatre </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 636 [20 L.Ed.2d 1313, 88 S.Ct. 2103],<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and concluded: \u201cIf, as <em>Marcus </em>and <em>Lee Art Theatre </em>held, a warrant for seizing allegedly obscene material may not issue on the mere conclusory allegations of an officer, <em>a fortiori, </em>the officer may not make such a seizure with no warrant at all.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 506 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 766].)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The ease at bar is controlled by the dictates of <em>Flack </em>and <em>Roaden. </em>Defendants herein were engaged in a continuing enterprise involving the preparation and distribution of sexually explicit material. They were contacted at their permanent business office, the \u201cHollywood House of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Films,\u201d by Deputy Sheriff Young, who posed as a buyer seeking to acquire pornographic materials for his business in Hawaii. After the initial contact an appointment was arranged between defendant Freeman and Young. At this meeting Freeman stated to the officer, \u201cI have some good action films, sucking and fucking,\u201d and further informed him that the price of these creations was between $550 and $2,000 for one-hour, feature-length color sound films.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">While Freeman and the officer were discussing film, defendant Horne collected various samples for the buyer\u2019s perusal. Freeman handed the officer an album of still photographs, apparently containing memorable moments from some of the more explicit productions. Home arrived back at the office with a cart containing boxes of film, one of which was placed on a reel-to-reel viewer. At this point Horne told Freeman that he thought \u201cthere was some cops downstairs\u2014or hanging around downstairs.\u201d Freeman then told him \u201cto take the stuff back\u201d and Home left the office with the films and the hand cart.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">After Home\u2019s withdrawal the film on the viewer was played for Deputy Young. The film was run at three times normal speed and without sound, but these limitations did not appear to detract from the officer\u2019s ability to ascertain its central theme. After viewing the film the deputy concluded it was obscene, arrested Freeman, and seized the film and the album of still photographs. At a prearranged signal five or six other deputies entered the office and conducted a thorough search of the premises. Apparently the theory of each officer was, in paraphrase of Justice Stewart\u2019s pithy expression, \u201cI know it when I seize it.\u201d (See 4 Loyola L.Rev. (1971) 9, 52-65.)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">While these events were transpiring Home was taking the remainder of the film to an automobile parked outside the building. He placed the boxes in the trunk and back seat of the car, then \u201cdrove around in circles\u201d for 10 to 15 minutes. At all times he was under surveillance by officers stationed outside Freeman\u2019s office. Home then returned to the office and was himself arrested. The officers conducted a complete search of the car and seized the aforementioned film canisters from the trank and back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The evidence sought to be suppressed includes the film viewed by Deputy Young, the film seized from the car, and the album of still photographs. At no time was a warrant obtained for the seizure of any of these items.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>The People first seek to avoid the strict warrant requirement of <em>Flack </em>and <em>Roaden </em>with the contention that \u201cNo search warrant was required because of the defendant\u2019s admission that the material being pandered was obscene.\u201d In view of Freeman\u2019s representations to Deputy Young, it is urged \u201cthat whatever impartial judicial determination on the question of obscenity to which the defendant was entitled had been voluntarily waived by reason of his own conduct.\u201d The support for this novel proposition is said to be the cases of <em>People </em>v. <em>Burnstad </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 560 [108 Cal.Rptr. 247], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Golden </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 211 [97 Cal.Rptr. 476].</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><em>Golden </em>is clearly inapposite. There the issue was not the warrantless seizure of suspected obscene material but rather the legal sufficiency of the affidavit pursuant to which a warrant was issued by the intervening magistrate. The purported admission of the defendant during a clandestine transaction, coupled with other evidence of possession of obscene material with the intent to distribute, were held by a divided court to be sufficient to support the issuance of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">In <em>Burnstad </em>a warrant had also been obtained. There an undercover officer had viewed certain of the defendant\u2019s films and arranged a meeting in order to purchase them. Prior to the meeting a warrant was issued authorizing the search of two locations and the seizure of the films the officer had viewed. However, in executing the warrant the officer seized a number of films not named in the warrant. In upholding the validity of this latter seizure the court distinguished <em>Flack </em>on the ground that \u201cHere the defendant had himself placed the mark of contraband on the films. In all his dealings with Officer Dixon, defendant had pandered all of his films as \u2018hardcore\u2019 pornography.\u201d (32 Cal.App.3d at p. 565.)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">While a warrant was obtained in that case, to the extent that <em>Burnstad </em>can be said to stand for the proposition that the warrant requirement of <em>Flack </em>and <em>Roaden </em>is rendered unnecessary by a defendant\u2019s own pejorative characterization of the material it is hereby disapproved. Theatre marquees, billboards and newspaper advertisements all too often appeal to base instincts by making extravagant claims concerning the licentiousness depicted on movie screens, yet no serious claim could be made that mere suggestive or disparaging descriptions justify a warrantless seizure of the films.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Whatever reaction might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>evoked by defendant\u2019s inelegant assessment of content in the instant case, it is nonetheless clear that presumptively protected First Amendment material cannot be transmuted into contraband merely by the crude puffing of a seller who emphasizes its purported salacious features.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Nor does <em>Ginzburg </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 463 [16 L.Ed.2d 31, 86 S.Ct. 942], relied upon in <em>Burnstad, </em>compel a different conclusion. In <em>Ginzburg </em>the defendant went to extraordinary lengths to sell his publications on the basis of their prurient appeal, such as obtaining mailing permits from communities with sexually suggestive names and stressing in advertising circulars the erotic nature of the material. The Supreme Court held that in a close case evidence of commercial exploitation of erotica solely on the basis of its sensual appeal may be determinative: \u201cWhere the purveyor\u2019s sole emphasis is on the sexually provocative aspects of his publications, that fact may be decisive in the determination of obscenity. . . . [\u00b6]. . . [B]y animating sensual detail to give the publication a salacious cast, petitioners reinforced what is conceded by the Government to be an otherwise debatable conclusion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 470-471 [16 L.Ed.2d at p. 38].)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">That a defendant\u2019s characterization of his material in the course of an attempted sale may be considered ultimately by the trier of fact at an obscenity trial in no way compels a conclusion that an investigating police officer may regard these purported admissions as authority to dispense with the necessity to obtain a warrant. The issue of obscenity is a complex legal question, to be decided by judges and magistrates. Motion pictures, even those suspected of being obscene, are presumptively protected by the First Amendment and may not be seized by police officers without a judicial determination that there is probable cause to believe the subject material falls outside the purview of that amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">There is one narrow exception to this strict warrant requirement, the so-called \u201cemergency exception.\u201d In <em>Flack </em>we stated, \u201cWe conceive of a legitimate emergency arising in arrest situations involving a high probability that evidence may be lost, destroyed, or spirited away. The one-night surreptitious screening of a film at a locked-door \u2018stag\u2019 party may under appropriate circumstances justify seizure without a warrant.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>(66 Cal.2d at p. 991, fn. 10.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Roaden </em>the court noted, \u201cWhere there are exigent circumstances in which police action literally must be \u2018now or never\u2019 to preserve the evidence of the crime, it is reasonable to permit action without prior judicial evaluation.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) (413 U.S. at p. 505 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 765].) On the basis of this exception the People contend that even if a search warrant was required in the instant case the existence of \u201ca legitimate emergency\u201d excused its issuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">The exception under consideration is extremely limited, and the People must sustain a considerable burden in demonstrating its applicability.  Even in the ordinary case of a warrantless search this burden exists <em>(Badillo </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 269, 272 [294 P.2d 23]), but the First Amendment demands the most restrictive rules where the search relates to presumptively protected material. <em>(Flack, </em>at p. 991 of 66 Cal.2d.) Thus in order for the exception to be operative the People must show there was probable cause to believe the material was obscene and their opportunity for seizure was limited to \u201cnow or never.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In the instant case neither burden is met. The canisters of film seized from the car were never seen by any of the officers, and aside from Freeman\u2019s representations they had no inkling as to their contents. Serious doubts may be entertained as to whether this evidence would even be sufficient to support the issuance of a warrant. (See <em>Lee Art Theatre </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1968) <em>supra, </em>392 U.S. 636, 637 [20 L.Ed.2d 1313, 1315].) In addition, Freeman\u2019s operation was not the one-night surreptitious screening envisaged in <em>Flack </em>but rather a continuing enterprise replete with office, secretary, reception room, and all the trappings of a permanent business arrangement. There appears no reason why Deputy Young could not have viewed the films, presented a sufficiently detailed affidavit to a magistrate, and returned to Freeman\u2019s office armed with a warrant for their seizure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The People next seek to justify the warrantless seizure of the films from Horne\u2019s automobile on the rationale of <em>People </em>v. <em>Dumas </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 871 [109 Cal.Rptr. 304, 512 P.2d 1208]. The argument illustrates a misconception which pervades this entire area: the equation of presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>lively protected First Amendment material with ordinary contraband. In <em>Dumas, </em>the police had obtained a warrant to search the defendant\u2019s apartment and certain other areas under his control for stolen railroad bonds, bank checks and narcotics. The search of the apartment proved fruitless but the officers did find defendant\u2019s automobile registration and car keys. The automobile, parked in the street some 100 feet away from the apartment building, was then searched and stolen securities, a loaded revolver and some narcotics were found in the trunk. We recognized that \u201cThe warrant obtained by the police officers in this case does not support their search of defendant\u2019s automobile\u201d <em>(id </em>at p. 880), but nevertheless upheld the search , on the ground there was \u201cprobable cause to search defendant\u2019s automobile under unforeseeable circumstances in which the securing of a warrant was impracticable.\u201d <em>(Id </em>at p. 885.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">It is thus clear that two independent factors must coexist for the <em>Dumas </em>rationale to become operative: probable cause and exigent circumstances. Neither is present here. As discussed <em>ante, </em>the substantiality of Freeman\u2019s business operation rebuts the. contention that seizure of the film was a \u201cnow or never\u201d operation. It Is also apparent there was no probable cause to believe the film was obscene. If Horne\u2019s hand cart had contained narcotics or weapons, the officers arguably would have been justified in searching the automobile to recover this contraband. Instead the items seized were canisters of film, never viewed by any of the officers and still shrouded in the protective cloak of the First Amendment. As made abundantly clear in <em>Flack </em>and <em>Roaden, </em>this type of material can never be considered contraband absent a judicial determination that there is probable cause to believe the material falls outside the constitutional protection.  Accordingly, the seizure of the film in the automobile cannot be justified on any of the traditional Fourth Amendment exceptions relating to warrantless seizures of contraband, such as the \u201cplain view\u201d theory, the <em>Dumas </em>rationale, or the doctrine allowing limited search and seizure incident to arrest.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>The correct rule was stated in <em>Fixler </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 475 [113 Cal.Rptr. 285]. There the question was whether a warrant for the seizure of two specifically named magazines authorized seizure of apparently similar magazines not named in the warrant. The court stated, \u201cThe trial court held that the total seizure was lawful in reliance on cases (such as <em>Skelton </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 144 . . .) which allow the seizure of \u2018contraband\u2019 legitimately seen by officers while conducting a lawful search for other items. But we know of no authority that extends that rule to the seizure of matter which lies within the special protection of rules developed under the First Amendment. In fact, the cases which we have found hold that, where an item is sought which may turn out to be protected by the First Amendment, no seizure may be made without the express authority of a magistrate.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) (38 Cal.App.3d at p. 481.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">As the seizure in this case was unlawful the trial court was correct in suppressing the evidence.

None of the allegedly obscen\u00e9 materials was shown to the magistrate. Some 11,000 copies of 280 publications were seized, only one-third of which were actually found to be obscene. The Supreme Court ruled that the state procedure vested undue discretion in the officer and failed \u201cto focus searchingly on the question of obscenity.\u201d (367 U.S. at p. 732 [6 L.Ed.2d at p. 1136].)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-13\">In <em>Quantity of Books </em>a four-judge plurality invalidated a Kansas warrant procedure for failure to afford the defendants a pre-seizure adversary hearing on the question of obscenity.

The procedure was deficient in that there was no factual inquiry by a magistrate into the officer\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The facts of <em>Lee Art Theatre </em>may fairly be analogized to the instant case on this point. There the officer relied on the \u201crepresentations\u201d of the theatre billboard as well as his own observations to obtain a warrant, but the procedure was still held inadequate. Here, not only was no warrant obtained, but the officers never even saw the vast majority of film seized and here sought to be suppressed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The additional contention that Freeman in some way \u201cconsented\u201d to the search or waived his Fourth Amendment rights is spurious. No evidence was introduced to support this theory, nor was the case tried on that basis. Voluntary consent is a question of fact to be determined from the circumstances of the case (see <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte </em>(1973) 412 U.S. 218, 248-249 [36 L.Ed.2d 854, 875-876, 93 S.Ct. 2041]), and in the present record there appear no facts indicating any knowing relinquishment of constitutional rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\">It may be that the locked-door stag party for film viewing has become an anachronism. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Golden, supra, </em>20 Cal.App.3d at p. 219, fn. 3, Kaus, P. J., dissenting.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Although Freeman indicated to Deputy Young that he kept most of his film at another, unnamed location, the film would nave had to have been brought to the officer if the puqiorted sale was to be completed. Additionally, the officer could not legally have seized this unseen film even had he known its location, since there would be no probable cause to believe that it was not within the protection of the First Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The dissent argues that under the facts there were the requisite exigent circumstances. As to the <em>seen </em>film this argument is clearly unsound because this film never left Freeman\u2019s office. As to the <em>unseen </em>film, even assuming that in taking the film to Horne\u2019s car an exigent circumstance was created, it is apparent there was no probable cause to believe this particular film was not protected First Amendment material. Freeman\u2019s characterization of his inventory plus the \u201cillustrative\u201d film viewed by Deputy Young could no more lead to the conclusion that all the remainder of the film was obscene than could a random sampling of a single book of a bookseller characterizing his inventory as sexually explicit lead to the conclusion that all the unseen books in his store were obscene. (See fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>Indeed as <em>Marcus </em>and <em>Lee Art Theatre </em>demonstrate, these latter facts, if presented to a magistrate, would not even suffice to obtain a warrant. Our conclusion can thus be stated quite simply: as to the material for which there were even arguable exigent circumstances (the unseen film), there was clearly no probable cause; as to the material for which there was arguable probable cause (the seen film), there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>clearly no exigent circumstances. Moreover, in view of the permanence of Freeman\u2019s business operation and the fact that the unseen film would have to have been brought back at the time of sale to the undercover officer, whom Freeman continued to regard as a bona fide buyer, we are convinced there were no exigent circumstances even as to the film taken to Horne\u2019s car. (See fn. 8, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\">The high degree of suspicion with which we view purported exceptions to the warrant requirement is illustrated by the fact that neither this court nor the United States Supreme Court has ever sustained a warrantless seizure of presumptively protected First Amendment materials.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b133-6\">RICHARDSON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEJc\">I respectfully dissent. In the majority view the case before us is \u201ccontrolled\u201d by two decisions, <em>Roaden </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>413 U.S. 496 [37 L.Ed.2d 757, 93 S.Ct. 2796] and <em>Flack </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, 66 </em>Cal.2d 981 [59 Cal.Rptr. 872, 429 P.2d 192]. Both of these cases expressly, although in somewhat different phrasing, confirm that police officers may seize, without a warrant, movie films which they reasonably suspect are obscene if \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d exist which indicate that the films may be \u201clost, destroyed, or spirited away.\u201d (66 Cal.2d at p. 991, fn. 10; see, 413 U.S. at p. 505 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 765].) The record discloses that the officers in question had reasonable cause to believe that the films ultimately seized were obscene, and that exigent circumstances justified the seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>At the preliminary examination Deputy Sheriff Young testified regarding his initial telephonic contact with defendant Freeman and his visit by prearrangement with defendants at their office, \u201cHollywood House of Films.\u201d After Young\u2019s arrival and in his presence defendants Freeman and Home engaged in a brief conversation after which Horne left. When Young announced that the purpose of his visit was to acquire some \u201chard-core\u201d pornographic movie films, Freeman advised Young that he had some \u201cgood action\u201d films. The majority describes Freeman\u2019s further graphic characterization of the films. Freeman then handed to Young, and asked him to examine, an album containing still color photographs of a variety of sexual activities. The album contained pieces of paper including one designated \u201cRental Films.\u201d While Young was examining the album, Home returned to the office with a cart containing boxes of film, one of which was installed in a reel-to-reel viewer for Young\u2019s benefit. Before the film was viewed, Home told Freeman \u201cthat he thought there was some cops downstairs\u2014or hanging around downstairs.\u201d Freeman then inquired if Horne was sure, and when Horne nodded affirmatively, Freeman told Home to \u201ctake the stuff back\u201d at which time Home left \u201ccarrying some of the films together with the handcart.\u201d The film which Young then viewed depicted various forms of very explicit sexual activity. During the office visit, Freeman, in Home\u2019s absence, told Young that \u201che kept the films at another place; should the police come with a search warrant, they wouldn\u2019t find anything there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">While Freeman and Young were in defendant\u2019s office defendant Home came finder the surveillance of Deputy Sheriff McFee outside the building and was observed to move assorted film boxes from a 1969 Cadillac placing them in a handtmck and returning to the building which housed defendant\u2019s office. Five or ten minutes later Horne exited the same building with the same handcart and with \u201cmost of the film in boxes that were on there when he took them out of the Cadillac.\u201d Horne was seen to push the cart to a parked 1962 Chrysler, open the trunk put some of the \u201csilver cans\u201d in the trank and the boxes into the back seat. Then, according to McFee, \u201c[h]e jumped in the car and left hurriedly.\u201d Home then for ten to fifteen minutes drove the Chrysler, making \u201cseveral circles around several blocks,\u201d and returning to park approximately one-half block from where the car had been parked originally. Home then returned to the office followed by McFee.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">McFee was then told by Young that when Young first arrived at the office Horne came in with some items and that while he was there the other defendant told him to \u201cget this stuff out of here.\u201d Young also told McFee that he had placed both Freeman and Home under arrest. McFee then searched the Chrysler automobile with the use of keys given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>to him by Home and found approximately eight cardboard boxes in the rear seat. In the trunk McFee found three or four silver 16 mm. film cannisters and the handtruck. Before the seizure of the film, none of the officers had seen the film. However, it was stipulated for purposes of the hearing that the 50 reels of 8 mm. film which were introduced into evidence although of different subjects and taken at different times and places, were \u201csimilar in content and subject matter\u201d to the 16 mm. film exhibited to Young and to the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">From the foregoing rather extended factual recitation appearing in the record, I reach the following conclusions. First, Officer Young reasonably believed the films in question, containing as they did graphic illicit sexual activities, were obscene, both those which he viewed and those which were unviewed. Freeman\u2019s own characterization of them was clear and explicit. The sample album (Exhibit 1) furnished Young by Freeman, presumably as illustrative of defendant\u2019s inventory, confirms their general nature. The single film (Exhibit 2) which Young viewed amply reinforced his impressions. In the record the film\u2019s character both at the time of the meeting in defendant\u2019s office and subsequently, was established clearly and unmistakably.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Second, exigent circumstances existed which amply justified the officers in seizing the film in order to prevent its concealment or destruction. During his preliminary discussions with Young, Freeman told him that \u201che kept the films at another place; should the police come with a search warrant, they wouldn\u2019t find anything there.\u201d Shortly thereafter, when Horne alerted Freeman to the suspicion that he \u201cthought there was some cops downstairs\u2014or hanging around downstairs,\u201d Freeman immediately instructed Horne to \u201ctake the stuff back.\u201d Home then forthwith took the handcart containing all but one of the films selected for Young and left the room. He was then observed by McFee returning the film and placing them in a trank of an automobile which he immediately drove\" away in a manner described by McFee as \u201churried.\u201d Horne\u2019s route in the car was a random and erratic one and it extended over several blocks. Upon his return he parked the car in a different area. Given Freeman\u2019s original declaration as to his arrangements to store the film elsewhere so that searching officers armed with a warrant would be frustrated, Freeman\u2019s direction to Home to remove the material immediately when alerted that officers were near, and Home\u2019s immediate disappearance with the film, the conclusion seems reasonable to me that \u201cexigent\u201d circumstances existed which indicated that the film was in imminent danger of being \u201clost, destroyed, or spirited away.\u201d <em>(Flack </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d at p. 991, fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>The majority find significance in the fact that \u201cFreeman\u2019s operation , was ... a continuing enterprise replete with office, secretary, reception room, and all the trappings of a permanent business arrangement.\u201d Such an appraisal, in all deference, misses the mark. We are concerned with movie film. The film, either singly or together, did not constitute office fixtures. It could be easily moved and readily carried by hand. The majority\u2019s analogy to a film shown at a theatre is not apt. This was not a situation in which the film was being shown over an extended period at predictable and ascertainable hours to a public admitted regularly on payment of a charge. This was a different case. The setting here was surreptitious. The conditions were clandestine. Defendants transported the film to the premises in one automobile and returned the film in another, and that within a very short time span. In between the use of the automobiles, a small handcart was utilized. The fact that the films were exhibited in a well established office complete with secretary detracts not one xyhit from the fact that the film which is the subject of our inquiry, was readily movable. The <em>Roaden </em>court itself took judicial notice of this fact and also noted the importance of the circumstances surrounding the exhibition of the film. (413 U.S. at p. 505, fn; 6 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 765].) Both from.what he heard and saw Deputy Young had very clear signals from defendants that their precise intentions were to remove and \u201cspirit\u201d the film away and speedily so. They had the capacity to match their intentions and this capacity had just been graphically demonstrated. A secretary was present. The officers presumably did not know how many other employees were available to aid defendants in their design.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">While First Amendment protections affecting freedom of expression have been extended to motion picture films, <em>Roaden </em>and <em>Flack </em>nonetheless veiy expressly recognize the exception permitting seizure without warrant even of objects presumptively afforded First Amendment protection. The majority describe the exception as \u201cnarrow\u201d or \u201cextremely limited.\u201d Regardless, however, of its characterization the exception contains only two essential ingredients\u2014first, probable cause to believe the seized material was obscene, and second, exigent circumstances prompting a reasonable belief that the property seized is about to be moved beyond the reach of the officers. I suggest that on the record the. magistrate was fully justified in concluding that probable cause existed to believe that the material being seized was obscene and that a \u201clegitimate emergency\u201d existed involving, in the language of <em>Flack, </em>a \u201chigh probability that evidence may be lost, destroyed, or spirited away.\u201d (66 Cal.2d at p. 991, fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">I would go further. Even if we accepted the majority\u2019s assumption that the officers lacked probable cause to believe the film viewed by Young <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>would be \u201cspirited away,\u201d they certainly had such cause with respect to the film removed by Home. This film was brought by Horne to the office in one car, transported by him to and from the office by handcart and then deposited in the back seat and trunk of another car, after which it was then taken in a random odyssey. As we recently explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Dumas, 9 </em>Cal.3d 871, 884 [109 Cal.Rptr. 304, 512 P.2d 1208], an automobile may be subject to a warrantless search whenever \u201c(1) exigent circumstances rendered the obtaining of a warrant an impossible or impractical alternative, and (2) probable cause existed for the search.\u201d As hereinabove indicated, in my view, the first element was fully satisfied. In <em>Dumas </em>we stated that \u201c[p]robable cause for a search exists where an officer is aware of facts that would lead a man of ordinary caution or pmdence to believe, and conscientiously to entertain, a strong suspicion that the object of the search is in the particular place to be searched.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 885.) The second condition was abundantly satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">I would grant a peremptory writ of mandate to annul the order suppressing the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">McComb, J., and Clark, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
