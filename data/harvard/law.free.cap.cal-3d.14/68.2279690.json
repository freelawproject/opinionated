Code, \u00a7 11500). After defendant refused to accept the conditions of a five-year period of probation, the trial court imposed a prison sentence and directed that it commence upon completion of the term defendant was currently serving for another drug conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, defendant now contends that to so impose a consecutive sentence, after having offered him probation, constituted an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. In light of the defendant\u2019s lengthy history of narcotics abuse and anti-social behavior we do not believe that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>court acted arbitrarily or unreasonably. We therefore have concluded that imposition of a consecutive sentence was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Defendant was arrested in San Joaquin County for narcotics possession in April 1972. In July he appeared before the court and entered a plea of guilty. Criminal proceedings were then suspended in order to determine whether defendant was a narcotics addict. In October 1972 the court so found and defendant was committed to the California Rehabilitation Center for treatment. The following June defendant\u2019s commitment to that institution was cancelled<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and he was returned to the San Joaquin County Superior Court for resumption of criminal proceedings and pronouncement of judgment. At that time the trial judge stated that he was prepared to grant a five-year unsupervised probation upon various conditions, one of which was that defendant waive \u201cthe right of the service of a search warrant in search and seizure at any time of the day or night.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant refused, however, to submit to the search condition and stated that he would prefer a prison sentence. Thereafter the trial judge, defendant, prosecutor and defense counsel discussed the matter in open court. During the discussion the trial judge made clear that if defendant refused to accept the terms and conditions of probation, a prison sentence would be imposed and made to run consecutively with the term defendant was currently serving.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant again refused conditional probation and the trial.judge then proceeded to impose a consecutive sentence for the term prescribed by law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant now contends that imposition of a consecutive sentence under these circumstances constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">It is well established that a trial court has discretion to determine whether several sentences are to run concurrently or consecutively. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 669; <em>In re Sandel, </em>64 Cal.2d 412, 416 [50 Cal.Rptr. 462, 412 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>806].)  It is also the rule that appellate courts do not have the power to modify a sentence or reduce the punishment therein imposed absent error in the proceedings. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Odle, </em>37 Cal.2d 52, 57 [230 P.2d 345].) Moreover, such error cannot be predicated on a trial court\u2019s determination that several sentences are to run consecutively unless an abuse of discretion is clearly shown. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>20 Cal.App.3d 659, 666 [97 Cal.Rptr. 817]; <em>People </em>v. <em>White, </em>100 Cal.App.2d 836, 839-840 [224 P.2d 868].)</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The concept of judicial discretion is difficult to define with precision. In the past we have described it as \u201cthe sound judgment of the court, to be exercised according to the rules of law.\u201d <em>(Lent </em>v. <em>Tillson, </em>72 Cal. 404, 422 [14 P. 71].) More recently we have said (quoting from another case) that the term judicial discretion \u201cimplies absence of arbitrary determination, capricious disposition or whimsical thinking.\u201d <em>(In re Cortez, </em>6 Cal.3d 78, 85 [98 Cal.Rptr. 307, 490 P.2d 819].) Moreover, discretion is abused whenever the court, exceeds the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances being considered. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Russel, 69 </em>Cal.2d 187, 194 [70 Cal.Rptr. 210, 443 P.2d 794]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fusaro, </em>18 Cal.App.3d 877, 894 [96 Cal.Rptr. 368] [cert, den., 407 U.S. 912 (32 L.Ed.2d 686, 92 S.Ct. 2445)].)  However, in the absence of a clear showing that its sentencing decision was arbitrary or irrational, a trial court should be presumed to have acted to achieve legitimate sentencing objectives and, accordingly, its discretionary determination to impose consecutive sentences ought not be set aside on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Turning to the facts of the instant case, we cannot say that the trial court has abused its discretion. As pointed out above, defendant has a lengthy history of narcotics use and anti-social behavior. The probation officer reported that defendant had been named in 15 \u201cwriteups\u201d related to narcotics and had suffered 2 felony narcotics convictions. One of these convictions was for a violation which occurred while defendant was on bail. The probation report concluded that defendant needed time \u201cto be dried out\u201d and consequently recommended against probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Defendant argues that notwithstanding his prior record, the trial court\u2019s decision to impose consecutive sentences must be viewed as an unreasonable and vindictive reaction to defendant\u2019s rejection of conditional probation. He contends that the alternatives of probation or consecutive ten-year maximum sentences could not both be appropriate for any one offender and therefore that the trial court\u2019s order was essentially arbitrary and not an exercise of discriminating judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Defendant\u2019s reasoning is not persuasive. By initially imposing the search condition as a term of probation, the trial judge demonstrated his belief that defendant should be subject to some substantial control for at least five years. Such a search condition would assist in deterring or discovering subsequent narcotics offenses thereby aiding defendant\u2019s rehabilitation and providing protection for the public. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mason, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d 759, 764.) The trial judge could have reasonably concluded that defendant\u2019s rejection of the search condition was an indication of both an unwillingness to reform and a desire to return to narcotics use at the earliest opportunity. Under these circumstances, the trial judge may well have felt that a two-year parole ineligibility period (made mandatory by Pen. Code, \u00a7 3043 upon the imposition of two or more consecutive sentences; not restricted to narcotic offenses) was necessary to further the legitimate sentencing objectives of rehabilitation and protection of the public. In light of the broad discretion to be afforded trial judges both in sentencing and in granting or denying probation and given defendant\u2019s extensive criminal record, it does not appear that the imposition of consecutive sentences in the instant case exceeded the bounds of reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Wright, C. J., McComb, J., Sullivan, J., and Clark, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b112-10\">Retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court sitting under assignment by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-11\">The trial court was acting under its power of consecutive sentencing set forth in section 669 of the Penal Code. That section provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhen any person is convicted of two or more crimes, whether in the same proceeding or court or in different proceedings or courts, and whether by judgment rendered by the same judge or by different judges, the second or other subsequent judgment shall direct whether the terms of imprisonment or any of them to which he is sentenced shall run concurrently, or whether the imprisonment to which he is or has been sentenced upon the second or other subsequent conviction shall commence at the termination of the first term of imprisonment to which he has been sentenced, or at the termination of the second or subsequent term of imprisonment to which he has been sentenced, as the case may be----\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b113-7\"><em>A </em>month after his San Joaquin County arrest, while on bail, defendant was arrested in Sacramento County for possessing dangerous drugs (former Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11910.) After his commitment to the California Rehabilitation Center, defendant was convicted of this second drug offense and sentenced by the Sacramento County Superior Court to state prison for from six months to ten years. It was this prison sentence which resulted in the cancellation of his C.R.C. commitment and the resumption of the San Joaquin County criminal proceedings which are the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Such a search provision may properly be imposed as a condition to probation where the defendant is a narcotics offender. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>5 Cal.3d 759 [97 Cal.Rptr. 302, 488 P.2d 630].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b113-9\">As noted in footnote 2, <em>ante, </em>defendant had been committed to state prison by the Sacramento County Superior Court for another drug offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b113-10\">Former Health and Safety Code section 11500 provided for an indeterminate sentence of not less than two nor more than ten years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b115-7\">TOBRINER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag\">I dissent on the ground that the imposition of a consecutive sentence by the trial court, under the facts of this case, constitutes an abuse of discretion. As explained in the opinion prepared by Justice Friedman for the Court of Appeal: \u201cThe trial court\u2019s initial and ultimate sentencing choices moved from an extreme of lenience to an extreme of severity, from unsupervised liberty to a deferred imprisonment creating a possibility of a total of 20 years of incarceration and supervised parole. [Fn. omitted.] When each of these extremes is viewed as a means of achieving the goals of criminal sentencing, both could not be \u2018right\u2019 for any one offender. Without adding to the extensive literature on sentencing objectives, we need consider only the objective of protecting the public against the offender\u2019s future criminal conduct. Necessarily implied in the judge\u2019s resort to unsupervised probation was a finding that public protection demanded no imprisonment or supervision after completion of the indeterminate Sacramento sentence. Necessarily implied in the judge\u2019s alternative selection was a finding that public protection required 2 to 10 years of imprisonment and supervision additional to the Sacramento sentence. If the goal of public protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>was satisfied by an order for unsupervised probation, the consecutive prison sentence was harsh and excessive. If the same criterion justified lengthy imprisonment, it utterly vitiated unsupervised probation. No logically relevant sentencing criteria could simultaneously justify both extremes; hence the choice between them had to be personal, subjective and arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\">\u201cA variety of intermediate alternatives were available. Here, however, we review only the exercise of statutory discretion under section 669 and do not engage in general review of sentence suitability. According to the courtroom dialogue, defendant\u2019s rejection of exposure to police search as a condition of probation led the judge to impose a prison sentence. If a sentence concurrent with the existing Sacramento sentence represented a relatively far cry from the judge\u2019s initial proposal, it had at least the virtue of greater proximity to it. A concurrent sentence would permit 2 to 10 years in prison and on supervised parole. The judge rejected it and chose the most extreme and most severe alternative available to him. The court\u2019s selection of the most severe available alternative was not based upon sentencing criteria; rather, it was an expression of the judge\u2019s subjective reaction to defendant\u2019s rejection of probation. The turn from one alternative to another was essentially arbitrary and not an exercise of discriminating judgment within the bounds of reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The majority do not question Justice Friedman\u2019s charge that defendant is being punished primarily not for his crime but for his rejection of the condition of probation. Instead, they seek to justify the expression of the judge\u2019s antagonistic reaction on the theory that he could conclude from defendant\u2019s rejection of the probation condition both an unwillingness to reform and a desire to return to narcotics use.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Thus the majority infer from defendant\u2019s refusal to waive his rights under the Fourth Amendment that defendant seeks to conceal criminal activity. I had thought it settled that a court could never draw an inference of criminal conduct from a defendant\u2019s assertion of his constitutional right. (See <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 609 [14 L.Ed.2d 106, 85 S.Ct. 1229].) Indeed we have consistently held that a police officer may not infer from a defendant\u2019s refusal to consent to a search that the defendant is concealing evidence of criminal activity. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wetzel </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 104, 109-110 [113 Cal.Rptr. 32, 520 P.2d 416]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cressey </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 836, 841, fn. 6 [87 Cal.Rptr. 699, 471 P.2d 19]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shelton </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 740, 747 [36 Cal.Rptr. 433, 388 <em>P.2d </em>665]; <em>Tompkins </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1963) 59 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Cal.2d 65, 68 [27 Cal.Rptr. 889, 378 P.2d 113].) Yet the majority would permit the trial judge to draw this same unconstitutional inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Defendant was asked to consent to unannounced, unreasonable and unwarranted searches, at any hour of the day or night, for a period of five years. If defendant prefers to face imprisonment before he will consent to arbitrary government intrusion upon his privacy, such is his constitutional right. A court may not make that preference a basis for inferring that defendant seeks to conceal criminal activity, or a ground for imposing an arbitrary sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b117-6\">MOSK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2G\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Under existing law it is unquestionably the right of the trial court to exercise discretion in sentencing a defendant. And, as the majority correctly state, appellate courts presently have limited power to interfere with the sentence imposed by a trial judge who has exercised his discretion, absent an abuse of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">The problem in this case is that the record does not reveal the trial judge meaningfully reflected upon the several available sanctions, and by a process of eliminating less drastic alternatives, ultimately settled upon the severe prison sentence inflicted upon this defendant. The judge may well have carefully cerebrated, but I suggest that appeals such as that involved here would be avoided, or more readily resolved, if the consideration given the sentencing process were recounted in open court for the understanding of the defendant and for perpetuation in the record of the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Prison sentences to run seriatim are the most draconian weapon in the trial judge\u2019s arsenal. The record discloses they were imposed almost casually in this instance. Yet 'the American Bar Association, after an exhaustive study of several years\u2019 duration, concluded, inter alia, that the \u201csentence imposed in each case should call for the minimum amount of custody or confinement which is consistent with the protection of the public, the gravity of the offense and the rehabilitative needs of the defendant.\u201d (ABA Project on Min. Standards for Crim. Justice, Standards Relating to Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures (Approved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Draft 1968) \u00a7 2.2.) To apply the American Bar standard, a judge who determines consecutive prison sentences to be necessary for a defendant before him should be expected to explain why such sentences are the minimum amount of custody consistent with public safety, the nature of the crime and the rehabilitative potential of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Admittedly this defendant is, by virtue of his frequent involvement with narcotics, an unsympathetic figure. Yet the first impulse of the judge was to give him straight probation; his ultimate order was consecutive state prison terms. Such disparate sentencing options are not uncommon to our penal code. Consider, for example, a defendant convicted of a first offense of second degree burglary. The judge may invoke any of the following sentencing devices in ascending order: (1) summary probation (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203); (2) probation upon various nonpenal conditions; (3) probation with a fine as a condition thereof (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1205); (4) probation with time in the county jail as a condition; (5) imprisonment in the county jail up to one year; (6) imprisonment in the state prison not less than 1 or more than 15 years (Pen. Code, \u00a7 461). With such diverse sentences available, how can a reviewing court ascertain whether there has been an abuse of discretion if the trial judge merely intones the sentence selected without any explanation on the record as to why, in the exercise of his discretion, he rejected all the lesser alternatives?</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Imprisonment is the maximum intrusion by society on an individual\u2019s liberty. Unfortunately under some circumstances it is required. Professor Herbert Packer, in writing of \u201cthe inevitability ... of punishment,\u201d stated that \u201cIn our present state of comparative ignorance about the sources and control of human conduct there is no escape from the use of punishment (whether criminal or not) as a device for reducing the/ incidence of behavior that we consider antisocial.\u201d (Packer, The Limits of the Criminal Sanction (1968) p. 249.) While that is undoubtedly true, the history of crime control and penal methods should warn us that complacent conclusions about inevitability and the assumption that no alternatives exist have in the past all too often been taken to justify barbarity and inhumanity. (Zimring &amp; Hawkins, Deterrence (1973) p. 41.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">While society looks to imprisonment as a source of protection, the record of prisons in solving or curbing the problem of crime is dismal. And, sad td- relate, progress in prison techniques over the past century has been negligible. Shortly after World War I George Bernard Shaw wrote that \u201cImprisonment as it exists today is a worse crime than any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>those committed by its victims.\u201d (Shaw, The Crime of Imprisonment, p. 13.) At mid-century two of the nation\u2019s most scholarly wardens, both Californians, warned us of their deep concern. Conditions at San Quentin were described by Warden Clinton T. Duffy as a \u201cnightmare\u201d (Duffy, The San Quentin Story (1950) p. 107), and Warden Kenyon J. Scudder declared we should use \u201cprisons as a last resort\u201d because, he wrote, \u201cMost men come out of these prisons worse than when they entered.\u201d (Scudder, Prisoners Are People (1952) p. 227.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The lesson is still unlearned today. Tom Wicker, one of America\u2019s most distinguished journalists, wrote in his chronicle of the recent Attica prison revolt: \u201cCaging men as a means of dealing with the problem of crime is a modem refinement of man\u2019s ancient and limitless inhumanity, as well as his vast capacity for self-delusion.\u201d The 19th century penitentiary produced \u201cmore mental breakdowns, suicides and deaths than repentance.\u201d It is a melancholy fact that \u201cthe nineteenth century reaches nearly to the twenty-first in its long and baleful influence on the treatment of offenders in America and in its legacy of self-delusion\u2014the ingrained American idea that society can make better men and women by sending them to prison, by putting them in cages. However idealistic its origins, that delusion has produced a protracted record of senselessness, futility, dishonor and inhumanity.\u201d (Wicker, A Time to Die (1975) pp. 59-62.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">There are few if any criminologists who do not believe that prisons breed, rather than curb, crime. It is not merely the antiquated penitentiary structures, but the tension, hostility, anger, homosexuality and violence necessarily indigenous to a way of life in which men are isolated from society, stripped of all dignity, privacy and status. \u201cThe idea of punishment as the law interprets it seems to be,\u201d concludes Dr. Karl Menninger, \u201cthat inasmuch as a man has offended society, society must officially offend him.\u201d (Menninger, The Crime of Punishment (1968) p. 71.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">In this context a collision of basic values is inevitable. On the one hand society demands protection from those who trespass upon its peace and security. On the other hand every individual, even a confirmed malefactor, has certain rights in a constitutional order. Use of the doctrine of \u201cthe least drastic alternative\u201d is the best technique for the adjustment of such impact. Its rational application preserves both of the conflicting values: the needs of society and the integrity of the constitutional order.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>The doctrine of the least drastic alternative requires that the state\u2014in this instance the sentencing judge\u2014demonstrate a particular course to be the least drastic method of achieving a desired end. Professor Norval Morris calls it \u201cparsimony.\u201d He wrote, \u201cThe least restrictive\u2014least punitive\u2014sanction necessary to achieve defined social purposes should be chosen.\u201d (Morris, The Future of Imprisonment (1974) pp. 60-61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The United States Supreme Court has often used the phrase \u201cless drastic means\u201d in a First Amendment context. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Robel </em>(1967) 389 U.S. 258, 268 [19 L.Ed.2d 508, 516-517, 88 S.Ct. 419]; <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Tucker </em>(1960) 364 U.S. 479, 488 [5 L.Ed.2d 231, 237-238, 81 S.Ct. 247]; Wormuth &amp; Mirkin, <em>The Doctrine of the Reasonable Alternative </em>(1964) 9 Utah L. Rev. 254, 267-293; Note <em>(1969) </em>78 Yale L.J. 464.) The high court used the same expression in <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 618, 637 [22 L.Ed.2d 600, 616-617, 89 S.Ct. 1322], and then spoke of methods that are \u201cnecessary\u201d in <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Blumstein </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 330, 342 [31 L.Ed.2d 274, 284, 92 S.Ct. 995]. Whatever the precise term adopted, the import of the several formulations is the same: the state must demonstrate that the infringement upon human liberties which occurs is unavoidable if the purpose of the state is to be achieved. (Singer, <em>The Least Drastic Alternative </em>(1972) 58 Cornell L.Rev. 51, 56.)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">If the purpose of a one-year residency requirement for welfare is to avoid welfare fraud, the Supreme Court found in <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>394 U.S. at page 637 [22 L.Ed.2d at pages 616-617], that the waiting period was too drastic and must be invalidated since the state may achieve its interest in a less onerous manner. If the purpose of a year\u2019s residence requirement for voting is to assure that the voter has an interest in the election outcome, that requirement is also too drastic since the state may ascertain in other ways that the voter is a bona fide member of the community. <em>(Dunn </em>v. <em>Blumstein, supra, </em>405 U.S. at p. 352 [31 L.Ed.2d at pp. 289-290].) If the state wishes to determine the competence of its teachers, it cannot do so by requiring them to list all organizations to which they belong, since investigation of their competence in the classroom would be a more direct and less intrusive method of reaching the same end. <em>(Shelton </em>v. <em>Tucker, supra, </em>364 U.S. 479.)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">While the least drastic alternative test has not yet been ordered in criminal cases, an emerging case law and commentary supports the principle. It would seem that if the doctrine applies to losses qf welfare benefits, voting rights and teachers\u2019 tenure, a fortiori it would be relevant to loss of liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>In <em>Covington </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(D.C.Cir. 1969) 419 F.2d 617 [136 App.D.C. 35], a commitment case, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit applied an aspect of the doctrine by requiring the state to demonstrate that less severe confinement was not justified. Chief Judge Bazelon wrote that \u201c[B]efore a court can determine that the hospital\u2019s decision to confine a patient in a maximum security ward is, within its broad discretion, \u2018permissible and reasonable\u2019 ... it must be able to conclude that the hospital has considered and found inadequate all relevant alternative dispositions----\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 624.)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">A significant federal case in this area is <em>United States </em>v. <em>Waters </em>(D.C.Cir. 1970) 437 F.2d 722 [141 App.D.C. 289], In <em>Waters, </em>a young offender was eligible for sentencing under the federal Youth Corrections Act, which specifies that the purpose of that act is rehabilitation. He was instead sentenced by the trial court as an adult felon. On appeal the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals declared that trial courts must in the future specify the reasons for not sentencing an otherwise eligible offender under the Youth Corrections Act. In effect, the court held that there was a presumption in favor of sentencing young offenders under the act and that the state, in this case the judge, bore the burden of demonstrating that such a rehabilitative sentence was not justified on the facts of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Again in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alsbrook </em>(D.D.C. 1971) 336 F.Supp. 973, a district court panel held that failure to sentence youthful offenders to Lorton Youth Center in Virginia on the sole basis that Lorton was overcrowded was an invalid exercise of sentencing power. Instead of approving a more drastic sentence, the court ordered the immediate relief of the overcrowded situation at that institution. The court spoke in terms of the need for rehabilitation and declared that \u201c[t]he Constitution, the Youth Corrections Act, and the conscience of a civilized society require that youth offenders receive firm but effective opportunity for treatment and realistic rehabilitation.\u201d The reference to the Constitution and to the \u201cconscience of a civilized society\u201d suggests possible future application of the Eighth Amendment.

Clemmer </em>(D.D.C. 1962) 206 F.Supp. 370.)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">It appears inevitable to me that courts ultimately will adopt, in one form or another, the doctrine of the least drastic alternative. The doctrine is hardly extreme. The American Law Institute has recommended a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>presumption in favor of probation for every offender. (Model Pen. Code (1962) \u00a7 7.01.) The American Bar Association has declared that nonconfinement is to be preferred over total or partial confinement \u201cin the absence of affirmative reasons to the contrary.\u201d (ABA Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2.3(c).) In a comment related to its conclusion, the American Bar Association said it \u201cbelieves that the starting point for every sentence should be probation or some other sentence not involving commitment or confinement, and that the extent to which commitment or confinement is employed in a given case should turn on the appearance of specific reasons which seem to call for that disposition.\u201d <em>(Id </em>at p. 72.)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Most conscientious trial judges anguish over the sentencing process. It is undoubtedly their least gratifying responsibility. Nevertheless what has been characterized as appellate <em>laissez faire </em>may have been misinterpreted by the trial bench as total freedom from accountability. The growing disenchantment with current methods of punition portend more, not less, responsibility on the shoulders of the sentencing judge. A concomitant of that responsibility is the obligation to forthrightly explain its exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In my criticism of current sentencing procedures in California, I do not suggest our state lags behind other jurisdictions. Quite the contrary: California has generally blazed a trail in providing such protective devices as presentence reports, availability of the report to defendant and his counsel, and an opportunity for defendant to be heard at the time of sentencing. But the trail still falls far short of a salutary penological goal, i.e., to assure that the judge not only adequately reflects upon the sentence imposed but demonstrates on the record that he has done so. In short the record must affirmatively reveal that the judge has considered all other less drastic alternative sentences before concluding that which he elects to impose is most appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Sentencing today is an archaic process at best. By application of the rule of the least drastic alternative we can ameliorate somewhat the most flagrant abuses of the sentencing process by requiring the state, functioning through its trial judge, to articulate the rationale for the sentence imposed. If we cannot abolish prisons, as seems clear, we should in good conscience limit their use to the confinement of those errant members of society for whom no other alternative appears feasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>If the judge employed his discretion in that manner in the instant case, it does not appear from the record. I would send the matter back to the trial court for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied May 21, 1975. Richardson, J., did not participate' therein. Tobriner, J., and Mosk, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-10\">The judge apparently believed he was being magnanimous in informing the defendant of the proposed sentence. At one point in the colloquy, he stated; \u201cAt least I am telling you what I propose to do. Perhaps I should not tell you anything and go ahead and do it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
