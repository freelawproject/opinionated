(See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1506.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The People\u2019s sole contention is that the court erred in determining that Wayne D. Earley\u2019s conduct was not prohibited by section 209 (kidnaping for the purpose of robbery) as construed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>71 Cal.2d 1119 [80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d 225, 43 A.L.R.3d 677].</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">In 1967 Earley was found guilty by a jury in the Alameda County Superior Court on one count of kidnaping for the purpose of robbery (\u00a7 209) and one count of first degree robbery (\u00a7\u00a7 211, 211a) and was sentenced to prison on each count.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judgment was affirmed on appeal.  Thereafter we reinterpreted section 209 in <em>Daniels, </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Mutch, 4 </em>Cal.3d 389, 396 [93 Cal.Rptr. 721, 482 P.2d 633], relying on the principle in <em>In re Zerbe, 60 </em>Cal.2d 666, 667-668 [36 Cal.Rptr. 286, 388 P.2d 182, 10 A.L.R.3d 840], held that a defendant is entitled to habeas corpus relief under <em>Daniels </em>\u201cif there is no material dispute as to the facts relating to his conviction and if it appears that the statute under which he was convicted did not prohibit his conduct.\u201d It is only where it appears as a matter of law that the defendant\u2019s conduct did not violate the statute under which he was convicted that the defendant is entitled to collateral relief under <em>Zerbe. </em>(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Timmons, 4 </em>Cal.3d 411, 416 [93 Cal.Rptr. 736, 482 P.2d 648] [conc. &amp; dis. opn. by Sullivan, J.]; <em>In re Howard, </em>21 Cal.App.3d 318, 321 [98 Cal.Rptr. 531]; <em>In re Madrid, </em>19 Cal.App.3d 996, 1003 [97 Cal.Rptr. 354].)</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">After <em>Daniels </em>Earley filed several motions to recall the remittitur on the ground that his conduct did not violate section 209 as construed in that decision. The motions were denied, and we denied hearings. He then filed in this court a habeas corpus petition on the same ground, and we denied the petition. He subsequently filed in the Marin County Superior Court a petition for habeas corpus on the same ground as well as an unrelated one, and an order to show cause was issued limited to the question of the validity of the section 209 conviction in the light of <em>Daniels. </em>Following the filing of the return and the traverse thereto, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>court determined that Earley\u2019s conduct did not violate section 209 as construed in <em>Daniels, </em>and the court filed an order vacating the judgment of conviction and remanding the case to the Alameda County Superior Court for resentencing on the robbery count and to permit Earley to renew his applications for probation and reduction of the charges. As heretofore stated, the People have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">1. <em>The Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">About 4:50 a.m. on July 22, 1967, Werner Schopfer, Jr., stopped at a stop sign at a lighted intersection at East 14th Street and 77th Avenue in Oakland. Earley, who was wearing sunglasses, walked up to the driver\u2019s side of the car and stuck an object through the window. Schopfer thought the object was a gun, but it apparently was a gun-like cigarette lighter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Earley told Schopfer to move over, and Schopfer complied. Earley got into the car and drove east on East 14th Street a block or two, turned onto a dark side street and eventually stopped away from any street lights, in the middle of a block on a side street named Holly near 86th Avenue, a distance of some 10 to 13 blocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">During the drive whenever Schopfer looked at Earley, Earley waved the apparent gun at Schopfer and said something to the effect that Schopfer was making him nervous and that Earley \u201cshould just kill\u201d Schopfer. Schopfer did not remember whether they passed any other cars. After stopping on Holly Street, Earley demanded and received Schopfer\u2019s wallet and watch. Earley then fled on foot. He took the car keys with him but left them at a nearby comer as he had promised to do. It does not appear that Schopfer was physically injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">2. <em>The </em>Daniels <em>Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">As a preliminary matter, it is necessary to consider the exact nature of the <em>Daniels </em>test. The People assert that it is only if both prongs of that test are met that a conviction of kidnaping for the purpose of robbery (\u00a7 209) is invalid under <em>Daniels.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\"><em>Daniels </em>stated (at p. 1139), \u201cwe hold that the intent of the Legislature in amending Penal Code section 209 in 1951 was to exclude from its reach not only \u2018standstill\u2019 robberies (e.g., <em>People </em>v. Knowles,... 35 Cal.2d 175 [217 P.2d 1]) but also those in which the movements of the victim are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>merely incidental to . the commission of the robbery <em>and </em>do not substantially increase the risk of harm over and above that necessarily present in the crime of robbery itself. [Italics added.] (See Note, <em>Room-to-Room Movement: A Risk Rationale for Aggravated Kidnapping... </em>11 Stan.L.Rev. 554, 555; Note, <em>A Rationale of the Law of </em>Kidnapping. . . Colum.L.Rev. 540, 554-557.)\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Some authorities have indicated that, if the movement is not merely incidental to the robbery, a conviction under section 209 is not invalid under <em>Daniels </em>irrespective of whether there is an increase in danger to the victim under the second prong of the <em>Daniels </em>test. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Stathos, </em>17 Cal.App.3d 33, 38-39 [94 Cal.Rptr. 482]; see <em>In re Bryant, </em>19 Cal.App.3d 933, 937-938 [97 Cal.Rptr. 40] [conc. opn.]; 59 Cal.L.Rev. 180, 189.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">On the other hand from language in the majority opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Thornton, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 738, it may be inferred that movements of a victim can constitute kidnaping for the purpose of robbery (\u00a7 209) <em>only </em>if the movements (1) are not merely incidental to the commission of the robbery <em>and </em>(2) substantially increase the risk of harm beyond that inherent in the crime of robbery.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <em>Thornton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>dissent clearly so indicates.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See also <em>In re Crumpton, 9 </em>Cal.3d 463, 466-467 [106 Cal.Rptr. 770, 507 P.2d 74]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cleveland, </em>27 Cal.App.3d 820, 825 [104 Cal.Rptr. 161]; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Lobaugh, </em>18 Cal.App.3d 75, 83 [95 Cal.Rptr. 547].) That indication is correct.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Cases such as <em>People </em>v. <em>Stathos, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.3d 33, are disapproved insofar as they are inconsistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Nothing in <em>People </em>v. <em>Stanworth, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 588, is inconsistent with the requirement that to convict a defendant of violating section 209 the jury must find both of the foregoing matters. <em>Stanworth </em>held (at p. 596) that the <em>Daniels </em>test is inapplicable to simple kidnaping (\u00a7 207). <em>Stanworth </em>pointed out that both prongs of the <em>Daniels </em>test refer to robbery and that simple kidnaping may occur in the absence of another crime. <em>Stanworth </em>stated (p. 601) that the language of section 207 \u201cimplies that the determining factor in the crime of kidnaping is the actual distance of the victim\u2019s movements; and further, that the minimum movements necessary for the commission of the crime \u00e1re present where the victim is forcibly taken \u2018into <em>another part </em>of the same county.\u2019 (Italics added.) Finally because the victim\u2019s movements must be more than slight... or \u2018trivial\u2019... they must be substantial in character to constitute kidnaping under section 207.\u201d <em>Stanworth </em>involved not only section 207 convictions but also a section 209 conviction, and with respect to the latter <em>Stanworth </em>applied the <em>Daniels </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\"><em>Stanworth </em>further noted (p. 600) that \u201cIn <em>Daniels, </em>we observed that section 209 fails to define the term \u2018kidnaps\u2019 . . . and concluded that the Legislature must have intended the term to have the same meaning as the word \u2018kidnaping\u2019 used in section 207. <em>(Daniels, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 1131.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>In sum, both <em>Daniels, </em>involving section 209 kidnaping, and <em>Cotton </em>[v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 459 (15 Cal.Rptr. 65, 364 P.2d 241)], involving section 207 kidnaping, construe the term \u2018kidnaping\u2019 to mean movements which are not merely incidental to associated crimes.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(Stanworth, </em>at p. 600.) However, in view of the fact that, as we stated in <em>Daniels, </em>\u201csection 209 prescribes increased punishment when the kidnaping is for the purpose of ransom or robbery\u201d <em>(Daniels, </em>71 Cal.2d at p.. 1131; see also Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1973 Supp.) \u00a7 358A, p. 187),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> violation of section 209 requires <em>not only </em>that the asportation be not merely incidental to the associated crime of robbery (i.e., that there be a kidnaping) but also that it \u201csubstantially increase the risk of harm over and above that necessarily present in the crime of robbery itself.\u201d <em>(Daniels, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 1139.)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">3. <em>Whether, As a Matter of Law, Earley\u2019s Conduct Did Not Violate Section 209 As Construed in </em>Daniels</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">(a) Whether the movements were \u201cmerely incidental to the commission of the robbery\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Brief movements to facilitate either robbery or robbery and rape are incidental thereto within the meaning of <em>Daniels. </em>(See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Stanworth, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 588 [25 feet from road to field]; <em>People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>Mutch, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d 389, 397-399 [30 to 40 feet from one room to another in business establishment]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>2 Cal.3d 894, 902 [88 Cal.Rptr. 208, 471 P.2d 1008] [around gas station premises]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 1119, 1122 et seq. [5 to 30 feet within own homes].) On the other hand movements to facilitate the foregoing crime or crimes that are for a substantial distance rather than brief are not incidental thereto within the meaning of <em>Daniels. </em>(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Thornton, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 738, 747, 750, 767-768 [movements .of victims one block and four blocks]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stephenson, </em>10 Cal.3d 652, 657-661 [111 Cal.Rptr. 556, 517 P.2d 820] [five or six blocks].) Movements for a substantial distance within one county manifestly constitute a carrying \u201cfrom one part of the county to another\u201d (see \u00a7 207).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">As heretofore appears, the movement in the instant case was 10 to 13 blocks. Movement of that distance or less has been expressly or impliedly viewed as substantial rather than brief in cases involving section 209 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thornton, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 738, 747, 750, 767-768; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stephenson, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 652, 657-661), and section 207 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stanworth, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 588, 603 [one-fourth mile]). Since the movement here was substantial, it was not \u201cmerely incidental to the commission of the robbery\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 1119, 1139), even though it may have been solely to facilitate the commission of the robbery.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Timmons, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 411 (a four to three decision), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>held a distance of five blocks to facilitate a robbery to be brief and incidental thereto. That holding in <em>Timmons, </em>however, has been impliedly overruled by <em>People </em>v. <em>Thornton, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 738, 747, 750, 767-768, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Stephenson, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 652, 657-661.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">(b) Whether the movements \u201csubstantially increase[d] the risk of harm over and above that necessarily present in the crime of robbery itself\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u201cUnder <em>Daniels, </em>the \u2018risk of harm\u2019 factor refers to the risk created by the victim\u2019s movements that he will \u2018suffer significant physical injuries over and above those to which a victim of the underlying crime is normally exposed\u2019; it does not refer to the increased risk that the crime of robbery will be committed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Timmons [supra], 4 </em>Cal.3d 411, 414 .. ..)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stanworth, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 588, 598.)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The \u201crisk of harm\u201d test is satisfied when the victim is forced to travel a substantial distance under the threat of imminent injury by a deadly weapon. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lara, </em>12 Cal.3d 903 [117 Cal.Rptr. 549, 528 P.2d 365].)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Here, however, Earley did not have a deadly weapon but a cigarette lighter his victim believed was a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The \u201crisk of harm\u201d test may also be satisfied in the absence of a deadly weapon under some circumstances. For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Thornton, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 738, 750, 767-768, after 8 p.m. the defendant forced his way into one victim\u2019s car and, seizing her around the throat with his arm, informed her he wanted her money. Rather than carrying out the robbery at that location, however, the defendant drove the victim four blocks\u2014steering with one hand while keeping her pinioned to the seat by means of his arm around her throat. After parking, defendant took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the victim\u2019s , money and sexually assaulted her. <em>Thornton, </em>in holding that as a matter of law the risk of harm to the victim was substantially increased, reasoned (at p. 768), \u201cClearly any substantial asportation which involves forcible control of the robbery victim such as that occurring in this case exposes her to grave risks of harm to which she would not have been subject had the robbery occurred at the point of initial contact.\u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Stephenson, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 652, 657-661.)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Here, as in <em>Thornton, </em>there was substantial asportation of the victim involving forcible control. Although such control was not by the identical means as in <em>Thornton, </em>it is clear that the movements increased to some extent the risk of harm beyond that inherent in the commission of the crime of robbery itself. Under the circumstances set forth above it appears that the asportation gave rise to dangers, not inherent in robbeiy, that an auto accident might occur or that the victim might attempt to escape from the moving car or be pushed therefrom by Earley. The fact that these dangers did not materialize does not, of course, mean that the risk of harm was not increased. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Milan, </em>9 Cal.3d 185, 193 [107 Cal.Rptr. 68, 507 P.2d 956].) And in our opinion it cannot be said under the circumstances here appearing that as a matter of law the increase in the risk of harm was not substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Timmons, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d 411, differs on its facts from the present case. There Mr. Baird and Miss Stephens, market employees, picked up bags containing $15,600 from a bank, and as they parked in the market parking lot upon their return from the bank defendant approached them. He stated, \u201cThis is a holdup,\u201d got into their car, and directed Baird to drive out of the lot. He further stated, \u201cDo as I tell you and I won\u2019t hurt anybody.\u201d He asked for and received the bags of money. He directed Baird to stop some five blocks from the market and left his victims unharmed. <em>Timmons, </em>after noting that the victims drove their own car for some five blocks along a city street in broad daylight, that there was no reckless driving, that neither victim was harmed, and that neither victim observed any weapon in the defendant\u2019s possession and the court found he was unarmed, stated, \u201cIn the circumstances, this brief asportation.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] may conceivably have increased the risk [of harm] in some slight degree beyond that inherent in the commission of the. robberies, but it cannot be said to have \u2018substantially\u2019 increased that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>risk.\u201d Here the distance was 10 to 13 blocks rather than 5 blocks as in <em>Timmons. </em>Further, in <em>Timmons </em>one of the victims drove during the daytime and presumably was able to give his undivided attention to driving, whereas here Earley drove at night while wearing sunglasses and holding an apparent weapon in one hand and it may be inferred his attention was divided between driving and watching his victim. Further here, unlike <em>Timmons, </em>the victim observed what he believed to be a gun in the robber\u2019s hands, the robber expressly threatened to kill him, the victim did not have a companion with him, and the robber drove from a lighted intersection to dark side streets.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">We conclude that the court erred in determining, as a matter of law, that Earley\u2019s conduct did not violate section 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The order is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Wright, C.

(3) The murder was willful, deliberate, and premeditated and was committed during the commission or attempted commission of any of the following crimes: ... (ii) Kidnapping, in violation of Section 207 or Section 209. Brief movements of a victim which are merely incidental to the commission of another offense and which do not substantially increase the victim\u2019s risk of harm over that necessarily inherent in the other offense do not constitute kidnapping within the meaning of this paragraph.\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Stanworth, </em>11 Cal.3d 588, 599 [114 Cal.Rptr. 250, 522 P.2d 1058], we expressed no opinion as to the effect of section 190.2, and we likewise do not do so here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The People also cite <em>People </em>v. <em>Beamon, </em>8 Cal.3d 625, 636 [105 Cal.Rptr. 681, 504 P.2d 905], in support of their assertion that it is only if both prongs of the test are met that a conviction of kidnaping for the purpose of robbery (\u00a7 209) is invalid under <em>Daniels. </em>In <em>Beamon </em>we stated, \u201cWithout addressing ourselves to the issue whether the kidnaping was merely incidental to the robbery within the meaning of <em>Daniels </em>it conclusively appears... that the abduction imposed a substantial increase in the risk of harm . . . ,\u201d and we upheld the section 209 conviction. In <em>Beamon </em>the movement was for some 15 blocks. Such distance was substantial rather than brief (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>11 Cal.3d 738 [114 Cal.Rptr. 467, 523 P.2d 267]) and thus both prongs of <em>Daniels </em>were not met.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b169-9\"><em>Thornton </em>stated (at p. 768), \u201cThe fact that in each case defendant chose to consummate the robbery at a location remote from the place of initial contact does not render the subsequent asportation \u2018merely incidental\u2019 to the crime, for <em>it is the very fact that defendant utilized substantial asportation in the commission of the crime which renders him liable to the increased penalty of section 209 if that asportation </em>war <em>such that the victim\u2019s risk of harm was substantially increased thereby.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The <em>Thornton </em>dissent stated (at p. 771), \u201c[W]e required in <em>Daniels </em>(at p. 1139) that to convict a defendant of violating section 209 the jury must find that the movements he compelled the victim to perform were significant displacements in space or time <em>and </em>substantially increased the risk of physical harm to the victim over and above that necessarily present in the crime of robbery.\u201d (Italics added.)

That instruction reads in relevant part: \u201cKidnaping is the unlawful movement by physical force of a person against his will and without his consent for a substantial distance where such movement is not merely incidental to the commission of the robbery and where such movement substantially increases the risk of significant physical injuries to such person over and above those to which such person is normally exposed in the commission of the crime of robbery <em>itself.\u201d</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Section 207, of course, differs from section 209 in that violation can occur in the absence of an \u201cassociated crime.\u201d <em>(Stanworth, </em>at p. 601; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>11 Cal.3d 784, 787 [114 Cal.Rptr. 426, 523 P.2d 226]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Apo, 25 </em>Cal.App.3d 790, 797 [102 Cal.Rptr. 242].)

It is obvious that no purpose would be served by reiterating those views in any detail at the present time. Clearly the <em>Thornton </em>majority are still in the saddle, and are still determined to ride roughshod over-the intent of the Legislature expressed in Penal Code section 209, explained by us in <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1119 [80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d 225, 43 A.L.R.3d 677], and confirmed by the recent \"enactment of Penal'Code section 190.2, subdivision (b)(3)(ii) <em>(ante, </em>p. 127, fn. 4). Yet because the majority\u2019s misapplication of the <em>Daniels </em>rule is even more flagrant here than in Thornton,. I am compelled to express some additional thoughts in response.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>At the outset I cannot refrain from observing that while we had no choice but to take the <em>Thornton </em>case because it came to us by automatic appeal, the present wound is self-inflicted. Worse, it constitutes an unnecessary waste of our limited judicial resources. Let us look briefly at the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">On November 17, 1967, judgment was entered in the Alameda Superior Court convicting defendant on one count of first degree robbery and one count of kidnaping for the purpose of robbery. On February 23, 1973, however, Judge E. Warren McGuire of the Marin Superior Court, acting on defendant\u2019s petition for habeas corpus, found that defendant\u2019s conduct did not constitute a violation of section 209 as construed in <em>Daniels. </em>He therefore filed an order vacating the kidnaping conviction on that ground (see, e.g., <em>In re Crumpton </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 463 [106 Cal.Rptr. 770, 507 P.2d 74]) and remanding defendant to the Alameda Superior Court for a redetermination of the sentence to be imposed on the robbery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">It may well be asked why the case did not quietly end at that point. Inasmuch as the original trial predated <em>Daniels, </em>defendant had been convicted of kidnaping on erroneous \u201cChessman instructions.\u201d At the time of Judge McGuire\u2019s order, defendant had already served more than six years in prison on that conviction. Even after the conviction was vacated, defendant remained subject to a sentence for first degree robbery. And no new principle of law was in issue\u2014only the application of settled rules to particular facts. In these circumstances it would seem the state\u2019s time and resources could have been far better spent than by relitigating the entire case in the appellate courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Whatever their motive, however, the People did appeal. Their first effort was singularly unsuccessful: in a brief, unpublished opinion authored by Presiding Justice Draper, the Court of Appeal unanimously affirmed the order vacating defendant\u2019s kidnaping conviction. Again the matter could well have been dropped without a trace of harm to the citizenry of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">But the People insisted on \u201cfighting the case all the way to the Supreme Court,\u201d and managed to persuade four justices to vote for a hearing. Thus in the course of its appellate travails the case has now been twice orally argued, and the courts have been called upon to study briefs totaling over 140 pages. What has been the result of all this effort?</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Although the majority purport to discuss certain rules of law, no new principles are in fact declared. In part 2 of their opinion <em>{ante, </em>pp. 126-129) the majority reject the People\u2019s totally untenable argument that if the movement of the victim is more than merely incidental to the robbery, a conviction under section 209 will survive a <em>Daniels </em>challenge even if there is no showing of a substantial increase in the risk of harm. But the unsoundness of this contention was clear from the face of <em>Daniels, </em>and as the majority recognize <em>(ante, </em>pp. 127-128), has been reiterated in both <em>Thornton </em>opinions, in <em>Crumpton, </em>in at least two decisions of the Court of Appeal, and in the relevant CALJIC instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The remainder of the majority opinion is simply a misapplication of the <em>Daniels </em>principles to the facts of this case. It is not surprising, for example, the majority hold <em>(ante, </em>pp. 129-131) that defendant\u2019s movement of the victim for 10 to . 13 city blocks was an asportation \u201cinto another part of the same county.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 207.) Since in <em>Thornton </em>the majority in effect defined that distance as a minimum of only one city block (see my dissent at p. <em>777 </em>of 11 Cal.3d), the result is foreordained in this and all other cases subsequent to <em>Thornton. </em>The sensitive inquiry envisaged by <em>Daniels </em>into whether the movement was criminologically significant (see 71 Cal.2d at p. 1138) seems to have been abandoned in favor of the crude and arbitrary rule of \u201cone block, one conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Equally predictable is the majority\u2019s holding <em>(ante, </em>pp. 131-133) that the movement caused a substantial increase in the risk of harm to the victim. Faced with the embarrassing circumstance that the \u201cgun\u201d used by defendant was in fact only a cigarette lighter, the majority fall back on defendant\u2019s driving habits. They rely principally on an analogy to their affirmance of Thornton\u2019s conviction of kidnaping Eileen S. (11 Cal.3d at pp. 767-768.) In that instance the defendant drove the victim\u2019s car while steering with one hand and holding the victim with his other arm around her neck. The <em>Thornton </em>majority found a substantial increase in the risk of harm in the combination of asportation plus \u201cforcible control\u201d of the victim. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 768.) The present majority repeat this language and attempt to identify the \u201cdangers\u201d allegedly created by such \u201cforcible control\u201d in the case at bar. <em>(Ante, </em>pp. 131-133.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Two such \u201cdangers\u201d are proposed. First, it is emphasized that defendant was driving at night while (1) wearing sunglasses and (2) holding the cigarette lighter in one hand, and that \u201cit may be inferred\u201d his attention was divided between such driving and watching his victim. These circumstances, say the majority, gave rise to the \u201cdanger\u201d that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>automobile accident might occur. As I explained in my dissent in <em>Thornton. </em>(11 Cal.3d at p. 778), \u201cThis scenario <em>might </em>have come true, of course; even the most careful driver is daily exposed to the <em>possibility </em>of accident and injury. But in the case before us the question is whether there was a <em>substantial </em>risk, within the meaning of <em>Daniels, </em>that such a result would actually occur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">When we examine the record in this connection we find no evidence whatever of the tint of defendant\u2019s sunglasses, or of how \u201cdark\u201d it really is in Oakland at 10 minutes to 5 on a July morning.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor is there any showing that defendant steered the car with one hand throughout the asportation, or when necessary was incapable of grasping the wheel with both hands even while holding the simulated gun; in that regard, reason tells us there is a significant difference between simply driving with one hand and driving with one hand but with the other forcibly restraining a kidnaping victim by the neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Even more speculative is the majority\u2019s second proposed \u201cdanger,\u201d Le., tha^the victim \u201cmight attempt to escape from the moving car or be pushed therefrom by Earley.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p. 132.) What possible basis in the record is there for these flights of fancy? There is not the remotest indication that Mr. Schopfer ever entertained the notion of leaping, Douglas Fairbanks-like, from the moving vehicle: he is a nightshift worker at the Oakland airport, not a celebrated movie stuntman. It is also highly unlikely that defendant would have \u201cpushed\u201d Mr. Schopfer out of the car <em>before </em>the robbery, as the sole purpose of the asportation was to relieve him of his valuables. Nor is there the slightest evidence suggesting that <em>after </em>the robbery defendant was inclined to forcibly eject his victim and speed away with the vehicle; on the contrary, he not only left Mr. Schopfer in command of his car but placed the ignition keys on a nearby street corner exactly as he had said he would do.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">On the present record it is no answer to say, as do the majority <em>(ibid.), </em>that \u201cThe fact that these dangers did not materialize does not, of course, mean that the risk of harm was not increased. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Milan, 9 </em>Cal.3d 185, 193 [107 Cal.Rptr. 68, 507 P.2d 956].)\u201d The logical flaw in this argument is that disproving the negative does not prove the positive: whether or not the hypothesized dangers ever \u201cmaterialized,\u201d there must still have been a factual basis for believing they were real. It is this factual basis which is entirely lacking in the majority\u2019s speculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The point may be illustrated in two ways. First, by contrasting the present record with the facts of the very case cited by the majority: in <em>Milan </em>the defendant commandeered a taxicab with a loaded gun. He first held his gun against the back of the head of a trainee riding in the front passenger seat. The driver intentionally ran a stop sign in \u00e1n attempt to attract the attention of the police. The defendant shot a hole through the windshield, shifted his gun to the back of the driver\u2019s head, and told the latter that the next bullet would be for him and to \u201cstop looking for stop signs, and if a police vehicle shows up, you\u2019re dead.\u201d The driver nevertheless continued to try to capture police attention by committing additional traffic violations, including going through two or three more stop signs, speeding, and running a red light. In such circumstances the chances that a traffic accident might occur or the kidnaping victims be shot were obviously very high; the dangers were real and pressing, not conjured up by an appellate court in the quiet of its chambers at some later date. In the case at bar no such highly dangerous risk-creating events ever took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Second, an argument <em>ad absurdum </em>may perhaps persuade where reason fails. In my <em>Thornton </em>dissent (11 Cal.3d at p. 782) I surmised that the majority would- draw the line at affirming a conviction under section 209 of a would-be robber who rendered his victim unconscious or securely bound and gagged him before driving the minimum required distance. I assumed that because in such a case the robber could give his undivided attention to driving and the victim could not jump from the moving car, the majority would find no substantial increase in the risk of harm. Here at last, I thought, was a case in which legislative intent would be respected and the defendant would be convicted of robbery and simple kidnaping only. I now see that I underestimated the majority\u2019s fertile imagination. When the suggested case reaches this court\u2014and one day it will\u2014the majority will find it possible to affirm on the theory, here enshrined, that the defendant might nevertheless have \u201cpushed\u201d his bound or unconscious victim out of the vehicle at some point during the trip. If that prospect is not deemed sufficiently grave to justify a life sentence, the majority are apparently prepared to invent some hitherto undreamed of \u201cdanger\u201d allegedly created by the asportation\u2014perhaps that an earthquake might occur in the next block and the car be swallowed up in a yawning chasm, or that a tornado might sweep the street and hurl the vehicle into yet another part of the county. And if it be objected that these are somewhat fanciful fears the majority will once again be able to say, \u201cThe fact that these dangers did not materialize does not, of course, mean that the risk of harm was not increased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>What is left of the <em>Daniels </em>rule after today\u2019s decision? Although the ratio decidendi of <em>Daniels </em>was that \u201cwhen the statute [i.e., \u00a7 209] is properly construed the evidence there introduced was insufficient to support the judgments\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mutch </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 389, 395 [93 Cal.Rptr. 721, 482 P.2d 633]), that act of statutory construction served the important purpose of saving the offense of aggravated kidnaping from a charge of unconstitutional disproportionality. Under the subsequently declared rule of <em>In re Lynch </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 410, 424 [105 Cal.Rptr. 217, 503 P.2d 921], \u201ca punishment may violate article I, section 6 [now \u00a7 17], of the Constitution if, although not cruel or unusual in its method, it is so disproportionate to the crime for which it is inflicted that it shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) An inevitable corollary of that rule (see <em>id. </em>at p. 426) is that when the Legislature prescribes penalties of vastly different severity for two genetically comparable acts, the more drastic punishment will be constitutionally suspect unless it is limited to conduct which is proportionately more dangerous to society. (Compare Pen. Code, \u00a7 241 [simple assault, fine up to $500 and/or jail up to 6 months] with Pen. Code, \u00a7 217 [assault with intent to commit murder, 1 to 14 years in prison].)</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">In footnote 10 of their opini\u00f3n the majority recite the statutory provisions for punishment of simple kidnaping and kidnaping for robbery. Let there be no mistake about the immense practical differences between these penalties. The sentence of a defendant convicted of simple kidnaping may be fixed at as little as 12 months; and if a longer sentence is imposed, he may nevertheless be paroled after that same 12-month period. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 208, 3049.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the other hand, a defendant convicted of kidnaping for the purpose of robbery must be sentenced to death or life imprisonment without possibility of parole if the victim dies or is harmed; and if, as here, the victim suffers no injury whatever, the defendant must still be given a life sentence. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209.) It is true in that case he will be entitled to parole. But he will not even be eligible for parole consideration until he has served at least seven years in prison (Pen. Code, \u00a7 3046), and in practice such parole is not ordinarily granted for approximately the first ten years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>There is, moreover, a still more important consequence which is widely misunderstood by the public and the bar alike. The \u201clife\u201d term imposed for aggravated kidnaping is far different from the \u201cfive to life\u201d term imposed for first degree robbery and a number of other offenses: the latter is a theoretical life maximum, but the former is an actual life minimum. Thus the robber will not only be released on parole far sooner than the kidnaper,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but his total term\u2014served both in and out of prison\u2014may be as little as 5 years and usually is less than 10 years. In stark contrast, if and when a defendant convicted of violating section 209 is finally released on parole <em>he will remain on parole for the rest of his life.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>No matter how mitigating the circumstances of his offense, no matter how complete his rehabilitation and how exemplary his behavior after release, he has no right ever again to be a free man.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">This disparity in the kidnaping penalties furnishes the yardstick by \"which to judge how \u201csubstantial\u201d must be the increase in risk of harm in order to support a conviction under section 209: the increase, I submit, must be proportionate to the difference in penalties. If it is not, there is no justification for convicting the defendant of aggravated rather than simple kidnaping. And in that event, the punishment inflicted will be unconstitutionally disproportionate to his conduct within the meaning of <em>Lynch.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The majority impliedly recognize this relationship. <em>(Ante, </em>pp. 128-129.) In fact, however, they pay it no more than lip service. When the majority pass from general statehients of principles to application of those principles to the case at bar, a very different rule emerges: in reviewing the record the majority conclude <em>(ante, </em>p. 132), \u201cit is clear that the movements increased <em>to some extent </em>the risk of harm beyond that inherent in the commission of the crime of robbery itself.\u201d (Italics added.) The emphasized language, of course, totally undermines the principle of constitutional proportionality: <em>any </em>forcible movement of the kidnaping victim conceivably increases the risk of harm \u201cto some extent.\u201d If such a minimal showing is all the majority now require to affirm a conviction under section 209, the \u201ccurrent of common sense\u201d which flowed through our <em>Daniels </em>decision (71 Cal.2d at p. 1127) has indeed been reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>The majority tell us <em>(ante, </em>pp. 130-131) that insofar as <em>People </em>v. <em>Timmons </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 411 [93 Cal.Rptr. 736, 482 P.2d 648], held a five-block movement to be merely incidental to a robbery, it was \u201cimpliedly overruled\u201d by <em>Thornton. </em>Are we to expect that in the next aggravated kidnaping case to reach this court the majority will <em>announce\u2014mirabile </em>dictu\u2014that insofar as <em>Daniels </em>required a truly substantial increase in the risk of harm to support the conviction it was \u201cimpliedly overruled\u201d by the case at bar? I can draw no other conclusion, despite the clear approval of the <em>Daniels </em>concept expressed by the Legislature. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.2, subd. (b)(3)(ii).)</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">At the close of my <em>Thornton </em>dissent (11 Cal.3d at p. 783) I expressed the sincere hope that the majority\u2019s decision would be \u201cno more than a passing aberration unfortunately confirming the old adage that hard cases make bad law.\u201d For <em>Thornton </em>was a \u201chard case\u201d: the defendant had all the earmarks of a vicious and depraved \u201csex fiend,\u201d and the majority were evidently prepared to go to any lengths to insure that he not \u201cwalk the streets\u201d again. But the matter now before us is not a similar \u201chard case.\u201d The probation report reveals that Wayne Earley is a product of the Oakland black ghetto, a shattered home, and total parental neglect. He was only 20 years old at the time of the crime. He was unarmed, and Mr. Schopfer suffered no physical injury or indignity whatever. The entire event cannot have taken more than 15 minutes, and when it was over Mr. Schopfer had lost only $8 and his watch. When Mr. Schopfer asked for the return of his car keys, defendant promised to leave them on the curb at the next corner, and he kept his promise.
