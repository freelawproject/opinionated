Arnold, federal prisoner # 05022-041, appeals from the denial of his habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. He challenges his convictions involving cocaine base, for which he is serving a term of 360 months of imprisonment. The district court determined that Arnold could not pursue relief under \u00a7 2241 because he did not satisfy the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-22\">On appeal, he contends that <em>DePierre v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2225, 180 L.Ed.2d 114 (2011), redefined the elements of crack cocaine offenses, barred the use of the preponderance of the evidence standard to determine drug type and quantity, and is retroactively applicable. He further argues that inadequate evidence was presented to prove that the substance in his case was cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-25\">A federal prisoner may attack the validity of his conviction in a \u00a7 2241 petition if he can meet the requirements of \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause. <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). The prisoner bears the burden of showing that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). A petitioner\u2019s inability to meet the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2255 is insufficient to meet this burden. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2000). Rather, a prisoner who wishes to proceed under the savings clause must establish that his claim \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and that the claim \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">In <em>DePierre, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2237, the Supreme Court held that the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) refers to cocaine in its chemically basic form, which includes, but is not limited to, \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d <em>DePierre </em>did not decriminalize Arnold\u2019s criminal conduct. Arnold therefore may not pursue \u00a7 2241 relief on his <em>DePierre </em>claim. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Evidently to bolster his <em>DePierre </em>argument, Arnold argues that <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009), and <em>Bullcoming v. New Mexico, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2705, 180 L.Ed.2d 610 (2011), require that the analysts who author lab reports must testify as to the reports and be subject to cross-examination. He does not argue that either <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>or <em>Bull-coming </em>was violated in his case as to any reports and the analysts who authored them. Rather, he argues that those cases reinforce the requirement in <em>DePierre </em>that the nature of the substance at issue be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. He raises his argument pursuant to <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>and <em>Bullcoming </em>for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Absent extraordinary circumstances, we will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal in a civil case. <em>Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). To the extent Arnold may be attempting to raise a contention that the holdings in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>and <em>Bullcoming </em>were somehow violated in his case, we do not consider the issue. <em>See id. </em>To the extent Arnold seeks to reinforce his <em>DePierre </em>argument by citing to <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>and <em>Bullcoming, </em>those cases do not change the fact that <em>DePierre </em>did not decriminalize Arnold\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
