He argues that the district court erred in finding that his prior Florida conviction for lewd and lascivious battery on a minor constituted a crime of violence sufficient to support his career-offender enhancement. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm Terry\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">Terry pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C) (\u201cCount Three\u201d), and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (\u201cCount Four\u201d). His presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) indicated that, before committing the instant offenses, Terry had sustained Florida convictions for lewd or lascivious battery on a minor and for sate or delivery of cocaine. Regarding the battery conviction, the PSI stated that, in 2002, Terry went into a 14-year-old\u2019s bedroom and forced her to have sex with him. Further, it stated that a medical evaluation of the victim showed that she had \u201ctearing, abrasion[s] and lacerations near her vagina.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">The PSI indicated that Terry qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, resulting in an offense level of 32, because he had two prior convictions for either a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d or a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d specifically, his prior Florida cocaine and battery convictions. Terry received a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), resulting in a total offense level of a 29. Terry\u2019s classification as a career offender placed him into a criminal history category VI. As to the firearm offense under \u00a7 924(c), Terry was subject to a mandatory minimum 60-month sentence, to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment. Because Terry was a career offender with a conviction under \u00a7 924(c), the applicable guideline range increased to 262 to 327 months under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(c)(2) and (c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">Terry objected to the PSI on the ground that his Florida conviction for lewd and lascivious battery, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(4), was not a proper predicate for the career-offender enhancement because it was not a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines. He asserted that <em>United States v. Harris, </em>608 F.3d 1222 (11th Cir.2010) held that a Florida conviction for sexual battery of a child under the age of 16 does not fall within the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) because it imposes strict liability and does not necessarily involve \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\u201d As such, his prior battery conviction, which is a strict liability offense, does not qualify as a crime of violence because it does not require specific intent to use force against another person. Further, regarding the circumstances of his prior conviction, Ter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>ry objected to the PSI\u2019s factual assertion that he \u201cwent into the bedroom of his girlfriend\u2019s child and forced her to have sexual intercourse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Terry filed a sentencing memorandum, reiterating that he did not qualify as a career offender. He argued that, under our \u201ccategorical approach\u201d to review, the district court should not consider anything other than the fact of conviction and the elements of the offense. Moreover, even under the \u201cmodified categorical approach,\u201d he does not qualify as a career offender because he never admitted to any allegations concerning forcible sex during his state plea proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">At the sentencing hearing, Terry argued that, although our decision in <em>Harris </em>\u201cseemingly rais[ed] an invitation\u201d to consider the specifics of the underlying offense, the Supreme Court has established that, if the statute may be reviewed under the categorical approach based only on the judgment and elements of the offense, there is no need to consider any further evidence or documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">However, he argued, even applying the modified categorical approach, the court was not permitted to consider \u201chearsay police reports\u201d under <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). He asserted that the government relied on statements that were made during Terry\u2019s state plea hearing, suggesting that the offense had involved violence, but those statements merely recited allegations from the police report. Terry\u2019s public defender in that proceeding did not object to the factual basis for his plea, but only for the purposes of his state plea, and as such, he argued that his interaction with the state court was insufficient to constitute an admission to any violent acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">The government then introduced several documents into evidence, including copies of the state information and judgment, Terry\u2019s guilty plea, and the plea hearing transcript. During the state plea hearing, the prosecutor described the factual basis for the plea, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-9\">[]Terry, did engage in sexual activity with the victim, a person 12 years of age or older but less than 16 years of age, by placing his penis in or on her vagina.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-10\">She was at the time 14 years old. Victim reported that she was, in fact, raped. There was a CPT medical evaluation done on this victim, and she did have tears and abrasions and lacerations near her vagina to corroborate that there had been some type of penetration to her. And there was also semen removed from her vagina, and that was sent off to Florida Department of Law Enforcement to be tested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">The state court asked Terry\u2019s defense counsel if he had any objection to the statement of facts, and counsel responded, \u201cNot for the purposes of this plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-12\">Terry argued that, unlike the Florida battery statute at issue in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), which could be violated in numerous ways, including touching, Terry was charged only with sexual activity, not sexual battery. Thus, the victim\u2019s report of being raped was not necessary for plea purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-13\">As a preliminary matter, the court rejected Terry\u2019s contention that it was required to follow the categorical approach. Instead, <em>Shepard </em>and <em>Johnson </em>instruct that, if the categorical approach does not resolve the issue, the court may then turn to the modified categorical approach, under which the court must determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>whether the government\u2019s Shepard-approved documents establish that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s conduct involved purposeful, violence, and aggressive conduct.\u201d The court noted that, in <em>Harris, </em>unlike the instant case, there was insufficient evidence for the court to make that determination. Here, the government\u2019s <em>Shepard-approved </em>documents, including the relevant portions of the state plea hearing, were sufficient to establish that Terry\u2019s prior conviction fell within the definition of a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.1 and \u00a7 4B1.2. The court found it relevant that Terry had committed a forcible sex offense, which is specifically enumerated in the application notes to \u00a7 4B1.2. However, ultimately, the court applied the modified categorical approach in finding that Terry\u2019s offense fell within the career offender guideline\u2019s residual clause, as an offense involving conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, and, as an offense involving purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">The court adopted the guideline calculations as contained in the PSI, and noted that Terry faced a guideline range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. Terry moved for a downward variance based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) sentencing factors, including his efforts to assist the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">In consideration of Terry\u2019s attempts to cooperate with the government, the court granted the downward variance and imposed a 198-month total sentence, consisting of 138 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count Three and a consecutive 60-month sentence as to Count Four.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a particular conviction is a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Lockley, </em>632 F.3d 1238, 1240 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 257, 181 L.Ed.2d 150 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">Pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1, a defendant is considered a \u201ccareer offender\u201d and subject to an enhanced sentence if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-12\">(1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-13\">(2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-14\">(3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-15\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined in the Sentencing Guidelines as any offense punishable by more than one year of imprisonment that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-16\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-17\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosive, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-18\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-19\">We have noted that, while not the same, the definitions of a crime of violence in \u00a7 4B1.2 and a violent felony in the ACCA are \u201cvirtually identical.\u201d <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1350 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008). Accordingly, decisions analyzing whether an offense is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA provide guidance when determining whether an offense qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the career offender guideline. <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>609 F.3d 1250, 1253 (11th Cir.2010), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1783, 179 L.Ed.2d 656 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">\u201cUnder \u00a7 4B1.2 of the guidelines, any state or federal offense that is punishable by more than one year of imprisonment can be a crime of violence if it fits within one of three categories.\u201d <em>United States v. Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d 971, 975 (11th Cir.2012). The first category includes crimes that have \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1). The second category includes the enumerated crimes of \u201cburglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion\u201d and those involving the \u201cuse of explosives.\u201d \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). The third category, sometimes referred to as residual clause crimes, includes those that \u201cotherwise involve[] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id.; Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d at 975. In addition, the commentary to the Sentencing Guidelines elaborates that a crime of violence also includes several specific crimes, including forcible sex offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, comment. (n.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">There are two ways in which we analyze whether a crime can fall within the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). <em>Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d at 975. The first is the categorical approach, under which the court considers whether the elements of the offense are of the type that would justify its inclusion in the definition of a crime of violence, without inquiring into the specific conduct of the particular offender. <em>Id. </em>at 975-76. The second way to identify the specific offense at issue is an exception to the categorical approach, referred to as the \u201cmodified categorical approach.\u201d <em>See United States v. Pantle, </em>637 F.3d 1172, 1175 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1091, 181 L.Ed.2d 976 (2012). Courts may apply the modified categorical approach \u201cwhen the law under which a defendant has been convicted contains different statutory phrases \u2014 some of which qualify as crimes of violence and some of which do not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and alteration omitted); <em>Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d at 976. Moreover, when applying the modified categorical approach, sentencing courts, under <em>Shepard, </em>are \u201cgenerally limited to examining the statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of the plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d <em>See United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1328 (11th Cir.2010) (applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Johnson, </em>held that, for a prior conviction to qualify as a violent felony under the elements clause of the ACCA, the offense must have an element of \u201cviolent force\u201d against the person of another. <em>Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1271. The Court defined violent force as \u201cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In so doing, the Court rejected the established common-law meaning of \u201cforce,\u201d which included even the slightest offensive touching, because such an interpretation did not fit the statutory context. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014\u2014, 130 S.Ct. at 1270-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-12\">In <em>Owens, </em>we applied <em>Johnson </em>to analyze whether the offenses of second degree rape and second degree sodomy under Alabama law qualified as violent felonies under the elements clause. <em>U.S. v. Owens, </em>672 F.3d 966, 970-72 (11th Cir.2012). Applying the categorical approach, we noted that \u201cforcible compulsion\u201d was not required to violate the second degree rape and second degree sodomy statutes, and the physical requirement of the statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>required only slight penetration with a nonconsenting victim, due to age or mental incapacity. <em>Id. </em>at 971. However, while excluding a battery conviction from satisfying the elements clause as a categorical matter, the <em>Johnson </em>decision left open the possibility that a battery conviction may satisfy the elements clause under the modified categorical approach by looking to the record of the conviction to determine if violent force was an element. <em>See Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1273. However, the \u201cabsence of records\u201d often frustrates the application of the modified categorical approach. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">Terry was convicted under the 2002 version of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(4), which defined lewd or lascivious battery on a minor as:</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">A person who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-7\">(a) Engages in sexual activity with a person 12 years of age or older but less than 16 years of age; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-8\">(b) Encourages, forces, or entices any person less than 16 years of age to engage in sadomasochistic abuse, sexual bestiality, prostitution, or any other act involving sexual activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">Fla.Stat. \u00a7 800.04(4) (2000). Under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(2) and (3), the victim\u2019s consent and the perpetrator\u2019s ignorance of the victim\u2019s age are not defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-10\">In <em>Hams, </em>we addressed whether a prior version of the same statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3)(1996), constituted a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. <em>Hams, </em>608 F.3d at 1225-27. The 1996 version of the statute stated that \u201ca person who [cjommits an act defined as sexual battery under [Fla. Stat. \u00a7 ] 794.011(1)(h) upon any child under the age of 16 years ... is guilty of a felony of the second degree.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) (1996). Sexual battery meant \u201coral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the sexual organ of another.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>608 F.3d at 1225. We employed the categorical approach to determine how offenses under that statute ordinarily would be committed. <em>Id. </em>at 1227-29. In doing so, we noted, \u201cThe proper inquiry is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1228. The risk posed must be similar in kind and degree to the risks posed by the enumerated crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 1227 (quotation and alteration omitted). Specifically, we ask whether the conduct at issue is \u201cpurposeful, violent and aggressive,\u201d or whether \u201cit is a more passive crime of inaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-12\">Using the categorical approach, we determined that sexual battery of a minor always posed a substantial risk of physical injury. <em>Id. </em>at 1230. We noted that the Florida statute at issue \u201ccover[ed] a wide array of conduct,\u201d imposing strict liability for some violations, but also covering \u201cconduct that is undoubtedly intentional or purposeful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1232. Nevertheless, we held that, as a strict liability offense that covered both violent and non-violent conduct, the Florida statute was not similar in kind to the enumerated offenses to constitute a crime of violence under the residual clause. <em>Id. </em>at 1230-33. In reaching this holding, we emphasized that we had considered the statute categorically, and \u201cwithout further specifics\u201d about the facts of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 1232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-13\">The district court did not err in finding that, under the modified categorical approach, Terry\u2019s prior conviction for lewd and lascivious battery on a minor, under \u00a7 800.04(4), constituted a crime of violence sufficient to support his career-offender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>enhancement. Terry correctly notes that, under the categorical approach, we have held that a prior version of the same offense did not qualify as a crime of violence. <em>See Harris, </em>608 F.3d at 1228-33. The district court, however, was permitted to apply the modified categorical approach because Terry\u2019s statute of conviction, \u00a7 800.04(4), contains different statutory phrases \u2014 some of which that qualify as crimes of violence and some of which do not. <em>See Pantle, </em>637 F.3d at 1175; <em>Chit-wood, </em>676 F.3d at 976. In fact, in <em>Harris, </em>we stated that Florida\u2019s lewd and lascivious battery statute can impose strict liability, but it can also criminalize intentional conduct. <em>Harris, </em>608 F.3d at 1232-33. Moreover, we indicated that we had applied the categorical approach because we lacked specifics regarding the circumstances underlying the prior conviction. <em>See id. </em>at 1233 (holding that, \u201ca violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) (1996) generally\u2014 <em>without further specifics </em>\u2014 is not a crime of violence\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Unlike in <em>Harris, </em>the district court here had access to \u201cspecifics\u201d regarding Terry\u2019s prior conviction, beyond merely the statutory language and charging document. The government submitted a transcript of Terry\u2019s plea hearing, a Shepard-approved document, showing that he agreed to the state\u2019s factual basis for his plea. <em>See Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1328. Specifically, the state prosecutor asserted that the 14-year-old victim had reported being raped and a medical evaluation corroborated her report, showing that she had tears, abrasions, and lacerations near her vagina. Terry argues that he agreed to the factual basis for his plea in state court because he believed the guilty plea to be in his best interest, not because he committed any forcible acts. Nonetheless, the district court was permitted to rely on the plea hearing transcript, under the modified categorical approach, in determining whether Terry\u2019s prior offense constituted a crime of violence. <em>See Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1328. The victim\u2019s report that she was raped and the corroborating medical evidence supported the court\u2019s determination that Terry\u2019s offense involved conduct that was \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive,\u201d as opposed to passive conduct that was subject to strict liability. <em>See Harris, </em>608 F.3d at 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">Terry\u2019s reliance on <em>Owens </em>is unavailing because <em>Owens </em>involved our review of Alabama\u2019s second degree rape and second degree sodomy statutes, under the categorical approach, to determine if those statutes satisfied the ACCA\u2019s \u201celements clause.\u201d <em>See Owens, </em>672 F.3d at 970-972. Even if Terry\u2019s statute of conviction, as a categorical matter, fails to satisfy the elements clause of the career offender guideline, <em>Owens </em>did not preclude the district court from employing the modified categorical approach to determine whether Terry\u2019s prior offense satisfied the career offender\u2019s residual clause. <em>See Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1273. Both <em>Owens </em>and <em>Harris </em>involved statutory review under the categorical approach, but here, the district court properly found that, because it had further specifics regarding Terry\u2019s conduct, it was permitted to apply the modified categorical approach in finding that his prior conviction qualified as a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)\u2019s residual clause. In so doing, the district court did not err in determining that Terry\u2019s conduct of raping the 14-year-old victim, such that she had tears and abrasions near her vagina, involved purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Terry\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
