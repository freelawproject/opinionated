Acuna challenges his counsel\u2019s failure to call as witnesses the co-defendants who pleaded guilty. But Acuna knowingly waived his right to contest his counsel\u2019s effectiveness as to this matter. Upon the district court\u2019s inquiries, Acuna specifically agreed \u2022with his counsel\u2019s decision not to call the potential witnesses, acknowledging that it was based on his own \u2014 apart from counsel\u2019s advice \u2014 request. Acuna thus gave up his opportunity to have them testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-12\">This Court has stated that ineffective assistance does not exist under <em>Strickland </em>where the defendant ultimately concurred in his counsel\u2019s tactical decision or strategy. <em>See Hammond v. Hall, </em>586 F.3d 1289, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2009). In <em>Ross v. Wainwright, </em>738 F.2d 1217 (11th Cir.1984), defense counsel largely elected not to contest guilt or present a defense. This Court said that, based on \u201cthe repeated statements by counsel in discussing his strategy and the full acquiescence of the defendant, ... the district court did not err in concluding that [the defendant] had waived his right to attack the effectiveness of counsel on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1222. Besides counsel\u2019s statements, we noted that the petitioner\u2019s acquiescence in the discussions with respect to the nature of his counsel\u2019s conduct made the case one in which \u201cmere assent in response to a series of questions from the bench constitute^] an adequate waiver\u201d of ineffective assistance of counsel claims. <em>Id. </em>at 1221 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-13\">Acuna was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s decision not to call as witnesses the co-defendants because Acuna essentially waived his right to contest his counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness on that decision by agreeing with that choice at trial. <em>See Hammond, </em>586 F.3d at 1327-28; <em>Wainwright, </em>738 F.2d at 1221-22. After Acuna\u2019s counsel informed the district court that he would not call the co-defendants and other witnesses, who were available in the courthouse, the district court specifically informed Acuna that he (not his counsel) had the right to present evidence and witnesses. Acuna acknowledged that he un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>derstood his rights and his counsel\u2019s decision; and, upon the district court\u2019s further inquiry after a single witness testified, Acuna confirmed that it was his decision to call no more witnesses. When both parties rested, Acuna again indicated that he had decided to present no more evidence. Moreover, following the closing arguments, Acuna verified that his counsel decided not to call the co-defendants as witnesses after consulting with Acuna and that he had requested that they not testify. Because Acuna fully participated in the decision not to have the witnesses testify \u2014 while knowing of the potential exculpatory nature of their testimonies \u2014 and given his responses to the district court\u2019s questions concerning that decision, he waived his right to attack his counsel\u2019s effectiveness on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">Besides, the record affirmatively contradicts Acuna\u2019s allegation that he suffered from \u2014 was prejudiced by \u2014 reliance on his counsel\u2019s advice, as ultimately Acuna himself decided not to call the co-defendants based on the risk to his father\u2019s defense. Acuna confirmed that his counsel had not unduly influenced that decision. Therefore, the district court correctly concluded that it was not reasonably probable that Acuna would have called the co-defendants to testify, and that, indeed, Acuna himself finally decided that they would not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">In addition, the record does not support Acuna\u2019s allegations that his counsel relied on another person\u2019s counsel\u2019s advice and failed to investigate reasonably the co-defendants\u2019 prospective testimonies. Acuria\u2019s counsel was aware of the potential exculpatory nature of the co-defendants\u2019 testimonies for Acuna and their potential incriminating impact on Acuna\u2019s father. Counsel expressed in open court that, despite advising Acuna of the possibly exonerating testimonies, Acuna did not want to call the co-defendants as witnesses because they could harm his father\u2019s defense. Given that Acuna did not object to these statements by counsel (but agreed with them) the record shows that counsel\u2019s actions were properly based on informed choices made and information supplied by Acuna. Accordingly, Acuna\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is -without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
