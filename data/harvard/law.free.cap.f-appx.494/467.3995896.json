Francois pleaded guilty to counts 4 and 5 of a 32-count indictment charging her with wire fraud related to her activities as a mortgage broker. She has appealed her sentence, contending that the district court erred in determining the loss attributable to her fraudulent conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-28\">The district court found that the loss amount attributable to Francois was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>$153,359, which was the amount that Francois had redirected to her businesses as kickback proceeds. Citing <em>United States v. Goss, </em>549 F.3d 1013 (5th Cir.2008), Francois contends that the district court should have undertaken a loan-by-loan analysis of the value of any available collateral instead of focusing on the extent of her purported gain. She contends that most of the loans she brokered are fully performing and that, therefore, no loss was sustained by the lenders. She contends also that any loss sustained by the lenders was not caused by her fraudulent conduct and should not be attributed to her. There is no evidence, she argues, that she intended that the lenders would suffer a loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">In <em>Goss, </em>we determined that <em>actual loss </em>in a mortgage fraud case is \u201cdetermined by deducting the value of the collateral from the total - loan amounts.\u201d <em>United States v. Murray, </em>648 F.3d 251, 255 (5th Cir.2011) (discussing <em>Goss, </em>549 F.3d at 1017-18), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1065, 181 L.Ed.2d 781 (2012). In the district court, Francois took the position that the actual losses could not be determined and that the total loss should be limited to the amount by which she profited from the criminal enterprise. She did not argue, as she does on appeal, that the district court should have determined the actual loss using the methodology in <em>Goss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Therefore, we have reviewed the issues asserted by Francois for plain error. <em>See United States v. Sotelo, </em>97 F.3d 782, 793 (5th Cir.1996). To show, plain error, Francois must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects her substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If she makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Under the Guidelines, financial losses are determined by using the greater of actual loss or intended loss. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)) (2010). When there is a loss but the amount of the loss cannot reasonably be determined, however, the sentencing court shall determine \u201cthe gain that resulted from the offense as an alternative measure of loss.\u201d \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(B)). The district court is only required to \u201cmake a reasonable estimate of loss,\u201d and its findings are \u201centitled to appropriate deference.\u201d <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>681 F.3d 678, 713-14 (5th Cir.2012), <em>petitions for cert. filed </em>(Aug. 9 and 16, 2012) (Nos. 12-5812 &amp; 12-5847); <em>see also Goss, </em>549 F.3d at 1019; \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">In this case, the district court concluded that the actual and intended amount of the loss could not be determined, and it based its loss determination on the amount by which Francois gained from her fraudulent scheme. After reviewing the record, we hold that it was reasonable for the district court to determine the amount of the loss on that basis. <em>See Brooks, </em>681 F.3d at 713-14; <em>United States v. McMillan, </em>600 F.3d 434, 458-59 (5th Cir.2010) (district court did not clearly err in determining loss at sentencing on basis of defendants\u2019 gain from offense because amount of victims\u2019 loss could not be reasonably calculated). Francois has not shown that the district court committed a clear or obvious error in calculating the loss based on the sums by which Francois\u2019s businesses gained from the offense and relevant conduct. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423; \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)(ii) &amp; (B)). The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
