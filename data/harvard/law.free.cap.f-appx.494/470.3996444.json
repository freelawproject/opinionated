Lara-Castillo argues that the IJ and the BIA erred in denying his application for cancellation of removal because he established that his removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his United States citizen children, who face kidnaping for extortion purposes if forced to accompany him to Mexico. However, because Lara-Castillo\u2019s claim does not involve a constitutional claim or a question of law, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination, as affirmed by the BIA, that Lara-Castillo failed to show the requisite \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to his two United States citizen children. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>see Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004). Lara-Castillo\u2019s petition for review is therefore dismissed insofar as it challenges the agency\u2019s discretionary denial of cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Lara-Castillo argues that the BIA and the IJ erred as a matter of law in denying his applications for asylum and withholding of removal because, as a Mexican parent of two United States citizen children who face kidnaping and extortion by criminals or gang members, he fears persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group. He characterizes his group as \u201cMexican parents of United States citizen children who face abduction and extortion because of their nationality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">To qualify for asylum and withholding of removal, a petitioner must establish persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution in his country, by the government or a person or group that the government is unable or unwilling to control, on the basis of any of five categories of which membership in a particular social group is one. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Members of a particular social group \u201cshare a common immutable characteristic that they either cannot change or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\u201d <em>Mwembie v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 405, 414-15 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, absent a nexus between the social group and the claimed persecution, Lara-Castillo cannot establish eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Tamara-Gomez v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 343, 348-50 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Lara-Castillo testified before the IJ that the gangs\u2019 motivation for extortion or theft is a desire for money, not a desire to punish or target him for membership in his social group. There is no evidence to suggest that gangs or other criminals would target him because his children are United States citizens. Actions based on a desire for money are not connected to persecution based on a protected category. <em>See Shaikh v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 861, 864 (5th Cir.2009). Even if Lara-Castillo had established his membership in a cognizable social group, no reasonable factfinder would be compelled to conclude that he established a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his purported membership in that group. Thus, even if he is a member of a particular social group defined as parents of United States citizen children, Lara-Castillo has not shown that he would be harmed because of the shared characteristic that establishes his membership in that group, i.e., because his children are United States citizens. The harm he fears \u2014 criminal violence based on financial motives \u2014 is not a basis for relief. <em>See Shaikh, </em>588 F.3d at 864. Lara-Castillo\u2019s petition for review of the denial of his asylum and withholding of removal applications is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">Lara-Castillo asks this court to remand his case to the IJ for consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>of new evidence of hardship to his children, as they will suffer greater hardship now that they are older. He also seeks consideration of new evidence of the \u201cmarked deteriorations in the violent country conditions of Mexico.\u201d The new evidence he seeks to present is cumulative of earlier evidence of violent country conditions in Mexico and fails to demonstrate that any acts of violence or extortion that might befall Lara-Castillo and his children would amount to persecution on account of a protected ground. Lara-Castillo\u2019s request for a remand is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART; REQUEST FOR REMAND DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b493-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
