On appeal, Smith contends that the district court erred by imposing an enhanced sentence based on a felony conviction that was not set forth in the indictment and not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. He recognizes that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), decided that a prior conviction is not an element of the offense under section 1326(b); but he argues that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) have called the validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>into question. We affirm Smith\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-12\">We review constitutional sentencing issues <em>de novo. United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 978 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Air mendarez-Toms, </em>the Supreme Court explained that a prior conviction used to enhance a sentence under section 1326(b)(2) is no element of the offense, and therefore, it need not be alleged in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 226-27, 118 S.Ct. at 1222. Although <em>Apprendi </em>and later decisions might have cast doubt on the reasoning of <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>we have repeatedly explained that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding precedent unless and until that case is expressly overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>Steed, </em>548 F.3d at 979-80; <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273-76 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246-47 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-13\">Smith\u2019s argument that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence based on an earlier conviction not charged in the indictment or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt is foreclosed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number><em>Almendarez-Torres.
