After he was denied a promotion to the position of Correctional Captain in 2004, Jackson filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) claiming that he was denied the promotion on account of his race, black. Jackson did not pursue the claim and continued on in his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-17\">The seeds for the present litigation were planted in July 2007, when the Department posted a vacancy in the Correctional Captain position. Jackson knew of the posting but did not apply. The Department posted a vacancy in the Correctional Captain position again in 2009. As before, Jackson, who lacked a bachelor\u2019s degree, one of the requirements for the position, did not apply. In any event, the posting was withdrawn because the bachelor\u2019s degree requirement had not been approved by the County\u2019s Human Resource (\u201cHR\u201d) department. HR subsequently approved the requirement, however, and the job was reposted, in February 2010. Jackson, still lacking a bachelor\u2019s degree, did not apply. A few days later, he filed a charge with the EEOC, claiming that the Department retaliated against him in 2007, 2009 and 2010 for filing the EEOC charge in 2005 by adding a bachelor\u2019s degree job requirement for the Correctional Captain posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After receiving his right-to-sue letter, he brought this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Following discovery, the Department moved the District Court for summary judgment. The court granted its motion. In its dispositive order entered on June 30, 2011, the court found that Jackson\u2019s claim failed because he had not applied for any of the positions and, had he applied, he would not have been chosen because he lacked a bachelor\u2019s degree. Moreover, the 2007 failure-to-promote claim was time-barred, and the 2010 claim was barred because his 2010 EEOC charge failed to allege that the bachelor\u2019s-degree requirement in the 2010 posting was in retaliation for his 2005 EEOC charge. Jackson now appeals, arguing that he established a pri-ma facie case of retaliation sufficient to carry his case to a jury. For the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s June 30, 2011 order, we find no merit in his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-8\">. The charge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-9\">I believe that I have been retaliated against by the department and by Marydell Guevara (Deputy Director) because I filed an EEOC charge against Respondent in 2005 alleging failure to promote because of my race, black.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-10\">In 2005, Susan Torrienta assured me that the promotion process would be changed. Shortly thereafter, Deputy Director Mary-dell Guevara (Hispanic) made the statement that as long she was Deputy, I would never be promoted to Correctional Captain since that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-11\">In 2007 and September 2009, Respondent's job announcement for the Correctional Captain position stated that applicants must have a bachelor\u2019s degree. I do not have a bachelor\u2019s degree and did not apply for the position. In September 2009, I learned that Respondent did not have approval to change the qualifications for the Correctional Captain position by listing bachelor's degree as a requirement. This was verified by Linda Webber in the compensation department and the 2009 job announcement was withdrawn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABX\">I have served as Acting Correctional Captain on many occasions and I am qualified for the position. I believe that the job requirement for the Correctional Captain position was changed from the 2000 version (which did not require a bachelor\u2019s degree) in an effort to prevent me from being promoted.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
