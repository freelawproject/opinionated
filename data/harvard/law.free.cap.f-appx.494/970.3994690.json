Through these motions, Anuforo sought review of the BIA\u2019s prior order affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) denial of his application for cancellation of removal, filed pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a). On petition for review, Anuforo argues the BIA erred by denying his motions because the BIA failed to adequately account for his positive equities and failed to consider significant evidence regarding, both his and his wife\u2019s serious medical issues.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we dismiss Anuforo\u2019s petition in part and deny the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-14\">As an initial matter, we review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Martinez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2006). We do not have jurisdiction to review any judgment regarding the grant of cancellation of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae. Despite this jurisdictional bar, we retain jurisdiction over such judgments to the extent the petitioner raises constitutional claims or questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We have explained that, where we are without jurisdiction to consider an attack on a final order of removal, we also lack jurisdiction to consider an attack by means of a motion to reopen or motion for reconsideration. <em>See Patel v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>334 F.3d 1259, 1261-62 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-16\">Here, our reasoning in <em>Patel </em>controls.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the underlying proceedings, Anuforo sought cancellation of removal pursuant to \u00a7 1229b(a), and had he sought review of the BIA\u2019s original order denying his application, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae would have deprived us of jurisdiction to consider his petition. Thus, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>precludes us from reviewing his attempt to challenge that order through a motion to reopen or motion to reconsider. <em>See Patel, </em>834 F.3d at 1262. To the extent Anuforo argues the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motions, we must dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">As noted above, the jurisdictional limitations in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00a9 do not preclude us from reviewing constitutional or legal claims. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). An alien cannot, however, present a challenge to evidentiary sufficiency as a meaningful question of law. <em>Garcia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>329 F.3d 1217, 1222 (11th Cir.2003). Nor may an alien frame \u201ca garden-variety abuse of discretion argument\u201d as a question of law to circumvent the jurisdictional bar in \u00a7 1252(a)(2). <em>Alvarez Acosta v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>524 F.3d 1191, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">In this case, although we retain jurisdiction over constitutional or legal claims, the arguments raised by Anuforo in his petition effectively ask us to review the BIA\u2019s weighing of the positive and negative factors presented in both the underlying proceedings and the motions to reopen and to reconsider. Despite his characterization of these arguments as questions of law, Anu-foro really challenges the BIA\u2019s conclusion that he was not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion, a determination that we lack jurisdiction to review. <em>Alvarez Acosta, </em>524 F.3d at 1196-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">To the extent Anuforo raises a question of law regarding the BIA\u2019s failure to consider evidence of both his and his wife\u2019s recent illnesses, this argument is without merit. The BIA may not engage in factfinding on appeal; rather \u201c[a] party asserting that the [BIA] cannot properly resolve an appeal without further factfind-ing must file a motion for remand.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). Here, the medical evidence was never properly presented to the BIA because it was not accompanied by a motion to remand the matter to the IJ. Thus, the BIA did not err in failing to consider Anuforo\u2019s medical evidence because it was precluded by regulation from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"ACG\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b993-11\">. We decline to address the additional arguments Anuforo raises for the first time in his reply brief. <em>See At Najjar </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283 n. 12 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that a petitioner abandons issues by failing to raise them in his initial brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b993-18\">. The Supreme Court recently explained that federal courts generally have jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>review orders denying motions to reopen. <em>Kucana v. Holder, </em>558 U.S. 233, 130 S.Ct. 827, 840, 175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010). The Supreme Court reserved judgment as to whether a federal court may review a motion to reopen if it would lack jurisdiction to review the petitioner's underlying claim for relief. <em>Id. </em>at 839 n. 17. Thus, <em>Kucana </em>does not affect the validity of <em>Patel, </em>which remains binding precedent in this Circuit. <em>See United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that a published decision of this Court \"is binding on all subsequent panels unless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this court sitting <em>en banc.\").</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
