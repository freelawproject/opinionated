Land argues here that the Commissioner did not properly assess his residual functional capacity (RFC) and, as a result, did not properly formulate hypothetical questions for the vocational expert (VE).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">In appeals from the denial of social security benefits, we review the ALJ\u2019s decision as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision when, as in this case, the ALJ denies benefits and the Appeals Council denies review. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cWe review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Hale v. Bowen, </em>831 F.2d 1007, 1011 (11th Cir.1987). \u201cIt is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Like the district court, \u201c[w]e may not decide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240 n. 8 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">Under the Social Security Act, a person is disabled if he is unable \u201cto do any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1505(a). If disabled, a claimant is eligible for payment of disability insurance and supplemental security income. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423(a)(1), 1382(a)(1); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.315(a)(3), 416.202(a)(3).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-12\">The Social Security Regulations outline a five-step, sequential evaluation process used to determine whether a claimant is disabled: (1) whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment or combination of impairments; (3) whether the impairment meets or equals the severity of the specified impairments in the Listing of Impairments; (4) based on a[RFC] assessment, whether the claimant can perform any of his or her past relevant work despite the impairment; and (5) whether there are significant numbers of jobs in the national economy that the claimant can perform given the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-13\"><em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011); <em>see also Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). \u201cThe burden is primarily on the claimant to prove that he is disabled, and therefore entitled to receive Social Security disability benefits.\u201d <em>Doughty, </em>245 F.3d at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Land argues that the Commissioner erred at the fourth step of the evaluation process. Again, step four assesses the claimant\u2019s RFC to determine whether the claimant is capable of performing \u201cpast relevant work.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv). A claimant\u2019s RFC takes into account both physical and mental limitations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a)(1). The ALJ found that Land \u201chas the [RFC] to perform light work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(b) and 416.967(b), except that he can only occasionally climb, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, crawl, and reach overhead using his right upper extremity.\u201d The ALJ further determined that Land \u201cshould ... avoid concentrated exposure to heavy machinery.\u201d Finally, the ALJ found that Land \u201ccan perform only simple, routine, repetitive tasks, without traveling, using numbers, driving, or supervising.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Land alleges that the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment, particularly the ALJ\u2019s finding that Land \u201ccan perform ... simple, routine, repetitive tasks,\u201d is \u201cnot supported by substantial evidence.\u201d He suggests that this is so because each of the doctors that evaluated Land for mental limitations in advance of the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment determined that he suffered from various \u201cmental health impairments.\u201d In particular, Land emphasizes that on their standard assessment worksheets, two doctors \u2014 Dr. Michael Zelen-ka and Dr. Alejandro Vergara \u2014 checked the box \u201cModerately Limited\u201d with regard to Land\u2019s \u201cability to complete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms and to perform at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number and length of rest periods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AHu\">We are not persuaded by Land\u2019s argument because it fails to consider <em>\u201call </em>the relevant medical and other evidence\u201d that was available to the ALJ. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a)(3) (emphasis added). The Social Security Administration\u2019s Programs Operations Manual System (POMS) clarifies that the boxes checked by Dr. Zelenka and Dr. Vergara are only part of a worksheet that \u201cdoes not constitute the [doctors\u2019 actual] RFC assessment.\u201d POMS DI \u00a7 24510.060(B)(2). Checking the box \u201cModerately Limited\u201d means only that the claimant\u2019s capacity is impaired; it does not indicate the degree and extent of the limitation. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 24510.068(B)(2). After checking the boxes as an \u201caid,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 24510.060(B)(2), a doctor is then required to detail his actual RFC assessment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 24510.060(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"AS\">Consistent with these directives, both Dr. Zelenka and Dr. Vergara, after checking the various boxes, elaborated on their opinions regarding Land\u2019s ability to perform in a work environment. Dr. Zelenka stated: \u201c[G]iven only simple instructions] to carry out, limited public contact, the ability to work relatively independently, with some allowances for occasional psychological problems] affecting productivity, <em>[Land] retains adequate mental ability to carry out simple instructions] and to relate adequately to others in a routine work setting[.] </em>\u201d (emphasis added). Dr. Vergara came to similar conclusions, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-11\">[Land] may experience difficulties trying to carry out detailed instructions and if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>he has to maintain concentration for extended periods of time. He may have difficulties too, having to respond appropriately to instructions and criticism from supervisors and if he attempts to set realistic goals independently. However taking in consideration all the information in file, longitudinal history, recent CE and recently reported ADL\u2019s, indicates that <em>\u2018claimant retains the necessary mental capabilities to at least do simple, type tasks and </em>assignments.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ai3\">(emphasis added). These opinions are consistent with the ALJ\u2019s finding that Land \u201ccan perform only simple, routine, repetitive tasks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">We reiterate that \u201c[w]e may not decide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240 n. 8 (quotation marks and alterations omitted). As set out above, \u201cwe must defer to the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Because more than a scintilla of evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment here, we will not second-guess the Commissioner\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Land also argues that the Commissioner erred at step five of the disability evaluation process. At step five the claimant has proved that he can no longer perform his past relevant work and \u201cthe burden shifts to the Commissioner to show the existence of other jobs in the national economy which, given the claimant\u2019s impairments, the claimant can perform.\u201d <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999) (quotation marks omitted). The ALJ may rely solely on the testimony of a VE to meet this burden. <em>Id. </em>at 1230. For the testimony of a VE to constitute substantial evidence, however, \u201cthe ALJ must pose a hypothetical question which comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Land alleges that the \u201cALJ ... failed to ask hypothetical questions to the [VE] that included all of ... Land\u2019s [m]ental [RFC] limitations.\u201d Here, at the assessment hearing, the ALJ asked the VE whether a hypothetical individual could perform other work in the national economy if that individual were of Land\u2019s age, education, and work experience, had the same physical limitations, and was \u201ccapable based upon Exhibit B-13F [the mental RFC assessment completed by Dr. Vergara] of performing simple, routine, repetitive tasks.\u201d The VE responded in the affirmative, and identified other jobs existing in significant numbers that Land could perform, specifically \u201cthat of an office helper ... [or] a ticket seller.\u201d The ALJ then asked the VE if that hypothetical individual could still perform those jobs if \u201cbecause of stress,\u201d the individual \u201cshould do no traveling,\u201d \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to meet any quotas,\u201d and should not drive or supervise. The VE indicated that the individual would still be able to perform those jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">We have held that an ALJ\u2019s hypothetical restricting the claimant to simple and routine tasks adequately accounts for mental limitations where the medical evidence demonstrates that the claimant retains the ability to perform those tasks despite deficiencies. <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1180 (\u201c[W]hen medical evidence demonstrates that a claimant can engage in simple, routine tasks or unskilled work despite limitations in concentration, persistence, and pace, courts have concluded that limiting the hypothetical to include only unskilled work sufficiently accounts for such limitations.\u201d). As indicated by the mental RFC assessments completed by Dr. Zelenka and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Dr. Vergara, Land retained the mental capacity to perform \u201csimple\u201d tasks despite his limitations. By limiting the hypothetical to an individual \u201ccapable ... of performing simple, routine, repetitive tasks\u201d based on Dr. Vergara\u2019s mental RFC assessment, the ALJ properly incorporated the relevant medical evidence regarding Land\u2019s mental limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny benefits is supported by substantial evidence and is based upon the proper legal standards. The Commissioner\u2019s decision is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\">. Land focuses his appeal exclusively on the ALJ's assessment of his mental limitations. He does not contest the AU\u2019s assessment of his physical limitations. That being the case, any potential arguments regarding the ALJ\u2019s assessment of his physical limitations are waived and abandoned. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
