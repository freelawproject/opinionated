On appeal, Bennett argues that a weapons-possession enhancement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(14)(B), should not apply to his sentence since no evidence showed that Bennett had possessed a weapon at the time he made false statements on his military housing application. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s determination of whether the defendant possessed a firearm in connection with the offense for purposes of a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(14)(B) enhancement. <em>See United States v. McClain, </em>252 F.3d 1279, 1284, 1288 (11th Cir.2001) (upholding application of dangerous weapons enhancement, which was nearly identical to \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(14)(B), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1, later deleted and consolidated with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G.App. C., amend. 617). For a district court determination to be clearly erroneous, we, after reviewing all of the evidence, must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>United States v. Foster, </em>155 F.3d 1329, 1331 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cWhere the evidence has two possible interpretations, the district court\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\">When reviewing a district court\u2019s sentence, we do not necessarily have to decide guidelines issues or remand cases for new sentence proceedings where the guidelines error, if any, did not affect the sentence. <em>United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1349 (11th Cir.2006). To determine if the error was harmless, we, first, must determine that the district court would have imposed the same sentence even if it had decided the guidelines issue in the defendant\u2019s favor. <em>Id. </em>Second, the sentence must be reasonable based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the advisory guidelines range, which did not include the alleged guidelines error. <em>Id. </em>at 1349-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">For an offense of fraud or deceit, the Sentencing Guidelines require the offense level to be enhanced if the offense involved \u201cpossession of a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) in connection with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(14)(B). We have held that courts should give the guidelines phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d its ordinary meaning. <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 695 (11th Cir.2002). We have held that the ordinary meaning of \u201cin connection with\u201d does not require that the weapon was used to facilitate the underlying offense. <em>Id. </em>We have not addressed explicitly the full meaning of \u201cin connection with\u201d as used in \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(14)(B) but, in <em>McClain, </em>we applied a nearly identical guideline, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1, later deleted and consolidated with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C., amend. 617; <em>McClain, </em>252 F.3d at 1288. In <em>McClain, </em>a defendant had driven young recruits to businesses and waited for them in a car while they cashed counterfeit checks. <em>McClain, </em>252 F.3d at 1281-82. A search of the defendant\u2019s car had revealed a firearm in the passenger compartment. <em>Id. </em>at 1282. A recruit told law enforcement that the defendant always kept a firearm in the vehicle when the defendant drove her to cash checks. <em>Id. </em>We held that, since the defendant had supervised a scheme with a large amount of cash in conjunction with young recruits with whom he was relatively unfamiliar, it was reasonable to infer that the defendant had carried the firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d the scheme to prevent a \u201crip-off.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1288. We based that holding on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">We have also consistently applied an expansive definition to the \u201cin connection with\u201d phrase in other guidelines contexts. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, </em>276 F.3d 1231, 1234-35 (11th Cir.2001) (unlawful possession, \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5)); <em>United States v. Matos-Rodriguez, </em>188 F.3d 1300, 1308-09 (11th Cir.1999) (counterfeiting, \u00a7 2B5.1(b)(3)); <em>United States v. Young, </em>115 F.3d 834, 837-38 (11th Cir.1997) (armed career criminal, \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A)). In <em>Jackson, </em>when police had attempted to arrest the defendant on an outstanding warrant, the defendant, without ever reaching a gun, repeatedly attempted to reach into his pocket, which contained a gun, while he assaulted and battered the arresting officers. <em>Jackson, </em>276 F.3d at 1232-33. We found no clear error where the district court had determined that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>defendant had made a real and determined effort to use the gun \u201cin connection with\u201d the assault of the officers. <em>Id. </em>at 1235. In <em>Matos-Rodriguez, </em>after the defendant sold counterfeit money to a police informant, the defendant threw a pistol out of his car window during a high-speed chase with police. <em>Matos-Rodriguez, </em>188 F.3d at 1302-03. We found no clear error where the district court had determined that the defendant had possessed a pistol \u201cin connection with\u201d his selling counterfeit money. <em>Id. </em>at 1309.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">In <em>Young, </em>a search of the defendant\u2019s apartment had uncovered guns, one of which had been stolen in an earlier burglary where the defendant\u2019s fingerprints had been found. <em>Young, </em>115 F.3d at 835. We held that an armed career criminal possesses a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d a crime of violence when that firearm is obtained during the commission of a burglary, even if the firearm was not used to facilitate the burglary. <em>Id. </em>at 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Based on the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, the \u201cin connection with\u201d phrase in its subsections (b)(6)(B) and (c)(1) in general applies if the firearm or ammunition facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n.14). The commentary to the application instructions of the Sentencing Guidelines says that definitions of terms that appear in specific guideline sections are not designed for general applicability, and their applicability to other sections must be determined on a case by case basis. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment, (n.2). The relevant conduct to determine a guideline range includes all acts and omissions committed by the defendant that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A). Where U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple counts, relevant conduct includes all acts and omissions that are part of the same course of conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2). If the offense behavior is ongoing or continuous in nature and the offense guideline is written to cover such behavior, offenses are to be grouped or are excluded from grouping depending on how the offenses are listed in this subsection. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d). If offenses are not listed in \u00a7 3D1.2(d), multiple offenses may or may not be grouped depending on a case-by-case determination based on the facts of the case and the applicable guidelines. <em>Id. </em>The sentencing guidelines do not apply to any count of conviction that is a Class B misdemeanor. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">Here, for purposes of his false-statement offense, Bennett had agreed by lease to follow various security regulations at the military base. Bennett violated those security regulations when he possessed unauthorized weapons at his on-base apartment, the apartment which he had obtained through his false-statement offense. Bennett\u2019s failure to disclose or seek authorization to possess the firearms helped Bennett avoid detection of his false-statement offense. Therefore, the district court did not clearly err when the court applied the weapons possession enhancement to Bennett\u2019s guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">But even if we were to determine that the application of the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(14)(B) enhancement was clearly erroneous, the error was harmless. The district court said that it had considered a higher sentence, but \u201ccame down with\u201d the 36-month sentence to give Bennett the benefit of the doubt and to match the government\u2019s recommendation. As for Bennett\u2019s claim that the phrase \u201ccame down with\u201d did not mean that the court had considered a higher sentence and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>reduced it, Bennett\u2019s interpretation is strained when read in context. As the record shows, the district court said in the immediately preceding sentence that it had considered a higher sentence. Further, the district court later announced that it did not matter to the court how the 36-month sentence was reached as long as Bennett\u2019s sentence was 36 months. This statement, by itself and in context, supports the view that the court would have sentenced Bennett to 36 months even without the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(14)(B) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Moreover, even assuming Bennett\u2019s guideline range was 1-7 months,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a 36-month sentence was not substantively unreasonable on this record. The district court carefully explained that Bennett\u2019s presence and his cache of weaponry presented a significant security breach, and Bennett had displayed a pattern of falsehoods. Thus, any error in the guidelines calculation was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b975-16\">. We based this range on an offense conduct of 6 and a criminal history category of II.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
