We affirm the court\u2019s judgment on the ground that O\u2019Hara\u2019s claims were time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">As the District Court correctly stated in its July 27, 2011 order, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1) prescribes the time for the filing of a Title VII claim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-11\">A charge under this section shall be filed within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred ... except that in a case of an unlawful employment practice with respect to which the person aggrieved has initially instituted proceedings with a State or local agency with authority to grant or seek relief from such practice or to institute criminal proceedings with respect thereto upon receiving notice thereof, such charge shall be filed by or on behalf of the person aggrieved within three hundred days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred, or within thirty days after receiving notice that the State or local agency has terminated the proceedings under the State or local law, whichever is earlier.... \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(l).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-14\">\u201cSince Florida is a deferral state, a charge must be filed within 300 days of the last discriminatory act.\u201d <em>Davis v. Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Office, </em>170 Fed.Appx. 598, 600 (11th Cir.2005)(noting that deferral states prohibit the unlawful employment practice at issue and have established state or local authorities to grant or seek relief for such practice). The requirement, therefore, is that the \u201clitigant has up to .. 300 days after the unlawful practice happened to file a charge with the EEOC.\u201d <em>AMTRAK v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 109-110, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b995-15\">Order at 1-2. O\u2019Hara filed her charge of discrimination with the Florida Commission on Human Relations on March 9, 2006. The 300-day period had thus begun on May 13, 2005. The discriminatory acts O\u2019Hara alleged culminated on April 27, 2005, when UWF made the decision to have her work from her residence. As the court accurately stated, \u201cfrom April 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>2005, to the termination of her contract on September 29, 2005, [O\u2019Hara] had no contact with ... the alleged harassers-Thus, all of the alleged misconduct occurred outside of the 300-day limitations period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b995-16\">. The court granted the motion on the retaliation claim, and subsequently dismissed her claim as stated in O\u2019Hara\u2019s fifth amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
