Although the Federal Sentencing Guidelines range was 24 to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment, the sentencing judge imposed an upward departure and an upward variance to arrive at the 48-month sentence. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1). On appeal, Tennison argues that the district court\u2019s upward variance was substantively unreasonable. After a thorough review of the record and briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-13\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b988-14\">On November 2, 2011, Tennison pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful production of an identification document, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(1). The maximum statutory penalty for the offense is 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. A United States Probation Officer prepared Tennison\u2019s pre-sentence investigation report (PSR) and calculated the Guidelines range to be between 24 and 30 months. Although the sentencing judge adopted the PSR, he stated: \u201c[TJhere are grounds for an upward departure, a greater sentence than that called for by the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d After discussing Tennison\u2019s lengthy criminal history and his manipulation of his co-defendants, the judge imposed a 48-month sentence \u2014 18 to 24 months above the Guidelines range \u2014 based on: (1) the inadequacy of the PSR\u2019s criminal history category; and (2) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s upward-variance factors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-15\">During the sentencing hearing, the Government suggested to the court that it had imposed both an upward departure and an upward variance because of its consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>ation of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court responded: \u201cWell, I think that\u2019s correct as a technical matter.\u201d Following the hearing, in its Statement of Reasons the court also pointed to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 \u2014 the inadequacy of Tennison\u2019s criminal history category \u2014 as the reason for the upward departure. Tennison now appeals the substantive reasonability of the sentencing judge\u2019s upward variance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence must be both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597 (\u201cAssuming that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound, the appellate court should then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence_\u201d \u2019); <em>United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1273 (11th Cir.2008). We will only vacate a sentence for substantive unreasonableness upon a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. McGarity, </em>669 F.3d 1218, 1264 (11th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, McGarity v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 378, 184 L.Ed.2d 220 (2012). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of proof. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">We are convinced from the record that the district court properly applied 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) to the facts of this case and imposed a substantively reasonable sentence. During the sentencing hearing, the district judge considered Tennison\u2019s history and characteristics<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> when he referred to the \u201ccommon thread suggested by [Tennison\u2019s] activities over the past three or four years.\u201d Tennison\u2019s activities over the past four years included: (1) a 2008 charge for two counts of forgery; (2) a 2009 conviction for violation of the RICO Act; (3) a July 2010 charge for criminal attempt \u2014 theft by taking; criminal damage to property; larceny; and invasion of privacy \u2014 criminal trespass; (4) an October 2010 charge for criminal attempt to commit a felony; knowingly driving a vehicle with a suspended, cancelled, or revoked registration; no insurance; and driving with a suspended/revoked registration; and finally (5) a November 2010 charge for armed robbery; kidnapping; theft by taking a motor vehicle; and burglary. Tenni-son had also been convicted of aggravated battery in 1992 and robbery in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-13\">Albeit without mentioning specifics, the district court also found that there was a need for the sentence to better reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>for the law, and provide just punishment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Likewise, the court found that an upward variance would afford greater deterrence to criminal conduct<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and protect the public from further crimes of Tennison.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Given that the district court explicitly considered Tennison\u2019s extensive criminal history, we are not persuaded that the district court committed a clear error of judgment. Tennison argues that there were no \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d warranting an \u201cextraordinary\u201d 60% \u2014 100% percent increase from the Guidelines range of 24 to 30 months. We reject, as the Supreme Court requires us to, \u201can appellate rule that requires \u2018extraordinary\u2019 circumstances to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 47, 128 S.Ct. at 595. The percentage increase from the Guidelines range is relevant, <em>see United States v. Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d 1291, 1317 (11th Cir.2009), but we are not bound by \u201ca rigid mathematical formula that uses the percentage of a departure as the standard for determining the strength of the justifications required for a specific sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 47, 128 S.Ct. at 595. Instead, the proper inquiry is whether there existed a \u201csufficiently compelling\u201d justification for the district court\u2019s departure from the Guidelines range. <em>Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d at 1317 (internal quotation marks omitted). As discussed above, Tennison\u2019s lengthy criminal history and his manipulation of his co-defendants were considered by the district court in accordance with \u00a7 3553(a). Moreover, the fact that Tennison\u2019s 48-month sentence is far below the 15-year minimum is a strong indication of substantive reasonability. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that a sentence was substantively reasonable, in part because it was \u201cwell below the maximum ten-year sentence\u201d \u2019). Giving the district court the deference which it is due, we find no abuse of discretion, and affirm the decision to impose a sentence of 48 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"Akk\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b988-11\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors are: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense; (3) the need to promote respect for the law and afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with education and vocational training and medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b989-10\">. Tennison does not challenge the district court\u2019s imposition of an upward departure; therefore, he has abandoned that issue. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2011) (holding that the defendant's failure to challenge the district court's refusal for a downward departure resulted in abandonment of that issue). Even if the district court's upward departure was improper, one of our sister circuits has held that an improper upward departure may be salvaged by a simultaneous upward variance. <em>See United States v. Timbertake, </em>679 F.3d 1008, 1011-12 (8th Cir.2012) (\"We have held that any procedural error in granting an upward departure is harmless when the district court makes it clear that the sentence is also based on an upward variance under the section 3553(a) factors.\u201d). Because Tennison abandoned any argument on the upward departure, we need not decide this issue today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b989-15\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b990-5\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b990-6\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"Ad5\">.18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
