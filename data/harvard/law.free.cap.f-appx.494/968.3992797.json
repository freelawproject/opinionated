Stat. \u00a7 760.10. Moten claims that Broward County intentionally discriminated against her based upon her race by hiring Patrick Karr, a white male, for the same position she held (Forensic Technician I) at a higher hourly wage. Moten argues that she presented sufficient evidence to establish race-based pay discrimination requisite to defeat summary judgment on her claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">Broward County set forth several legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for offering Karr the hourly wage that it did: (1) the office had a pressing need to fill the vacancy; (2) it wished to offset some of Karr\u2019s relocation costs with a higher hourly wage; (8) Karr\u2019s experience warranted a higher hourly wage; and (4) the county official did not know Moten\u2019s hourly wage when he offered Karr the same position at a higher hourly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">Assuming Moten established a prima fa-cie case of intentional racial discrimination, she did not show that Broward County\u2019s proffered reasons were false and that racial discrimination was the true reason for hiring Karr at a higher hourly wage. Accordingly, after a thorough review of the record and the briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Broward County.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">AFFIRMED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
