Lagos\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) indicated a sentence guideline range of 46 to 57 months, based on a criminal history category of III, and a total offense level of 21, including a sixteen-level enhancement for having been previously deported following a conviction for a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Over Lagos\u2019s objection to the sixteen-level enhancement, the district court sentenced him to a term of 46 months imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">On appeal, Lagos argues that his sentence must be vacated because the district court erred by enhancing his sentencing guideline range pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Specifically, Lagos argues that the district court erred in applying the enhancement because \u201chis prior conviction for resisting arrest with violence in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 is not a crime of violence within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).\u201d This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Romo-Villalobos, </em>674 F.3d 1246,1247 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">In 2003, Lagos was convicted in Florida for resisting an officer with violence under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01. In 2007, Lagos was removed from the United States to Honduras. Thus, whether the district court properly applied the enhancement depends on whether Florida\u2019s resisting an officer with violence statute is a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Lagos concedes that we answered precisely this question in the affirmative in <em>Romo-Villalobos, </em>674 F.3d at 1251, and has pointed to no authority overruling or undermining its holding. \u201c[A] prior panel\u2019s holding is binding on all subsequent panels unless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this court sitting <em>en banc.\u201d United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). Thus, Lagos cannot prevail on his argument that his conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 does not sustain an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">Lagos also argues that the district court erred by imposing a sentence that is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. When determining whether a sentence is reasonable, we must first \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Then, assuming that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound, we must \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When conducting this review, we \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Lagos argues that his sentence is proeedurally unreasonable because the district court incorrectly calculated his guideline range based on his prior conviction for resisting an officer with violence, and because the district court failed to give adequate consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, particularly Lagos\u2019s character and history. For reasons already stated, the district court did not err in its determination that Lagos\u2019s conviction for resisting an officer with violence was a crime of violence under the Guidelines. As to Lagos\u2019s argument that the district court failed to \u201cappropriately weigh several \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors [including] the circumstances of [Lagos\u2019s] current immigration offense, his family circumstances, [and] his community service since 2004,\u201d it is clear from the record that the district court did take these factors into consideration. Therefore, we cannot say that the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error\u201d in calculating Lagos\u2019s sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Neither can we say that Lagos\u2019s 46-month sentence, which is at the low end of his guideline range, is substantively unreasonable. Where, as here, \u201ca. sentence is proeedurally reasonable and is within the applicable Guidelines sentencing range,\u201d we look at the totality of the circumstances and ask whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>United States v. Chavez, </em>584 F.3d 1354, 1365 (11th Cir.2009). While we do not apply a presumption of reasonableness to a within-guidelines sentence, \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The record clearly indicates that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors advanced by Lagos in favor of a sentence below the guideline recommendation. The court rejected Lagos\u2019s argument that he deserved a sentence below the guideline recommendation, explaining that because this will be the third time Lagos has been removed from the United States, a sentence at the low end of the guideline range is necessary to deter him from returning illegally. Even if we thought, given the totality of the circumstances, that a different sentence was warranted, \u201c[w]e may not ... set aside a sentence merely because we would have decided that another one is more appropriate.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1191 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cWe may set aside a sentence only if we determine, after giving a full measure of deference to the sentencing judge, that the sentence imposed truly is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On this record, Lagos has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a low-end guideline sentence. We cannot say that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">For these reasons, Lagos\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
