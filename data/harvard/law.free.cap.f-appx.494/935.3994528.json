We dismiss the petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-27\">Larrea, a native and citizen of Ecuador, entered the United States on May 23, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>1999, as a non-immigrant visitor with authorization to remain in the country until November 22 of that year. On November 11, Larrea filed an 1-485 Application to Register Permanent Resident or Adjust Status. Also that day, Zoila Maria Villavi-cencio, who was then Larrea\u2019s wife, filed an 1-130 Petition for Alien Relative \u2014 a visa petition \u2014 on Larrea\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">The former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) interviewed Larrea and Villavicencio about these submissions in July 2000. Then, in April 2001, the INS issued a Notice of Intent to Deny the visa petition based on Larrea and Villavicen-cio\u2019s failure to provide clear and convincing evidence that their marriage was <em>bona fide. </em>The INS gave Villavicencio an opportunity to rebut this finding. Instead, Villavicencio told the INS that she and Larrea were separated and that she intended to divorce him. Consequently, in August and September 2001, the INS denied Larrea\u2019s 1-485 application and the I-130 petition Villavicencio filed on his behalf. Larrea and Villavicencio divorced in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">In March 2009, Larrea filed a second I-485 application. This time, his daughter, a United States citizen, filed an 1-130 petition on his behalf. In June 2009, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS\u2019s) Citizenship and Immigration Service (CIS), which replaced INS, sent Lar-rea a notification that his 1-185 application had been approved.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Just two days later, however, CIS issued a Notice of Intent to Deny the 1-130 petition based upon the CIS District Director\u2019s determination that the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) \u00a7 204(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(c), applied to Larrea\u2019s case. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-9\">[N]o petition shall be approved if ... the alien has previously been accorded, or has sought to be accorded, an immediate relative or preference status as the spouse of a citizen of the United States ..., by reason of a marriage determined by the Attorney General to have been entered into for the purpose of evading the immigration laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">INA \u00a7 204(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(c). CIS indicated that, based on INS\u2019s findings in connection with the 1999 visa petition, Lar-rea married Villavicencio solely for the purpose of obtaining immigration benefits. CIS gave Larrea\u2019s daughter an opportunity to respond to the notice. Although Larrea\u2019s daughter responded with a statement from Villavicencio that her marriage to Larrea was sincere, CIS denied the I-130 petition on August 25, 2009, based on INA \u00a7 204(c). CIS then denied Larrea\u2019s 1-485 application based on the denial of his 1-130 petition. The record does not indicate that Larrea or his daughter appealed either of these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">The next day, DHS served Larrea with a Notice to Appear, charging him with removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), for remaining in the United States longer than permitted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At a hearing before an IJ, Larrea, through counsel, conceded removability under INA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>\u00a7 237(a)(1)(B). But he argued that he was entitled to relief from removal based on his application for adjustment of status. He denied the factual findings made in connection with the denial of the first 1-130 visa petition filed on his behalf and, as a result, argued that he did not fall within the purview of INA \u00a7 204(c) for purposes of the second petition. Larrea\u2019s counsel stated that Larrea sought only adjustment of status based on the 1-130 petition his daughter filed and no other form of relief from removal. The IJ warned that Larrea was probably not entitled to adjustment of status, but he took the matter under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">After the hearing, the IJ issued a written decision finding Larrea removable, denying adjustment of status based on INA \u00a7 204(c), and ordering his removal to Ecuador. The IJ found that Larrea was ineligible for adjustment of status because the 1-130 petition had not been approved and an approved 1-130 petition is a precondition for approval of an 1-485 application for adjustment of status. The IJ relied on the District Director\u2019s determination that INA \u00a7 204(c) barred approval of Larrea\u2019s 1-130 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Larrea appealed to the BIA, arguing that the IJ erred in declining to give him an opportunity to rebut DHS\u2019s evidence and to apply for any other relief available. The BIA sustained Larrea\u2019s removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), which Larrea did not contest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And the BIA confirmed that Larrea was ineligible for adjustment of status because the District Director\u2019s INA \u00a7 204(c) determination barred approval of the 1-130 visa petition and, without an immigrant visa, CIS could not approve Larrea\u2019s 1-485 application. Finally, the BIA concluded that Larrea received ample opportunity to present evidence and had affirmatively waived other available forms of relief during his hearing before the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">This is Larrea\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision dismissing his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-12\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision. We review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo, </em>and review \u201cadministrative fact findings under the highly deferential substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Rivera v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 815, 820 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). We must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). To reverse a factual finding by the BIA, we must find that \u201cthe record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-14\">A. The BIA\u2019s removability finding</p>\n<p id=\"AUF\">Larrea contends that the BIA erred in finding him removable. He first argues that the BIA\u2019s \u201cpolicy in deportation cases\u201d is arbitrary and capricious under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Judulang v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>476, 181 L.Ed.2d 449 (2011). But Larrea points to no policy in particular that he claims is arbitrary and capricious. Instead, he seems to argue that the BIA\u2019s reliance in this case on CIS\u2019s earlier findings was erroneous. Thus, <em>Judulang </em>is inapposite. And, as Larrea conceded before the BIA and again in his appellate brief, he remained in the United States beyond his authorization to do so, which makes him removable under INA \u00a7 287(a)(1)(B). Larrea accordingly has not shown that the BIA erred in finding him removable. <em>Adefemi </em>386 F.3d at 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">B. Larrea\u2019s application for adjustment of status</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Larrea next argues that the BIA should have remanded his case to the IJ to review the CIS District Director\u2019s determination that the second 1-130 petition fell within the purview of INA \u00a7 204(c) and should therefore be denied. He contends that, because this is a removal proceeding, the IJ should have not given conclusive effect to the prior visa and adjustment-of-status proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">The Attorney General may, at his discretion, adjust the status of an alien to that of a lawful permanent resident, and thereby permit relief from removal, if the alien (1)applies for adjustment of status, including by filing an 1-485 application, (2) is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence, and (3) has an immigrant visa immediately available to him at the time the 1-485 application is filed. INA \u00a7 245(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But, if the Attorney General determines that the alien entered into a marriage \u201cfor the purpose of evading immigration laws,\u201d the Attorney General cannot issue an immigrant visa, which would render an applicant ineligible for adjustment of status. INA \u00a7 204(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">The CIS District Director is tasked with determining, on the Attorney General\u2019s behalf, whether INA \u00a7 204(c) prevents the approval of an alien\u2019s 1-130 visa petition. <em>Matter of Samsen, </em>15 I. &amp; N. Dec. 28, 29 (BIA 1974). Although that decision is directly appealable to the BIA, it is not reviewable by either an IJ or the BIA in a later removal proceeding. <em>Matter of Aurelio, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 458, 460-61 (BIA 1987). Larrea never directly appealed the District Director\u2019s determination that he was ineligible for an immigrant visa based on \u00a7 204(e) because he married Villavicencio to evade immigration laws to the BIA. And he cannot argue the merits of the determination now, in his removal proceedings. Accordingly, Larrea was not entitled to remand to the IJ, and we do not disturb the District Director\u2019s determination that Larrea was ineligible for an immigrant visa based on INA \u00a7 204(c). Therefore, because Larrea did not have a valid immigrant visa when he filed his 1-485 application, the BIA correctly determined as a matter of law that Larrea was ineligible for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">C. Larrea\u2019s due process claim</p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">Finally, Larrea argues that he was not given an adequate opportunity to defend his case before the IJ. He claims that he deserved an additional opportunity to be heard after the IJ\u2019s hearing, and that, by issuing a written decision instead of holding further proceedings, the IJ denied Larrea an opportunity to be heard and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>apply for additional forms of relief. \u201cTo establish due process violations in removal proceedings, aliens must show that they were deprived of liberty without due process of law, and that the asserted errors caused them substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Tang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>578 F.3d 1270, 1275 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). The record in this case establishes that Larrea was afforded ample opportunity to present affirmative and rebuttal evidence to the IJ. And his counsel conceded that Larrea only sought adjustment of status, even when the IJ warned Larrea that he was probably not eligible for this form of relief. Accordingly, he has not demonstrated a due-process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">For these reasons, we conclude that the BIA correctly determined Larrea\u2019s remov-ability and denied adjustment of status; therefore, we dismiss his petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b959-7\">. Larrea argued before the IJ and BIA that this notification constituted an approval, and both rejected his contention. Larrea does not, however, assert this argument in his petition before this court. He has therefore abandoned the issue. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b959-12\">. DHS also charged Larrea with removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(l)(G)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(l)(G)(ii), for committing marriage fraud. And, although the IJ found Larrea removable under this section, on appeal the BIA reversed this finding. It is therefore immaterial to Larrea\u2019s instant petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b960-6\">. Larrea contests the IJ\u2019s removability finding under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B) for the first time on appeal. Because he never contested the finding before the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to review the claim, and we dismiss this portion of Larrea's petition. <em>See Amaya</em>-Artunduaga <em>v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1251 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b961-9\">. Although we generally lack jurisdiction to review any claim by an alien \"regarding the granting of relief\u201d under INA \u00a7 245(a), we retain jurisdiction over constitutional claims and questions of law raised in a petition for review. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(i), (D); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), (D). Because Larrea challenges the BIA\u2019s legal determinations and alleges a due-process violation, we have jurisdiction to entertain these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
