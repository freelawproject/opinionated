Plaintiffs sued the named defendants for alleged improprieties occurring during the pursuit of a merger between Blue Cross and Columbia/HCA Healthcare, Inc. (\u201cColumbia\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The settlement provided for the dismissal of all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against all the defendants except claims for legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty against Seminatore. Seminatore objected to the proposed settlement, claiming that the settlement could affect his possible contribution claims against the settling defendants. However, the trial court ruled that he lacked standing to object to the settlement because the court had no plans to enter an order limiting his right to seek contribution. After a hearing, the trial court approved the settlement. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Seminatore assigns the following errors for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">\u201cI. The trial court erred in finding that defendant Kenneth F. Seminatore lacked standing to object, because defendant Seminatore suffered \u2018formal legal prejudice\u2019 when the trial court approved the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">\u201cII. The trial court did not adequately review the settlement agreement to determine whether it was \u2018fair, reasonable and in the best efforts of all parties affected by it.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">\u201cIII. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the settling defendants and Medical Mutual/Blue Cross entered into the settlement agreement in \u2018good faith\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 2307.33, because that issue was not before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">\u201cIV. The finding that the settlement was entered in good faith is not supported by the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">Having reviewed the record and the legal arguments of the parties, we affirm the judgment of the trial court. The apposite facts follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">On March 28, 1997, Raymond Lesser, Seven Oaks Financial Corporation, and Norwalk Raceway Park, Inc. filed a derivative action against fifteen defendants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>All of the plaintiffs had policies of insurance with Blue Cross. The defendants were Blue Cross executives, advisors, and legal representatives. The complaint sought to recover $25 million expended by the defendants in the unsuccessful pursuit of a merger with Columbia, a health care conglomerate that owns hundreds of hospitals, outpatient surgical centers, and home health agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In or about October 1997, a partial settlement was proposed that would dispose of all the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against all of the defendants except Seminatore. The agreement provided for payments totaling $6,807,500. Seminatore filed his objection to the proposed settlement, arguing that it would improperly bar him from seeking contribution from the other defendants in the event he was held hable to the plaintiffs. The trial court ruled that Seminatore had no standing to be heard at the hearing on the proposed settlement \u201cbecause his right to contribution [had] not been established and [appeared] speculative at best.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">A hearing on the settlement was held on December 17, 1997. After the hearing, the trial court approved the settlement, concluding that \u201cthe plaintiffs, the settling defendants, and Medical Mutual/Blue Cross have entered into the settlement agreement in \u2018good faith\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 2807.33.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 claims were dismissed against all of the defendants except Seminatore.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">On January 8,1998, the plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to add a new legal malpractice action against Seminatore arising out of the cancellation of Blue Cross\u2019s license to use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield trademarks. On January 15, 1998, Seminatore also sought leave to file a third-party complaint for contribution against the attorneys, accountants, consultants, and other professionals whose opinions he relied on regarding the Columbia transaction; none of these third-party defendants were parties in the derivative action. On the same date, Seminatore filed his notice of appeal challenging the trial court\u2019s decision to approve the partial settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">In his first assignment of error, Seminatore argues that the trial court erred in finding that he lacked standing to object to the settlement agreement. \u201cStanding refers to whether a party has a sufficient stake in an otherwise justiciable controversy to obtain judicial resolution of that controversy.\u201d <em>Fenner v. Parcels of Land Encumbered with Delinquent Tax Liens </em>(Feb. 28, 1997), Highland App. No. 96CA906, unreported, 1997 WL 94245. <em>In re Miamisburg Train Derailment Litigation </em>(1993), 92 Ohio App.3d 304, 316, 635 N.E.2d 46, 54; <em>Local Union 1886, United Workers of Am. v. Ohio Reclamation Bd. of Review </em>(1996) , 116 Ohio App.3d 371, 373, 688 N.E.2d 283, 284-285, appeal dismissed (1997) , 78 Ohio St.3d 1418, 676 N.E.2d 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">The burden of establishing standing falls upon appellant Seminatore. See <em>In re School Asbestos Litigation </em>(C.A. 3, 1990), 921 F.2d 1330, 1332. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Generally, only a party to a proposed settlement may object to that settlement. <em>Zupnick v. Fogel </em>(C.A.2, 1993), 989 F.2d 93, 98; <em>Agretti v. ANR Freight Sys. </em>(C.A.7, 1992), 982 F.2d 242, 248; <em>Alumax Mill Products, Inc. v. Congress Financial Corp. </em>(C.A.8, 1990), 912 F.2d 996, 1001; <em>In re School Asbestos Litigation </em>(C.A.3, 1990), 921 F.2d 1330, 1332. However, an exception to this rule has been recognized in cases where a nonsettling defendant can show that he will suffer some \u201cformal legal prejudice\u201d as a result of the settlement. <em>Zupnick </em>at 98; <em>Eichenholtz v. Brennan </em>(C.A.3, 1995), 52 F.3d 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In its journal entry approving the settlement between the parties, the trial court held that \u201c[t]he Plaintiffs, the settling Defendants, and Medical Mutual/Blue Cross have entered into the Settlement Agreement in \u2018good faith\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 2307.33.\u201d R.C. 2307.33(F)(2) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u201cWhen a release or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce judgment is given in good faith to one of two or more persons liable in tort for the same injury or loss to person or property or the same wrongful death, * * * [t]he release or covenant discharges the tortfeasor to whom it is given from all liability for contribution to any other tortfeasor.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Seminatore argues that he suffered formal legal prejudice because the trial court\u2019s ruling that the settlement was reached in good faith, in effect, bars him from seeking contribution from the other defendants. See <em>Harris v. Alexander Grant &amp; Co. </em>(1990), 61 Ohio App.3d 172, 183, 572 N.E.2d 226, 233-234; <em>Baker v. Clouse </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 618, 623, 591 N.E.2d 722, 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Seminatore urges us to follow <em>Eichenholtz v. Brennan </em>(C.A.3, 1995), 52 F.3d 478. In <em>Eichenholtz, </em>the circuit court of appeals held that a nonsettling defendant has standing to object to a partial settlement when the district court issues an order barring all claims for contribution or indemnification against the settling defendants. However, here the trial court did not issue an order barring contribution; consequently, <em>Eichenholtz </em>is distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">A showing of formal prejudice is easier where the terms of the settlement or the trial court\u2019s approval order contains language purporting to bar the nonsettling defendant\u2019s claim for contribution. See <em>Alumax Mill Products, Inc. v. Congress Financial Corp. </em>(1990), 912 F.2d 996 (terms of settlement included dismissal with prejudice of nonsettling defendants\u2019 cross-claims for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>contribution); <em>Wainwright v. Kraftco Corp. </em>(N.D.Ga.1971), 53 F.R.D. 78 (settlement agreement contained a provision that settling defendants would not be held liable for contribution to the remaining defendants). However, in this case, in its order finding that Seminatore had no standing to object to the settlement, the trial court stated that it had no plans to enter an order that would limit Seminatore\u2019s right to seek contribution from the other settling defendants. In fact, neither the settlement nor the trial court\u2019s order contained any language barring contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Consequently, we reject Seminatore\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s approval of the settlement caused him to suffer formal legal prejudice. Seminatore has not brought contribution claims against any of the settling defendants. As discussed above, neither the language of the settlement itself nor the language of the court\u2019s order approving the settlement contained any language barring Semina-tore from asserting any contribution claims against the settling defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Seminatore argues that the settlement in effect triggers the application of R.C. 2307.33(F)(2), which provides that no contribution claim can be brought against a defendant who enters into a good-faith settlement of a tort action. However, the trial court has not determined the applicability of R.C. 2307.33(F)(2) to any such claims by Seminatore, and we believe any discussion on this issue is premature. \u201c[CJourts have repeatedly held that a settlement which does not prevent the later assertion of a non-settling party\u2019s claims, although it may force a second lawsuit against the dismissed parties, does not cause plain legal prejudice to the non-settling party.\u201d <em>Agretti v. ANR Freight Sys., Inc. </em>(C.A.7, 1992), 982 F.2d 242, 247. See, also, <em>Quad/Graphics, Inc. v. Fass </em>(C.A.7, 1983), 724 F.2d 1230, 1233; <em>Transamerican Refining Corp. v. Dravo Corp. </em>(C.A.5, 1992), 952 F.2d 898, 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Furthermore, R.C. 2307.33 provides that a settlement by one of two or more tortfeasors reduces the plaintiffs claim against the nonsettling tortfeasors to the extent of the greater of any amount stipulated by the release or the amount of the consideration paid for it. See <em>Niemann v. Post Industries, Inc. </em>(1991), 68 Ohio App.3d 392, 396, 588 N.E.2d 301, 303. This provision would adequately protect Seminatore\u2019s interests if he is ultimately found liable on the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. Consequently, Seminatore has failed to demonstrate any formal legal prejudice suffered as a result of the trial court\u2019s approval of the partial settlement. Seminatore\u2019s first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Having concluded that Seminatore lacked standing to object to the partial settlement, we overrule his remaining assignments of error as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b358-10\">Kaepinski and Rocco, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-16\">.
