Claimant is a machinist. On June 15, 1946, while working on a cylinder a ramhead caught. In pulling this free claimant \u201cfelt a snap\u201d in his back. Several awards of compensation benefits have been made as a result of this injury and have been paid. The carrier, however, suggested that the claimant should undergo a spinal fusion operation. Claimant has refused this and the board has now found that his refusal is not unreasonable, although it found earlier in a decision which it rescinded that Ms refusal was \u201c unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>able.\u201d Three impartial specialists, two o\u00a3 them orthopedists and the other a neurologist, testified to the necessity and value of the operation. Claimant\u2019s own psychiatrist felt the only hope of cure was a spinal fusion. But a physician whose opinion had been received expressed the view that he should have a \u201cfairly good recovery without surgery\u201d; that there are \u201cno very definite anatomic indications for surgery\u201d. He concluded that surgery \u201cdefinitely is not indicated.\u201d Since this medical opinion gives support both to the claimant\u2019s refusal to undergo an operation and to the board\u2019s present view that the refusal is not unreasonable there is no room in this case for our interference. Decision and award affirmed, with costs to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board. Foster, P. J., Brewster, Bergan and Halpern, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
