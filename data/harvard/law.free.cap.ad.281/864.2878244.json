Y. 171, 174). The subsequent transfer of article 10-A from the Insurance Law to article YI-A of the Banking Law did not alter the character of such companies. Such department of a savings bank partakes of the nature of a mutual life insurance company for the purpose of determining the applicability of the municipal gross receipts tax (Administrative Code of City of New York, \u00a7 RR41-1.0). Determination unanimously confirmed, with $20 costs and disbursements to the respondents. Present \u2014 Dore, J. P., Cohn, Callahan, Yan Yoorhis and Breitel, JJ.
