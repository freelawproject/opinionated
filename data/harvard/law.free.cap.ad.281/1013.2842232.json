As the contract to arbitrate and the arbitrable dispute exist, all controversies are for the arbitrators including the timeliness of the so-called adjudication proceeding. Order unanimously affirmed, with $20 costs and disbursements to the respondent. Present \u2014 Dore, J. P., Cohn, Callahan, Van Voorhis and Breitel, JJ.
