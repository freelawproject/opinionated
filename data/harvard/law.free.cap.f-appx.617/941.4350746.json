On appeal, Smith argues that, in calculating the advisory guidelines range, the district court misapplied the dangerous-weapon increase to his offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E). After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Under \u00a7 2B3.1, a robbery defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by three levels if he brandished or possessed a dangerous weapon in the course of the robbery. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E). The defendant need not have actually possessed the dangerous weapon, however, in order to receive the increase, so long as the defendant used an \u201cobject in a manner that created the impression that the object was an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B3.1 cmt. n. 2(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">\u201c[T]he critical factor for the application of \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E) is whether the defendant intended the <em>appearance </em>of a dangerous weapon.\u201d <em>United States v. Bates, </em>213 F.3d 1336, 1338 (11th Cir.2000) (upholding application where the defendant reached into his waistband, implying the presence of a weapon, and the victim perceived the defendant to possess a gun). Therefore \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E)\u2019s three-level increase is proper when a defendant uses \u201ca concealed body part,\u201d such as a finger, \u201cto cause the victim to believe that it is a dangerous weapon.\u201d <em>United States v. Vincent, </em>121 F.3d 1451, 1455 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Here, the district court did not err in applying the three-level increase for possession of a dangerous weapon. At the sentencing hearing, the victim, Jessica Payne, a postal employee who was working the counter during Smith\u2019s robbery, testified that when Smith entered the post office, he had his right hand inside his jacket pocket. Smith told Payne, \u201cThis is a robbery, give me what you got,\u201d and nudged his concealed hand towards her. While Smith gave Payne orders to give him all of the money and then to give him money orders and the money order machine, he continued to nudge his concealed hand at her. Payne testified that it \u201clooked like something was in there pointing at [her],\u201d and she believed it was a gun. Smith never removed his right hand from his pocket while he was in the post office.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">Although Smith objects to the district court\u2019s finding that he nudged his hand towards Payne while his hand was inside his jacket, the district court did not clearly err in crediting Payne\u2019s testimony that he did so. Furthermore, based on both Payne\u2019s subjective perception that Smith was pointing a gun at her and the objective circumstances of the robbery to which Payne testified, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Smith intended the appearance of a dangerous weapon in his concealed hand. Therefore, the district court did not err in applying \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E)\u2019s three-level increase to Smith\u2019s offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b966-7\">. We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of the guidelines to the facts <em>de novo.
