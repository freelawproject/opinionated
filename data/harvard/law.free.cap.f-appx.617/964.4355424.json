Pugh made a claim for a survivor\u2019s benefit after the death of her ex-husband, who was a participant in Defendants\u2019 retirement plan. Defendants denied Pugh\u2019s claim because the benefit was due only to surviving spouses, and Pugh and her husband had divorced shortly before his death. The district court affirmed Defendants\u2019 denial of the claim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Renee Pugh\u2019s then-husband was a participant in the .El Paso Corporation Pension Plan, under which he received retirement benefits beginning in 1987. They divorced in 2011, and he died less than eight months later. After her ex-husband\u2019s death, Pugh made a claim for a \u201cRetiree Survivor\u2019s Benefit.\u201d El Paso denied the claim. Pugh sued, and the district court granted summary judgment for El Paso.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s affirmance of El Paso\u2019s decision to deny benefits under the plan, and we apply the same legal standards. <em>See Blankenship v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>644 F.3d 1350, 1354 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam). We apply, as the district court did, a six-part analytical framework to review El Paso\u2019s denial of benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-8\">(1) Apply the <em>de novo </em>standard to determine whether the claim administrator\u2019s [i.e., El Paso\u2019s] benefits-denial decision is \u201cwrong\u201d (i.e., the court disagrees with the administrator\u2019s decision); if it is not, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-9\">(2) If the administrator\u2019s decision in fact is <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong,\u201d then determine whether he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims; if not, end judicial inquiry and reverse the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-10\">(3) If the administrator\u2019s decision is <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong\u201d and he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims, then determine whether \u201creasonable\u201d grounds supported it (hence, review his decision under the more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-11\">(4) If no reasonable grounds exist, then end the inquiry and reverse the administrator\u2019s decision; if reasonable grounds do exist, then determine if he operated under a conflict of interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-12\">(5) If there is no conflict, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-13\">(6) If there is a conflict, the conflict should merely be a factor for the court to take into account when determining whether an administrator\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 1355. Pugh admits that El Paso was vested with discretion (step 2), and that there was no conflict of interest (step 4). But she disputes the district court\u2019s conclusions that El Paso\u2019s decision was not \u201cde novo wrong\u201d (step 1), and, alternatively, that it was supported by reasonable grounds and thus not arbitrary and capricious (step 5). We see no need to decide whether El Paso\u2019s decision was \u201cde novo wrong\u201d; either way, because it was not arbitrary and capricious, El Paso was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-15\">The retirement plan owes the Retiree Survivor\u2019s Benefit only to, as relevant here, an \u201cEligible Spouse.\u201d The plan defines \u201cEligible Spouse\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-16\">The husband or wife of a deceased Participant, who (i) was married to the Participant under the laws of the State where the marriage was contracted at least one year prior to the date of his death, (ii) is not a party to a court action for judgment of separation or decree of divorce pending at the time of the Participant\u2019s death, and (iii) subsequent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>the Participant\u2019s death has not remarried.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">The crux of this dispute concerns the correct interpretation of clause (i). Pugh reads it to define \u201cEligible Spouse\u201d as one who was married to the plan participant for <em>any </em>one-year period before his death. El Paso,.in denying her claim, read the clause to include only those spouses married to the plan participant for the one-year period <em>immediately 'preceding </em>the participant\u2019s death. Pugh qualifies as an Eligible Spouse under her reading, but not under El Paso\u2019s: she was married to her husband for many years, but they divorced some seven months before he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">We agree with the district court that El Paso\u2019s interpretation was supported by reasonable grounds. Most notably, if Pugh\u2019s interpretation were accepted, it would create incongruous outcomes. For one, the plan could owe this benefit to any number of ex-spouses who had been married to the plan participant for at least a year (and are neither presently a party to a divorce proceeding nor remarried).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For another, it would lead to absurd results with respect to clause (ii), because it would confer this benefit on ex-spouses but deny it to current spouses involved in divorce proceedings with the plan participant. Imagine a participant who was married to her first husband for at least one year, and who was divorcing her second husband (also of at least one year) at the time of her death. The first husband would qualify for the Retiree Survivor\u2019s Benefit as an Eligible Spouse (because they were married for at least one year and he <em>was not </em>at that time a party to a divorce proceeding), but the second husband would not qualify (because he <em>was </em>a party to a divorce proceeding). That, as El Paso explained, \u201cmakes no sense\u201d and \u201cis not contemplated by the Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">El Paso\u2019s interpretation of the definition of \u201cEligible Spouse\u201d is reasonable. And because it is vested with discretion to interpret the terms of the plan, its reasonable interpretation must be afforded deference. <em>See White v. Coca-Cola Co., </em>542 F.3d 848, 856 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that where a plan provision is ambiguous, the plan administrator\u2019s interpretation must be upheld \u201c[a]s long as a reasonable basis appears\u201d for its interpretation (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b990-6\">. Pugh argues that this could never happen, because the plan\u2019s definition of the term \"Spouse\" eliminates the possibility of payment to multiple \"Eligible Spouses.\u201d <em>[See </em>Bl. Br. 20.] But the plan provides that the relevant benefit is owed to \"Eligible Spouses,\u201d a term that is explicitly defined without reference to the general definition of \"Spouse\" to which Pugh points. The term \"Spouse\u201d defines eligibility only for other benefits not relevant here. The definition of the term \"Spouse\u201d thus plays no part in the determination of who is an \"Eligible Spouse,\u201d and whatever limitations the former contains cannot affect the latter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
