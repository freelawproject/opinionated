Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b346-17\">Duggan\u2019s claims are founded on the following allegations. In early 2009, Duggan, then serving on active duty as a member of the Texas Air National Guard, alleges he was involved in an altercation with Master Sergeant Richard Franks (\u201cFranks\u201d), a non-commissioned officer, during which Franks threatened Duggan\u2019s life'.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, Duggan alleges he was unjustly found to have assaulted Franks, and as a result was placed on restricted duty, given menial tasks, and formally disciplined.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Duggan then contacted United States Senators regarding his treatment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-18\">However, Duggan alleges that his punishment continued through the collaboration of authority figures with loyalty to Franks.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a result of allegedly unjust accusations by these individuals that Dug-gan took unauthorized leave, \u201c[a]s of June 26, 2009, [Duggan] was asked to not return to the base, and began terminal leave through the end of his Title 10 activation orders.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As part of this campaign to see Duggan removed from military service, Duggan alleges that, on July 12, 2009 and August 25, 2009, Major Vincent Gradney and Major Debora Krupa accessed Dug-gan\u2019s medical records, directed them alteration and ultimately disclosed those rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>ords to Duggan\u2019s military unit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Duggan ultimately separated from the Texas Air National Guard in September 2010.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">On July 11, 2011, Duggan filed his original complaint, asserting violations of the Privacy Act,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and on February 7, 2012, Duggan filed his first amended complaint, the live pleading at the time of the complained-of dismissal, in which he amended his Privacy Act claims and asserted additional claims falling under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">On May 21, 2012, the district court granted Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Duggan\u2019s FTCA and Privacy Act claims pursuant to the <em>Feres </em>doctrine, under which certain tort claims of military service members are non-justiciable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Dug-gan subsequently appealed only the dismissal of the Privacy Act claims',<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and this court granted the Defendants\u2019 motion to vacate in part the district court\u2019s order applying the <em>Feres </em>doctrine to the Privacy Act claim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">On remand and motion of the Defendants, the district court dismissed Dug-gan\u2019s Privacy Act claim for failure to sufficiently allege actual damages within the requirements of the Privacy Act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Duggan timely appealed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-17\">II. Standard op Review and Relevant Law</p>\n<p id=\"b347-18\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss de novo.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To survive dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), all well-pleaded allegations \u201cmust be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cThreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-19\">The Privacy Act broadly regulates the executive branch\u2019s handling of the private information of individuals when it is contained within a system of \u2022 records,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and specifically imposes consent requirements on the disclosure of such information, subject to several exceptions not relevant here.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> For claims of unauthorized disclosure, the Privacy Act provides for relief in the form of actual damages;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>such damages are limited to \u201cproven pecuniary or economic harm,\u201d to the exclusion of \u201cdamages for mental and emotional distress.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Duggan\u2019s amended complaint alleges that the Privacy Act violations directly led to certain injuries, including harm to his relationships with his military co-workers, emotional turmoil, extreme embarrassment, \u201csevere mental anguish,\u201d difficulty eating and sleeping, and paranoia.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Later in his complaint, Duggan seeks a damages award \u201cfor the adverse effects and harm caused by the [Privacy Act violations],\u201d but does not further expand on the types of injury previously attributed to those violations.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Duggan also alleges generally attributable, pecuniary injuries, averring that Defendants\u2019 <em>collective </em>conduct caused him emotional injury resulting in a diagnosis of hypertension requiring medication, and lost income and other damages related to his termination from the military.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We consider the arguments surrounding these injuries <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Regarding the specifically attributed injuries, the parties first dispute whether the Privacy Act encompasses claims for these non-pecuniary damages. In <em>F.A.A. v. Cooper, </em>the Supreme Court specifically considered the scope of \u201cactual damages\u201d in the civil remedies provision of the Privacy Act, and held that those remedies do not extend to \u201closs of reputation, shame, mortification, injury to the feelings and the like.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>Cooper </em>squarely forecloses Dug-gan\u2019s recovery for these damages, and allegations thereof are insufficient to support the claim. Duggan\u2019s attempts to distinguish <em>Cooper </em>are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Duggan\u2019s claim therefore relies on his allegations of pecuniary harm through income loss, which he broadly attributes to Defendants\u2019 \u201cunlawful and improper conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> There is no dispute that these alleged damages comprise \u201cactual damages\u201d recoverable under the Privacy Act. However, Defendants argue that there is no plausible basis for their specific attribution to the Privacy Act violations.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In support, Defendants cite to <em>Sweeney v. Chertoff, </em>which held that a Privacy Act claimant\u2019s alleged injury (loss of pay) was too attenuated from the alleged violation (nondisclosure of a medical form\u2019s voluntary nature) to satisfy causation requirements.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In doing so, the <em>Sweeney </em>panel acknowledged the possibility that the injury might not have occurred but for the violation; the panel nevertheless concluded that, in light of evidence that the loss of pay resulted from the plaintiffs suspension after an internal agency disciplinary action, \u201csuch a hypothetical counterfactual situation is not sufficient to meet the causation requirement.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">Though not binding, <em>Sweeney\u2019s </em>reasoning is persuasive, notwithstanding its application to the summary-judgment context or its issuance prior to the. current pleading requirements. This is so because, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>sidering Duggan\u2019s allegations within the <em>Twombly-Iqbal </em>framework, Duggan\u2019s recovery of actual damages for the alleged Privacy Act violations could only result from a \u201chypothetical, counterfactual situation\u201d which is insufficient to satisfy the plausibility requirements at the motion-to-dismiss stage. Like the <em>Sweeney </em>plaintiff, Duggan was subject to disciplinary action for unauthorized leave, pursuant to which Duggan alleges he was \u201ccompletely relieved of all duties, asked to return to the base, and began terminal leave.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Though Duggan otherwise alleges that the basis of this discipline was unjust, he does not allege it resulted from the Privacy Act violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Significantly and unlike the <em>Sweeney </em>plaintiff, Duggan experienced this injury prior to the alleged Privacy Act violations, which further undercuts any causal inference between the events. The inference is not strengthened by Duggan\u2019s argument in his reply that he was ultimately terminated in September of 2010.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> According to Duggan\u2019s allegations, he \u201cbegan terminal leave\u201d weeks prior to the alleged Privacy Act violations and did not return to service prior to his ultimate termination; the progression of the alleged injury had all but concluded by the time the Privacy Act violations are alleged to have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Duggan\u2019s allegations simply do not support a plausible inference that the Privacy Act violations were causally related to his relief from duties and ultimate termination. Absent such a connection, there is no basis for Duggan\u2019s right to \u201cactual damages\u201d within the meaning of the Privacy Act. As a result, the district court did not err in dismissing Duggan\u2019s Privacy Act claims, and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
