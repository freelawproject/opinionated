That state proceeding was interrupted when Appellants filed a suit that was resolved, again for failure to state a claim, by the Fifth Circuit in 2014, and then completed by the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-23\">Regarding the present suit as an attempt to set aside the state court\u2019s forcible detainer judgment, Appellants encounter the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>rule. That is where the district court ended, and we must affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
