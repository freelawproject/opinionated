Ormachea was a high-ranking officer in the Bolivian police department and was convicted of attempting to extort Humberto Roca \u2014 a Bolivian under criminal investigation. Ormachea argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude testimony regarding his prior attempts to extort others. He also argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of either count. Finally, he argues that the district court applied the Guidelines incorrectly both by refusing to give him a three-level reduction under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2X1.1, and by applying USSG \u00a7 2B3.2 rather than USSG \u00a7 2C1.1 to calculate his base offense level. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-16\">We first address whether the district court erred when it denied Orma-chea\u2019s motion <em>in limine. </em>We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Chavez, </em>204 F.3d 1305, 1316 (11th Cir.2000). Under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b)(1), \u201c[ejvidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.\u201d However, it may be admissible for other purposes, such as proving intent, absence of mistake, or lack of accident. Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)(2). To be admissible, (1) the evidence must be relevant to one of these issues rather than solely to the defendant\u2019s character, (2) the prior act must be proved sufficiently to permit the jury to determine by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant committed-'the act, and (3) the evidence\u2019s probative value cannot be substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice and must otherwise satisfy Federal Rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>Evidence 403. <em>Chavez, </em>204 F.3d at 1317; <em>see also United States v. Bowe, </em>221 F.3d 1183, 1192 (11th Cir.2000). When the state of mind required for the charged and extrinsic acts is identical, the evidence is relevant to the defendant\u2019s intent. <em>United States v. Dickerson, </em>248 F.3d 1036, 1047 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">Under Rule 403, a district court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of \u201cunfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 403. Under Rule 403, we view the \u201cevidence in a light most favorable to its admission, maximizing its probative value and minimizing its undue prejudicial impact.\u201d <em>United States v. Edouard, </em>485 F.3d 1324, 1344 n. 8 (11th Cir.2007). Whether the probative value- of Rule 404(b) evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect depends on the circumstances of the prior act. <em>United States v. Dorsey, </em>819 F.2d 1055, 1061 (11th Cir.1987). Relevant factors to this inquiry include: (1) \u201cthe strength of the government\u2019s case on the issue of intent,\u201d (2) \u201cthe overall similarity of the extrinsic and charged [acts],\u201d (3) the closeness in time between the extrinsic and charged acts, and (4) \u201cwhether it appeared at the commencement of trial that the defendant would contest the issue of intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, whether testimony regarding the prior act is likely to incite the jury to an irrational decision is also relevant to the Rule 403 analysis. <em>See United States v. Pepe, </em>747 F.2d 632, 671 (11th Cir.1984). Limiting instructions may mitigate any prejudicial effect caused by introducing prior act evidence. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1282 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of prior ex-tortions by Ormachea. Extortion is \u201cthe obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(2). To sustain a conviction for attempted Hobbs Act extortion, the government must prove that the defendant intended to extort someone \u201cthrough acts reasonably calculated to arouse fear.\u201d <em>United States v. Farrell, </em>877 F.2d 870, 876 (11th Cir.1989). Here, it appeared at the beginning of trial that Ormachea would contest the issue of intent because he claimed that the alleged victim paid him for political influence, not in response to threats. Therefore, testimony regarding Ormachea\u2019s attempts to extort third parties was relevant to his intent to extort the victim in this case because all of these acts involved the same mental state \u2014 his intent to obtain money from others through fear caused by the threat of criminal investigations or incarceration. <em>See United States v. Delgado, </em>56 F.3d 1357, 1365 (11th Cir.1995) (noting that when a defendant pleads not guilty, he \u201cmakes intent a material issue, imposing a substantial burden on the government to prove intent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">Also, viewed in the light most favorable to admission, the danger of unfair prejudice did not substantially outweigh the evidence\u2019s probative value. The earlier efforts to extort took place during the same space of time as that before the jury here. For instance, Ormachea made the statements to the others in early 2013, approximately five months before his meetings with the victim here. And the risk of any undue prejudice was curbed by the district court\u2019s limiting instruction to the jury concerning the proper consideration of Rule 404(b) evidence. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">We next address the district court\u2019s denial of Ormachea\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. We r\u00e9view a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal on sufficiency of the evidence grounds <em>de novo. United States v. Browne, 505 F.3d </em>1229, 1253 (11th Cir.2007). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility determinations in the government\u2019s favor. <em>Id. </em>We will affirm a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal \u201c[i]f a reasonable jury could conclude that the evidence establishes [the defendant\u2019s] guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This standard does not require the evidence to be inconsistent with every reasonable hypothesis other than guilt. <em>Id. </em>Instead, we allow juries to choose from several reasonable conclusions that could be drawn from the evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">As discussed above, in order to sustain a conviction for attempted extortion under the Hobbs Act, the government was required to prove that Ormachea intended to extort someone and used acts reasonably calculated to arouse fear. <em>Farrell, </em>877 F.2d at 876. A defendant\u2019s exploitation of a victim\u2019s fear can also constitute extortion regardless of whether the defendant caused the fear. <em>United States v. Haimowitz, </em>725 F.2d 1561, 1572 (11th Cir.1984).. To sustain a conviction for foreign travel in aid of racketeering, the government must prove that the defendant: (1) traveled in interstate or foreign commerce (2) with the intent to further an unlawful activity and (3) performed or attempted to perform an unlawful activity. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952(a). Extortion in violation of federal law or the law of the state in which it was committed is an \u201cunlawful activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1952(b)(i)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">The district court did not err in denying Ormachea\u2019s post-verdict motion for judgment of acquittal. Ormachea principally argues that there was insufficient evidence of using threats reasonably calculated to-arouse fear. But the government introduced evidence of Ormachea directly threatening to ensure that Roca \u2014 the victim \u2014 would be found guilty in criminal cases in Bolivia if he did not pay. These conversations were recorded and played for the jury. Similarly, Ormachea\u2019s statements about innocent people being imprisoned in Bolivia could be reasonably construed as threats to have Roca\u2019s family members incarcerated as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">Ormachea argu\u00e9s that Roca did not give Ormachea money \u201cbecause of fear,\u201d as Roca knew \u201cthe meeting and the money [were] monitored by the FBI\u201d and he \u201cpart[ed] with the money in order to set up\u201d Ormachea. But because this was an indictment for <em>attempted </em>extortion, the government did not need to prove that Ormachea actually obtained property through the use of fear. A reasonable jury could have found that he attempted to extort Roca.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-11\">Next, we address whether the district court should have reduced Orma-chea\u2019s offense level under USSG \u00a7 2X1.1. We review a district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing for clear error and its application of the Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Lee, </em>427 F.3d 881, 892 (11th Cir.2005). Under the Guidelines, a defendant may receive a three-level reduction if he was convicted of attempt, rather than the substantive offense, unless (1) he or she \u201ccompleted all the acts the defendant believed necessary for successful completion of the substantive offense,\u201d or (2) \u201cthe circumstances demonstrate that the defendant was about to complete all such acts but for apprehension or interruption by some similar event beyond the defendant\u2019s control.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Xl.l(b)(l).-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>The commentary says that the reduction is not appropriate when the substantive offense was substantially completed or was interrupted or prevented on the verge of completion by law enforcement. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2X1.1, comment, n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Here, the district court did not err in rejecting a three-level reduction. Orma-chea collected $5,000 of an agreed-upon $30,000 payment and made arrangements regarding the remaining amount. On this record, the district court correctly found \u201ceverything other than collecting the 30,-000 ... was done.\u201d Even if Ormachea did not commit all the acts he believed necessary to successfully complete the substantive offense, the circumstances demonstrate that he would have done so but for his intervening arrest. The district court did not clearly err.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">Finally, we address whether the district court erred in applying USSG \u00a7 2B3.2. Although we generally review a district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines <em>de novo, Lee, </em>427 F.3d at 892, if a party induces or invites the district court into making an error, we will not review that error on appeal. <em>United States v. Braman, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2009). Ormachea argues that the district court should have applied \u00a7 2C1.1 \u2014 the Guideline for soliciting bribes in exchange for influence \u2014 instead of \u00a7 2B3.2 \u2014 the Guideline for extortion by force or threat of injury or serious damage. However, Ormachea invited any error by arguing against the application of \u00a7 2C1.1 both before and at the sentencing hearing. We therefore will not review the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
