It concluded with the recommendation that the district court should grant the Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment and dismiss Ms. Stephens\u2019s action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-20\">Following receipt and consideration of the Magistrate Judge\u2019s 36-page Report and Recommendation, the district court issued its own 65-page Order on September 30,2014. After verbalizing, in the first 21 pages, why only Stephens\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims against the City and against Acevedo in his individual capacity remained, the district court devoted the. balance of its lengthy, patient, and detailed analysis of the case to explaining why it was adopting the Magistrate Judge\u2019s determination that Ms. Stephens had failed to make out her <em>prima facie </em>case and why the court was not reaching the questions (1) whether the Defendants would have engaged in the same employment action in the absence of the First Amendment protected conduct or (2) why Ms. Stephens had failed to make a showing that the non-First Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>reasons for the Defendants\u2019 actions were pretext. All of that was in support of the district court\u2019s October 8, 2014 Judgment, in which it granted the Defendants\u2019 Motion. for Summary Judgment to dismiss Ms. Stephens\u2019s lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Our review of the rulings of the magistrate judge and the district judge, as well as the rest of the record on appeal, including the briefs of the parties, satisfies us beyond cavil that the district court committed no reversible error. Accordingly, that court\u2019s dismissal of Ms. Stephens\u2019s action with prejudice is, in all respects</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
