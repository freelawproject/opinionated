He contends that the district court plainly erred by imposing a 12-level crime of violence enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his conviction for third degree criminal sexual conduct under Michigan Compiled Laws Annotated \u00a7 750.520d(l)(a) (1992). He argues that the Michigan offense does not comport with the generic, contemporary meaning of the enumerated crime of violence of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d because the statute of conviction lacked an age differential of at least four years between the perpetrator and the victim. As he concedes, however, this argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 562 n. 28 (5th Cir.2013) (en banc). He raises it to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-21\">Additionally, Ramos-Martinez contends that, because a defendant was punishable under \u00a7 750.520d(l)(a) without regard to whether he knew or should have known that the other person was younger than 16 years old, the offense did not require that the defendant have taken undue or unfair advantage of the minor and does not comport with the generic, contemporary meaning of \u201csexual abuse.\u201d Because Ramos-Martinez did not object to the enhancement in the district court, review is for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>plain error. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497 (5th Cir.2012). \u201cThe doctrine of plain error serves powerful institutional interests, including securing the role of the United States District Court as the court of first instance, as opposed to a body charged to make recommendations to appellate courts.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370, 378 (5th Cir.2009). To demonstrate plain error, Ramos-Martinez must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). An error is not clear or obvious if it is subject to reasonable debate. <em>Id.; Ellis, </em>564 F.3d at 377-78. If Ramos-Martinez makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">In light of <em>Contreras v. Holder, </em>754 F.3d 286, 295 (5th Cir.2014), and <em>Ramos-Garcia v. Holder, </em>483 Fed.Appx. 926, 928-29 (5th Cir.2012), the determination of whether the Michigan offense comports with the generic, contemporary meaning of \u201csexual abuse\u201d is subject to reasonable debate. Accordingly, any error by the district court was not \u201cclear or obvious,\u201d and Ramos-Martinez cannot meet his burden of showing plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423; <em>see also Ellis, </em>564 F.3d at 377-78 (noting that \u201cthe second prong of plain error analysis is particularly important\u201d and suggesting that, unless a crime of violence error can be identified simply by considering the \u201celements of the crime\u201d or \u201cother straightforward applications of case law,\u201d it is not clear or obvious). We need not consider Ramos-Martinez\u2019s argument that the offense does not constitute the enumerated offense of statutory rape or the Government\u2019s argument that the offense constitutes a forcible sex offense under \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
