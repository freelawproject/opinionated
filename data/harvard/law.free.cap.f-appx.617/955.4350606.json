This court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>granted a certificate of appealability on one issue: \u201c[w]hether the district court erred in denying Claim 1 of Williams\u2019[s] amended 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition,\u201d in which Williams asserted that he received an inadequate Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> warning prior to a police interrogation. On appeal, Williams argues that his <em>Miranda </em>warning was constitutionally insufficient because it did not reasonably convey his right to have an attorney present \u201cduring\u201d his interrogation, rather than simply \u201cbefore\u201d the interrogation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After careful consideration, we affirm the district court\u2019s order and deny Williams\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">At Williams\u2019s trial, the State introduced a recording of an interview between Investigator Herbert Haigh and Williams at the sheriffs office before his arrest. According to the trial transcript, the following exchange took place at the beginning of the interview:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-5\">INVESTIGATOR HAIGH: ... Let me make sure you understand your rights, John. You do have the right to remain silent. Anything that you say could be used against you in court. You have the right to have an attorney and have that attorney present before any questioning. If you cannot afford an attorney, one could be appointed before any questioning. And if you decide to answer questions now without an attorney, you have the right to stop\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-6\">MR. WILLIAMS: I\u2019ll answer whatever\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-7\">INVESTIGATOR HAIGH: \u2014 you have the right to stop at any time. Do you understand the rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-10\">MR. WILLIAMS: I ain\u2019t done nothing wrong. (Inaudible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-11\">INVESTIGATOR HAIGH: I\u2019ve got some questions. And again, if I ask a question that you don\u2019t want to answer, then you don\u2019t \u2014 certainly don\u2019t have to. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-12\">MR. WILLIAMS: I\u2019ll answer anything you ask me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-13\">Williams argues on appeal that this <em>Miranda </em>warning was deficient because Investigator Haigh said he had a right to an attorney <em>\u201cbefore </em>any questioning,\u201d not <em>during </em>questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>Davis v. Jones, </em>506 F.8d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir.2007). When the state court\u2019s findings of fact are not at issue, we may only grant habeas relief on claims adjudicated on the merits in state court if the state court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). A state court\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law if the state court (1) applied a rule that contradicts governing law set forth in prior Supreme Court cases, or (2) confronted a set of facts materially indistinguishable from those in a prior Supreme Court case and arrived at a different result. <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 73, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 1173, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003). A state court unreasonably applies clearly established federal law when it \u201cidentifies the correct governing legal principle ... but unreasonably applies that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>principle to the facts of the [petitioner\u2019s] case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75, 123 S.Ct. at 1174. To be entitled to habeas relief, the petitioner must show that the state court\u2019s ruling on the claim was \u201cso lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>775 F.3d 1294, 1306 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Where, as here, a petitioner presents a federal claim to a state court and the state court denies relief without explanation, federal courts may presume that the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits unless there is \u201cany indication or state-law procedural principles to the contrary.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 99, 131 S.Ct. 770, 784-85, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). To receive federal habeas relief, the petitioner must show \u201cthat there was no reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98, 131 S.Ct. at 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Before police may question someone in custody, they must \u201cclearly inform[ ]\u201d the person of his or her \u201cright to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him [or her] during interrogation.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 471, 86 S.Ct. at 1626. \u00d1o one particular formulation of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings is required. <em>Duckworth v. Eagan, </em>492 U.S. 195, 202-03, 109 S.Ct. 2875, 2880, 106 L.Ed.2d 166 (1989). Instead, reviewing courts determine whether, when viewed as a whole, the warnings reasonably conveyed the individual\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Id. </em>at 203, 205, 109 S.Ct. at 2880-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">In <em>Florida v. Powell, </em>559 U.S. 50, 130 S.Ct. 1195, 175 L.Ed.2d 1009 (2010),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Supreme Court held that warnings stating that the defendant had \u201cthe right to talk to a lawyer before answering any ... questions\u201d and \u201cthe right to use any of these rights at any time [he] want[ed] during th[e] interview\u201d complied with <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 54, 62, 130 S.Ct. at 1200,1204-05. The Court determined that the warnings reasonably conveyed that the defendant could consult with a lawyer before answering any questions and that he could exercise that right during the interrogation. <em>Id. </em>at 62, 130 S.Ct. at 1205. In context, the Court reasoned, the word \u201cbefore\u201d simply indicated the time at which the defendant\u2019s right to an attorney became effective. <em>Id. </em>at 63, 130 S.Ct. at 1205. Nothing in the warnings suggested that the defendant\u2019s right to counsel would be restricted after questioning commenced. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, taken together, these warnings informed the defendant of his right to have an attorney present during the interview. <em>Id. </em>at 62, 130 S.Ct. at 1205.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">Based on this Supreme Court precedent, the district court did not err in denying Williams\u2019s \u00a7 2554 petition. The state appellate court\u2019s decision was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. Of course, the Court has made clear that \u201cthe State must warn the accused prior to such questioning of his right ... to have counsel, retained or appointed, present <em>during </em>interrogation.\u201d <em>Fare v. Michael C., </em>442 U.S. 707, 717, 99 S.Ct. 2560, 2568, 61 L.Ed.2d 197 (1979) (emphasis added). However, as in <em>Powell, </em>the word \u201cbefore\u201d here can be reasonably read to indicate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>time at which Williams\u2019s right to have an attorney present became effective, rather than as a limitation on when he could have an attorney present. Furthermore, \u201c[njothing in the words used [by Haigh] indicated that counsel\u2019s presence would be restricted after the questioning commenced.\u201d <em>Powell, </em>559 U.S. at 68, 130 S.Ct. at 1205.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">We agree with Williams that-the warnings at issue here were less clear than those in <em>Powell </em>because Williams was not told that he could invoke his previously stated rights at any time. <em>See Powell, </em>559 U.S. at 54, 130 S.Ct. at 1200. But although reasonable jurists could disagree with the state court\u2019s determination, it was not objectively unreasonable to interpret Haigh\u2019s statements as adequately conveying Williams\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights. For this reason, federal habeas relief is not appropriate, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b980-8\">. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b980-9\">. In Ground 1 of his petition, Williams also raised the issue of whether the <em>Miranda </em>warning sufficiently informed him of his right to appointed counsel. Because Williams only mentions that issue in passing on appeal, he may have abandoned it. <em>See Kuenzel v. Comm\u2019r, Ala. Dep't of Corr., </em>690 F.3d 1311, 1314 n. 1 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam). In any event, the state court did not unreasonably apply Supreme Court precedent. Reasonable jurists can disagree about whether the warning that an attorney \"could be appointed\u201d adequately conveyed Williams\u2019 rights under <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b981-8\">. Clearly established federal law encompasses the holdings of Supreme Court cases decided as of the date the highest state-court decision reached the merits of Williams\u2019s claim. <em>See Greene v. Fisher, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 38, 45, 181 L.Ed.2d 336 (2011) (holding that a Supreme Court decision issued three months after the last state-court adjudication on the merits was not \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d for AEDPA purposes (quotation omitted)). <em>Florida v. Powell </em>was decided nearly six months before the Florida appellate court\u2019s <em>per curiam </em>affirmance here, so we may consider it in determining whether the Florida state court\u2019s decision was contrary to clearly established federal law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
