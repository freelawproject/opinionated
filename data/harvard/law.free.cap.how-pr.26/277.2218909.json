Clark agt. James Brooks and others.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b283-10\">On an <em>appeal </em>from an <em>order of sale and </em>reference, where a receiver has been appointed and has possession of the property, a <em>stay of proceedings pending the appeal </em>will be granted, where it appears the ease is soon to be <em>tried on the merits, </em>when a reference may be dispensed with.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number><em>New York Special </em>Term,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AXv\">February, 1864.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">Motion by defendants to continue a stay of proceedings pending the appeal taken by them from the order of sale and reference made in this action. .</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-6\">John McKeon, <em>for motion.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-7\">Henry A.

The case is soon to be tried on its merits, and the judgment which will then be rendered may, probably, entirely dispense with the contemplated reference\u2014perhaps with any reference whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">To permit the reference mentioned in the order in question to proceed at present would be to allow an inquiry to be conducted, at considerable expense and labor, which may prove to be entirely valueless for any purpose of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">When a very brief time must decide whether any, and if any, what character of reference will be necessary, I do not think it proper to permit one of doubtful utility to be prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">I have not failed to consider the suggestions pressed with so much zeal and ability by the learned counsel for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>plaintiff, as to the impropriety of the court, through receivers, conducting a newspaper of a political character (and I add whether political or otherwise) longer than is requisite to protect the interests of all parties. But as it has been conducted so long, I am not able to perceive that either the court, or the plaintiff, whose interest, it should be remembered, even on his own statement, is very trifling compared with that of the defendants, can be materially affected by its continuation for a short time longer, until the merits of the case can be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Motion to continue stay granted\u2014no costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
