Glentworth </em>agt. <em>Richard E. Moore and others, </em>and he came to the conclusion that, since the amendment of 1858 of sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>tion 307 of the Code, there has been and is no limitation to the number of term fees in the court of appeals, taxable under subdivision 7 of that section. A copy of his opinion having been handed to the court, I have examined it with care, and entirely agree with him. Judge Parker arrived at the same conclusion in <em>Adams </em>agt. <em>Perkins </em>(25 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>368). The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs, and the clerk should be directed to readjust the costs, and allow the $120 for the twelve term fees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
