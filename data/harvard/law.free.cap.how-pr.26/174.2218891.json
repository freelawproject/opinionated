Barnes to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-8\">It appeared from the plaintiff\u2019s complaint that he had devoted many years of labor and scientific research to the art of brewing ales, especially with reference to their keeping qualities in hot weather; in the course of which \"he, had discovered an art and process of manufacturing an ale which had become celebrated throughout the United States for its keeping qualities, and the superiority of the article as well as its economy in manufacture; that such discovery was of such a nature that it could not be patented; consequently the plaintiff was in the habit of teaching it to different brewers for a valuable consideration, they binding themselves to keep it secret. The complaint further averred that A. B. Nash <em>&amp; </em>Co., who were brewers in Troy, applied to the plaintiff for a knowledge of his secret, which the latter, for a valuable pecuniary consideration, agreed to impart to them, and thereupon an agreement was entered into between the plaintiff and A. B. Nash <em>&amp; </em>Co., to the effect that the plaintiff imparted to them his discovery, the said A. B. Nash <em>&amp; </em>Co. binding themselves in a penalty of $15,000 not to impart it to any one excepting their manager and agent, the defendant Charles N. Barnes, nor to suffer the knowledge of it to be acquired by any one through their negligence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-9\">It further averred that the defendants broke their agreement, after having experienced the beneficial nature of the improvement, by secretly imparting the knowledge of the process to divers other large and extensive brewers in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>city and other cities, whereby the plaintiff has been damaged $35,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-5\">It also appeared that the defendants claimed and set up that they would teach that process to other parties, whereby the plaintiff\u2019s business as a teacher of the art of brewing would be broken up, and the aims and labors of a lifetime would be frustrated by the inequitable acts of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-6\">The complaint concluded by praying judgment against A. B. Nash &amp; Co. for $35,000 damages, and for an injunction against all the defendants to prevent them from further disclosing the plaintiff\u2019s process.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-7\">To this the defendant, Charles N. Barnes, demurred.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b182-8\">John Townsend, <em>for defendant.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-9\">1st.
