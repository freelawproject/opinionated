It is, therefore, a trust to pay certain sums, not yet due, at certain fixed periods as they shall accrue ; to which, under numerous decisions, no valid objection can be made. It follows that the assignment must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>The plaintiffs failed to show by this evidence I think, that the furniture of the defendant Jacobson, alleged to be held by contract, comprised any articles other than those which were by law exempt from sale on execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The defendants must have judgment dismissing the complaint, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
