The plaintiff\u2019s attorney refused to receive the notice of appeal, on the ground that an undertaking had not also been filed and served. On the 29th September an undertaking was filed and a copy served on the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, which he returned, because too late. On the 30th September the notice of appeal and copy undertaking were again served on the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, who again refused to receive them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-13\">The motion is for an order staying proceedings on the judgment pending the appeal; setting aside any execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>which may have been issued upon the judgment, and for leave to file the undertaking <em>nunc pro tunc.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b100-5\">R. W. Townsend, <em>for defendant.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b100-6\">Niles &amp; Bagley, <em>for plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b100-7\">Monell, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AH\">The service of the notice of appeal on the 21st September (it having been conceded on the argument that it was in time) was sufficient to perfect the appeal. No undertaking is necessary in an appeal from a special to a general term of this court. The refusal, therefore, of the plaintiff to receive it was irregular. To stay proceedings on the judgment appealed from, the appellant must either obtain an order from the court for that purpose, or he must file and serve an undertaking as required on an appeal to the court of appeals <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 348); and it seems such undertaking must be filed and a copy <em>served with the notice of appeal. </em>The undertaking, therefore, which was served on the 29th September was too late. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 340; N. <em>Y. Central Ins. Co. </em>agt. <em>Safford, </em>10 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>344 ; <em>Cushman </em>agt. <em>Martin, </em>13 <em>id. </em>402.)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">There is no reason given in the moving affidavit for not serving the undertaking with the notice of appeal, and I am unable, therefore, under the authority of N. <em>Y. Central Ins. Co. </em>agt. <em>Safford (supra) </em>to give the defendant the relief he asks for on this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Upon furnishing a sufficient excuse for omitting to serve the undertaking at the time required, the court may relieve the appellant, and upon proper terms grant him a stay of proceedings. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 327.)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">The appellant can go on with his appeal, his notice being sufficient for that purpose ; but as the case now stands he cannot have a stay of proceedings. <em>(Cushman </em>agt. <em>Martin, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">The motion is denied, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
