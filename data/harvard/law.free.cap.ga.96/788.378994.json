In such a case, an injunction should be granted, preserving the existing status of the parties; and in the granting of such injunction, the judge may impose such conditions upon the complainant as will secure to the respondent such rights as may be awarded to him by the final decree in the case. <em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
