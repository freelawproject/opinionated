In the case under consideration, the plaintiff in error resided without the limits of the county in which the criminal prosecution was pending; the clerk of the superior court issued an ordinary subpoena addressed to him, and upon that he attended the court. This subpoena being issued without having first been countersigned by the solicitor-general, was issued in direct contravention of the provision of the code now under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>consideration. Any process which issues against the prohibition of a statute is void, and the person to whom it is directed is under no obligation to obey its mandate. This witness might have disregarded entirely this void process; but inasmuch as he saw proper to attend the court thereunder, he must be treated in law as a mere volunteer, and not as attending in obedience to the mandate of a lawful process. By the very terms of the act, he was not entitled to either his <em>per diem </em>or mileage allowance, and the judgment of the court disallowing his claim was correct, and is, accordingly, <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
