Nickerson, Judge, denying bail pending extradition to Israel. Leitner, a United States citizen, was arrested in Israel and charged with various acts of violence against Arabs in 1983-84. He was freed on bail after pledging to cooperate with the Israeli government. After apparently receiving death threats, but before trial, Leitner fled in September 1984 to the United States, where he had grown up. He has lived openly here for about IV2 years, he has a New York City taxi license in his name, has completed a semester at Pace Law School, and has lived with or frequently visited his parents in Queens. Under the Extradition Treaty with Israel, at Israel\u2019s request, the Government obtained a provisional arrest warrant in June 1985, but did not arrest appellant until January 15, 1986. Magistrate Scheindlin granted bail on the ground that appellant posed almost no risk of flight, especially given the conditions of the bond imposed, Leitner\u2019s lack of prior record, his family ties and the external pressures prompting his flight from Israel. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">In <em>Wright v. Henkel, </em>190 U.S. 40, 63, 23 S.Ct. 781, 787, 47 L.Ed. 948 (1903), the Supreme Court held that federal courts could grant bail in extradition cases in \u201cspecial circumstances.\u201d The Court\u2019s primary concern was that our Government be able to deliver the accused when the nation seeking extradition had complied with the extradition treaty. <em>Id. </em>at 62, 23 S.Ct. at 786. In <em>In re Mitchell, </em>171 F. 289, 289 (S.D.N.Y.1909), Judge Learned Hand held that bail should be granted \u201conly in the most pressing circumstances, and when the requirements of justice are absolutely peremptory.\u201d Special circumstances have been found when a prisoner needed to be free to pursue his civil case, <em>Mitchell, </em>or when the prisoner was a juvenile and there were no suitable holding facilities for him. <em>Hu Yau-Leung v. Soscia, </em>649 F.2d 914, 920 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 971, 102 S.Ct. 519, 70 L.Ed.2d 389 (1981). The courts continue to hold that there is a presumption against bail in extradition cases, and that bail can be granted only in \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 920; <em>United States v. Williams, </em>611 F.2d 914 (1st Cir. 1979); <em>United States v. Messina, </em>566 F.Supp. 740, 742 (E.D.N.Y.1983), although some courts have noted a trend toward liberalization in bail, at least in the provisional arrest context. <em>See Messina, </em>566 F.Supp. at 742; <em>Beaulieu v. Hartigan, </em>430 F.Supp. 915, 916 &amp; n. 2 (D.Mass.) (citing cases), <em>vacated in pertinent part, </em>554 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">Like various other extradition treaties, Article XI of the Israel-United States extradition treaty requires a \u201ccase of urgency\u201d before a party may apply for an accused\u2019s provisional arrest. Regardless whether determination of \u201curgency\u201d is non-justiciable, as the Government argues, <em>but see Caltagirone v. Grant, </em>629 F.2d 739, 744 n. 10 (2d Cir.1980); <em>Messina, </em>566 F.Supp. at 744-45 (questioning non-justiciability, but giving judicial deference to extraditing government\u2019s and this Government\u2019s determination of urgency), in this case, as found by the district court, the violent acts of terrorism allegedly involved, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>when coupled with any risk of flight warrant the denial of bail. In this sense, \u201curgency\u201d is not merely temporal in nature. Rather, the term involves other considerations including importance to the country seeking extradition and foreign policy concerns of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">It is true that the treaty parties moved slowly in arresting Leitner, and we take with a grain of salt the Government\u2019s claim that it could not locate him, despite the fact that he was driving a taxi and going to law school under his own name and apparently visiting his parents almost every weekend. Judge Nickerson did not explicitly address the urgency question, but he did find that the interest in producing extraditable persons \u201cis magnified where a defendant is charged with acts of terrorism.\u201d We agree. Similarly in <em>Messina, </em>he treated \u201curgency\u201d as less related to immediacy than to the importance of the case given the nature of the crime, the risk of flight, and the interests of the countries in extradition. The broader interpretation of the term that takes into account the interests of the treaty parties seems the appropriate one.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Judge Nickerson noted that Leitner had chosen to flee Israel when other alternatives apparently were open to him and that his prior flight, the seriousness of the crimes and the interests of the two governments in extradition weigh strongly against bail. Both governments are pledged to fighting terrorism and they must be evenhanded in their treatment of terrorists. Bail, however, is appropriate in \u201cspecial circumstances.\u201d Even a low risk of flight would not be dispositive. Other than the bond and Leitner\u2019s unblemished record in the United States, there are really no \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d unique to this appellant as in previously decided cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">We note that Leitner has already been detained a month and that under Article XI of the treaty he \u201cshall\u201d be set at liberty sixty days after his arrest if a request for extradition and proper documentation pursuant to Article X have not by then been received.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
