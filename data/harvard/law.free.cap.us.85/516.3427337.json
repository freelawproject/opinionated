The custom of Chaffee &amp; Co. was to ship whiskies in both directions; that is to say, northward towards Toledo and southward to Cincinnati. Going north such whiskies had to pass through a place called Piqua, which was the first place on the canal at which toll was payable when the vessel was going from Tippecanoe in the direction named. Going south, towards Cincinnati, the whiskies had to pass .through Dayton, the first place at which toll was payable when the vessel was going from Tippecanoe south. There was no other distillery at Tippecanoe. There were, however, in the whole distance between Piqua and Dayton three others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-7\">The Miami Canal, on \"which these whiskies were transported, had been made and for some years was managed by the State of Ohio. And a statute for \u201c the regulation of the navigation thereof and for the collection of tolls,\u201d enacted that no' boat should be permitted to pass on it unless the master *had first obtained a clearance for each voyage from the collector of tolls, which clearance the collector nearest to the place at which the boat began her voyage was required to issue. To enable the collector to issue clearances that should truly represent what cargo was on board, the act made it obligatory on the master to exhibit to the collectors \u201ca just and true account or bill of lading\u201d of \u201ceach and every article of property on board-,\u201d when the boat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>should depart on her voyage, or which should be taken on board afterwards; and further, to insure accuracy, every collector receiving a bill of lading might require the master to verify it by his oath.. The knowingly delivering any false bill was made an indictable offence, punishable with fine in three times the value of the property omitted or falsely stated in the bill. The bill of lading thus required was to be exhibited to the collector where any portion of the cargo should be unladen. The' act proceeded :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-5\">\u201c It shall be the duty of every collector to whom bills of lading are required to be presented, in order to obtain a clearance for any voyage, to make out from such bill or bills of lading, in a book, <em>a certificate, </em>containing a pertinent description of the articles composing the cargo-of the boat, for which clearance is about to bo issued, <em>properly classified and designated with reference to the rates and amount of tolls chargeable </em>thereon; which certificate shall be signed by the master, who shall also attest on oath or affirmation to the correctness thereof,- if required by the collector, befoi\u2019e the clearance shall be issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-6\">\u201cIn every case where a certificate is required to be -made out and signed, the collector shall enter upon the clearance a correct list or statement of all articles of lading contained in such certificate, properly classified and designated, with the amount of \u25a0tolls charged and received thereon, and shall sign his name thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-7\">\u201c On the arrival of any boat at the place of destination, or at any place in the course of the voyage where there is a collector\u2019s office, the master thereof shall immediately present to the collector the bill or bills of lading together with the clearance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-8\">\u201c No boat shall proceed on its voyage until the bill or bills of articles of lading on board thereof, together with the clearance and list of passengers, shall have been presented to the collector, nor <em>until all necessary examinations and'comparisons of such bills of lading, clearance, and cargo, shall have been </em>made, nor until all tolls payable at such office \u00a7hall have been paid; and the collector may detain both the bills of lading and clearance until the necessary entries shall be made on such clearance, and until all the requisitions of this section shall be complied with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-9\">\u201cNo part of the cargo of any boat shall be unladen' at the termination of any voyage until the clearance, together with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>the bill or bills of lading'of tie whole cargo, shall have been presented to the proper collector, and a permit obtained from such collector for such unlading, which permit such collector is hereby required to grant, after 'a reasonable time shall have elapsed for the examination of such clearance, bills of lading and cargo, and on the payment of all tolls which shall remain due.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-5\">Though, as already said, the canal had been originally managed by the State, it was not so managed at the time when the whiskies of Chaffee &amp; Co. were transported. The State had leased it, the lease-containing this provision :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-6\">\u201cSuch rights, privileges, and franchises now exercised by the State as may be necessary to manage, control, and keep in repair the public works, and collect tolls for the navigation of the same, together with the right to appoint superintendents, collectors, &amp;c., who shall have and exercise the same power and authority in the collection of tolls and water rents, and the levy of fines, as can now by law be exercised by similar officers and agents appointed by the State; and said lessee or lessees shall be governed by the rules and regulations for navigating the canals now in force, subject to such alterations and additions as may hereafter be established by law,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-7\">The purpose of the <em>company, </em>which had now leased the canal, apparently was to follow the rules about clearances that the statute had prescribed. But whether the rules had been followed with statutory rigor was less clear. ' Captains would come, it appeared, to the collector\u2019s office and report for a clearance; the collector's generally, though not always, knowing them. The bills of lading were usually produced, but occasionally a captain would happen to have left his bills behind, and in such case, if he was a person known to the collector, and a person whose word the collector thought he could safely take as to what was on board the boat, he would sometimes dispense with the production of the bills, and make out the clearance from the captain\u2019s verbal report; though this would not be done <em>ordinarily </em>with any master, and never in the case of \u201cnew men\u201d whom the collectors did not know. Captains were never interrogated upon their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>oaths; nor did the collector ever overhaul and make personal inspection of cargoes, or in this way or in any way have actual and personal knowledge whether the representation of the .captains or of the bills was strictly accurate. But however made, the captain would always certify the representation on which the clearance was granted to be true.- When, however, arriving at its destination, the boat came to be unladen, it was testified \u201cto be the duty of the collector at such place of unlading to see, when the boat is unloading, that the captain has given in his freight correctly; and if he sees any freight that is not on the clearance, he then brings the captain to an account for it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-5\">The certificates which the captains signed on the books of the collector would be in this form :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-6\">\u201c Collector\u2019s Office,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AuO\">Dayton, December 2d, 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-7\">\u201cI, H.

What the collector then did, or at least what it was his duty to do, was to check the clearances from other places, and see that they were right. He made memoranda in a book of freights as shown by them, or as found by himself, but these no captain signed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-7\">In one direction or in the other, Chaffee &amp; Co. had sent large quantities of whisky.

The declaration, which was founded on the italicized portion of the section above quoted, of the act of June 30th, 1864,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> charged that the \u201c defendants,\u201d from February 1st, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>1865, to September 1st, 1866, were residents at Tippecanoe, &amp;c., they, <em>the </em>defendants, then and there did \u201c carry on and transact the business of distillers of spirits, <em>under said firm name of H.

The demurrer was overruled. The defendants Sidney Chaffee and Hutchins then pleaded <em>not guilty </em>and <em>nil debet, </em>and the defendant William Chaffee pleaded separately that he was not a member of the firm of H. X&gt;. Chaffee &amp; Co., or interested in its business. The district attorney filed the common <em>similiter </em>to the pleas of Sidney Chaffee and Hutchins, and traversed by replication the plea of William Chaffee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-5\">The death of Highland Chaffee\u2019was then suggested,,and it was ordered that as to him \u201c all proceedings be stayed and abate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-6\">The case being subsequently called for trial, the government abandoned, in form, the suit against William Chaffee, the abandonment beiim entered of record..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-7\">On the trial, the defendants having proved that during the time embraced in the controversy, they had. paid taxes on full 6045 barrels of whisky made by them during that time, the government, in order to show that the defendants had in their custody or possession, dutiable whisky, \u201cfor the purpose of selling the same with the design of avoiding payment of the duties imposed thereon,\u201d offered in evidence the books of the collectors at Piqua and Dayton, which the collectors produced, to show by different certificates in them, on which clearances had been granted at Dayton or Piqua, the collection offices nearest to Tippecanoe, at which place, as already said, Chaffee &amp; Co. were the only distillers, that 200,000 gallons more whisky had been moved from the said place than duties were paid on. Certificates from the books at Cincinnati checking' the clearances, and showing what whiskies had arrived there, were also offered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-8\">The collectors at Piqua, Dayton, aud Cincinnati were examined. As would be inferable from what has been already stated, they had little personal knowledge of any facts bearing on th'e controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-9\">The handwriting off Kaufman, the young man who made some entries at Dayton, and who was dead, was proved, and the grandson of Brown, who made some others, was produced and sworn. But the government examined none of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>the captains whose names were signed to the several certificates in the books at Dayton and Piqua, as to the genuineness of their signatures, nor was proof given of the handwriting or death of any of them. The collector at Cincinnati did not testify from any knowledge of his own that his books contained true recqrds of what whiskies had arrived. Some, but not all, of the captains were examined as .witnesses, and testified to the carriage of whisky from Chaffee\u2019s distillery on their boats, at dates corresponding, and of quantities corresponding to their several certificates respectively. The government also offered evidence tending to prove that the distillery of Chaffee &amp; Co., at Tippecanoe, was of a capacity equal to a production of fifty barrels of whisky per day when run to its fullest capacity; a larger number of barrels than it was admitted that duties had been paid on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-5\">The defendants objected to the reception of the books, on the ground that it was hearsay and <em>res.inter alios acta. </em>But the evidence was admitted, \u201c not as evidence that whisky came from or belonged to the defendants, but only as competent to show that a given quantity passed a certain point on a given day, and if the government, did not connect this whisky with the defendants, the testimony would be stricken out.\u201d The defendants excepted. The evidence was never afterwards stricken out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-6\">For th\u00e9 purpose of showing the quantity of whisky on hand on the 26th of October, 1865, the defendants offered the evidence of tweqty-three witnesses. This testimony tended to prove that on the 1st day of July, 1864, when the distillery stopped, there was a large quautity of whisky on hand (perhaps 2000 barrels), which was stored in the cellar, grain-rooms, and other placea in or about the distillery; that this whisky, or the greater part of it, remained on the premises until the 26th of October, 1865, the several witnesses testifying to seeing it at different times from the 1st of July, 1864, until the 26th of October, 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-7\">The government, in rebuttal, offered the evidence of eleven witnesses. This testimony tended to prove that from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the 1st of July, 1864, to the summer of 1865, there was very much less whisky \u2014 certain witnesses said not much more than fifty barrels \u2014 at the distillery than was asserted by the defendants and testified to by their witnesses; and that, in the autumn of 1865,-up to the 26th day of October, there was little if any whisky there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-5\">Sidney Chaffee lived in Tippecanoe, and was about the distillery most of the time,'and attended to making purchases, and to other business of the firm of H. D. Chaffee &amp; Co., and Hutchins, during the time he wras a partner, was employed about the distillery. He testified that the firm of H. I). Chaffee &amp; Co. kept ordinary books of accounts. He was present in court during the entire trial, and Hutchins was in court at the close of defendant\u2019s testimony. Before the commencement of the trial, to wit, on the 3d of March, 1870, the government had caused this notice to be served on the defendants:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-6\">\u201c Tippecanoe, March 3d, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-7\">\u201c <em>The United States </em>v. <em>M.

The counsel for the defendants stated that they were at Buffalo. The counsel for the government refused to receive the statement as an excuse for the non-production of the books, and demanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>their production; and that S. L. Chaffee should be called as a witness for the defence to explain why they were not produced, and to testify generally in the case. The defendants did not produce the books and papers, and did not call either S. L. Chaffee or Hutchins as a witness in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-5\">Before charging, the court informed the counsel that it vrould allow evidence to be introduced at any stage of the case, to supply any omission or by way of explanation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-6\">It then proceeded to charge.

Compare the two and see upon which, in its own nature, as men of common sense, you can repose, your credence with most confidence. The one is plain, simple, and direct, without a motive of falsification. The other presents a spectacle like this: A phalanx of twenty men swearing on their .oaths to some two thousand barrels of whiskj?, at a given time, in a given place, and two-thirds as many, equally intelligent and equally respectable, with equal opportunities of knowledge, swearing thei\u2019e is not fifty barrels there. It is a hapless conflict, leaving the mind in uncertainty, with nothing whatever to rest upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-8\">\u201c It is, however, before you, and you will look carefully over its details, and give due weight to the ingenious and able criticisms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>which have been made by the distinguished counsel for the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-5\">Passing to the proofs generally, and to the effect to be given to the non-production of the books of the firm, and relying on <em>Clifton </em>v. <em>United States,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in 4 Howard, it instructed the jury among other things, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-6\">\u201c The proof in the outset may be defective. It may not be sufficient to enable you, without any doubt or hesitation, to find against the defendants, and still it may be your duty, nevertheless, so to find; for although I instruct you that the case must be made out beyond all reasonable doubt in this, as well as in criminal eases, yet the course of the defendants may have supplied, in the presumptions of law, all which this stringent rule demands. In determining, therefore, in the outset whether a case is established by the government, you will dismiss from your minds the perplexing question, whether it is so made out beyond all doubt. It needs not, in the exigencies of this case, be so proved in order to throw the burden of explanation upon the defendant, if from the facts you believe he has within his reach that power. In the end all reasonable doubt must be removed; but here, at this stage, you need say only \u2018is the case so far established as to call for explanation?\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-7\">\u201c If, then, you conclude that, unexplained and uncontroverted by any testimony, the opening proof would enable you to find against the defendants for the claim of the government, or any material part of it, you will then take up their testimony in view of the principle announced. Although the counsel for the defence, when this principle was announced, with spirit and energy begged leave to differ with the court in reference to the effect of not producing the books, and not swearing the defendants, still the presumption of law is that client and counsel have deliberately, and with full knowledge of the law and all its presumptions, elected to withhold this proof, and you will not in the smallest degree abate the full application of the principle on any notion that it. may have been misapprehended. The rule is one which I am confident will commend itself to your common reason. It is this : \u2018 Without exception, where a party has proof in his power, which, if produced, would render certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>material facts, the law presumes against a party who omits it, and authorizes a jury t\u00f3 resolve all doubts adversely to his defence. The same rule is applicable in a case whore a party once had proof in his power which had been voluntarily destroyed or placed beyond his reach.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-5\">\u201cIf you believe the books were kept which contained the facts necessary to show the real amount of whisky in the hands of the defendants, in October, 1865, and the amount which they had sold during the next ten months, or that the defendants, or that either of them, could, by their own oath, resolve all doubts on this point; if you believe this, then the circumstances of this case seem to come fully within this most necessary and beneficent rule.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-6\">To the instructions thus given the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-7\">The jury found that <em>\u201c the defendants owe, </em>to the plaintiffs the sum of $235,680, <em>in manner and form </em>as the plaintiffs have complained against them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-8\">Motions by the defendants for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were overruled, and the court entered judgment on the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-9\">The defendants now brought the case here, alleging that the court had erred among other ways\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-10\">1.

The demurrer should not have been overruled, aud the judgment should still be arrested for a misconception of the meaning of the section of the act on which the suit is brought, The whole section on which the suit is brought is homogeneous; its purpose was to insure the forfeiture of dutiable articles, <em>\u201cfound\u201d </em>in the possession or custody or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>within the control of any person for this unlawful purpose, and the punishment of the person in the custody or possession of \u201c <em>such </em>goods.\u201d The act does not refer to a design merely conceived or entertained by the owner of dutiable property, to sell it with the design of defrauding the -government. It is aimed at an overt act, a fraudulent attempt, and this is defined as custody, possession, or control, for the purpose of selling or removing, and not merely possession or control coincident with such purpose. In other words, the punishable possession is not that which is simultaneous with, but that'which is <em>'\u201cfor the purpose\u201d </em>of fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-5\">2. Independently of this the judgment should be arrested. The action is <em>debt </em>brought against Highland Chaffee, Sidney Chaffee, <em>William Chaffee, </em>and line Hutchins, partners, as H. D. Chaffee &amp; Co. During the progress of the cause Highland'Chaffee died. William Chaffee, by plea traversed the averment that he was a partner, aud the jury having been sworn and testimony given, the government abandoned the claim against him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-6\">This verdict, therefore, which was given, that \u201c the <em>defendants\u201d </em>owe, was bad in law. The action being <em>ex contractu, </em>upon an issue made up in part by the plea of <em>nil debet, </em>and the verdict expressing, not that the defendants are guilty, but that they <em>owe, </em>there could be in law no judgment against less than the whole number of those original defendants who were surviving, except upon a plea of personal disability of the acquitted defendant, not inconsistent with the truth of the declaration, as of lunacy, coverture, infancy, bankruptcy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-7\">Sir William Blackstone,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> speaking of implied contracts, says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-8\">\u201c Of this nature are such as are necessarily implied by the fundamental constitution of government, to which every man is a contracting party.' And thus it is that every person is bound and hath virtually agreed to pay such particular sums of money as are charged on him by the sentence, or assessed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>\u2022the interpretation of the law. . . . Whatever, therefore, the laws order any one to pay, that becomes instantly a debt which he hath beforehand contracted to discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-5\">Chief Baron Comyn<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-6\">\u201c Debt lies upon every contract, <em>in deed or in law. </em>As if an act of Parliament gives a penalty, and does not say to whom nor by what action it shall be recovered, an action of debt lies upon such statute by the party grieved.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b543-7\">So also Smith Thompson, J.:<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-8\">\u201cActions for penalties are civil actions, both in form and in substance, according to Blackstone. The action is founded upon that implied contract which every person enters into with the state to obey its laws.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-9\">\u2022 So also the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Webster,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which Persons, C. J., says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-10\"><em>\u201c </em>But if debt <em>qui tam </em>be sued against several, demanding a joint forfeiture, on a plea of <em>nil debet </em>all the defendants ought to be found indebted, because the form of the action and plea is on a joint contract, although the debt arises from a tort.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-11\">The action in <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Webster </em>was brought, in debt, to recover four penalties of $15 each, for taking fish by a seine or drag-net, against the form of the statute. A passage in Chitty, and the case of <em>Bastard </em>v. <em>Hancock, </em>in Carthew, may indeed be cited, opposed to this view; but the great authority of Comyn, Blackstone, Thompson, and Parsons,<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> the first names on either side of the Atlantic, cannot be set aside by a passage of Chitty on Pleading, sustained by a case in Carthew, a reporter, the accuracy of whose work Lord Thurlow questioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-12\">3. The court erred in its rulings upon the admission of testimony. The Cincinnati book being a record of arrivals, while the Dayton and Piqua books are records of clearances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>different questions would present themselves as to each, if each was admissible. , But no one of the books was a public record, nor as such had any one superior value, or any freedom from the ordinary condition's of admissibility of private books of entry. The collector at Cincinnati was not bound to keep any record of discharges. He gave no clearances after a vessel arrived. <em>His </em>books certainly were not made in pursuance of statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-5\">By specifying the reouired contents of the certificates, viz., a pertinent description of the articles composing the cargo \u201c properly classified and designated, <em>with reference to the rate and amount of tolls chargeable </em>thereon,\u201d the statute of Ohio shows that the State meant to keep only such <em>k </em>record of the movement.of property on its canals as might be necessary to secure its tolls. The same barrel, if it went forward and back on the canal, would be regarded and entered on \u2022 clearances as two barrels. But was it two barrels, and is the distiller to be charged for two ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-6\">The entries here were secondary evidence. The bills of lading from which they were made were the primary sources of knowledge; but no foundation was laid for the introduction of secondary evidence in the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-7\">Again, the entries were not competent as the declarations of <em>collectors, </em>for the collectors had no knowledge on the subject. They merely prepared the records from an examination of the bills of lading, or from what was a much less certain source, the recollections of captains as stated to them orally.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-8\">Nor were they competent as the certificates of the <em>captains, </em>because the certificates, considered as entries or declarations of the captains, were incompetent wfithout proof of the death or- non-accessibility of the captains, if they were not called. In the Cincinnati cases the captains signed nothing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-9\">It will not be argued that any of these certificates would be admitted in any English court; they do not come within the leading case of <em>Price </em>v. <em>Lord Torrington</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>nor any of the later cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>4. As to the errors in the charge. In substance, the charge was this: That while, in the end, the government must prove its claim true beyond a reasonable doubt, yet if before the defendants gave any proof it made out a plausible, reasonably-proved ease, so far established as to call for explanation as to any material part of its claim, then, if the defendants failed to produce their books and to testify in their own exculpation, <em>the law </em>presumed against them, resolving all doubts adversely to their defence; and all reasonable doubts having been thus removed by their fatal omission to prove their innocence by their own testimony and their books, it became the duty of the jury to resolve all doubts against the defendants in ascertaining the amount of the penalty to be assessed, by starting with the government\u2019s <em>primd facie </em>ease for $750,000, or whatever other sum such case established, aud marking out any or all of it, as far only as the jiii-y could so do without any doubt or hesitation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AFA\">This is no caricature, but a fair summary of the charge. Such-a charge substantially withdrew from the defendants their constitutional right of trial by jury, and converted yA'hat at common law and in equity would have been their protection, viz., the right to refuse to testify to their own conviction, into the machin\u00e9ry for their sure destruction, actually placing them in no better position than if they had failed to plead and the jury had been sworn to assess the debt and damages upon default.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b545-5\">\n<em>Mr. S. F. Phillips, Solicitor-General, contra:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-6\">1. The clause in the forty-eighth section, upon which the declaration was framed, aud which in the section as quoted <em>supra, </em>p. 517, is italicized, differs from the preceding clause in that it does not require a present possession for the institution.of proceedings. On the contrary, such proceedings may be founded upon any previous possession. The draftsman. of the section commences by providing punishments for two specific offences, aud then reverts to the first-named punishment for the purpose of providing for certain details <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>in the proceedings incident to the enforcement of such punishment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-5\">Legislators often use the word <em>shall </em>for <em>shall have. </em>It is rarely that they provide punishment for a man who <em>shall have </em>committed crime; on the coutrary, they almost always say <em>(ex. gr.) </em>he who <em>shall </em>commit treason shall suffer death, &amp;e.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-6\">2. The action being <em>debt upon a penal statute </em>against <em>three, two </em>only of whom are found indebted, judgment may well be given against the two. The particular distinction, first taken in <em>Bastard v. Hancock,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>reported by Carthew, between debt upon penal statutes and other forms of debt, was not under consideration by Blackstone, or Comyn, or Smith Thompson, J., referred to on the other side. The authorities relied on by the other side are, therefore, no authorities against that distinction. There remains for the plaintiffs in error the great authority of the elder.Parsons. The case in Carthew,- however, was not cited before him. And even Parsons, C. J., must yield a point of pleading to the extraordinary authority of Chitty and Sergeant Williams.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> The passage in Chitty has stood the test of twenty editions without change. The case in Carthew is the leading authority, and according to the reporter, it was.decided on the point of the proper <em>entry, </em>\u201cafter great debate\" in the-C. B. Lord Thurlow was fond of undervaluing persons who stood in his way. Ilis judgment of a common-law reporter like Carthew may be questioned. Two better common-lawyers, Willes and Kenyon, speak highly of Carthew as a reporter.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-7\">3; As .to the admissibility of evidence. Conceding that the entries in the canal books are but ordinary entries- in books kept in the course of official duty, how do they stand ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-8\">The canal books had been kept at three different offices, Piqua, Dayton, and Cincinnati; the first, of <em>clearances northwardly </em>from the place where the distillery was located; the second, of those <em>southwardly ; </em>and the third, of <em>arrivals </em>at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>southern termination of the canal. The course of business made it the duty of three persons to keep such books at the above places, respectively. The books of the latter were a cheek upon those of the former for all freight coming down' from, or from above, those points; and it Was the duty and practice of collectors at such points to <em>inspect the freight as the boat was unloaded, </em>above, for the purpose of checking the books at the clearing.offices, &amp;c. Dor all entries at Dayton there are corresponding ones at Cincinnati.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-5\">So far as entries were made by persons whose duty it was, and who are living, aud shown not to have <em>known </em>the truth of those entries, the principle which underlies the competency of this class of evidence is a confidence in the general honesty and truthfulness of such entries, like that felt in the general uniformity of all natural phenomena. All intelligent business persons feel great confidence in its revelations, irrespective of any inquiry into the intelligence of the officer who made the entries. It is enough to know that <em>these </em>are the freight books, say of such and such a steam navigation, or- railroad, or canal company, to cause one to conciliate at once favor for their contents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-6\">Much evidence quite as reliable as that of most other classes will be excluded, if it be required of clerks of companies doing transportation business by ships, railways, or canals, that they shall have a personal knowledge of the truth of every detail of freight entered by them in the course of duty; or, otherwise, that their books, kept in the only practicable way, shall not be competent evidence of such matters. A vgst mass of facts intimately connected -with commercial business, and therefore of great importance in litigation, is every day recorded in such books, in cases where 'it is impracticable, not to say impossible,- that the entry-maker should know their truth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-7\">The principle in <em>Price </em>v. <em>Lord Torrington </em>was as great a shock to the conservative thought of the profession at the beginning of the last century as its development administered by the court below is claimed to be to such thought now. It may well be said that such development is as nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>essary to the condition of commerce now as the form in which it originated was to the <em>business </em>of 1704. Such seems to be the tendency of those views of this court in <em>Fennerstein\u2019s Champagne </em>and <em>Gliquot\u2019s Champagne, </em>the former of which cases especially the court considered as making these entries evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-5\">4. As to the exceptions to the charge. In considering any paper <em>piecemeal, </em>\u2014 taking particular passages aud excepting to <em>them </em>\u2014 risk is run of doing injustice to its meaning by tearing connected passages asunder. Certain words attributed to the learned judge below may not have been just the words w\u2019hich he would have selected in his study, with opportunity for weighing them and fixing their exactest import, but the general drift is intelligible, and as reflected in the whole (the practical import of which is, that the jury wras authorized to resolve all doubts against a party who continued silent when he ought to speak) is correct. The abstract rule laid down is not only applicable to the present case but universally applicable, and as the court had already announced that it wmuld <em>at any stage of the ease </em>allow evidence to be introduced by way of explanation or to supply an omission, objection t'o it seems unreasonable.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b529-11\"> 13 Stat. at Large, 240.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b534-10\"> See <em>supra, </em>pp. 517, 518.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b539-9\"> Pages 145, 114.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b540-8\"> Page 242.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b542-9\"> 3 Commentaries, 159.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-6\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b543-13\"> Comyn\u2019s Digest, Title, Debt, A, 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-7\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b543-14\"> Stearns et al. v.

That section authorizes the forfeiture of dutiable goods when held for sale with that design, and of the raw materials and tools intended for use in the manufacture of such goods, and imposes a penalty upon the person who, with that purpose and design, has the goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>iii his possession or custody, or under his control. It is the possession with the unlawful purpose that the act was intended to reach by a forfeiture of the goods found with the party, and the punishment of such party. The defendants contend that such possession must exist when the seizure is made; the government insists that it is immaterial when the possession existed, if it was accompanied at the time with the unlawful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">When this case was argued the court consisted only of eight judges, and upon the question raised by the demurrer they are equally divided in opinion, and therefore no decision can be had thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">It does not appear by the record on what special grounds the motion in arrest of the judgment was made, but it was assumed in the argument of counsel that not only the question, which we have already mentioned as arising upon the demurrer, was presented ou the motion, but also the further question, whether the action, being debt against several, and the plea being <em>nil debit, </em>judgment could be entered against any less than the whole number surviving, except upon a plea of personal disability of the acquitted defendant, not inconsistent with the truth of the original declaration, such as coverture, infancy, or bankruptcy. The action was originally brought against four defendants, Highlaud Chaffee, Sidney Chaffee, William Chaffee, and Hutchins, who are described as late partners doing business under the firm name of II. D. Chaffee &amp; Co. During the progress of the cause Highland Chaffee died. William Chaffee pleaded that he was not, at the time designated in the declaration, or at any other time, a member of the firm of H. D. Chaffee &amp; Co., or interested in its business, and on the trial the plaintiffs abandoned their claim against him and allowed judgment to pass iii his favor. Sidney Chaffee and Hutchins pleaded both not guilty, and <em>nil debet, </em>and the verdict of the jury was that the defendants owed the plaintiffs the sum of two hundred and thirty-five thousand and six hundred and eighty dollars, in manner and form as they had complained, against them. Now the argument is, that as the declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>alleges a joint liability of all the defendants, the plea of <em>nil debet </em>by two of them \u2014 that they were not indebted to the plaintiffs in manner and form as alleged \u2014 puts in issue such joint liability, and the finding against the two with the acquittal of the other, showed that the plea of <em>nil debet </em>was true, aud that there was no such joint liability, but the contrary established; and, therefore, the judgment should be arrested. The answer to the argument is, that the rule stated as to the effect of the plea of <em>nil debet </em>only'- applies where the action is debt upon a simple contract. The action of- debt lies for a \u00a1statutory penalty, because the sum demanded is certain, but though in form <em>ex contractu, </em>it is founded in fact upon a tort. The necessity of establishing a joint liability in such cases does not, therefore, exist; it is sufficient if the liability of any of the defendants be shown. Judgment may be entered against them aud in favor of the others, whose complicity in the offence, for which the penalty is prescribed, is not proved', precisely as though the action were in form as well as in substance <em>ex delicto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The testimony admitted on the trial, to which the defendants specially excepted, consisted of the certificate-books of certain collectors of foils on the Miami Canal. That canal extends from Cincinnati to Toledo, in Ohio, passing through Tippecanoe. The nearest collector\u2019s office north of this place Avas at Piqua, the nearest south of it was at Dayton. Between these points there were four distilleries, thrfee besides that of the defendants. The canal belongs to the State, but was leased in 1861 to private parties for ten years, Avhieh term Avas extended, in 1867, for ten years more. The act of the legislature authorizing the lease provided that it should vest in the lessees such rights, privileges, and franchises then exercised by the State, as might be necessary to manage, control, and keep in repair the canal and collect tolls for its navigation, with the right to appoint superintendents and collectors, who should exercise the same power' and authority in the collection of tolls aud <em>water </em>rents and the levy of fines, as could then be exercised by similar officers and agents 'appointed by the State; and that the lessees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>should be governed by the rules and regulations for navigating the canals then in force, subject to such alterations as might thereafter be established by law. By an act of the State then in force, passed in 1840,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> no boat or float was allowed to start on a voyage on the canal without having a clearance from the collector at the nearest point of departure, or to pass any collector\u2019s office on the canal without producing the clearance with its bills of lading. In order to obtain the clearance, the master of the boat or float was required to present the bills of lading to the collector, and before it could be issued, it was the duty of the collector to make out from the bills of lading, in a book to be provided for that purpose, a certificate containing a description of the articles composing the cargo of the boat or float, properly classified and designated with reference to the rates and amount of tolls chargeable thereon; and that certificate was to be signed by the master, and, if required, its correctness was to be attested by his oath or affirmation. On the arrival of the boat or float at its place of destination, no part of the cargo could be unladen, landed, or removed from the canal until the clearance and bills of lading were presented to the collector at the place and his permit obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">It was proved on the trial that, between the dates mentioned in the declaration, the defendants had paid taxes on over six thousand barrels of whisky manufactured by them. But the plaintiffs endeavored to prove that a larger quautity was transported by vessel or rail from Tippecanoe between these dates, and -that there was no other distillery at that place, except the one owned by the defendants, from which it could have been received; and thus show that the defendants had had in their possession or custody within that period, distilled spirits for sale with the design of avoiding the payment of duties thereon, as alleged in the declaration. For this purpose they gave in evidence, against the objection of the defendants, the certificate-books of the collectors of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>tolls at Piqua, above Tippecanoe, and at Dayton, below it; and also a certificate-book kept by the collector at Cincinnati, showing the arrivals of freight at that port. The certificates stated the place from which the whisky was received, and its quantity, but not the parties to whom it belonged, or by whom it was -shipped. The collector at Daytoii testified as to the sources of information from which he made up the certificates, and it was admitted that the collectors at the other points would testify substantially to the same effect as to the sources of the information on which they acted. \u2019These were generally the freight bills presented by captains of boats, as required by the act of 1840; but sometimes the bills were not presented, and then the simple statements of the captains were received, if they were well known. The collectors had no personal knowledge of the truth- of the statements contained in the certificates; and though when a clearance was wanted they were at liberty to require the oath or affirmation of the captains signing the certificates to their correctness, it does not appear that either oath or affirmation was ever exacted. Some of the captains, but not all of themj were produced a,s witnesses at the trial as to their carriage of whisky from the distillery of the defendants, but they were not examined as to the genuineness of their signatures to the certificates; nor were the signatures of the other captains, who were not produced, proven, nor their death shown or absence accounted for. All the certificates were admitted without distinction. \"When the books were offered, objection was taken to their introduction, on the general ground that they were hearsay evidence and transactions between third parties. Subsequently a similar objection was taken to each of the certificates on a motion to exclude them from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The books were not public records; they stood on the same footing with the books of the trader or merchant. The fact that the lease was from the State did not change the character of the entries made by the collectors, who were simply agents of the lessees, and not public officers of the State. Their admissibility must, therefore, be deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>mined by the rule which governs the admissibility of entries made by private parties in the ordinary course of their business.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">And that rule, with some exceptions not including the present, case, requires, for the admissibility of the entries, not merely that they shall be contemporaneous with the facts to which they relate, but shall be made by parties having personal knowledge of the facts, and be corroborated by their testimony, if living and accessible, or by proof of their handwriting, if dead, or insane, or beyond the reach of the process or commission of the court/. The testimony of living witnesses personally cognizant of the facts of which they speak, given under the sanction of an oath in open court, where they may be subjected to cross-examination, affords the greatest security for truth. Their declarations, verbal or written, must, however, sometimes be admitted when they themselves cannot be called, in order to prevent a failure of justice. The admissibility of the declarations is in such cases limited by the necessity upon which it is founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">We do not deem it important to cite at length authorities for the rule and its limitation as we state it. They will be found in the approved treatises on evidence, and iti the numerous cases cited by counsel on the argument. In'this court the case of <em>Nicholls </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>reported in 8 Wheaton,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and that of <em>Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Weide, </em>reported in 9 Wallace,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> are illustrations of the rule. In the first case, it was held that after the death of a notary, his record of protests was admissible upon proof of his death and handwriting, the court observing that it was the best evidence the nature of the case admitted of, that the party being dead, his personal examination could not of course be had, and that the question was, whether there should be a total failure of justice or secondary evidence should.be admitted to prove the facts. In the second case, the books and ledger of the plaintiffs were admitted in evidence to show the amount and value-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>of goods lost by the burning of their store, upon the testimony of the parties who made the entries that they were correct, the court holding that the books \u201cwould not have been evidence <em>per se, </em>but with the testimony accompanying them, all objections wrere removed;\u201d and referring to cases decided in the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals of New York, in support of the ruling. In both of these cases the entries were made by parties personally cognizant of the facts. This knowledge of the party making the entry is essential to its admissibility. His testimony, if living, would be rejected if ignorant of the facts entered, and it would be strange if his death could improve its value in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The cases of <em>Fennerstein\u2019s Champagne </em>and <em>Cliquot\u2019s Champagne, </em>reported in the 3d Wallace,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> do not infringe upon this rule. Those were cases ivhere it became necessary to establish the market value of certain wines in France, and such' value could only be ascertained by sales made by dealers in those wines in different parts of the country, and the prices at which they were offered for sale, and circumstances affecting the demand for them. It would not be proved by a single transaction, for that may have been exceptional; the sale may have been made above the market price, or at a sacrifice below it. Market value is a matter of opinion which may require for its formation the consideration of a great variety of facts. To arrive at a just conclusion prices-current, sales, shipments, letters from dealers and manufacturers, may properly receive consideration. A party, without having been previously engaged in any mercantile transaction, may be able to give with great accuracy the market value of an article the dealing in which he has watched, and in stating the grounds of his opinion as a witness, lie may very properly refer to all these circumstances, and even the verbal declarations of dealers.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Now in the cases in 3d Wallace, statements of dealers in the champagne, pr of agents of dealers, made in the course of their duties as agents, aud-letters from dealers and prices-current, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>admitted as bearing upon the point sought to b.e established, the market value of the wines. There is no analogy between these cases and the one at bar. What was the market value of the wines in France was, as already said, a matter of opinion. Whether the defendants had in their possession or custody, between certain dates, 200,000 gallons of distilled spirits, or any other quantity, for the purpose of selling the same with a design to avoid the payment of duties thereon, was a question of fact and not of opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">If now we apply the rule which we have mentioned to the certificate-books of the canal collectors their inadmissibility is evident. . They were not competent evidence as declarations of the collectors, for the collectors had no personal knowledge of the matters stated; they derived all their information either from the bills of lading or verbal statements of the captains. Nor were the books competent evidence as declarations of the captains, because it does not appear that the bills of lading were prepared by them, or that they had personal knowledge of their correctness, or that their verbal statements, when the bills of lading were not produced, were founded upon personal knowledge; and besides, many of the certificates were admitted without calling the captains who signed them, and without proof of their death or inaccessibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">It remains to consider the exceptions taken to the charge to. the jury. These are sixteen in number, and are directed principally to the error which pervades the whole change, consisting in' the instruction reiterated in different forms, that after the government had made out a <em>prima facie </em>case against the defendants, if the jury believed the defendants had it in their power to explain the matters appearing against them, and did not do so, all doubt arising upon such <em>prima facie </em>case must be resolved against them. As we have stated, the defendants had paid taxes on over six thousand barrels of whisky manufactured by them between the dates mentioqed in the declaration. Nearly this number was traced to consignees. By the. canal certificates and railroad receipts the government had shown in. that way a trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>portation from Tippecanoe of over two thousand barrels more. It was admitted that no charge was to be made to the defendants for any amount they had on hand in October, 1865, although the declaration charges the possession with the unlawful purpose to have been between February 1st, 1865, and September 1st, 1866. The defendants endeavored to show that they had on hand at that time between two and three thousand barrels, and for that purpose called in a large number of witnesses, neighbors, and others, who had visited the distillery during that period. The estimates of the amount by these witnesses differed materially, being made from recollection. The defendants were present at the trial, but were not called as witnesses. It was proved that they kept books, consisting of day-books, journals, and ledgers.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Now the\u2019 court instructed the jury that it was a rule, without exception, that where a party has proof in his power which, if produced, would render material facts certain, the law presumes against him if he omits to produce it and authorizes a j ury to resolve all doubts adversely to his defence; that although the case must be made out against the defendants beyond all reasonable doubt in this case as well .as in crimiual cases, yet the course of the defendants may have supplied in the presumptions of law all which this stringent rule demanded. \u201c In determining, therefore, in the outset,\u201d said the court to the jury, \u201cwhether a case.is established by th^.government, you will dismiss from your minds the perplexing question whether it is so made out beyond all doubt. It need no.t, in the exigencies of this case, be so proved in order to throw the burden of explanation upon the defendant, if from the facts you believe he has within his reach that power. In the end, all reasonable doubt must be removed, but here, at this stage, you need say only, is the case so far established as to call for explanation.\u201d . . . \u201cIf, then, you conclude that, unexplained and uncontroverted by any testimony, the opening proof would enable you to find against the defendants for the claim of the government, or any material part of it, you will then take up their testimony in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>view of the principle\u201d stated, that of presuming against at party who fails to produce proofs in his possession. And again, the court instructed the jury that the law presumed that the defendants kept the accounts usual .and necessary for the correct understanding of their large business and an accurate accounting between the partners, and that the books were in existence and accessible to the defendants unless the contrary were shown, and then said to the jury, \u201c If you believe the books were kept which contained the facts necessary to show the real amount of whisky in the hands of the defendants in October, 1865, and the amount which they had sold during the next ten months, or that the defendants, or either of them, could by their own oath resolve all doubts on this point; if you believe this, then the circumstances of this case seem to come fully within this most necessary and beneficent rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The purport of all this was to tell the jury that, although the defendants must be proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, yet if the government had made out a <em>primd facie </em>case against them, not one free from all doubt, but one which disclosed circumstances requiring explanation, and the defendants did not explain, the perplexing question of their guilt need not disturb the minds of the jurors; their silence supplied in the presumptions of the law that full proof which should dispel all reasonable doubt. In other words, the court instructed the jury, in substance, that the government need only prove that the defendants were presumptively guilty, and the duty thereupon devolved upon them to establish their innocence, and if they did not they were guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">We do not think it at all necessary to go into any argument to show the error of this' instruction. The error is palpable on its statement. All the authorities condemn it.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The case of <em>Clifton </em>v. <em>United </em>States, in 4 Howard, cited by the court below, was decided upon a statute which cast the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>burden of proof upon the claimant in seizure cases after probable cause was shown for the prosecution, and, therefore, has no application.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The instruction sets at naught established principles, and justifies the criticism of counsel that it substantially withdrew from the defendants their constitutional right of trial by jury, and converted what at law was intended for their protection \u2014 the right to refuse to testify \u2014 into the machinery for their sure destruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Judgment reversed, and the cause</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Remanded eor a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b551-6\"> Entitled \u201c An act to provide for the protection of the canals of the State of Ohio, the regulation of the navigation thereof, and for the collection of tolls;\u201d approved March 28th, 1840.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\"> Page 326.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\"> Page 677.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\"> Pages 114, 145.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b554-7\"> Alfonso v.
