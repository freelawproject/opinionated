At the time the note was given, as ever before iu Louisiana since it had been settled by the whites, slavery existed, and the sale of slaves was lawful. But in 1865 an amendment, the 13th, to the Constitution of the United States was adopted, in these words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-6\">\u201cNeither slavery nor involuntary servitude . . . shall exist within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-7\">And in 1867 the Supreme Court of Louisiana adjudged it to be a principle of jurisprudence in that State that contracts for the sale of persons were void, and should not be enforced in their courts. After this decision, that is to say, in July, 1868, Tabb sued Boyce on the note. Boyce pleaded that the consideration of the note was the sale of slaves, and that the decisions of the Supreme Court of Louisiana had fully and unequivocally established that all obligations thus contracted were void and of no effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-8\">The court thus charged :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-9\">\u201c It is not a legal defence to a suit brought on a promissory note executed iu this State on the 13th of February, 1861, by the holder against the maker thereof,' to allege and prove that such note was given as the price, or a part of the price, of slaves sold to the maker.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-10\">\u201c That such sale was at the time lawful and valid in the said State is a sufficient consideration for a note, and the obligation cannot be impaired by laws of a State passed subsequently to the date thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-11\">\u201cNo law of the United States has impaired such obligation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-12\">Verdict and judgment.having gone for the plaintiff\u2019, the defendant brought the case here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b559-13\"><em>Mr. P. </em>Phillips, <em>for the. plaintiff in error,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ace\">relied on the decisions of the Supreme Court of .Louisiana, already referred to, and the thirty-fourth section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, above quoted.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b559-14\">\n<em>Mr. L.

This subject received the careful attention of this court in <em>White </em>v. <em>Hart, </em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and we are satisfied of the soundness of the views there presented. The case of <em>Osborne </em>v. Nicholson<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> is also decisive of the last point in the charge. In that ca.se it was held that contracts relating to slaves, valid-when made, were not impaired by the thirteenth amendment to the Constitution, and it would serve no useful purpose to restate the argument by w7hich that decision was supported. It is sufficient to say that we have seen no reason to question the correctness of the interpretation given \u25a0to that amendment in its application to that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">It is urged on the part of the plaintiff in error, as the highest court in Louisiana has, on grounds of.public policy, refused to enforce contracts like this since the abolition of slavery, that the thirty-fourth section of the Judiciary Act \u2022of 1789 obliges this court to follow that rule of decision. This is an erroneous view of the obligation imposed by that section on this court, as our decisions abundantly show.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> The provisions of that section do not apply, nor was it intended they should apply, to questions of a general nature not based on a locat statute or usage, nor on any rule of law affecting titles to land, nor on any principle which had become a settled rule of property. The decisions of the State courts, on all questions not thus affected, are not conclusive authority, although they are entitled to, and will receive from us, attention and respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Judgment aee\u00edrmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b560-9\"> 13 Wallace, 647.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"AQI\"> Ib. 655.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b560-10\"> Swift <em>v. </em>Tyson, 16 Peters, 1; Watson <em>v. </em>Tarpley, 18 Howard, 520; Delmas <em>v. </em>Insurance Company, 14 Wallace, 665.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
