If A. becomes liable for the faithful discharge.of duties by B. , as clerk for C., and it should come to the knowledge of C. , that B. had embezzled his funds, but notwithstanding C. continues him in his employment, it would be a fraud on A., ignorant of this embezzlement, to hold him responsible for any subsequent act of dishonesty. So we say, in this ease, that the knowledge of the government that Quillian had embezzled its funds, should have caused his immediate dismissal. This would have terminated the liability of his sureties, and limited it to the amount then due. . But when the government chooses to continue in office an officer known to have committed such an act,- it takes upon itself the trust of his future honesty.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b675-11\">\n<em>Mr. S.
