(a firm composed of one Kintzing and a certain Lindsley) were grocers in St. Louis, and kept a bank account with Bartholow &amp; Co., bankers in the same city. On the 15th of January, 1869, these last discounted a note for $2500 of their^customers, the said Kintzing &amp; Go., indorsed by J. B.

These assembled and \u201c most of .them\u201d signed a deed of composition, by which they agreed to take seventy cents on the dollar, in notes of Kintzing, payable in' six, twelve, and eighteen months. But there was a provision in the deed that it should not be binding on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>any creditors unless agreed to and signed by all.

Spencer, for the plaintiffs in error:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-10\">1. Bartholow &amp; Co. were compelled to receive payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>when tendered, since if they had refused to receive payment the indorser, Wilcox, whose liability was contingent only on non-payment by Kintzing &amp; Co., would have been discharged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-6\">2. Bartholow &amp; Co. had no notice of Kintzing\u2019s insolvency. The case, as found, is perhaps defective, in not showing more particularly than it does the condition of Kintzing &amp; Co.\u2019s affairs \u2014 the relative state of their debts and.assets \u2014 when they called their creditors together.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> But it is clear that it .was considered that a release of 30 per cent, would set Kintzing up; and that creditors to the amount of more than $100,000 did not only sign off at the rate of 70 cents on the dollar, but did actually take composition notes; the notes that came due in August \u2014 six months from the date of the deed of composition \u2014 having as found been $25,000. To this exteut, therefore, \u2014 :a very large extent, it would seem, from the magnitude of the figures, \u2014 we may assume as matter of law, that Kintzing was released, notwithstanding the clause in the deed that the composition should not bind any creditor unless all agreed to it. The creditors who not only signed but took and kept the notes, in law waived that clause.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> The case then \u00cd3 this: A trader having solid assets, finds himself embarrassed; he calls his creditors together and gets from \u201c the most of them \u201d a release of 30 per cent, of their claims, contingent on all signing. \u2022 He expects to get th\u00e9 sign'atui\u2019es of all. A large proportion not .only sign but actually take notes,.and so in law release him to the extent of 30 per cent. <em>After </em>this, he pays a. person who had not released; one who being perfectly secured otherwise had no interest.to look into or even to watch his affairs, and doubtless had not looked into or even watched them. Continuing insolvency after such a release is not so violently presumable as that every one dealing with the party afterwards must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>be taken, as of course, to deal with him, with- legal notice of it;- that is to say, with \u201c reasonable cause to believe \u201d it; and if he has no such legal notice, \u2014 no \u201c reasonable cause to believe\u201d it, \u2014 he cannot have received the payment in fraud of the.Bankrupt law. Indeed, in such a case, it is hard to believe that even the debtor can have made the payment with a view to give a preference. The only object which a debtor can have in compromising with creditors is to secure a safe position. Not only Bartholow &amp; Co., but Kintzing himself, may have well believed that such a position had been obtained by Kintzing here; and,the fact that the note had lain dishonored for several months is nothing against this view. Kintzing <em>had, </em>indeed, been embarrassed (perhaps insolvent), and unable to go on; but now, when he pays, he had by the release of even a portion of his creditors got on his feet. Why had he let the note lie so long? Because during that time he was embarrassed or insolvent. Why does he now pay it? Because his .creditors to the amount of more than $100,000 had, in fact and in law, released 30 per cent, of their debts, and extended for six, twelve, and eighteen months the payment of the remaining 70 per cent., and he thinks he is not insolvent. The very fact of the <em>previous </em>delay shows on his own part his now supposed solvency; while as to Bartholow &amp; Co., if'they had not supposed him now solvent, why would they, as it of necessity is alleged that they did, in fraud of the Bankrupt Act, receive payment, and so incur the danger of a suit just such as the present, when all the while they had Wilcox liable to them, from whom they could have got payment without any danger whatever ?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b651-6\">\n<em>Messrs.

Wilcox. Before its maturity Wilcox, who was solvent, waived protest and notice, and the note remained unpaid until August 9th, when Kintzing paid the amount to plaintiffs in error. In the meantime Kintzing &amp; Co. failed'in business, and in February attempted a composition with their creditors at seventy cents on the dollar, in notes payable in six, twelve, and eighteen months. The plaintiffs in error did not sign this agreement, though they knew bf it, and that effort seems to have failed. It must be conceded that Kintzing was utterly insolvent when he paid the note, and this must have been known to plaintiffs in error. A petition in bankruptcy was filed against Kintzing within less than four months after the payment of the note, and Bean, the defendant in error, having been appointed assignee, brought the present suit to recover the money so paid, as being a preference of a creditor forbidden by the Bankrupt law.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">If it were a transaction solely between Kintzing and the bankers there seems to be no reason to doubt that the payment was such a preference as would enable the assignee to recover it back. But the case is not a little embarrassed by the fact that the indorser, Wilcox, was solvent, and was liable on the note to the bankers, and the question arises whether, under such circumstances, they were at l\u00edb\u00f3rty to refuse to receive payment of the principal without losing their claim upon the indorser, who-was probably a mere accommodation surety. It is a question not without difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">It is vei\u2019y true that an ingenious argument is made to show that by an arrangement between Kintzing and his partner the former assumed all the debts under the attempted compromise, aud took all the property of the former, and that, by reason of the partial success of the compromise, Kintzing was no longer insolvent. But the facts in the finding of the court leave no room to doubt that Kintzing was, after the failure, always insolvent, in the sense of being unable to pay his current overdue debts, and of this plaintiffs could not be unaware, since they held the note, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>which they received the money now sued for, about five mouths after its maturity, without payment, and without their signing the compromise paper. They must, therefore, have kuown that, in the sense of the Bankrupt law, Kintzing had been insolvent for months before they received payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Does the fact that \"Wilcox, the indorser, was solvent, and was liable, change the rule as to payment as a preference?</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The statute in express terms forbids such preference, not only to an ordinary creditor of the bankrupt, but to any person who is under any liability for him-; and it not only forbids payment, but it forbids any transfer or pledge of property as security to indemnify such persons. It is, therefore, very evident that the statute did ndt intend to place an indorser or other surety in any better position in this regard than the principal creditor, and that if the payment in the case before us had been made to the indorser, it would have been recoverable by the assignee. If the indorser had paid the note, as he was legally bound to do, when it fell due, or at any time afterwards; and then received the amount of the bankrupt, it could certainly have been recovered of him. Or if the money had been paid to him directly instead of the holder of the note it could have been recovered, or if the money or other property had been placed in his hand to meet the note or to secure him instead of paying it to the bankers, he would have been liable. He would not, therefore, have beeii placed in any worse position than he already occupied if the holders of the note had refused to receive the money of the bankrupt. It is very obvious that the statute intended, in pursuit of its policy of equal distribution, to exclude both the holder of the note and the surety or indorser from the right to receive payment from the insolvent bankrupt. It is forbidden. It is called a fraud upon the statute in one place and an evasion of it in another. It was made by the statute equally the duty of the holder of the note and of the indorser to refuse to receive such a payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Under these circumstances, whatever might have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>the right of the indorser, in' the absence of the Bankrupt law, to set up a tender by the debtor and a refusal of the note-holder to receive payment, as a defence to a suit against him as indorser, no court of law or equity could sustain such a defence, while that law furnishes the paramount rule of conduct for all the parties to the transaction; and when in obeying the mandates of that law the indorser is placed in no worse position than he was before, while by receiving the money the holder of the note makes himself liable to a judgment for the amount in favor of the bankrupt\u2019s assignee, aud loses his right to recover, either of. the indorser or of the bankrupt\u2019s, estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">We are of opinion, therefore, notwithstanding the hardship of the case, which is more apparent than real, that the payment must be held to be a preference within the Bankrupt law, and. that the judgment of the court below, that the assignee should recover it, must be</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
