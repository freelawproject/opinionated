The case was thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-8\">The State of California' was admitted into the.Union on the 9th of September, 1850. At the first session of its legislature afterwards, namely, on the 26th of Maroh, 1851, an act was passed entitled il An act, to provide for the disposition of certain property of the State of California,\u201d which granted to the city of San Francisco the use and occupation, for ninety-nine years, of certain lands lying in front of the city covered by the tidewaters of the bay of San Francisco.

Nor is it necessary to controvert the proposition that in several of the States, by general legislation or immemorial usage, the proprietor, whose land is bounded by the shore of the sea, or of an arm of the sea, possesses a similar right to erect a wharf or pier in front of his land, extending into the waters to-the point where they are navigable. In the abseuce of such legislation or usage, however, the common-law rule would govern the rights of the proprietor, at least in those States where the common law obtains. By that law the title to the shore of the sea, and of the arms of the sea, and in the soils under tidewaters is, in England, in the king, and, in this country, in the State. Any erection thereon without license is, therefore, deemed an encroachment upon the property of the. sovereign, or, as it is termed in the language of the law, a <em>purpreslure, </em>which he may remove at pleasure, whether it tend to obstruct navigation or otherwise. <footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">But in this case no inquiry as to the rights of a riparian proprietor, by either the common law or local usage or regulation, is needed. The complainant is not the proprietor of any land bordering on. the <em>shore </em>of the sea, in any proper sense of that term. His land is situated nearly half a mile from what was the shore of the bay of San Eraneisco, at the time California ivas admitted into the Union, and over it the water at the lowest tide then flowed at a depth sufficient to float vessels of ordiuary size. Although the title to the soil under the tidewaters of the bay was acquired by the United States by cession from Mexico, equally with the title to the upland, they held it only in trust for the future State. Upon the admission of California into the Union upon equal footing with the original States, absolute property in, and do<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>minion and sovereignty over, all soils under the tidewaters within her limits passed to the State, with the consequent right to dispose of the title to any part of said soils in such manner as she might deem proper, subject only to the paramount right of navigation over the waters, so far as such navigation might be required by the necessities of commerce with foreign nations or among the several States, the regulation of which was vested in the General government.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Acting upon the rights thus acquired, the legislature of the State, on the 26th of March, 1851, a-t, its first session after the admission, passed an act disposing of portions of the lands covered by the tidewaters of the bay, in front of the city of San Francisco. That act is generally known in the State as the I^each and Water-Lot Act-<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> It granted to the city, for the term of ninety-nine year\u00a7, the use and occupation of lands thus covered, with some specified exceptions, lying within a certain designated line, described according to a map of the city on record in the-recorder\u2019s office of the county, and declared that the line thus designated should \u201c be and remain a'permanent water front\u201d of the city. It also provided that the authorities of the city should keep the space beyond the line to the distance of five hundred yards, \u201c clear and free from all obstructions whatsoever;\u201d and reserved to the State the right to regulate the'construction of wbarves.and other improvements, so that they should not interfere with the shipping and commercial interests of the bay and harbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">A subsequent act of the legislature, passed oh the 1st of May, 1851, authorized the city of San Francisco to construct wharves at the end of all the streets commencing with the bay, the wharves 'to be made by extending the streets into the bay for a distauce not exceeding two hundred yards beyond the outside line of the beach apd water-lots, the line established as the permanent water front of the city; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>provided that the space between the wharves, when extended, should remain free from obstructions, and be used as public slips for the accommodation and benefit of the general commerce of the city and State.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">It was after the passage of these acts that the predecessors, of the complainant acquired all the title to the lots which he holds; and they took whatever interest they obtained in subordination to the control by the city over the space immediately beyond the line of the water front, and the right of the State to regulate the construction of wharves and other improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">There is, therefore, no just foundation for the claim by the complainant as a riparian proprietor of a right to wharf out into the bay in front of his land. He holds, as his predecessors took the premises, freed from any such appendant right.- The erection of his wharf, the obstruction to the use of which is the cause of the present suit, was', therefore, not only an interference with the rightful control of the city over the space occupied by it, but was an encroachment upon the soil of the State which she could remove at pleasure. Having the power of removal she could, without regard to the existence of the wharf, authorize improvements in the harbor, by the construction of which the use of the wharf would necessarily be desti\u2019oyed. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">But it is contended by the complainant that he had acquired by prescription a perfect title to the wharf when the present suit was commenced; in other words, that he or his grantors had been in the-uninterrupted possession of the wharf for a period which barred the right of the State under her statute of limitations. The wharf was constructed in 1854; the defendants commenced the piling, capping, and . planking, which constitute the obstruction complained of, in 1867; and the statute of limitations of the State declares that, \u201c The people of the State will not sue any person for, or in respect of, any real property, or the issues or profits thereof, by reason of the right or title of the people to the same, unless\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">\u201cFirst, such right or title shall have accrued within ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>years before any action or other proceeding for the same shall be commenced; or unless, .</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u201c Second, the people, <em>o\\' </em>those from whom they claim, shall have received the rents or profits of such real\u2019property, or some part thereof, within the space of ten years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Upon the supposed operation of this statute the pretension of the complainant rests.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In auswer to this pretension - it is contended with much force that the statute only applies to lands which the State holds, as private proprietor, for sale or other disposition, and in-respect to which the title may be lost by adverse possession, as defined in the same statute, and not to lands which she holds as sovereign in trust for the public. To constitute sufficient adverse possession under the statute to bar the owner, when the claim of title is not founded upon a written instrument, the land must have been protected by a substantial inclosure, or been usually cultivated or improved, conditions inapplicable to the possession of land covered by tidewater, or of a wharf constructed thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">- Where lands are held by the State simply for sale or other disposition, and not as sovereign in trust for the public, there is some reason in requiring the assertion of her rights within a limited period, when any portion of such lauds is intruded upon, or occupied without her permission, and the policy of the statute would be carried out by restricting its application to such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">The terms, \u201c shall have accrued,\u201d are used in the sense of \u201c shall havNexisted <em>\u201d </em>within the period designated. The title of the State to soils under the tidewaters of the bay accrued on her admission into the Union twenty-three years ago, but yet it would not be pretended that the State could not sue for any portion of such soils Upon which a party had encroached, because ten years had elapsed since such admission. A literal construction of the terms used would denude the State of nearly the whole of her property. It would prevent her from suing an intruder of yesterday -upon a title of twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">But assuming that the statute applies to lands held by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>State, as sovereign, in trust for.public purposes equally as to other lauds, before the ten years prescribed had elapsed after the erection of the wharf, namely, in April, 1863, the legislature passed an act creating the Board of State Harbor Commissioners, the defendants in this suit, and provided that the commissioners should take possession of and hold all that portion of the bay lying along- the water front of the city and county of San Francisco, and adjacent, thereto, to the distance of six hundred feet into the waters of the bay, from the line of the '&gt;,ater front, together with all the improvements, rights, privileges, franchises, easements, and appurtenances connected therewith or appertaining thereto,' except such portions of the water front as were held by parties under valid leases, and of those portions when the leases expired. That act also authorized the' commissioners to \"institute suits for the possession of any wharf or wharves, and other rights and privileges, for the recovery of tolls, dockage, and wharfage; and for the removal of obstructions, and the abatement of nuisances on the water front, and to prosecute the suits to judgment; and declared that the possession and control of the water front, with its improvements, rights, privileges, franchises, easements, and appurtenances, were vested in the commissioners for certain specified -purposes, all of which related to the protection of the harbor, the construction of wharves, landings, and other improvements intended for the safety and convenience of shipping and consequent promotion of commerce. \u2019 The act also prohibited any subsequent collection of tolls, wharfage, and dockage by any person or company, on any part of the water front, without authority of the commissioners, and made a violation of the prohibition a public offence, punishable by fine or imprisonment or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">There is in these provisions a most emphatic declaration on the part of the legislature, that the State did not intend to abandon her control over the water front of the city, or to allofir by silence any rights therein, which she held as sovereign in trust for the public, to pass into private ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Statutes of limitation, as observed in a recent case in this court,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u201c are founded upon the general experience of mankind,-that claims which are valid are not usually allowed to' remain neglected. The lapse of years without any attempt to enforce a demand, creates,, therefore, a presumption against its original validity, or that it has ceased to subsist. This presumption is made by these statutes a positive bar; and they thus become statutes of repose, protecting parties frond the prosecution of stale claims, when by loss of evidence from the death of some witnesses and the imperfect recollection of others, or the destruction of documents, it might be impossible to establish the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Although this language was used with reference to a demand upon \u00e1 policy of insurance, it applies equally to claims for property in the possession of others. They are not generally held for long periods without some attempt at their enforcement. When,- therefore, no claim to property is made for years against the possessor, the presumption arises that his possession is .founded in right, and by statute the presumption being conclusive, the possessor is said to have acquired title by operation of the statute or by prescription. The presumption to which the statute gives this effect extends, however, only against individual claimants; their personal interest is supposed to be sufficient, to induce vigilance in the enforcement of their claims. It does not extend against the State, which acts-through numerous agents, having no such incentive to prosecute her claims. The rule, therefore, with respect to her rights is that they are not lost or impaired by th,e negligence of her officers,-a rule which has been found by experience essential to the preservation of the interests and property of the public. Statutes of limitation are not for this l\u2019eason held to embrace the State, unless she is expressly designated, or necessarily included by the .nature of the mischiefs to be remedied.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The statute of California is exceptional.in this particular. It declares that the State will not sue for or in respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>real property, unless her title or right has existed within a prescribed time, or rents or profits have been received within that period. She llius allows a presumption to arise in favor of any occupant of her lands, and that presumption to become absolute, that she possesses no title or interest therein, if within that period no assertion of her title or interest is made.\u2019 Bnt this presumption is rebutted when such assertion is made, and it may be made by her as well by legislative act as by judicial proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">In the present case, the act creating the harbor commissioners and authorizing them to take possession and improve the water front, was a public act relating to a matter of public concern, of which the complainant and all others were bound' to take notice. \u25a0 Hardly anything, which we can readily conceive of, would be more expressive of the intention of the legislature that the State should conserve her title and interest in the whole water front of the city. In our judgment, it prevented the complainant from acquiring the \u2022title of the State by operation of the statute of limitations, as effectually as if that statute had not been in existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b77-6\"> 10 Wallace, 497.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b77-8\"> Angell on Tidewaters, 198, 199.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b78-7\"> Pollard\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Hagan, 3 Howard, 212; Mumford <em>v. </em>Wardwell, 6 Wallace, 436.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b78-8\"> The act is entitled \u201cAn act to provide.for the disposition of certain property of the State of California.\u201d Laws of California for 1851, p. 307.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b82-7\"> Riddlesbarger <em>v. </em>Hartford Insurance Company, 7 Wallace, 390.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
