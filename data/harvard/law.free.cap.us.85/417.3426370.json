Among them were two acts, one of March 10th, 1824,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and the other of February 6th, 1839,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> whose conjoint effect ap- ' parently was to divide the State into three districts, a northern, a middl\u00e9 (this latter embracing Barbour County, one of the counties of Alabama), and a southern, whose terms and sessions were to be held at Mobile. These acts gave to these different District C\u00f3urts, in general terms, the jurisdiction and powers of Circuit Courts.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-5\">With these various acts in force, one Kolb, a citizen of Barbour County, already mentioned as in the judicial district designated by Congress as the middle one, sued the State. Insurance Company of <em>Missouri, </em>by process in attachment, in a State court sitting at Euphala, in the county of Barbour aforesaid. On the 11th December, 1872, the insurance company applied to the said- State court where the suit- was brought, alleging its incorporation by and citizen- \u25a0 ship in Missouri, and praying for the removal of the suit \u201cinto the next <em>Circuit </em>Court of the United States to be held in this the district where the suit is pending.\u201d This petition was made, of course, pursuant to the right given in the twelfth section of the Judiciary Act, which says:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-6\">\u201cIf a suit be commenced in any State court . . . by a citizen of the State in which the suit is brought, against a citizen of another State, . . . and the defendant shall . . . file a petition for the removal of the cause from that into the next <em>Circuit </em>Court to be hold in the district where the suit is pending, &amp;c., . . . the cause shall <em>there </em>proceed as if it had been brought there by original process.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-8\">The State court, on the 11th of January, 1873, made an order that the cause be removed out of this court into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number><em>Circuit </em>Court of the United States <em>at Mobile, Alabama, that being the Circuit Court of the United States for this district. </em>And, on. the 18th following, the proper papers were filed with the clerk of the Southern District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-4\">On the 3d of March, 1873, after all this had been done, Congress passed an act relating to the Circuit and District Courts for the <em>Middle </em>and Northern Districts of Alabama, one section of which enacted, \u201cthat so'much of any act or acts of Congress as vested in the District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, . . . the power and jurisdiction of a Circuit Court be aud the same is hereby repealed.\u201d The act, which in two places spoke of the Circuit Court at Mobile as the Circuit Court for the District of Alabama, made several important changes in previously existing things.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-5\">On the 23d of December, 1873 \u2014 after the passage of the statute just mentioned \u2014 Kolb, the plairitiff in the suit, appeared in the Circuit Court and moved to have the case stricken from the docket for want of jurisdiction, which order was made by the court, the circuit judge presiding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-6\">The insurance company now applied to this court for a mandamus to the said Circuit Court, requiring it to proceed to try and determine the case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b431-7\">\n<em>Messrs. P. Phillips and J. T. Morgan, for the petitioner,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP7\">-made an elaborate examination of different statutes, including specially that of March 3d, 1873, and argued that in view of this legislation the Circuit Court at Mobile had original circuit court jurisdiction over the entire State, or made the State, so far as said Circuit Court was concerned, but one district. The learned counsel conceded that the act of March 3d, 1873, did not, in express terms, confer such jurisdiction upon the Circuit Court at Mobile, nor expressly, enact'tbat the State should constitute but one district for circuit court purposes.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-9\"> <em>4 </em>Stat. at Large, 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"AXE\"> 5 Id. 315.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b430-10\"> The briefs of the petitioner\u2019s counsel referred to many acts haring moro or less bearing on the ease. The Reporter refers to. those which he deems specially pertinent; though he cannot affirm that if was on these that this court based its judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b431-8\">Mr. Justice MILLER</author>\n<p id=\"AV1R\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Much argument is addressed to us on the construction of the act of March 3d, 1873, concerning the District and Cir-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>cult Courts of Alabama, especially whether by that act the Circuit Court sitting at Mobile has circuit court jurisdiction over the whole State or not. In the view we take of the present case it is not necessary for us to decide that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Prior to that time the District Court of the United States for the Middle District of Alabama was a court invested with circuit court powers. Among those powers, in our opinion, was that of receiving and exercising jurisdiction over cases removed from the State courts within its territorial limits. \u25a0The case before\u2019us whs of that class. No question is raised that the requirements of the law for the r\u00e9moval were complied with. The order for the removal was made on the 11th day of January, 1873, and the papers filed in the office of the clerk of the Circuit Court for the Southern District on the 18th day of the same month.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The.order of the State court was that \u201ctbis\u00a1 cause be removed out of this court, tinto the'Circuit Court of the United States at Mobile, Alabama, that beiu\u2019g th,e Circuit Court of the United States for this district.\u201d The county of Barbour, in which the State court sat and made this order, was in the Middle District of Alabama, and as, in our judgment, the case,-if to be removed at all, should have been removed-to the District Court for that district, to be disposed of in the exercise of its circuit court powers, we think the order of the State court was void. That it conferred.no jurisdiction of the case on the Circuit Court for the Southern District of Alabama, because it could take none as the law then stood. Whatever may be the effect of the subsequent act of March 3d, 1873, on the jurisdiction of all these courts, there-is nothing in it which removes the difficulty in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The Circuit Court at Mobile was, therefore, x\u2019ight in refusing to hear the case, and ordeiing it to be stricken from the docket, and the mandamus now asked for is</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
