One Hershfield intervened, asserting that he had a mortgage on the property, of a date prior to that sued on by Griffith. The court gave judgment in favor of Griffith, and'Hershfield took the case to the Supreme Court of the Territory, which affirmed the judgment below. Hershfield now brought the case here by <em>appeal, </em>assigning among other errors the blending of equity and common-law jurisdiction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b670-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>\n<em>Mr. Lyman Trumbull, for the appellant,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK6\">adverting to the seventh amendment to the Federal Constitution, the Process Act of 1792, the organic law of the Territory, and-the Civil Practice Act \u2014 all set forth in the preceding case <em>{supra, </em>p. 648-650), \u2014 and to the same cases as Mr. Leech referred to in the argument there, argued, that a foreclosure of a mortgage \u2014 a proceeding in its essence equitable \u2014 had been performed through common-law means, and argued further, as Mr. Leech did in the preceding case, that it was not competent for the Territorial legislature of Montana to abolish, as it had sought to do by its Civil Practice Act, the distinction between chancery and common-law proceedings, which the organic act, adopting the Process Act, had recognized; and that this court had in numerous cases so decided.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b670-6\">\n<em>Messrs. J. Habley Ashton and N. Wilson, contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApE\">contended that a proceeding to obtain satisfaction of a mortgage was not necessarily a proceeding in equity, and adverted to the practice in Pennsylvania, where regarding a recoi\u2019ded mortgage as in the nature of a judicial record, a <em>scire facias </em>was by statute allowed to be issued thereon through common-law courts; the only courts which, with rare exception, the State of Pennsylvania had ever had. It was not necessary, therefore; to assume that the proceeding below had been an equitable one. Being had in courts not courts of chancery, it was to be regarded as a commoii-Iaw proceeding, and proper. If, therefore, the appeal was not to be dismissed, the decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b670-7\">But the appeal should be dismissed. The proceeding having been, as shown above, one at law, a writ of error was the only proper means to bring it here.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b670-8\">Mr. Justice BRADLEY</author>\n<p id=\"AbU\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">The only point made in this case is,- that being one of equity jurisdiction it was tried by jury as an action at law. This being so it would seem that, under the seventh article of amendments to the Constitution, it should have been removed by writ of error and not by appeal. But that aside, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>we have just decided in <em>Hornbuckle </em>v. <em>Toombs </em>that equitable as well as legal relief maybe pursued by the form of action prescribed by the Territorial legislature. There is no complaint that this was not done, or. that substantial justice was not administered between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Judgment aebtrmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b671-7\">Dissenting, Justices CLIFFORD, DAVIS, and STRONG.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
