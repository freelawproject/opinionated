The only exception taken relates to the doctor\u2019s answer that his patient showed no improvement after the operation. Although the witness did not profess to be competent to perform the operation, he could be found qualified unquestionably to express an opinion as to his patient\u2019s physical condition. There is nothing in the evidence to substantiate the defendants\u2019 contention that this opinion was \u201cbased in part on conversations with Doctor Jones.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">The <em>testimony of the witness amounted merely to an </em>assertion that so far as his experience permitted him to judge, and his experience included the treatment of a similar injury, the chance that the plaintiff\u2019s condition would be improved by an operation was problematical. The evidence was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">If the defendants believed that the doctor\u2019s conclusion was based on insufficient data, they should have requested the Presiding Justice to strike the evidence from the record on that ground or have adopted \u201csome other convenient procedure to bring their complaint specifically\u201d to his attention. <em>Ricard </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>87 N.
