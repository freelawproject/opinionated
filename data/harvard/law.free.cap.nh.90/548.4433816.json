H. 224. It is not uncommon, however, for articles of copartnership to provide the method by which the partnership affairs shall be settled, and when such provisions exist they must prevail. Parsons, Partnership (4th <em>ed.), s. </em>344.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Partners \u201cmay agree that upon the death of any of their number, the survivors shall become the absolute owners of the firm assets, with a personal liability to pay the deceased partner\u2019s representatives for his interest.\u201d Burdick, Partnership (3d <em>ed.), </em>148. In such a situation the right of the representatives is to have the value of the deceased partner\u2019s interest \u201cascertained in the method prescribed by the agreement, and paid by the survivors in the stipulated manner.\u201d <em>Ib. </em>149.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The partnership agreement in the present case provides, in effect, that in the event of a partner\u2019s death his legal representative is to be paid a sum based primarily on the value of the deceased partner\u2019s interest in the firm, and on payment of that sum title to the partnership property is to vest in the surviving partners. Since the sum to be thus paid is capable of judicial determination, it cannot be deemed indefinite or uncertain. <em>Kann </em>v. <em>Company, </em>81 N. H. 535, 540; s. c. 85 N. H. 41, 48. On the death of George Normand the surviving partners were obligated to pay to George\u2019s legal representative, and the latter was required to accept, the value of George\u2019s share as stipulated in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Although the original partnership was dissolved by the death of George, the pleadings indicate that the surviving partners continued the business precisely as before with no intentional departure from their former course of dealing. Under such circumstances it is presumed that they intended the original articles of copartnership to be those of the new partnership \u201cexcepting such, if any there were, as were plainly inapplicable.\u201d See Parsons, Partnership (4th <em>ed.), s. </em>165, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">\u201cIf a partnership is continued after the expiration of the time originally contemplated, or is dissolved by the retirement or addition of a partner, the business being continued, the continued partnership is deemed to be on the same terms, as far as applicable, as before\u201d (Bates, Partnership, s. 216, and cases cited), and a provision in the articles that if a partner dies before the expiration of the partnership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>term the surviving partner shall pay a stated sum for the deceased partner\u2019s interest applies to the continued partnership <em>(Cox </em>v. <em>Willoughby, </em>13 Ch. Div. 863).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b580-10\"><em>McLane, Davis &amp; Carleton, </em>for the motion.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">It follows that Leonce, as sole surviving partner, is entitled to acquire the interests of both George and Aim\u00e9 on the terms prescribed by clause 5 of the partnership agreement. When George died, Aim\u00e9 and Leonce each owed George\u2019s estate one sixth of the value of the partnership property. When Aim\u00e9 died, Leonce owed Aim\u00e9\u2019s estate one half of the value. Since George\u2019s estate has not been paid, Leonce should pay the administratrix one third of the value of the partnership property as of the date of George\u2019s death. He should pay Aim\u00e9\u2019s estate one half the value as of the date of Aim\u00e9\u2019s death less one sixth of the value as of George\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The questions transferred are answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b580-9\">On Motion for Rehearing. After the foregoing opinion was filed Sylvio Normand, individually and as executor of the will of Aim\u00e9 Normand, and the other defendants interested under the will moved for a rehearing on the ground that the record is so ambiguous and inadequate that this court cannot properly determine the questions transferred \u201cuntil the facts involved are more fully and clearly presented\u201d in the Superior Court.</p>\n<author id=\"b580-11\">Marble, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ags\">Counsel state in the motion that the reserved case \u201cwas prepared by and agreed upon\u201d by the attorneys representing the interested parties and assert that if they are relieved from the agreement by the Superior Court, they are prepared to establish facts tending to prove that Aim\u00e9 and Leonce Normand, after the death of George Normand, \u201coperated the business as trustees.\u201d The proffered evidence is to the effect that \u201cthe former articles of partnership were recognized to be unsatisfactory,\u201d that there was no express agreement \u201ceither to accept the terms of the old partnership or to enter into a new partnership agreement,\u201d and that on July 31, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>1939, a \u201cdraft of a new proposed partnership agreement\u201d was submitted by Aun\u00e9 to Leonce but \u201cwas never executed owing to Aim\u00e9\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">We find in this evidence nothing to indicate the existence of a trusteeship. On the contrary, the fact that Aim\u00e9 and Leonce were contemplating new articles of partnership definitely confirms the presumption that they were continuing business under the old articles until a new agreement could be reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">\n<em>Motion denied.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
