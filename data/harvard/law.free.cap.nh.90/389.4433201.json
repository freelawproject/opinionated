And where a partnership has been dissolved by the bankruptcy of one of the partners, the surviving partner retains his authority over the partnership property after the bankruptcy clothed with a trust to apply the property to the discharge of the partnership obligations and to account to the trustee in bankruptcy for the bankrupt partner\u2019s share of the surplus.

L., c. 317, s. 7. See, also, 1 Hening, Dig. 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">\u201cWhen a bill is filed under the provisions of section 7, the plaintiff may cause a certified copy thereof, and of the order thereon, to be filed in the office of the clerk of the town in which any defendant resides; . . . and such filing and the service of the bill upon such defendant shall constitute a lien, as against him and others having after-acquired rights, upon the personal estate, property, interest, right or credit to which the bill relates, or which may be discovered by the proceedings, for the performance of any decree or order relative thereto, in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant.\u201d P.
