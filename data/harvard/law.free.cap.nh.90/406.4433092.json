Nowhere in the policy is found any extension of coverage to persons operating with the express or implied consent of the named assured. Failure to insert the so-called \u2018omnibus clause\u2019 obviously restricts coverage to the two persons designated in the declarations. Operation by anyone else is uninsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">It is plain that this argument is based entirely upon the language of the insuring clause above quoted and ignores entirely the effect of the indorsement which materially altered the original terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>It can hardly be doubted that the word \u201cinsured\u201d in the first sentence of the indorsement above quoted is a typographical error and that for \u201cinsured\u201d we should read \u201cinsurer.\u201d Thus construed, this sentence constitutes an unqualified agreement that the terms of the act relating to motor vehicle insurance shall be included in the policy. Section 1 of this statute provides that a motor vehicle liability policy shall provide \u201cindemnity for or protection to the insured and any person responsible for the operation of the insured\u2019s motor vehicle or trailer with his express or implied consent.\u201d It, therefore, follows that unless the effect of this agreement is limited by the succeeding provisions of the indorsement, it must be held that \u201cany person responsible for the operation of the insured\u2019s motor vehicle or trailer with his express or implied consent,\u201d is within the coverage of the policy as modified by the indorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\">Such is the result contemplated by the section of the statute which authorizes the attachment of such indorsements to existing policies. \u201cAny company authorized to issue Motor Vehicle liability policies, as defined in Section 1, may, ... in lieu of such a policy, issue an indorsement to an existing policy; . . . which shall provide indemnity or protection in like manner and to the same extent as such a policy.\u201d Laws 1927, c. 54, s. 6, p. IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">It seems to be contended by the plaintiff, however, that the other sentence from the indorsement above quoted, which purports to define the term \u201cassured,\u201d had the effect of limiting the protection of the policy to the named assured, upon the theory that the only persons \u201centitled to protection under the Agreements, Conditions and Declarations of this policy\u201d are those mentioned in the first condition set forth above, namely, Metitia and Agnew.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">If it was, in fact, the intention of the plaintiff in preparing this indorsement to limit the effect of its apparently unqualified acceptance of the provisions of the statute, contained in the first sentence of the indorsement, by defining the term \u201cassured\u201d in the somewhat mysterious language above quoted, the good faith of the plaintiff would be open to serious question and any inconsistency between these two sentences might properly be resolved against it by giving full effect to the unqualified language of the first sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">We do not think, however, that there is any inconsistency between these two provisions of the indorsement. The indorsement itself constitutes one of the \u201cagreements\u201d of the policy. It clearly includes the provisions of the statute as terms of the policy. As above stated, the terms of the statute thus made a part of the policy, provide for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>protection to persons operating the insured\u2019s motor vehicle with his \u201cexpress or implied consent\u201d. Therefore, in the language of the indorsement, such persons are \u201centitled to protection under\u201d one of \u201cthe Agreements ... of this policy.\u201d In short, the effect of the indorsement was to write into the policy the very \u201comnibus clause\u201d, which is said by plaintiff\u2019s counsel to have no existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">If, therefore, the defendant, Louis Goodall, was, at the time of the accident, operating a motor vehicle of the assureds with their express or implied consent, it must be held that he is covered by the terms of the policy, and it is so adjudged.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The case appears to have been argued by both parties upon the assumption that this was so, and the finding of the court that Louis Goodall was \u201can employee of Metitia and Agnew\u201d tends to confirm this view. If there were any doubt as to the circumstances under which Louis Goodall was driving the defendant\u2019s car at the time of the accident, the evidence offered by the defendants \u201cthat when the accident occurred, Louis Goodall was driving the car upon a mission for Metitia and Agnew, owners of the car\u201d should have been admitted for the purpose of showing their consent to such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
