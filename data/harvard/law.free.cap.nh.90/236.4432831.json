Levesque, called by the defendants, testified that Blais lived in his home as a member of his family; that he had allowed Blais to use his automobile on various occasions and that he was willing that he should use it if he took good care of it. In answer to the inquiry, \u201cDid you make any limitations on this day in question about the use of the car?\u201d he said: \u201cNo, he just told me he was going to Peabody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">On cross-examination Levesque stated that Blais, when granted permission to use the ear, did not always tell him \u201cthe exact place\u201d to which he was going, but that he did so on the evening of the accident and that the only permission granted him was to take the car to go to Peabody and return. Blais\u2019 testimony was to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">It appeared in evidence, however, that both Levesque and Blais had come to the trial with one of the plaintiff\u2019s adjusters, that they were not represented by counsel but had conferred with the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys and that one of these attorneys had told Blais, who could not afford to employ a lawyer, that he would help him if he could, that they had previously given their depositions and that plaintiff\u2019s counsel on that occasion had entered a special appearance in their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Thereupon defendants\u2019 counsel was permitted to cross-examine Levesque and to introduce in evidence a written statement given by Levesque to the defendant Wells in which Levesque declared that Blais had \u201cpermission to use my Rockne sedan that was involved in an accident with a car owned and operated by a Tellis Wells of Wind-ham, N. H., at Salem, N. H.\u201d He testified that this statement was true and later said: \u201cThat particular night he [Blais] asked me if he could use it [the car]. I said, \u2018All right.\u2019 I looked over the car and said, \u2018You take it easy.\u2019 That was the story of that night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">While there were many apparent contradictions in Levesque\u2019s testimony, it was for the master to determine which of his assertions were true.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">Levesque\u2019s testimony that he had been \u201cwilling\u201d to let Blais drive his car on other occasions was clearly admissible on the issue of permissive use. <em>Buxton </em>v. <em>Langan, ante, </em>13. See, also, <em>American &amp;c. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wentworth, ante, </em>112. Levesque stated in his deposition that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Blais had told him he was going to Manchester he \u201cwould like to have gone with him.\u201d It is suggested that this evidence was inadmissible on cross-examination of Levesque by defendants\u2019 counsel because the master by excluding similar evidence earlier in the trial had made this ruling the law of the case. A simple answer to this contention is that the exclusion occurred before defendants\u2019 counsel had been granted the right of cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\">Neither Blais\u2019 default nor that of Levesque could affect the protection afforded the defendants by the indemnity provisions of the policy, for if Blais was using the car at the time and place of the accident with Levesque\u2019s consent, coverage extended to him, and the rights of the defendants became fixed. <em>Maryland Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>88 N. H. 346, 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">The plaintiff filed forty-seven requests for findings of fact and rulings of law. All were properly disposed of by the master. The first request relating to the burden of proof is unimportant since there was \u201cno question\u201d in the master\u2019s mind as to the extent of the permission granted. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>89 N. H. 95, 98. Various other requests call for rulings of law which the master had no authority to make <em>(Barry v. Bartis, </em>85 N. H. 202) and which relate merely to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain decrees for the defendants. Others catalogue the inferences that might be drawn from certain portions of the testimony and are immaterial in view of the general finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Levesque\u2019s written statement is the subject of numerous other requests. This statement was introduced through Levesque himself, who admitted its truth. The master was therefore entitled to treat it as affirmative evidence <em>(Wentworth </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>86 N. H. 251, 253), and was not obliged to accept the interpretation which Levesque, in answer to leading questions by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, placed upon it. If there was any doubt about its meaning, that doubt was to be resolved by the master, who saw Levesque and heard him testify. <em>Wentworth </em>v. <em>Railroad, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The plaintiff cites the case of <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Martel, </em>88 N. H. 479, in support of six requests, but in that case there was no evidence that tended to prove permissive use. In view of the definiteness of the master\u2019s finding, the requests relating to incidental and emergency uses, \u201cdeparture from the permitted route,\u201d and lack of evidence as to agency are of no moment. The request for a ruling that the meaning of the policy could not be varied by Levesque\u2019s understanding was idle inasmuch as the master did not profess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>to construe the policy and the plaintiff conceded at the trial that the only question in the case was \u201cwhether there was express or implied consent\u201d given by Levesque \u201cfor the use of his car by Blais on Thanksgiving Day, 1937.\u201d The same concession is made in the plaintiff\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The remaining requests need not be considered in detail. Exceptions concerning seventeen of them are understood to be waived, and no argument other than the bare assertion of error is advanced in support of the exceptions to the denial of the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
