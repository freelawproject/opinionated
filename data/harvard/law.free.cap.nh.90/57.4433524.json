L., c. 290, s. 4). <em>Leclerc </em>v. <em>Leclerc, </em>85 N. H. 121, 125; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Jewell, </em>86 N. H. 190; <em>Sheehy </em>v. <em>Sheehy, </em>88 N. H. 223, 228. The court has found the mother\u2019s fitness, but the defendants\u2019 brief alleges an offer of evidence tending to show her unfitness. It is not shown by the record, and it is not clear, whether this evidence was excluded. Assuming its exclusion, the exclusion was proper if it was offered only to show that the child\u2019s welfare would be better subserved by the defendants\u2019 custody over her. But in view of its relevancy on the issue of the mother\u2019s fitness, a finding, upon application for a new trial, of accident, mistake and misfortune in not also offering it for that purpose, would require the grant of the application. <em>Barclay </em>v. <em>Club, </em>89 N.

If, as the defendants\u2019 brief states, the child is illegitimate, he has none.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">As the case stands, the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b85-17\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
