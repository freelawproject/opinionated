Many of these requests are virtual motions for a directed verdict. All requests of this nature and all exceptions to specific findings are disposed of by the conclusion here reached that all the master\u2019s findings, both general and special, are fully sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">Numerous other requests call for the reporting of evidence rather than facts (see P. L., <em>c. </em>339, s. 11) and for the finding of facts which would be inconclusive on any issue. Failure to grant such requests furnishes no valid ground of exception. <em>Moynihan </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>77 N. H. 273, 274; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Company, </em>78 N. H. 491, 493; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Fernald, </em>82 N. H. 186, 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">Several requests relate to the burden of proof, the plaintiff\u2019s contention being that the defendant was obliged to show by evidence of a \u201cclear and affirmative nature\u201d that \u201cthe use of the way was not consented to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">It is true that the defendant, having asserted a prescriptive right, was required to prove its existence by a balance of probabilities. 2 Tiffany, Real Prop. (2d <em>ed.), </em>519, <em>pp. </em>2045, 2046; <em>Burnham </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>McQuesten, </em>48 N. H. 446; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Gerrish, </em>59 N. H. 569, 571. But evidence of acts of such a character as to warrant the inference that he and his predecessors in title had used the way as of right for a period of twenty years or more constituted <em>prima facie </em>proof. <em>Jean </em>v. <em>Arsenault, </em>85 N. H. 72, 73. It then became necessary for the plaintiff \u201cto come forward with evidence\u201d that those acts were, in fact, permitted. <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>86 Vt. 219, 223. For \u201cwhere an actual, uninterrupted use and enjoyment, as of right, with knowledge of the other party, is shown to have existed a sufficient length of time to create the presumption of a grant, the presumption stands as sufficient proof and establishes the grant, unless it is rebutted by proof that the use and enjoyment were permissive.\u201d <em>Smithv. Putnam, </em>62 N. H. 369, 372. Notwithstanding this presumption, however, \u201cthe character of the use remains a question of fact, unless the proof and inferences are all one way,. . . and the burden of proof remains on the defendant.\u201d <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Bailey, supra, </em>224.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The plaintiff here fails because there is no evidence from which it could reasonably be inferred that the use made of his field, so far as the defendant or any of his predecessors in title are concerned, was commenced or continued with the leave and license of the owner. In other words, the defendant\u2019s uninterrupted use of the roadway for thirty-six years was \u201cunexplained.\u201d <em>Jean </em>v. <em>Arsenault, </em>85 N. H. 72, 75; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Gerrish, </em>59 N. H. 569, 571. Since this is so, the fact that the master may have understood that the plaintiff assumed the risk of non-persuasion on the issue of permissive use is of no consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s suggestion that color of title \u201cis an essential element in the defense here set up\u201d is clearly erroneous. \u201cThe purpose of color of title is twofold: first, to show that possession of part is taken under claim of title to the whole; second, to define the boundaries of the tract covered by the claim.\u201d 3 Washburn, Real Prop. (6th <em>ed.), s. </em>1981. See, also, <em>Dame </em>v. <em>Fernald, </em>86 N. H. 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">But the plaintiff further contends that even if a valid right of way existed on October 5, 1935, it was extinguished on that date by the tax collector\u2019s deed to his grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">While it has been said that \u201cNo title can pass by a collector\u2019s deed under the statute, but an estate in fee-simple\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Messer, </em>17 N. H. 420, 428), and that one who receives a collector\u2019s deed acquires title to the land \u201cdevested of all other liens thereon or titles thereto\u201d <em>(Eastman </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>60 N. H. 408, 418), neither of the cases cited holds that easements are extinguished by such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>conveyance. The one relates to a right of dower, the other to a mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Although the authorities are not uniform on the subject (see Annotations, 40 A. L. R. 1523; 110 A. L. R. 612), \u201cOrdinarily, a tax sale does not divest easements charged on the property sold.\u201d 3 Cooley, Taxation (4th <em>ed.), s. </em>1494. See, also, note to \u201cRecent Cases,\u201d 51 Harv. Law Rev., 361, 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Selectmen in this State are required to appraise all taxable property \u201cat its full and true value in money.\u201d P. L., c. 63, s. 1. In determining this value no deduction is made for mortgages, liens, rights of dower, and similar interests. Apart from statute (see P. L., c. 66, s. 25), those holding such interests \u201care delinquent if the taxes are not seasonably paid.\u201d See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Messer, supra. </em>But an easement is not a lien, nor is it a title to or interest in real estate in the sense in which those terms are applied to mortgages and dower rights. It is rather a servitude imposed upon the land, sometimes said to be \u201ccarved out\u201d of the servient estate. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>138 N. Y. Supp. 654, 656; <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Senosky, </em>128 Or. 229, 233. See, also, <em>Bellows Falls &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Walpole, </em>76 N. H. 384. Its existence lessens the value of that estate and increases the value of the dominant tenement.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Presumably assessors take into account this effect of easements on value in making their appraisals. See <em>Lodge </em>v. <em>Swampscott, </em>216 Mass. 260, 263; <em>Ehren &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Association, </em>120 N. J. Eq. 136. And if, acting in ignorance of the existence of an easement, they overvalue the servient estate, the mistake is correctible by abatement proceedings unless circumstances exist which render abatement inequitable <em>(Bellows Falls &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Walpole, </em>76 N. H. 384).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">\u201cJohn Doe is the owner of a house and lot. He conveys an easement to his neighbor, Richard Roe. He mortgages the property to a local bank. He executes a ten-year lease to John Doe, Jr. at the rental of one dollar a year. Then assessment time arrives, and he finds himself assessed on the full value of the land. He prepares a petition in abatement, setting forth that the three acts have greatly lessened the value of his property. His petition will be denied as to the lease and the mortgage, but may be granted as to the easement. It is well settled at common law and rarely changed by statute, that the mortgagor and the lessor pay the entire tax on the property as if there were no mortgage or lease, and that the life tenant pays the entire tax just as if there were no remainderman. But it has also been held that a landowner whose property is subject to an easement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>is entitled to a reduced valuation, the value of the easement being added to the estate of the dominant owner. When a piece of property is so encumbered with easements that no use can be made of it, the fee owner pays no tax.\u201d Bonbright, \u201cValuation of Real Estate,\u201d 34 Columbia Law Rev., 1397, 1435, 1436.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Section 2 of chapter 63 of the Public Laws, which provides for the separate assessment of \u201cdistinct interests\u201d in real estate, does not, in our opinion, apply to easements appurtenant to land. See Black, Tax Titles (2d <em>ed.), s. </em>104. As originally enacted, the section reads: \u201cWhenever it shall be made to appear to the selectmen that several persons are owners of several interests in the same real estate, or that one person is the owner of land and another is the owner of any building, timber or wood standing thereon, they shall, upon request, appraise such several interests and assess the same to the several owners thereof separately.\u201d R. S., c. 42, <em>s. </em>2. That the words \u201cseveral interests\u201d are of narrow application is evidenced by the fact that an amendment was deemed necessary in order to include within the provisions of the statute the owners of ores and minerals. Laws 1852, c. 1291. The fact that in 1867 the words \u201cdistinct interests\u201d were substituted for \u201cseveral interests\u201d (G. S., c. 52, s. 2) is unimportant since the marginal notation in the Commissioners\u2019 Report of that year (c. 53, <em>s. 2) </em>indicates a verbal rather than a material change.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Neither the case of <em>Granite State Land Co. </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>76 N. H. 1, nor the case of <em>Bellows Falls &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Walpole, </em>76 N. H. 384, holds that the statute has reference to a right such as that here claimed. It is our conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s grantor took the land subject to the right of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The master\u2019s finding that the defendant was not damaged by the temporary injunction was made in 1937. Since the injunction is still in force, the defendant is entitled to a hearing on the question of damages before the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">\n<em>Plaintiffs exceptions overruled: defendant\u2019s exception sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
