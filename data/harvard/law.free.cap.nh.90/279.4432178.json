Powers.</parties>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b307-14\"><em>McLane, Davis &amp; Carleton (Mr. Carleton </em>orally), for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b307-15\"><em>Laflamme &amp; Nourie (Mr. Nourie </em>orally), for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b307-16\">Page, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABqq\">In the course of argument defendant\u2019s counsel said: \u201cNow, you will recall that in my opening statement I said to you that Mr. Barrett did not blow his horn, that when he saw the Powers automobile, he was obviously within the view of the Powers automobile, and that there was no necessity for blowing his horn, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>he was within the vision of Dr. Powers. Now, I argue to you gentlemen that that is the fact of the case; I argue to you gentlemen that that is the situation that morning; I argue to you that there was no need for Mr. Barrett to blow his horn as he came into that intersection, because his car was in clear view of Dr. Powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\"><em>\u201cMr. Davis: </em>I except to the statement there was no need for Mr. Barrett to blow his horn at that intersection, as it is contrary to the law that he should so do. I object to that statement. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>It is simply an argument, as I understand it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">To this ruling, that the matter objected to was not a statement of the law, but an argument of matter of fact, the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Upon this theory, the court later instructed the jury as to the statute requiring the sounding of the horn, and added, \u201cEven if a signal was not given as required by the statute, it is not grounds for imposing liability unless you also find that the violation of the statute was causal of the accident, in other words, that compliance with the statute would have prevented the accident.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s brief concurs in the court\u2019s view that defendant\u2019s counsel was arguing the claim that \u201csince Barrett was in Powers\u2019 view, such [signal] would have had no effect in avoiding the accident.\u201d It is not probable that the jury understood the purpose otherwise, even though the argument might have been phrased with greater precision.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">The plaintiff asserts that the argument was ill-grounded because the defendant was not permitted to express an opinion whether \u201cthere was anything [his] horn could have done to help Dr. Powers to look toward [him] and avoid the accident.\u201d That, however, was an opinion that the jury might have drawn from other testimony that was before them. Subject to objection, but not to exception, the defendant testified: \u201cI could see him; I don\u2019t see why he couldn\u2019t see me\u201d; also, without any objection, that he was within the view of Dr. Powers when he first saw him, that there was nothing to obstruct the view of his car by Dr. Powers as the latter entered the intersection. Dr. Powers testified that, before entering the intersection, he looked both right and left and saw nothing; but when he got nearly to the middle of the road he saw a car at his left, within a few feet; that when he first looked to the left, he had a vision westerly on Merrimack Street for about 150 feet. Under the circumstances, it was arguable that what Dr. Powers did not see when he looked would not have been brought to his attention by the sounding of Barrett's horn. Such an argument is consistent with the statutory duty to sound the horn. <em>George </em>v. <em>Company, </em>86 N. H. 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>In this connection it is urged that there was a greater tendency to prejudice because, it is claimed, the jury were charged that \u201cif they found that Powers was inattentive as he neared the intersection, he was then without legal right to rely upon performance by the defendant of his statutory duty.\u201d We do not so understand the instruction given to the jury, <em>viz. </em>that the statute contemplates that the \u201coperator will give such a signal when he is sufficiently close to the intersection that the person of average prudence approaching will be given an opportunity to hear and heed the signal.\u201d This is merely a definition of the required timing and intensity of the signal rather than a statement that the defendant had no duty to blow his horn.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We cannot agree with the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the \u201ccombined effect of these two errors was to take from the jury\u2019s consideration the question of whether the accident could not have been avoided if the defendant had complied with the statute \u2014 in other words, the jury was not permitted to consider Barrett\u2019s infraction of the law as the probable proximate cause of the accident.\u201d On the contrary, that issue was specifically submitted by the court to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"AIf\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
