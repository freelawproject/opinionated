L. 158, as made it incumbent on the court, upon the defendant\u2019s motion, to withdraw a juror and continue the case. The provision is: \u201cnor may the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>neglect or refusal of any defendant, actually upon trial in a criminal court, to offer himself as a witness be treated as creating any presumption against him, or be adversely referred to by court or counsel during the trial.\u201d This provision is not to be weakened by subtle refinement; but we are all of opinion that this case does not come within it. By the agreement of facts it appears that counsel for the defendant were conferring when the district attorney announced to the court that the commonwealth rested; that at the conclusion of their conference one of the counsel for the defendant turned to the district attorney and said, \u201cGo ahead;\u201d that the district attorney, believing that counsel for the defendant had not heard his statement that the commonwealth rested, because of their being in conference at the time, inquired of counsel for the defendant, \u201cAre you not going to offer a defense?\u201d and that this remark \u201capparently was not heard by the jury.\u201d Even if the jury had heard the remark it would be an entirely unreasonable supposition that they would interpret it as an allusion to the defendant\u2019s testifying in his own behalf. But inasmuch as it was not made in such manner as to be heard by the jury it is apparent that no right of the defendant was prejudiced in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
