J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-10\">The judgment in this case was entered in 1906 on a transcript of proceedings had before a justice of the peace. The judgment was entered against Mary and George Sosnowiski. The attorney for Mary Sosnowiski obtained a rule to show cause why the judgment entered against Mary Sosnowiski should not be stricken off as to her, for the reason that the transcript would not support a judgment against her. This contention would prevail were it not that an application has been made on. behalf of plaintiff to amend the record, so that the transcript shall correctly represent the proceedings as they were actually recorded by the justice on his docket. The depositions taken show that it was a constable who wrote out the first transcript. It is apparent that the constable\u2019s knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>of English is quite imperfect. The transcript was not a correct copy of the proceedings as they appear on the justice\u2019s docket. We have now before us a corrected record, and it is such as to support the judgment against Mary Sosnowiski.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-5\">The application to amend the record in the present case is not for the purpose of amending a proceeding before a justice. The common pleas would have no jurisdiction in such a case. The record of the proceedings before the justice is not changed in any particular.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-6\">The case of Justice v. Meeker, 30 Pa. Superior Ct. 207, is conclusive against the contention of the defendant. In that case Judge Porter says:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-7\">\"The order of the court permitting the amendment of the transcript was right; this was not an amendment of the proceedings before the justice, but the correction of mistakes in the transcript so as to make it correctly show what proceedings were had before the justice. When there are mistakes in a transcript they may be, and ought to be corrected. The judgment is founded upon the record of the justice, and the transcript should be made to truly present that record; whether it does so is to be determined by the court below, upon inspection of the docket, and all the papers and evidence before them: Caldwell v. Thompson, 1 Rawle, 370; Miles v. Tanner, 3 P. &amp; W. 95; Lyon v. Chalker, 2 Watts, 14.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-8\">The rule to strike off the judgment is discharged and the rule to amend the record is made absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-9\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b673-10\"><em>P.

Meeker, 30 Pa. Superior Ct. 207, excepting in one particular. Upon the taking of depositions on the rule to show cause the summons was offered in evidence, and while the constable\u2019s return on the back shows a personal service, it fails to show that he handed a true and attested copy of the summons to the defendants. But it was also shown by the testimony of the constable, and this was uncontradicted, that he made a valid service and this appears also by the justice\u2019s docket. It is to be observed further that no attempt was made to set aside the judgment by certiorari. As the docket shows that the service sworn to by the constable was valid and the uncontradicted testimony shows that a valid service was in fact made, we are unable to agree with appellant\u2019s counsel that the permission to amend the record by filing a correct transcript worked to the prejudice of the appellee, or that the case is distinguishable upon any other substantial ground from the case cited. This is all that we deem it important to add to the clear and satisfactory opinion of President Judge Edwaeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The assignment of error is overruled and the order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
