The original opinion is reported in 132 S. W. (2d) 553. After a careful consideration of the motion and the many able briefs filed by counsel for the litigants as well as by amici curiae, we have reached the conclusion to witdraw the original opinion and substitute the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">The Continental Oil Company, the East Texas Refining Company, H. L. Hunt, and P. G. Lake filed this suit against G. G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Turner and wife, Sina A. Turner, and the Gulf Production Company, to recover the oil and gas leasehold estate in a certain tract of 311.72 acres of land, more or less, in Rusk County, Texas. Plaintiffs claimed title under an oil and gas lease from G. G. Turner and wife to C. M. Joiner, Trustee, dated April 7, 1927. The Gulf Production Company claimed title under a lease executed by G. G. Turner and wife to J. W. Pevey, dated July 25, 1930. The case was brought in the form of an action in trespass to try title, but plaintiffs specifically pleaded the Turner lease of April 7, 1927, and compliance with its terms, as the source of their title. The case was tried before a jury, and in response to findings of the jury the trial court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. The Court of Civil Appeals affirmed that judgment. 61 S. W. (2d) 185. This Court granted a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\">Defendants in error claim under a lease executed April 7, 1927, by G. G. Turner and wife to C. M. Joiner, Trustee, and filed for record April 15, 1927. On October 18, 1930, the Turners reacknowledged this lease before a different notary public. Gulf Production Company claims under a lease executed by Turner and wife to J. W. Pevey, dated July 25, 1930, and filed for record August 5j 1930. Which of the two leases is superior, is the question here presented for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The jury found': (1) That G. G. Turner and wife prior to April 7, 1928, accepted from Dan Cameron syndicate interest certificates purporting to cover the 80-acre Joiner Discovery Oil Well tract, in satisfaction of the rentals payable to G. G. Turner and wife on the C. M. Joiner, Trustee, lease for the three succeeding years commencing April 7, 1928; (2) that G. G. Turner and wife prior to August 2, 1930, the date of the purported J. W. Pevey lease, moved away from the land in controversy in this suit, with no intention of returning and occupying same as their homestead; (3) that the Continental Oil Company, the East Texas Refining Company, H. L. Hunt, and P. G. Lake, at the time of the purchase of the interest claimed by them in the property in controversy, did not know, and could not have known by the exercise of ordinary inquiry, of any defect in the title to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">G. G. Turner and wife executed to C. M. Joiner, Trustee, an oil and gas lease on 311.72 acres of land, above described. It was in the usual form, and was to run for five years, and as long thereafter as oil or gas might be produced. This lease was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>acknowledged by Turner and his wife in statutory form, was dated April 7, 1927, and was filed for record. The lease involved here is an ordinary oil and gas lease, and is classed an \u201cunless clause\u201d lease. The \u201cdrilling clause\u201d of the lease reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\">\u201cIf no well be commenced on said land on or before the 7 day of April 1928 this lease shall terminate as to both parties, unless the lessee on or before that date shall pay or tender to the lessor, or to the lessor\u2019s credit in the First State Bank at Overton, Texas, or its successors, which shall continue as the depository, regardless of changes in the ownership of said land, the sum of Seventy Seven and 25/100 Dollars, which shall operate as rental and cover the privilege of deferring the commencement of a well for Six (6) months from said date. In like manner and upon like payments or tenders the commencement of a well may be further deferred for like periods of the same number of month successively. And it is understood and agreed that the consideration first recited herein, the down payment, covers not only the privilege granted to the date when said first rental is payable as aforesaid, but also the lessee\u2019s option of extending that period as aforesaid, and any and all other rights conferred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Plaintiffs in error contend that the foregoing clause of the lease was never complied with, and that the lease terminated by its own terms on April 7, 1928, long before Pevey, through whom the Gulf Company claims, obtained his lease from Turner and wife. Defendants in error allege in their pleadings that they claim under the Joiner lease, and that the delay rentals had been fully paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The testimony shows that Joiner, who was drilling an oil well in the vicinity of this land, was in hard financial straits, and that he was unable to pay the delay rentals on the lease in money; and he proposed that if the lessors would accept syndicate certificates in payment of the delay rentals, he could continue to drill the well. Defendants in error contend that Turner accepted, prior to April 7, 1928, the syndicate certificates as payment of the delay rentals, and the work continued on the well; and that the acceptance of such syndicate certificates continued the original terms of the lease. On the other hand, plaintiffs in error contend that the lease executed by Turner and wife to Joiner was on the Turners\u2019 homestead, and that Turner did not have the right to accept the syndicate certificates as payment, in lieu of the cash specified in the lease. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The issue as to whether Turner and his wife accepted' the syndicate certificates was raised; but that issue was decided, against the Turners when the jury, in response to a special issue, answered that Turner and wife had accepted such syndicate certificates in payment of the delay rentals. Plaintiffs in error also contend that it should be held, as a matter of law, that Turner did not have the right to accept such syndicate certificates in payment of the delay rentals, and continue the lease in force, for the following reasons: (1) That ff was an oral modification of the lease, and was in violation of the Statutes of Frauds and the Statute of Conveyances; (2) that such transaction violated the homstead rights of Mrs. Turner; and (3) that the provisions of the \u201cunless\u201d clause providing that, in the absence of drilling operations, the lease would terminate unless $77.25 was paid by a certain time, constituted a limitation on the estate; and, therefore, unless $77.25 in money was paid, the lease terminated by its own terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\">The lessors had the right to accept or reject the syndicate certificates as payment of the delay rentals. If the delay rentals were not paid on or before April 7, 1928, as provided for in the lease, the lease terminated by its own terms. Prior to that date the lessors preferred that the lease should not terminate, and accepted the syndicate certificates in lieu of the money,-as payment of the delay rentals. The original lease \u25a0 unquestionably satisfied the Statute of Frauds and the Statute of Conveyances (Articles 3995, 1288, and 1291, Vernon\u2019s Annotated Texas Civil Statutes), and we are here dealing- with the method of payment. The lease itself provides a means by which it was to be extended. Where the rent is paid and the lease is extended, the lessee does not hold under a new or different contract, but holds under the original lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The following rules are well established:</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">(1) That the parties to a contract, grant, or option.may lawfully change the medium of payment, and waive strict performance of the method of payment, without violating the Statute of Frauds. Jones v. Gibbs (Com. App.), 133 Tex. 627, 130 S. W. (2d) 265; Hill v. Brown, 225 S. W. 780, id. 237 S. W. 252 (Com. App.) ; Mitchell v. Simms (Com. App.), 63 S. W. (2d) 371; Khoure Bros. v. Jonakin (Ky.), 300 S. W. 612; 16 R. C. L., p. 885, sec. 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">' (2) That a creditor and a debtor' may make- and accept satisfactory payment of a debt otherwise than in money. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>between a debtor and a creditor, anything may be agreed upon as satisfaction; and whatever is accepted by the creditor in satisfaction is effective as payment, and discharges the debt. Robson v. Watts\u2019 Heirs, 11 Texas 764; Hinsley v. Ryon, 9 Texas 405; Yndo v. Rivas, 107 Texas 408; 180 S. W. 96; Wright v. Donaubauer (Sup. Ct.), 154 S. W.

Ed., 1936), p. 423, sec. 121; Mills-Willingham, Law of Oil &amp; Gas, p. 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\">(3) That the strict performance of a contract which is required to be in writing may be waived, or its terms extended, by oral agreement. Presidio Mining Co. v. Bullis, 68 Texas 581, 4 S. W. 860; Bullis v. Noyes,, 75 Tex. 540, 12 S. W. 397; Watkins v. Arnold (Civ. App., writ refused), 60 S. W. (2d) 476; Ley v. Patton (Civ. App., writ dismissed), 81 S. W. (2d) 1087; Dockery v. Thorne (Civ. App., writ refused), 135 S. W. 593; Lewis Bros. v. Pendleton (Civ. App., writ dismissed), 227 S. W. 502; Jones v. Gibbs, 133 Texas 627, 130 S. W. (2d) 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">In Restatement of the Law of Contracts, Section 224, the general rule is announced as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u201cThe performance of a condition qualifying a promise in a contract within the Statute may be excused by an oral agreement or permission of the promisor that the condition need not be performed, if the agreement or permission is given while performance of the condition is possible, and in reliance on the agreement or permission, while it is unrevoked, the promisee materially changes his position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">See also State v. Tyler County State Bank (Com. App.), 277 S. W. 625; Greenwood v. Senter (Civ. App.), 44 S. W. (2d) 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The Turners had the right to accept the syndicate certificates, if they saw fit to do so. They exercised that right by accepting such certificates in payment of the delay rentals. And this occurred on or before the date stipulated for the payment of such delay rentals. The jury found that Turner and wife accepted syndicate certificates in payment of the delay rentals prior to April 7, 1928. Consequently, the precise question for determination here is: Did the acceptance of the certificates by the Turners satisfy the payment of the delay rentals and continue in force the terms of the lease? We think that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>the great weight of authority supports the conclusion that it did; and we so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\">The husband has the right to collect, receive, and dispose of the proceeds of the homestead, whether the proceeds arise from a lease of the homestead or from damages or insurance paid on account of destruction or injury to the homestead. This right rests on the ground that the proceeds of a sale or lease of the homestead are mere personal property, both before and after they are received by the husband. Whiteselle v. Jones (Civ. App.), 39 S. W. 405; Alvord Nat\u2019l Bank v. Ferguson (Civ. App.), 126 S. W. 622 (writ refused); Johnson v. Hall, 163 S. W. 399; Williams v. Corpus Christi Bank &amp; Trust Co. (Civ. App., writ refused), 104 S. W. (2d) 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">We are not here concerned with the question as to whether a husband alone may change or extend a lease or lien on the homestead, without the joinder of his wife. Here the husband and wife joined in the creation of the lease. That lease was never changed nor extended. It simply continued in force as originally executed by them. The only question is their right to accept payment of the rentals in a form different from that provided for in the lease. The jury found that the husband and wife both joined in accepting the substitute payment. This occurred before the lease had lapsed on account of the failure to pay rentals. We think they had a right to accept payment of the rentals in the form they did, and that the lease previously executed by them continued in force without the necessity of a re-execution thereof by the husband and wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The jury found that G. G. Turner and wife accepted the syndicate interest certificates in satisfaction of the rentals, and we cannot hold, as a matter of law, that such \u25a0 transaction violated the homestead rights of Mrs. Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The plaintiffs in error contend that the lease from Turner and wife to Joiner, Trustee, being at least in part on the homestead of Turner and wife, was to that extent void, because G. P. Birdwell, the notary before whom the acknowledgments were taken, had a beneficial interest in the right so granted by the lease, thus disqualifying him to act as notary in taking the acknowledgments. The alleged interest of Birdwell arose in this manner: On March 29, 1927, before the Turners executed their lease to Joiner, Trustee, the said Joiner conveyed to W. D. Tucker a one-fourth interest in 'all leases then owned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>in Rusk County and a one-fourth interest in all leases thereafter to be \u201ctaken in the name of C. M. Joiner, Trustee, in Rusk County.\u201d This instrument was acknowledged before one G. P. Birdwell, but was not recorded until August 19, 1930. On March 30, 1927, also prior to the time of any conveyance from the Turners to Joiner, the said W. D. Tucker sold and conveyed one-half of his one-fourth interest in the leases owned and to be acquired by Joiner, as Trustee, to Sam Warren, in trust for several men, including one G. P. Birdwell. The instrument showed on its face that G. P. Birdwell was one of the beneficiaries therein. This instrument was acknowledged before one G. P. Birdwell and was attached to the instrument of date March 29, 1927, above described, and recorded August 19, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\">All of the conveyances through which G. P. Birdwell acquired an interest in the leases were executed prior to the time Joiner acquired the lease here in question, and were recorded after the Turners had executed the lease to Joiner, but before Joiner had executed the leases to the defendants in error. While the lease from Turner and wife to Joiner, Trustee, was acknowledged before one G. P. Birdwell, as were the prior conveyances of Joiner to Tucker, and of Tucker to Warren, Trustee for the benefit of one G. P. Birdwell, there is no evidence or finding by the jury that the G. P. Birdwell who took the acknowledgments of Turner and wife to the lease to Joiner, Trustee, was the same person as the G. P. Birdwell who acquired a beneficial interest in the lease through the prior conveyances from Joiner to Tucker, and from Tucker to Warren, as trustee for the benefit of Birdwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">In this connection, it should be noted that the conveyances from Joiner to Tucker, and from Tucker to Warren, as trustee for the benefit of Birdwell, are not here presented to show an outstanding superior title in Birdwell. They are being here presented merely for the purpose of showing that Birdwell was disqualified to act as notary in taking the acknowledgments of Turner and wife to the lease to Joiner, as trustee; thereby <em>defeating </em>the title deraigned through the Joiner lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">There is in some instances a presumption of identity of person arising from indentity of name; but this presumption is usually indulged in support of the <em>regularity </em>of land titles. It is never indulged in when its effect would be to negative the regularity and soundness of such a title. 30 Tex. Jur., p. 600, sec. 14, states the rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u201cThe presumption of identity of person that arises from identity - of name is not one of universal application. It grew out of the general presumption in support of the integrity of records and the regularity of land titles, and it ceases to become operative whenever its effect would be to negative them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-3\">See also Waller v. Edmonds, 47 Texas 468; Kelley v. Consolidated Underwriters (Civ. App.), 300 S. W. 981, 984; Corey v. Moore, 11 S.

App.) ; and see annotation, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Since there was no proof, nor finding by the jury, nor request for such finding, that the G. P. Birdwell who took the acknowledgments of Turner and his wife to the lease to Joiner, Trustee, was the same G. P. Birdwell who had previously acquired a beneficial interest in all leases to be thereafter acquired by Joiner; and since we cannot indulge in such presumption, there is nothing to support the contention that the notary who took the acknowledgments to the lease from Turner and wife to Joiner, Trustee, was in anywise disqualified. Nor is it shown that any fraud was practiced or any undue influence was brought to bear on either Turner or his wife in taking their acknowledgments to the lease given to Joiner. Since Turner and his wife actually signed the lease and appeared before a notary public and acknowledged same, and since the lease and the notary\u2019s certificate were regular on their face, and in no way disclosed the interest of the notary therein, the instrument would be valid to subsequent purchasers without notice of the defect.

Jur., p. 272, sec. 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\">But even if there had been evidence that the G. P. Birdwell who took the acknowledgments of Turner and wife to the lease from them to Joiner, as trustee, was the same person as the G. P. Birdwell who acquired a beneficial interest in the lease through the prior conveyances\" from Joiner to Tucker, and from Tucker to Warren, as trustee for Birdwell, the result would be the same; because the defendants in error were not charged with notice thereof. The jury found that the defendants in error had no actual notice of any defect in the title to the lease, and the evidence is sufficient to support that finding. If there was any notice at all of Birdwell\u2019s disqualification to take the acknowledgments, it was the constructive notice arising from the recording of the conveyances through which Bird-well acquired his interest. It appears, however, if we were to indulge in the presumption of identity of person arising from the mere identity of name, that Birdwell acted as notary in taking the acknowledgment in the conveyance from Tucker to Warren, as trustee for Birdwell. In other words, the very instrument through which G. P. Birdwell acquired his interest in the lease showed on its face that the same G. P. Birdwell was both notary and grantee. He took the acknowledgment to the conveyance of the lease to himself. If we were to indulge in the presumption that the G. P. Birdwell who took the acknowledgment to the conveyance was the same person named as the beneficiary in the conveyance, then we would have to hold that he was disqualified to take the acknowledgment to such conveyance. The defect in the instrument under which Birdwell acquired his interest in the lease would be apparent on the face of the instrument, and such instrument would not be subject to recordation. 1 Tex. Jur., p. 424, sec. 15; 36 Tex. Jur., p. 439, sec. 31; Whitehead v. Foley, 28 Texas 268; McDaniel v. Needham, 61 Texas 269; Birdseye v. Rogers (Civ. App.), 26 S. W. 841; Christy v. Romero (Civ. App., writ refused), 140 S. W. 516; Salmon v. Huff, 80 Texas 133, 15 S. W. 257; Coffey v. Hendricks, 66 Texas 676, 2 S. W. 269; Holliday v. Cromwell, 26 Texas 188. If the instrument was not subject to recordation, subsequent purchasers were not required to take notice thereof, even though same was actually recorded in the deed records. 1 Tex. Jur., p. 424; sec. 15; 36 Tex. Jur., p. 487, sec. 57; King v. Russell, 40 Texas 125; Taylor v. Harrison, 47 Texas 454; Hayden v. Moffat, 74 Texas 647; 12 S. W. 820; Peters v.

We therefore hold that there was no such proof of a defect in the acknowledgments in the lease from Turner and wife to Joiner as to render the same invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\">Now the question presents itself whether the word \u201cTrustee\u201d inserted in the Joiner lease Tyas sufficient to impose upon a purchaser under such lease the duty of inquiring and ascertaining who were the beneficiaries in such lease. There is nothing in the Joiner lease which in any manner indicated that Birdwell had an interest therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Prior to 1925 the rule prevailed in this State that subsequent purchasers of property which had been conveyed to a trustee were legally bound to ascertain who were the beneficaries in the trust conveyance. This placed quite a burden upon those who acquired property from a trustee. In 1925 the Legislature changed that rule by adopting Article 7425a, Vernon\u2019s Annotated Texas Civil Statutes, which-reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u201cWhere a trust is created, but is not contained or declared in the conveyance to the trustee, or when a conveyance or transfer is made to a trustee without disclosing the names of the beneficiary, or beneficaries the trustee shall be held to have the power to convey or transfer or encumber the title and whenever he shall execute and deliver a conveyance or transfer or encumbrance of such property, as trustee, such conveyance or transfer or encumbrance shall not thereafter be questioned by any one claiming as a beneficiary under such trust or by any one claiming by, through, or under an undisclosed beneficiary, provided that none of the trust property in the hands of said trustee shall be liable for personal obligations of said trustee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Under the plain provisions of the above statute, where the conveyance was from Turner and wife to Joiner, as trustee, without disclosing for whose benefit Joiner held as trustee, the defendants in error could purchase from Joiner, as trustee, without being charged with constructive notice of Bird-well\u2019s interest, if any, in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The fact that the original lease from Turner and wife to Joiner, as trustee, was afterwards reacknowledged before a different notary, after Pevey had taken a lease on the same property, in our judgment was not an admission that the o-rig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>inal lease was void; and such act would not be a waiver of any rights acquired under the lease as originally acknowledged, nor estop Joiner and his vendees from asserting such rights. At most, it might raise an issue to go to the jury; but the jury, in finding that the defendants in error had no notice of any defect in the title, resolved that issue in favor of said defendants in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\">The defendants in error further contend that, since whatever title Birdwell had in the lease emanated out of Joiner prior to the time Joiner acquired an interest therein, they, as purchasers through Joiner, were not required to take notice of the conveyances through which Birdwell acquired an interest in the lease. They cite in support of their contentions the following authorities: Breen v. Morehead, 104 Texas 254, 136 S. W. 1047, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 1285; Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, vol. 2, p. 1133, sec. 658; Copelin v. Shauler (Tex. Sup.), 6 S. W. 668; Anderson v. Farmer (Civ. App., writ refused), 189 S.

We omit a discussion of this contention, because same is not necessary to a decision of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">This case was submitted to a jury, and their findings were made as above indicated, and the trial judge entered judgment thereon. Both the trial court and the Court of Civil Appeals found that there was sufficient evidence to support the judgment. This Court will not set aside a judgment of the trial court, unless it can be said, as a matter of law, that there was no evidence of a probative nature to support such judgment. We have examined the statement of facts and the entire record, and have found evidence to support the judgment of the trial court. Therefore this Court is not justified in holding to the contrary.

M. Cureton, and reported in 132 S. W. (2d) 553, this volume 202, correctly disposes of this case. No good purpose would be served by my writing further.\u201d In view of the far-reaching effect of the rulings contained in the majority opinion on rehearing, I feel that I should make a statement of my views on the issues which' I think should control the decision of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">As shown by the original opinion by Chief Justice Cureton, and the opinion of the majority of this Court on rehearing by Associate Justice Sharp, Continental Oil Company et al assert title in this cause under an oil and gas lease, dated April 7, 1927, from G. G. Turner and wife, Sina A. Turner, to C. M. Joiner covering a tract of 311.72 acres of land in Rusk County, Texas. The above lease is in the usual form of an \u201cunless\u201d oil and gas lease. It will be noted that it contains, among others, the following provisions:</p>\n<p id=\"b214-14\">It states that it leases the land above mentioned:</p>\n<p id=\"b214-15\">(1) \u201cfor the sole and only purpose of mining and operating for oil and gas or of laying pipe lines and building tanks, stations and structures thereon to produce, save and take care of said production.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>(2) It provides that said lease \u201cshall remain in full force for a term of five years from its date, and as long thereafter as oil or gas, or either of them, is produced from said land by lessee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\">(3) It provides: \u201cIf no well be commenced on said land on or before the 7th day of April, 1928, this lease shall terminate as to both parties, unless the lessee on or before that date shall pay or tender to the lessor or to the lessor\u2019s credit in the First State Bank at Overton, Texas, or its successors, which shall continue as the depository regardless of changes in the ownership of said land, the sum of Seventy-seven and 25/100 ($77.25) Dollars, which shall operate as a rental and confer the privilege of deferring the commencement of a well for six (6) months from said date. In like manner and upon like payments or tenders the commencement of a well may be further deferred for like periods of the same number of months successively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">It is shown that the homestead of Turner and wife was a part of this 311.72-acre tract; that neither Joiner nor any of his assigns have ever drilled a well for oil or gas on this land, or erected any improvements thereon; that the sums of money required by the terms of this lease to be paid, to keep it in force after April 7, 1928, were never paid; that Joiner proposed to G. G. Turner that he take \u201csyndicate interest certificates\u201d in lieu of the payments in money for the three succeeding years commencing April 7, 1928, called for in the lease contract; that Turner agreed to this; and that such certificates were delivered to Turner; but no written memorandum of change in the lease contract was signed by Turner and wife, or either of them. Finally, it is shown that Turner and wife, accepted the above-mentioned \u201csyndicate interest certificates\u201d in payment of the delay rentals provided for in the lease contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">It will be noted that the above lease contract provides that it shall remain in force for a term of five years from its date, and as long thereafter as oil or gas, or either of them, is produced in paying quantities. It is then provided that if no well be commenced on the land covered by the lease on or before April 7, 1928, the lease shall terminate as to both parties, \u201cunless\u201d the lessee shall pay or tender to the lessor or to the lessor\u2019s credit in a certain named bank the sum of $77.25, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>which shall operate as a rental and confer the privilege of deferring the commencement of a well six months from said date. In like manner and upon like payments or tenders, the commencement of a well could be further deferred for like periods for the same number of months successively until the end of the five-year primary period.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\">It is settled by the decisions of this Court that the above instrument, while called a mineral or oil and gas lease, is, in law, a conveyance of an estate in land. Its effect is to sever the mineral estate from the surface estate, and convey the mineral estate to the lessee named in the contract. It is also settled by the decisions of this Court that, while an instrument of this kind is, in law, a conveyance of an estate in land, the \u201cunless\u201d clause operates to limit the estate conveyed. The opinion of the majority does not question, but fully recognizes the above-stated construction of this instrument, and of others of like character and import.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">I think it is also settled as the law of this State that the \u201cunless\u201d provisions in a lease of this kind are not only limitations on the grant or estate conveyed, but that the events contained or named in such provisions mark the duration of the estate granted. The estate granted either continues to exist for its primary term, in this instance five years, or it terminates before the primary term is ended according to the happening or not happening of the event or events of the \u201cunless\u201d provisions made a limitation upon the grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Under the \u201cunless\u201d provisions of this and like leases the lessee is under no obligation to either drill a well or pay rentals. He simply has the option of permitting the lease or estate granted to terminate and cease to exist, or he can keep such lease or estate alive and in effect by either drilling or paying rentals, as specified in its \u201cunless\u201d provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">When duly executed, a contract such as this expresses the agreement of the parties and definitely and completely fixes, determines, and defines the very character of the estate granted, and the method by which it will endure for the primary period, or terminate at a prior date. In my opinion, since the \u201cunless\u201d provisions of this contract are limitations upon the very grant itself, fix the very character of the estate granted, and mark its duration, they constitute, in fact and in law, a part of the very essence of the title created in the first instance. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>being true, it is my opinion that permitting a change of such provisions to be effected in parol is to violate not only the letter, but the very object and intent of our statutes of conveyance and of frauds. Articles 1288, 1291, 3995, R. C. S. 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\">To my mind it is just as logical to say that the times named for the drilling of a well, or the payment of delay rentals, provided by the \u201cunless\u201d provisions of this lease contract, can be shortened or extended in parol, as it would be to say that the thing itself, provided to be done, can be so changed to something else. In fact, it appears to me that if the thing itself provided to be done can be changed to something else by a mere parol agreement, then the thing itself can be absolutely abolished in the same way, and nothing substituted in its place. I mention these matters to show the far-reaching consequences of the opinion of the majority on the rights of both lessors and lessees.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Chief Justice Cureton\u2019s opinion fully discusses the nature and effect of the \u201cunless\u201d clause in this instrument. Such opinion also points out that under our statutes an estate conveyed is deemed the grant of a fee simple title if a less estate be not limited by express words, or does not appear to have been granted. No one would argue that the limitation upon the estate here granted could have rested originally in parol. If not, I think that Chief Justice Cureton\u2019s opinion fully demonstrates that such limitation cannot be altered, changed, or abolished in parol.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Finally, I think Chief Justice Cureton\u2019s opinion correctly announces the law which ought to govern this case in so far as such opinion deals with the powers to change the \u201cunless\u201d provisions of this written contract by subsequent parol agrees ment. I also thing that Chief Justice Cureton\u2019s opinion correctly announces the law governing this case in so far as it deals with the power of Turner and wife to alter or change the \u201cunless\u201d provisions of this lease contract as to the land covered thereby which constituted their homestead, except by written instrument duly executed by both Turner and wife, and separately acknowledged by the wife. (See this volume, page 212.)</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Opinion delivered June 10, 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">For the convenience of the Bar, the opinion by the late Chief Justice Cureton, as referred to by Mr. Justice Critz, is here inserted, as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b218-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Opinion by Mr. Chief Justice Cureton. (132 S. W., 2d Series, 553.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\">This case is before the Court by writ of error from the Court of Civil Appeals for the Sixth District. The opinion of that court may be found in 61 S. W. (2d) 185, and is here referred to for a general statement of the case. The Continental Oil Company, East Texas Refining Company, H. L. Hunt, and P. G. Lake, as plaintiffs in the trial court (defendants in error here), filed this suit against G. G. Turner and wife, Sina A. Turner, and the Gulf Production Company (plaintiffs in error here) to recover the oil and gas leasehold estate in a certain 311.72 acres of land, more or less, in Rusk County, Texas. The defendants in error claim title under an oil and gas lease from G. G. Turner and wife, Sina A. Turner, to C. M. Joiner, Trustee, dated April 7, 1927. The Gulf Production Company title is through and under a similar lease executed by the said G. G. Turner and wife, Sina A. Turner, to J. W. Pevey, dated July 25, 1930. At the time of the trial below the Gulf Production Company was in possession under its lease, had brought in seven producing wells, and was then drilling another, all at a cost to the company up to that time of $149,725.00. The suit was brought by defendants in error in the form of an action in trespass to try title, but they specially pleaded the Turner lease of April 7, 1927, and compliance with its terms as the source of their title. The primary question is: Which lease is to be given effect? The lease of defendants in error is in the usual form of oil and gas leases. G. G. Turner and wife, Sina A. Turner, are named as lessors, and <em>C. M. Jomer, Trustee, </em>as lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The lease sets out the field notes of the land, was to run five years, and as long thereafter as oil or gas might be produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Both G. G. Turner and his wife first acknowledged this lease in statutory form on the 7th day of April, 1927, before G. P. Birdwell, Notary Public for Rusk County, Texas. More than three years thereafter, viz., on the 18th day of October, 1930, both G. G. Turner and his wife, S. A. Turner, again asknowledged the execution of this instrument, in statutory form, before James A. Copeland, Notary Public for Harris County, Texas. The lease was twice filed for record in Rusk County; first on the 15th day of April, 1927, and again on February 17, 1931.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The \u201cdrilling clause\u201d of the lease reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\u201cIf no well be commenced on said land on or before the 7 day of April 1928 this lease shall terminate as to both parties, <em>unless </em>the lessee on or before that date shall pay or tender to the lessor, or to the lessor\u2019s credit in the First State Bank at Overton, Texas, or its successors, which shall continue as the depository, regardless of changes in the ownership of said land, the sum of Seventy Seven and 25/100 Dollars, which shall operate as rental and cover the privilege of deferring the commencement of a well for Six (6) months from said date. In like manner and upon like payments or tenders the commencement of a well may be further deferred for like periods of the same number of months successively. And it is understood and agreed that the consideration first recited herein, the down payment, covers not only the privilege granted to the date when said first rental is payable as aforesaid, but also the <em>lessee\u2019s option </em>of extending that period as aforesaid, and any and all other rights conferred.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\">The plaintiffs in error say that the above \u201cunless\u201d clause was never complied with, and that the lease terminated by its own limitations on April 7, 1928, long before Pevey, through whom Gulf Production Company claims, obtained his lease from the Turners. Defendants in error say in their pleadings that they claim <em>\u201cthrough and under said lease, and subject to the terms of said lease,\u201d </em>and <em>\u201cupon which all delay rental obligations </em>hadI <em>been fully satisfied and discharged.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Although Mr. and Mrs. Turner denied that anything of the sort ever took place, the jury, answering special issues, found that G. G. Turner and wife, Sina A. Turner, prior to April 7, 1928, accepted from Dan Cameron syndicate interest certificates purporting to cover the 80-acres Joiner discovery well tract (on the Daisy Bradford land), in satisfaction of the rentals payable under the lease for the three succeeding years, commencing April 7, 1928. The syndicate interest certificate transaction took place between G. G. Turner, alone and Dan Cameron, a representative of C. M. Joiner, Trustee, \u2014 Mrs. Turner not being present. Concerning the transaction, Cameron in part testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u201cI called on Mr. Turner at least a week and possibly two weeks prior to the date on which the rental was due to talk to him about the rental money and Mr. Turner was up on his barn or car shed and I went out there and went up there and told him that Mr. Joiner was having work and a hard time in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>keeping the work up and well drilling and to pay the rentals and if he did have to continue to pay the rentals on the land down there that it would be impossible for him to continue to drill the well, because it was very difficult for him to get the money \u2014 and that the only thing he could do to keep the work going on down there was to get the folks that owned \u2014 that he had the land leased from, to accept in lieu of their rentals and in payment of their rentals the syndicate interest.</p>\n<p id=\"AbI\">********</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\">\u201cThat was the syndicate interest in the well he was then drilling and Mr. Turner told me that he thought a good deal of Mr. Joiner and would do anything on earth to help him come out and he expressed himself that he had a very high regard for Mr. Joiner and also he knew that Mr. Joiner had been having an awful hard time to keep this well going * * * Mr. Turner told me he was willing to accept the syndicate interest in the well for his rental and he said that there would not be any rentals anyhow if Mr. Joiner was not drilling and the rentals didn\u2019t amount to anything to him and he was glad to accept in lieu of the rentals the syndicate interest in this well down there.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">***** *</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u201cI made out Mr. Turner a syndicate interest for his rentals and delivered it to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">********</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\u201cI had a pad of those forms like that, the original and the duplicate, and I had a carbon in between them and I made out this certificate and then I gave one copy to Mr. Turner and I kept one copy for Mr. Joiner\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">********</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">\u201cAt the time I gave him the certificate I made out a rental receipt and got Mr. Turner to sign it.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">********</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">\u201cAt the time of the transaction with Mr. Turner he agreed to settle with me for three years rentals, from April 7, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">******* H&lt;</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">\u201cMr. Turner signed the rental receipt for the three years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-14\">The above transaction is the only basis for the claim that Joiner, Trustee, complied with the terms of the lease, and the Court of Civil Appeals held it was sufficient for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>The homestead of Turner and his wife was located on the land, and had been for more than fifty years. The Court of Civil Appeals held that after the execution of the lease by the Turners they had no homestead rights whatever in or to the property, in part saying:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\">\u201cSo the conveyance of the determinable fee by G. G. Turner and wife carried with it the exclusive right of possession, and that remaining in the Turners after the conveyance being only a right of reverter, not carrying with it a right of possession, until after the happening of the event that would terminate the estate, then no right of homestead could attach in favor of the Turners, a present right of possession being necessary for homestead rights to attach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">This holding is the basis of the court\u2019s conclusion that the syndicate interest certificate transaction was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In our opinion, the terms of the lease negative any purpose to grant or to abandon the homestead or the possession of the premises, or any interest therein not necessary for carrying into effect the lease itself. The lease expressly states that Joiner, Trustee, and his vendees, <em>could not use the \u201cwater wells of the lessor\u201d; </em>that <em>\u201cwhen requested by lessor, lessee shall bury all pipe line below plow depth\u201d; that \u201cno well shall he drilled nearer |than 200 feet to the home or bam on said </em>premises,, <em>without the written consent of the lessor\u201d; </em>and <em>\u201cLessee shall pay for damages caused by all operations to growing crops on said land.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">These clauses, it seems' to us, show beyond dispute that it was contemplated by the very terms of the lease itself that Turner and wife should continue in possession of their home, house, wells, barn, and continue to cultivate the land, and make such use of it as could be made, in so far as might be consistent with the exercise of the right to drill and produce oil therefrom. Moreover, as to the surface of the land, the only grant made by the Turners was in the nature of an easement that it might be employed in the production of oil and gas. That surface, and everything in the land itself, except the minerals covered by the lease, was still <em>in their possession and was their property, </em>subject to a reasonable use, qualified only by the express provisions of the lease, to which we have made reference. Summers on Oil &amp; Gas (Perm, ed.), vol. 4, sec. 652. So, it cannot be said, as the Court of Civil Appeals holds, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>the right of the Turners was only \u201ca right of reverter not carrying with it a right of possession.\u201d Quite contrary to this conclusion of the Court of Civil Appeals is a paragraph in the reply of defendants in error to the application for writ of error filed in this cause, which reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\">\u201cIt has never been contended by defendants in error that they are entitled to the exclusive possession of the entire estate in the Turner land. <em>On the contrary, the title and right of the lessors, the Turners, to the use and occupancy of the surface of the land, </em>such as is reserved to every lessor under the ordinary oil and gas lease, <em>has never been and is not now in dispute.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">This Court has long recognized the right of a landowner to sever the surface and mineral estates, and convey the latter without conveying or destroying the former. 31 Tex.

W. 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Since we have determined that the Turners did continue to have a homestead estate in the land covered by the lease, it follows that the basis of the holding of the Court of Civil Appeals that Turner had the right to accept the syndicate certificates in continuation of the lease because no homestead rights existed (61 S. W. (2d) 188) passes out of the case, with the result that the conclusion of the court sustaining the validity of the transaction is necessarily erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The insistence here, however, is that since Turner had the right under the law, as head of the community, to collect, receive, and dispose of the proceeds of the homestead, he had the right to accept the syndicate interest certificates. We recognize the rule that the <em>proceeds </em>of a sale of the homestead property, <em>if personalty, </em>are subject to the control of the husband. 22 Tex. Jur., p. 130, sec. 92. <em>But here there were no proceeds.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The lease here involved is an \u201cunless lease,\u201d and imposed no obligation on Joiner, Trustee, to either drill or pay; and upon his failure to either drill, pay, or make the deposit in the named bank, no liability of any kind arose in favor of the Turners against him; nothing was due thereunder; there was nothing for Turner to collect; and-nothing could be recovered. 31 Tex.

Jur., p. 744, sec. 134. (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">That the Court of Civil Appeals misinterpreted the meaning of the <em>\u2018unless\u2019 </em>clause before us is plainly shown in one of the concluding sentences in its opinion, wherein the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u201cTurner\u2019s written authority to demand money in payment of rentals did not restrict his right to- accept property in satisfaction thereof.\u201d 61 S. W. (2d) 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The error in this is obvious. Turner had no written authority, nor any other authority, under the lease to <em>demand </em>money in payment of rentals. <em>There were no rentals due, and under the leaS[&amp; there was no obligation due the Turners for the payment of which he could demand money. </em>The defendants in error \u201cdo not dispute\u201d this proposition as applicable to an \u201cunless lease.\u201d On page 48 of their \u201cReply * * to printed arguments filed by plaintiffs in error * *\u201d in this Court, they say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">\u201cIt is insisted in all the arguments that there is never any obligation to pay the rentals that, at the option of the lessee, may be paid under an \u2018unless\u2019 lease. <em>The defendants in error do not dispute that proposition.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">For the reasons stated, we are clear that Turner, under the rules of law which permit him to collect community debts, or settle obligations due the community, did not have authority to accept the syndicate interest certificates for the continuance of the lease on the homestead.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">The result of the failure of Joiner, Trustee, to either begin a well, pay the specified amount of money, or make the named deposit by April 7, 1928, was to <em>i/pso facto </em>terminate the lease, and the Turners became reinvested with the entire estate without the necessity of re-entry, declaration, or legal action. 31 Tex.

S., Art. 1291. By reason of this statute, the intent to convey an estate in fee simple will be presumed where a less estate is not expressly and unequivocally declared. 14 Tex. Jur., p. 933, sec. 155; May v. S. &amp; A. P. Townsite Co., 83 Texas 502, 508, 18 S. W. 958 ; Lindsay v. Freeman, 83 Texas 259, 263, 18 S. W. 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The conditions under which the lease before us could continue, and the length of time it could endure, were, <em>under the statute, just as much a part of the grant as the title to the oil and gas, or surface easement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">It therefore appears that the \u201cunless\u201d provisions of the lease here involved, being words of limitation, the purpose of which is to specify <em>\u201cthe term of continuance or </em>iduration\u201d of the <em>estate, constitute an integral part of the very grant itself required by statute in order to prevent the grant from being one in fee simple.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">From Cameron\u2019s testimony, quoted above, it is apparent that the agreement between Cameron and Turner. to extend the Turner lease for three years from April 7, 1928, for the syndicate interest certificates, was not in writing, but was verbal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>So, what we really have before us is a parol agreement of Turner to accept the syndicate interest certificates for the three years\u2019 rental named in the lease, a written document called a syndicate interest certificate, the contents of which we do not know, and according to the so-called duplicate in the record, a receipt for money, although no money was paid, signed by Turner, alone, but unacknowledged, for three years\u2019 rental.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\">Since the oral modification of the lease extended it for three years upon a new and different option and consideration to that written in the lease, changed by oral agreement the limitations written in the grant in compliance with the statute (R. S., Art. 1291), quoted above, it is obvious that it was in violation of both the Statute of Frauds and the Statute of Conveyances. R. S., Arts. 3995, 1288; 20 Tex. Jur., p. 215, sec. 6, pp. 283, 284, secs. 73, 74; Adams v. Hughes, 140 S. W. 1163, 1169 (writ refused) ; Burgher &amp; Co. v. Canter 190, S. W. 1147; Schofield v. Pyron, 257 S. W. 350; Kistler v. Latham, 255 S. W. 983, 985.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The defendants in error, under the lease as thus modified by the oral agreement, have a lease for some terms of which they must go to the original and executed document, and for others to the oral modification. It is quite elementary that in such a case the oral modification of a contract falling within the Statute of Frauds is itself within the statute. In fact, it may be correctly said that the oral modification of the written agreement creates a new contract, resting entirely in parol. 20 Tex. Jur., p. 213, sec. 6, n. 283, secs. 73, 74; Ickert v. Minor, 22 S. W. (2d) 741, 743; McDonald v. Whaley, 244 S. W. 596, 598; Gardner v. Sittig, 188 S. W. 731; Allen v. Mulkey, 19 S. W. (2d) 936, 945; Kistler v. Latham, 255 S. W. 983, 985; Adams v.

(2d) 333, 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">This is necessarily so, because only by parol can it be ascertained what portion of the written instrument is to remain effective and what portion has been eliminated or suspended by the syndicate interest certificate transaction. So, what we really have is a parol conveyance of an oil and gas lease on the Turner lands. The jury found that the syndicate interest certificates were delivered, but this does not take the contract which now rests entirely in parol out of the Statute of Frauds. In order to do this, not only must the consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>be paid, but possession must be delivered and valuable improvements made, neither of which was done. The agreement, therefore, cannot be enforced. 20 Tex. Jur., pp. 328, 337, secs. 116 to 124; Hooks v. Bridgewater, 111 Texas 122, 229 S. W. 1114; Ward v. Etier, 113 Texas 83, 251 S.

W. 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Defendants in error\u2019s proposition that the acceptance of the syndicate interest certificates in lieu of money was a mere substituted method of performance, is without merit. \u201cA substituted method of performance\u201d necessarily presupposes a contract to be <em>performed, </em>and an obligation to be satisfied; otherwise, there is no \u201cmethod of performance\u201d for which some other method may be \u201csubstituted.\u201d In the lease before us <em>there was no obligation to be performed, </em>and therefore no method of performance for which something else could be substituted. Joiner had an option (is is called the <em>\u201clessee\u2019s option\u201d </em>in the drilling clause previously quoted) to continue the lease, but he could not effectively exercise it by delivery of syndicate interest certificates, because that was not one of his options. Options must be accepted according to their terms, and leases of the character before us must be strictly complied with. 43 Tex. Jur., p. 100, sec. 62; 31 Tex. Jur., p. 759, sec. 141, p. 762, sec. 144, p. 764, sec. 145, p. 767, sec. 146. So&gt; what actually took place was not a \u201csubstituted method of performance,\u201d but a substitution of another option for those named in the written lease, or the incorporation in the agreement of a fourth option, resting in <em>parol </em>to the effect that if Joiner would deliver the syndicate interest certificates, the lease should be continued for three years. But the lease was an \u201cunless\u201d lease, and under it the options specified in the written document, in connection with the termination clause, were \u201climitations on the grant,\u201d an integral part of the very grant itself, required by the statute (R S., Art. 1291) to prevent the passage of a fee simple title; which, of course, could not be changed by parol. The delivery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>of the certificates was not a \u201csubstituted performance\u201d of the original agreement, but an original performance of the parol option attempted to be incorporated in the written document for the purpose of changing the limitations of the grant, in violation of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\">Defendants in error in their brief filed here on the proposition that the \u201cunless\u201d provisions of an oil and gas lease express a \u201ccondition subsequent,\u201d instead of a \u201climitation,\u201d (pages 49 and 50) concede that the doctrine of \u201csubstituted performance\u201d can have no application to a grant upon a limitation. They say that a grantor <em>\u201ccannot trnive the results of the happening of cm event to which the duration of an estate is limited,\u201d </em>and (on page 48) \u201cThe grantor may waive or be estopped to assert the breach of a condition, or he may accept a substituted performance of it by parol, <em>while he cannot do </em>so\u25a0 <em>in the case of a limitation.\u201d </em>(All italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Cases and authorities cited by defendants in error relative to parol modifications of actual obligations to pay rent, or actual obligations to pay royalties, or changing the method of paying royalties, have no application here, since these involve substituted methods of performing actual obligations; not, as here, the addition of a parol option and the substitution of an oral limitation for those written in the grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The limitation in the lease was imposed on the grant by Mrs. Turner, the wife, <em>and operated in protection of her homestead right; and </em>G. G. Turner, the husband, alone, could no more enlarge, modify, or change it than he could alone make a valid grant or lease in the first instance, or change the determinable fee into a complete fee simple title, or the surface easement into a complete conveyance. The authorities declare the husband alone cannot contract for the renewal or extension of an obligation on the homestead, or that the <em>burden of an encumbrance may not be increased thereon without the wife\u2019s consent, etc. </em>22 Tex. Jur., pp. 122, 123, sec. 86; 23 Tex.

The last authorities cited hold that easements, including the right to take water, which is a mineral (40 Corpus Juris, p. 738, sec. 12) are within the quoted definition of \u201cencumbrances.\u201d It is therefore obvious that the husband alone cannot change or modify limitations imposed by the wife in an original oil lease; for certainly a change in the limitation on the grant, in the conditions, compliance with which was necessary to its continuance, the purpose and claimed effect of which was to continue the grant for three years, was an \u201cencumbrance,\u201d which diminished the value of the homestead property of Mrs. Turner. The husband cannot even accept a less amount of consideration than that specified in the wife\u2019s deed, and bind the wife. Cole v. Bammel, 62 Texas 108; Stallings v. Hullum, 89 Texas 431, 35 S. W. 2; Dodd v. Daniel, 89 S. W. (2d) 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">These cases rest upon the principle that a change in the consideration to be paid for the homestead from that specified in the deed signed and acknowledged by the wife has the effect of making the conveyance upon terms which were not in her deed, and therefore not binding upon her.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">In the case before us the principle applies with greater force than in the cases cited, because the effect of the syndicate certificate transaction was not only to substitute another and different consideration for that named in the lease, but at the same time to change the limitations of the grant, and cause its continuance for three years upon delivery of the certificate, an option not specified in the lease at all, a transaction resting entirely in parol. As said in Cole v. Bammel, cited above, <em>\u201cSuch a proceeding imposes upon the wife a, different contract from that which she had explained to her, and, in effect, forces upon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number><em>her a conveyance she may have been unwilling to execute. </em>* * * <em>and the beneficial design of the statute </em>(R. S., Art. 1300) <em>is frustrated.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\">Mrs. Turner\u2019s joinder was necessary in the creation <em>of </em>the limitation in the lease in the first instance, and is equally necessary to any valid change of this limitation. It would be an idle and futile thing for the Constitution and the statutes to require the joinder of the wife in the execution of the lease before us; to require her to separately acknowledge it after its contents <em>as turitten </em>had been explained to her by the notary; and to require the wife to limit the estate granted by express words if she desired it to be limited (R. S., Art. 1291), if the husband alone could modify or change the limitation on the grant imposed by her in her conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">We are of the opinion that the syndicate interest certificate transaction was not only in violation of the Statute of Frauds and the Statute of Conveyances, as we have shown, but was in violation of the statutes governing homestead conveyances by husband and wife; was void as to Mrs. Turner, the wife; should not have been admitted in evidence in the first instance; and could not form the basis of a judgment in favor of defendants in error. /</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Mrs. Turner is not estopped as to her homestead by the syndicate interest certificate transaction, even though she did accept the certificates, or ratify the transaction, since there is no fraud shown on her part. 22 Tex.

Mitchell v. Simms, 63 S. W. (2d) 371; authorities <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>In addition to the foregoing, we have concluded that the lease was absolutely void as to the homestead, for the reason that Birdwell, the notary public who took the acknowledgments of Mr. and Mrs. Turner, was interested as a part owner or beneficiary of the estate conveyed, and was therefore disqualified to take the acknowledgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\">Birdwell\u2019s disqualification arose out of the following facts: On March 29, 1927, C. M. Joiner, Trustee, and W. D. Tucker entered into a partnership agreement, acknowledged by both Joiner and Tucker before G. P. Birdwell, a notary public, and its validity is not questioned. This agreement made Joiner, Trustee, and Tucker partners in the ownership of all oil and gas leases then in the name of C. M. Joiner, Trustee, in all leases originally taken in the name of Citizens Lease Syndicate, but controlled by Joiner, Trustee, <em>in all other leases and royalties to be acquired, </em>and in all oil and gas wells to be drilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">On March 30, 1927, W. D. Tucker assigned one-half of his one-fourth interest in the partnership thus created to Sam Warren, Trustee for <em>G. P. Birdwell </em>and other named parties. This assignment was attached as an addendum to the original partnership agreement between Joiner and Tucker referred to <em>above; </em>and the two documents thus attached were filed for record on August 19, 1930, and were recorded as one instrument. Both instruments (omitting acknowledgments) are copied in the margin at the end of this opinion. U) (-) (See pages 235, 236).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The assignment from Tucker to Warren, Trustee, was acknowledged by Tucker before <em>G. P. Birdwell, </em>notary public, who was, of course, disqualified by reason of interest to take the acknowledgment. 1 Tex. Jur., pp. 442-445, secs. 32, 33, 34, 36. But the instrument was valid as between the parties without the acknowledgment. 1 Tex. Jur., p. 417, sec. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">This instrument plainly gave Birdwell a beneficial interest in all the property which had been assigned to Tucker by Joiner, Trustee, and an interest in all oil and gas lease to be thereafter acquired for the use and benefit of the Joiner-Tucker partnership, as well as in all oil wells, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Tucker, in carrying out his part of the Joiner-Tucker agreement to procure as many leases as possible in the name of C. M. Joiner, Trustee, on April 7, 1927, obtained the lease here involved from the Turners, which was acknowledged by both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Mr. and Mrs. Turner before <em>G. P. Birdwell </em>as notary, who, being <em>beneficially interested in the lease, </em>was disqualified to take the acknowledgments. 1 Tex. Jur., p. 442, sec. 32, p. 443, sec. 33, p. 444, sec. 34, p. 446, sec. 36; 1 Am. Jur., p. 334, sec. 52; Corpus Juris Secundum, p. 824, secs. 53, 53d; 1 Corpus Juris, p. 802, sec. 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\">The knowledge of Tucker, partner of Joiner, and agent of the partnership, of Birdwell\u2019s disqualification was notice to Joiner and the partnership of such disqualification. Gary v. McKinney, 239 S. W. 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The acknowledgment of Mrs. Turner having been taken by Birdwell, a disqualified notary, was absolutely null and void, \u201cis as though it had never been written, is mere waste paper, is not her act and deed, and is wholly ineffectual to divest her of her title.\u201d 1 Tex. Jur., pp. 517, 519, secs. 114, 115, 116, p. 535, see. 133; 22 Tex. Jur., p. 122, sec. 86; Workman\u2019s Mutual Aid Assn. v. Monroe, 53 S.

W. 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">This rule applies to oil and gas leases the same as it does to other conveyances of the homestead property. 22 Tex. Jur., p. 128, sec. 90; 31 Tex. Jur., p. 587, sec. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">. It is unnecessary to decide the effect of this void deed in the hands of an innocent purchaser (as was done in Workman\u2019s Mutual Aid Assn. v. Monroe, <em>swpfa), </em>since we have concluded defendants in error are not of that class.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The defendants in error say that, since their title comes through C. M. Joiner, Trustee, the intervening- instruments which disclose Birdwell\u2019s disqualification to take the Turner acknowledgments do not convey notice to them, because \u201cnot in\u201d their \u201cchain of title\u201d; and that they are not charged with notice of any infirmities in the acknowledgments, because of Revised Statutes, Article 7425a.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The two rules invoked have no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">The general rule as to notice to a purchaser of realty is stated in 43 Texas Jurisprudence, p. 647, sec. 383, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b233-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\"It is a general rule that the purchaser is charged with notice of the existence, contents, and legal effects of all instruments contained in his chain of title or connected therewith. <em>He is bound by every description, recital, reference and reservation, and by every other matter contained in or fairly disclosed by any instrument which forms an essential link in the chain of title under tohich he claims. This is so\u2019 regardless of whether the instrument is recorded or whether he has actually seen or read it, or has any knowledge of its contents.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><em>\u201cAccordingly, the purchaser is charged with knowledge of any equity or interest of a third person which is disclosed or recognied by a conveyance through which he claims, as well as notice of any fact recited or revealed in such conveyance, in the certificate of acknowledgment, or in another instrument to which the conveyance refers. </em>And when a fact is recited which is sufficient to put a prudent man on inquiry, the purchaser is charged with notice of facts which might have been ascertained by a proper inquiry.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">See, also, 31 Tex.

The addition of the word <em>\u201cTrustee\u201d </em>to Joiner\u2019s name was sufficient to convey notice that Joiner was but a trustee, and put defendants in error upon inquiry as to the character of trust under which he acted, and the extent and limitations of his authority. 20 R.

Tucker entered into an agreement, which is copied in the margin at the end of this opinion. U)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number><em>By this instrument, it is obvious that Joiner, Trustee, assigned a one-fourth interest in all the leases which he then owned and all to be thereafter acquired in the name of Joiner, Trustee, to Tucker for the one thousand dollars, </em>etc. The agreement states that both Joiner, Trustee, and Tucker \u201cmutually agree to use their best endeavor to increase our holdings and handle them to best advantage, * * *\u201d It further provides that \u201call expenses thereto to be paid out of the first proceeds derived from sale of any property jointly owned by assignor and assignee.\u201d The instrument goes into some detail in regard to the method of operation, not necessary to be stated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\">It is perfectly clear from this agreement that it created a joint working, as well as a joint ownership, partnership between Joiner and Tucker for the purpose of engaging in the business of obtaining leases and producing oil and gas. 32 Tex. Jur., p. 215, sec. 21, pp. 217, 218, sec. 2, p. 227, sec. 8, p. 244 sec. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">For these reasons, it was a <em>mining partnership. </em>29 Tex.

(2d) 1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">All the property of the parnership at the time of its creation stood in the name of Joiner, Trustee, or was owned and controlled by him; but his agreement to hold it for the use and benefit of the partnership was sufficient to create a trust. 26 R. C. L., p. 1182, sec. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">All leases to be acquired after the creation of the partnership were to be taken in the name of \u201cC. M. Joiner, Trustee,\u201d but were to be partnership property. This, of course, created a trust. 42 Tex. Jur., 668, sec. 60; 47 C. J., pp. 757, 758, sec. 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">In the instrument itself, however, Joiner is named as <em>\u201ctrustee\u201d </em>in conformity with the legal effect of the agreement. In fact, it may be said that the partnership agreement between Joiner, Trustee, and Tucker not only named Joiner as Trustee, but declared the terms and purposes of the trust, and by its registration notice was given to all the world that the property comprised was held under the terms of the agreement; and subsequent purchasers could not claim that they took in ignorance of the trust. 42 Tex. Jur., p. 733, sec. 117; Merriman v. Russell, 39 Texas 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>The partnership agreement between Joiner, Trustee, and Tucker was executed on March 29, 1927. One of the additional leases which was secured in the interest of the partnership was that from the Turners to Joiner, Trustee, <em>the identical lease involved in this suit, </em>secured on April 7, 1927. Obviously, under the facts, this lease is within the terms of the working partnership agreement, and Tucker took title to a one-fourth interest therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\">The statute invoked (R. S., Art. 7425a), as giving Joiner, Trustee, plenary power to convey the property of the partnership trust, clearly has no application. The statute in part declares:</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u201cWhere a trust is created, but is not contained or declared in the conveyance to the trustee, * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Here the Joiner-Tucker agreement declares the trust and defines and limits the powers of the trustee. In such case the rule is that the trustee must strictly follow the prescribed mode of exercising his powers. 42 Tex. Jur., p. 718, sec. 104, p. 714, sec. 99; Ryan v. Porter, 61 Texas 106; Bowman v.

Pearson, 109 S. W. 280, 283 (writ refused).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The agreement of Joiner, Trustee, and Tucker in part declares:</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u201cIt is expressly understood and agreed that in the deposition of any of the property, it must be done with the consent of both parties thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">It is obvious that the word \u201cdeposition\u201d used in the quotation, and in the instrument as copied in the statement of facts, is a typographical error for the word \u201cdisposition,\u201d and we are- so treating it. The provision is consistent with the general rule of law that one partner has no implied authority to sell or convey the firm\u2019s real estate, but may with the consent of the other partner convey partnership land. 32 Tex.

Jur., p. 335, sec. 75; authorities <em>supra. </em>But Tucker could not consent, because he had conveyed one-half of his one-fourth interest to Warren, Trustee, for Birdwell and others, (2) (see page 236) by virtue of which, under the law applicable to mining partnerships, Warren, Trustee, had become a partner with Joiner, Trustee, and Tucker in the enterprise.

W. 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">In order that sales of leases might be consummated by Joiner, Trustee, all the interested parties, including Tucker, executed conveyances sufficient to place the whole title in Joiner, Trustee, <em>and to: evidence their consent to sales, </em>before Joiner, Trustee, ever undertook to convey the lease to those through whom defendants in error claim title. For this purpose they executed two instruments, one of which conveyed the title and interests of Tucker and of Sam Warren, as trustee, to Joiner, Trustee; the other ratified Warren\u2019s conveyance, and conveyed the title of those for whose benefit Sam Warren was trustee to Joiner. The first instrument or assignment, \u2014 that executed by W. D.

These two instruments are necessarily in defendants in error\u2019s chain of title, for the reason that but for them Joiner, under the terms of the partnership and trust agreement, as well as the general law of partnership, would have had no authority to execute the conveyances under which the defendants in error claim title to the property in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The effect of the above-described conveyances to Joiner, Trustee, <em>was to put defendants in error upon notice that G.

Jur., p. 486, sec. 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">On July 25, 1930, long before the execution of the conveyance from Joiner, Trustee, through which defendants in error claim title, G. G. Turner and wife executed an oil and gas lease on the property here involved to J. W. Pevey. The lease was properly acknowledged by both lessors on August 2, 1930, filed for record in Rusk County.on August 5th, and duly recorded on August 8, 1930. It is through this conveyance that the plaintiff in error, Gulf Production Company, claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Against the conclusion that this instrument is valid and effective, defendants in error urge the proposition that in May or June, 1930, prior to the execution of the Pevey lease on August 2, 1930, the Turners had abandoned their homestead, and that by reason thereof the Joiner lease became effective as a conveyance by Turner of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The jury found that Turner and wife, prior to August 2, 1930, \u201cmoved away from the land in controversy with no intention of returning and occupying same as their homestead.\u201d In view of the law that an abandonment of the homestead is not accomplished by going away without any intention to return at any particular time, but by going away <em>\u201cwith the definite intention never' </em>io <em>return at all\u201d; </em>and in view of the rule that the homestead claimant may leave the homestead because of the illness of himself or family, and for many other reasons or purposes, including that of acquiring means to improve the homestead, or for the subsistenc\u00e9 of his family, or he may leave with the intent \u201cto abandon provided he can sell,\u201d without an abandonment of his present homestead, it may well be doubted if this finding is sufficient to constitute a legal abandonment of the homestead. 22 Tex. Jur., pp. 71, 72, sec. 46; Foreman v. Meroney, 62 Texas 723, 727; Shepherd v. Cassidy, 20 Tex. Jur., pp. 24, 30; and authorities <em>post. </em>Be that as it may, however, there is not a scintilla of evidence in this record to support the jury\u2019s finding. On the contrary, <em>all </em>the evidence shows that when the Turners, left the premises in controversy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>in May or June, 1930, they left for a short visit to their daughter in Houston, the immediate occasion being a \u201cstroke\u201d suffered by Mrs. Turner; because of which, and Mr. Turner\u2019s feeble condition, they were unable to care for themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\">No oil had been discovered in Rusk County or the East Texas oil field at that time; and the same situation existed on July 25 and August 2, 1930, when they executed the Pevey lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">G. G. Turner, the plaintiff in error, testified by depositions (taken apparently in 1931) that he was taken ill upon his place (the land in controversy) in May (1930) ; that he worked some after he was unable to work, but had not been able to work to amount to anything since that time. <em>He stated that his illness was the occasion for leaving the farm and moving to Houston, because he was not able to work. Referring to the place here involved, the witness testified; That it was his home during all that time; that he was living there in 1927, and that it was still his home. </em>That now he was just living around with his children. He further said that it was the only home he was going to keep, and that if anything happened to any of his children, or if they ever \u201cgot oil out of that country\u201d he was going back; that it was the only home he had.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Mrs. G. G. Turner testified by deposition's (taken apparently in 1931) that she lived in Houston with her daughter, Mrs. Love, and her son-in-law; that she lived with them, in Palestine, until they moved to Houston; that she moved from her old home (in Rusk County) in June, 1930; that the property in controversy <em>\u201cis still our home. It will be until our death I reckon\"; </em>that it was the only home they had; that she was now just living with her children; and that she did not intend to sell their home as long as she lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">John W. Turner, a son of the plaintiffs in error, Mr. and Mrs. Turner, <em>who assisted Cameron, Joiner\u2019s agent, in obtaining a re-acknowledgment of the Turner-Joiner lease, </em>to be later referred to, was called as a witness by the defendants in error, and testified: That his father and mother went to Houston in May or June, 1930; that they were 77 years of age at the time ; that his mother <em>\u201csuffered a stroke\u201d </em>just before they went; that his father\u2019s health at the time, and the general strength of his parents, <em>\u201cwas feeble\u201d; </em>and that all his brothers and sisters had previously married, and all <em>\u201cleft home,\u201d </em>except one of the boys who lived on the place, but not in the house with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>his father and mother. In answer to the question as to why his father and mother left home and went to Houston, he said: <em>\u201cIt was on account of mother\u2019s sickness, she had a stroke and got to where she was not able to wait on herself.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\">John Talley, testifying upon the trial of the case in March, 1932, stated that he was the son-in-law of Mr. and Mrs. Turner, his wife being their daughter, Eunice (deceased at the time the evidence was being given); that in June, 1930, his father-in-law came to Houston, not to live, but to pay a visit; and that he came to stay two weeks. He said: <em>\u201cTo be exact he wrote me a letter and told me that he was coming to&lt; spend two weeks with me; </em>that Mr. and Mrs. Turner came as far as Palestine together from the old place, but Mrs. Turner stopped in Palestine, \u201cbecause she was not able to make the trip,\u201d and Mr. Turner came on to the witness\u2019 house at Houston.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The witness\u2019 wife died in August (1931), and one of the Turner boys, Emmett, took Mr. Turner back to his (Emmett\u2019s) home at Arp; and that Mr. Turner had been at the old place and back to Houston visiting, first one place and then another, among his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The witness said: <em>\u201cMy father-in-law and mother-in-law, they got to where they were not able to stay in the old home a'nd look after themselves after Mrs. Turner had her little stroke. * * Mr. Turner did not come to live with me. He came to pay me a visit, and Mrs. Turner\u2019s health had been bad and is yet to where we thought it was not safe for them to go back to their home.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">This witness testified that Mr. and Mrs. Turner\u2019s home was the old homestead; that they claimed the old home as their homestead; that they still have all of their personal belongings in their old home, including their household furnishings, livestock, and chickens; that they have always called it home and always will; in fact it is their home; and that Mrs. Turner had been back to the old place to visit Bake, a son, who lived there, two or three times since she left it in June, 1930. (All italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Emmett Turner, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Turner, testified that his father and mother claimed the land in controversy as their homestead; that they would both love to live at the old home place if they epuld; that his father has told him that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>telling how many times; that his father had asked him to take him back to the old home several times, and he had carried him back there five or six times in the last six months; that he spends all the way from a week to a month when he goes back; and that he spent two weeks there the preceding January, and a month \u201cup until a few days ago.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\">It is true that Mr. Turner, testifying (by deposition) in 1931, <em>after oil wells had been brought in on his place, </em>stated there were oil wells on the place then, and he did not think he would make it his home any more; that he had no intention of going back there; and that he might go up there, but he could not live there any more. This evidence was given in view of the condition of things at the old home place at the time the witness was testifying, but even then was qualified by the statement, <em>that if anything happened, to his children, or if they got oil out of that country, he would go\u2019 back. </em>In connection with this qualifying statement, the testimony shows that after the death of Mrs. Talley, his daughter, (in August, 1931) with whom he was staying in Houston, <em>he did go back, and has been back many times, staying sometimes as long as a month at the old home place, where his household goods and belongings were. </em>Mrs. Turner, also testifying (by deposition in 1931), <em>after the oil wells came in, </em>said it would be impossible for them to go back to the old home to live; <em>that Mr. Turner\u2019s health was failing faster and faster. </em>But this in turn is qualified by her further statements that the property here in controversy was the only home they had; that now they were just living with their children; but that they had no other home, and did not intend to sell it as long as they were living.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">This testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Turner relates only to the conditions existing, and their own state of mind, approximately a year after they went to Houston, long after the conveyance to Pevey, and does not in the remotest degree refer to the conditions at the time of the execution of the Pevey lease, or their <em>intentions </em>when they left their home for the visit to Houston in June, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In addition to the foregoing testimony, we also note that in the Pevey lease the use of the water wells on the premises was reserved from the grant; that pipe lines were required to be buried below plow depth; that the lessee was prohibited from drilling oil wells nearer than 200 feet of the house or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>barns on the premises, without the written consent of the lessors; and that the lessee should pay for damages caused by oil operations to growing crops. These reservations, or provisions, plainly evidenced the intentions of the lessors to continue to occupy and use the premises for the usual farm and residential purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\">In addition to the above, we direct attention to the fact that the undisputed evidence shows that at all times, from the day they left home in June, 1930, up to the time of the trial in March, 1932, Mr. and Mrs. Turner used the old home in the only way their age and state of health permitted them to use it. They kept all their household goods and effects there, visited the place from time to time, Mr. Turner sometimes staying a month at a time; and we assume they enjoyed the rents and revenues from the home, because nothing appears to the contrary. Under such circumstances, there is no abandonment of the homestead. Foreman v. Meroney, 62 Texas 723, 727; Rawleigh v. Blackwell, 48 S. W. (2d) 754; and authorities <em>post.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">There is not a line in the record which shows the Turners had any intention of abandoning their homestead from the time-they left home, in June, 1930, to the date of the execution of the Pevey lease. <em>They left because they were ill arid feeble, the undisputed evidence shelving, for a temporary visit. It is true Mrs. Turner\u2019s illness from her \u201cstroke\u201d was prolonged some two or three months before she reached Houston, but every moment of her absence, as well as the absence of Mr. Turner, up until the execution of the Pevey lease, was due to the illness or feebleness of one or the other, or of both. There is nothing in the remotest degree that up to that time they had the intention not to return to the old homestead when they could.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The defendants in error, in their brief filed in the Court of Civil Appeals, summarized the evidence as to the occasion and reason for Mr. and Mrs. Turner\u2019s trip to Houston as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u201cThe facts show that in 1930 Mr. and Mrs. Turner were seventy-seven years old. They were feeble from their advanced years. Mr. Turner was no longer physically able to work. Mrs. Turner\u2019s feebleness had brought on a stroke. Their children had married and moved away from the old home and had become scattered. Mrs. Talley, a daughter, had moved to Hous<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>ton; Mrs. Love, another daughter, was living in Palestine; John and Emmet, sons, had acquired farms of their own, and Bake, another son, was living in a separate house on the old Turner place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\">Defendants in error then say, arguendo:</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u201cFeeble and in their advance years, these old people knew that they could no longer live alone on the farm. They would of necessity have to spend their few declining years in the care of their children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">It thus appears that there is a unanimity of conclusion from the evidence that Mr. and Mrs. Turner went to Houston because of illness, and because of their aged and feeble condition\u2014 that in no sense did they <em>voluntarily </em>leave the old home. The statement in the quotation that \u201cthese old people knew that they could no longer live alone on the farm,\u201d is purely argument of counsel. There is no evidence of any character as to what \u201cthese old people\u201d knew.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The homestead provisions of the Texas Constitution were intended to be interpreted and administered in a practicable way. They were formulated by able men, well acquainted with the ordinary conditions of life, who knew men and their wives become aged, infirm, feeble, and ill, and that, as the end nears, they must be nursed and cared for by their children \u2014 or generally were, \u2014 and sometimes, as it were, \u201clive around among the children.\u201d They also knew that when old age and illness come, the preservation of the homestead, with what shelter and sustenance it offers, is more needed than before. Under the homestead provisions of the Constitution and laws of Texas, aged and sick people do not go at their peril to the homes of their children for aid in their feebleness- and distress; these provisions are not so tenuous and frail a shield as that. They were intended to protect the homestead through all the natural vicissitudes of life, including old age, feebleness, and sickness; and during every condition or circumstance that these entail, <em>unless and until the homestead is voluntarily abandoned. </em>A temporary absence, due to these or other like causes, or domestic or financial necessities, or the unfitness of the home for use, does not constitute an abandonment; and to this we may add that if Turner and wife left the old home as defendants in error say, because \u201cfeeble and in their advanced years these old people knew they could no longer live alone on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>farm\u201d and \u201cwould of necessity have to spend their few declining years in care of their children,\u201d there was no <em>voluntary </em>abandonment of the home. An act of <em>necessity </em>is not a <em>voluntary </em>act, <em>and there can be no legal abandonment, unless it is voluntary. </em>22 Tex. Jur., p. 75, sec. 49, p. 76, sec. 50; 29 C.

Farmers, etc. Bank, 148 Pac. 745; authorities <em>post.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\">As said by Chief Justice Hemphill in Shepherd v. Cassidy, just cited:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u201cWe must remember the wise and beneficient purpose of the homestead exemption; that it was intended to secure the peace, repose, independence, and subsistence of citizens and families; that it was placed beyond the reach of creditors, an asylum upon which they might gaze, but which they could neither enter nor disturb; a right so strongly secured, founded upon such high public policy, cannot be lost by the mere absence of the party or family intended to be benefited. The homestead is not to be regarded as a species of prison bounds, which the owner cannot pass over without pains and penalties. <em>His necessities and circumstances may frequently require him to leave his homestead for a greater or less period of time. He may leave on visits of business or pleasure; for the education of his children; or to acquire in some more favorable location, means to improve his homestead; or for the subsistence of his family; of he may intend to abandon, provided he can sell. But let him leave for what purpose he may, or be his intentions what they may, provided they are not those of total relinquishment or abandonment, his right to the exemption cannot be regarded as forfeited.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We quite agree with the opinion of the Commission of Appeals in the case of Foreman v. Meroney, 62 Texas 723, 727, in which it is said:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\n<em>\u201cThe homestead, therefore, is not to be likened to prison bounds, within which the family must always remain, but to a sanctuary, to which they may always return. And an abandonment is accomplished, not by going away without any in-</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b249-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>tention of returning at any particular time in the future, but by going away with the definite intention never to return at all.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.) '</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">The authority just quoted states the correct rule. To constitute an abandonment of a homestead, <em>the claimant must go away with the definite intention not to' return; or, we may add, must form such definite intention after going atony. </em>22 Tex.

There is no evidence whatever to support the jury\u2019s verdict, and it must be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-15\">We are familiar with the rule invoked by defendants in error (22 Tex. Jur., p. 134, sec. 94), but it has no application here, for the reason that up until the execution of the Pevey lease, under which the Gulf Production Company claims, <em>the homesteald had not been abandoned. Until the abandonment takes place, the husband\u2019s deed alone conveys nothing, and cannot be held as a restriction on the right of or as an impediment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-16\">_ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>to the conveyance of the homestead to another in the constitutional and statutory way. </em>Stallings v. Hullum, 89 Texas 431, 35 S. W. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\">Under circumstances not necessary to be detailed here, the Turners re-acknowledged the Joiner-Tucker lease of April 7, 1927, under which defendants in error claim, on October 18, 1930. The Pevey lease had been filed for record and was of record long prior to the date of the re-acknowledgment. The defendants in error were therefore charged with notice of the conveyance to Pevey and his vendees, and can assert no title under the re-acknowledgment lease against them. It is only where intervening rights have not attached that the re-acknowledgement of a defective conveyance may be effective. 1 Tex. Jur., pp. 563, 564, sec. 160; King v. Haley, 75 Texas 163, 12 S.

The judgments against the Gulf Production Company were erroneous, because the title of that company was superior to that claimed by the defendants in error. : ;</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\">The judgments of the District Court and of the, Court of Civil Appeals, in so far as they authorize a recovery in favor of the defendants in error, and against the plaintiffs in error, G. G. Turner and wife, Sina A. Turner, and Gulf Production Company, will be reversed, and judgment rendered that as against said plaintiffs in error, the defendants in error shall take nothing. In other respects, the judgments of both courts will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b251-4\">MARGINAL NOTES REFERRED TO IN OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\"STATE OF TEXAS ) \u201e\u201e</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u201cCOUNTY OF RUSK ) N0' ' \u2022\u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">\u201cFor and in consideration of the sum of One Thousand Dollars, ($1,000.00) to me in hand paid, the receipt of which is hereby duly acknowledged, I, C.
