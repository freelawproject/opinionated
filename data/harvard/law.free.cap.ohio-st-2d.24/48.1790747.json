See 3 Wigmore, Evidence (3 Ed.), 680 and 683, Sections 1013 and 1014. Cf. <em>Mead </em>v. <em>McGraw </em>(1869), 19 Ohio St. 55, the report of which omits the testimony which gave rise to the instruction held to be proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">Although Mary\u2019s testimony concerning her past life suggests a conscious falsity, the biographical facts concerning a period of time totally unconnected with the issues in the case are not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">In his general charge, following the usual instructions on determining the credibility of witnesses, including the language that \u201cyou may disbelieve all of the testimony of a particular witness,\u201d the trial judge referred specifically to plaintiff\u2019s biographical testimony, explained that it was \u201cnot material to any issue of this particular case,\u201d and limited its purpose to the credibility and weight of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>testimony. As a whole, that portion of the charge was nearly tantamount to the refused special instruction and was more than defendant was entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The seeming contradiction between Mary\u2019s testimony as to what caused her fall and how she fell, her reputed statement in the hospital record and her signed statement prepared by the insurance investigator, is also not of a character to require the giving of the <em>falsus in uno </em>instruction. Seemingly contradictory utterances of a witness do not, per se, establish a conscious falsity. 3 Wigmore, Evidence (3 Ed.), 681, Section 1013. Something more must appear which will permit the' jury reasonably to believe that perjury was committed. Annotation, 4 A. L. R. 2d 1077, 1104, Section IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Whether, in this case, plaintiff\u2019s versions of how she fell are contradictory is a matter of interpretation. Viewed at their worst, however, they do not support a conclusion that she perjured herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The trial court\u2019s refusal to give the special instruction was proper. The Court of Appeals, therefore, erred in reversing on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">The Court of Appeals accepted defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court committed prejudicial error when it gave a plaintiff-requested special instruction which placed the burden of proof of the issue of contributory negligence on the defendant without qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">That special instruction read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">\u201cI charge you as a matter of law that contributory negligence is an affirmative defense and therefore the burden of proof as to such a defense is upon the defendant, and it is necessary for the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence two things:</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">\u201cFirst, the defendant must prove that the plaintiff was negligent;</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">\u201cSecond, that such negligence on the part of the plaintiff proximately contributed to the injuries and damages which she sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>\u201cThe failure of the defendant to prove either one of the two elements stated means that any defense of contributory negligence must fail. In other words, even though you might find from the evidence that the plaintiff was herself negligent, yet such finding will not defeat plaintiff\u2019s right to recover unless you further find that such negligence on the part of the plaintiff contributed to her injuries and damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The record indicates that the only place where the issue of contributory negligence could arise was in the plaintiff\u2019s case. The defendant offered no evidence as to the knowledge or acts of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">It is clear then that plaintiff did have the burden to counterbalance any inference of contributory negligence which arose during her case. <em>Ziebro </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 489; <em>Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St. Louis Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Lee </em>(1924), 111 Ohio St. 391. See <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Stanford </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St. 2d 31, 43. For this reason, the trial court should not have given plaintiff\u2019s requested special instruction, which did not qualify the defendant\u2019s burden of proof. <em>Greenawalt </em>v. <em>Yuhas </em>(1947), 83 Ohio App. 426, approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">However, the special instruction in question was erroneous only because it was incomplete. It contained no positive error of law. The jury heard nothing wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Furthermore, the general charge contained a complete and accurate statement of law. It qualified the defendant\u2019s burden of proof by instructing that any inference of contributory negligence arising from plaintiff\u2019s case must be counterbalanced by the plaintiff. We fail to find any prejudice to the defendant requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">The defendant, however, contends that the general charge may not be considered in determining prejudice for the reason that a general charge cannot be utilized to cure error in a special charge, citing <em>Pittsburgh, Cincinnati &amp; St. Louis Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Krouse </em>(1876), 30 Ohio St. 222 (paragraph nine of the syllabus); <em>Wertenberger </em>v. <em>State </em>(1919), 99 Ohio St. 353. See also <em>Washington Fidelity National </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number><em>Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Herbert </em>(1932), 125 Ohio St. 591; <em>Lima Used Car Exchange Co. </em>v. <em>Hemperly </em>(1929), 120 Ohio St. 400. But compare <em>Deckant </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(1951), 155 Ohio St. 498, 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">We do not agree with the contention in this case for the reason that our recent decision in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Flesher </em>(1967), 12 Ohio St. 2d 107, reaffirms the policy of R. O. 2309.59<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that, in order to support the reversal of a judgment, the record must affirmatively show that error intervenes to the prejudice of the party complaining thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\"><em>Smith </em>recognizes that, although an erroneous special instruction cannot he cured by the general charge, no reversal should be granted in the absence of a showing of prejudice. <em>(Id., </em>at 113-14, and the cases there cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The general charge cannot be ignored in determining whether prejudice occurred. As a practical matter, in this case the general charge annulled any prejudice which may have been created by the erroneous special instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Defendant makes two additional objections to the form of the special instruction <em>i. e., </em>that the use of the words \u201cright to recover\u201d in the last paragraph of the instruction assumed, and misled the jury to believe, that the plaintiff had such a right; and, that the last sentence of the instruction misled the jury into believing that it could not find plaintiff\u2019s own negligence to be the sole cause of her injury. :</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The trial court\u2019s acquiesence in the use of the phrase \u201cright to recover\u201d was unfortunate. These words can be misleading. A far more appropriate form of instruction can be found in 1 Ohio Jury Instructions, Contributory Negligence, No. 9.11.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">However, even if it could be argued that the instruction assumed that the plaintiff had the right to recover, the court gave other special instructions which made it clear that the jury knew that the question of the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover was for its determination. See <em>Lackner </em>v. <em>Burns </em>(1964), 175 Ohio St. 469, 473; <em>Centrello </em>v. <em>Basky </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 41, 52. The claim that the jury was led to believe that it could not find that plaintiff\u2019s negligence was the sole cause of her injury is an unrealistic and strained interpretation of the special instruction, which we reject.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The rule of law proposed by defendant is that it had \u201cno legal obligation to a business invitee to remove natural accumulations, of snow and ice\u201d from the parking area which it admittedly owned and controlled. If this were the correct rule, defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict should have been granted. However, as we understand it, its contention before the Court of Appeals was, and here is, that the trial court committed prejudicial error in its general charge on the substantive question of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">In <em>Debie </em>v. <em>Cochran </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St. 2d 38, the defendant was held not liable to a plaintiff-invitee who fell on a natural accumulation of ice and snow on the sidewalk in front of the defendant\u2019s store.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">We bottomed that rule of non-liability of the property owner for the condition of his premises upon his lack of imputed superior knowledge of that condition. To the extent that a business invitee and the owner of the premises have equal knowledge of the usual dangers resulting solely from natural accumulations of ice and snow, the latter cannot be charged with actionable negligence with regard to such dangers.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">However, under the rationale of <em>Debie, </em>the owner of business premises has a duty to remove natural accumulations of ice and snow which he knows, or should know, have \u201ccreated there a condition substantially more dangerous to his business invitees than they should reasonablv have anticipated from their knowledge of weather conditions prevailing generally in the area.\u201d (Paragraph 1 of the syllabus, <em>Debie </em>v. <em>Cochran, supra, 11 </em>Ohio St. 2d 38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The majority opinion by the late Chief Justice Taft in <em>Sidle </em>v. <em>Humphrey </em>(1968), 13 Ohio St. 2d 45, reiterates this view. In <em>Sidle, </em>a newsboy fell on the natural accumulation of ice and snow on the steps of the defendant\u2019s apartment building. The defendant was held not liable upon the theory that the owner of the premises owes the invitee no duty with regard to conditions of the premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>which are obvious and apparent. Natural accumulations of ice and snow, it was said, present obvious dangers from which an invitee can be expected to protect himself. Accord: <em>Jeswald </em>v. <em>Hutt </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St. 2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">However, this is not to say, nor do <em>Jeswald, Sidle, </em>or <em>Debie </em>hold, that there is no duty upon a person in control of business premises to remove a natural accumulation of ice and snow which creates a danger which is not obvious, which an invitee thereto cannot reasonably be expected to know, and of which the owner should have superior knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">A deep hole in a parking lot which is filled or covered, or both, by a natural accumulation of snow constitutes a condition, the existence of which the owner of the premises is bound, in the exercise of reasonable care, to know. He is also bound to know that a natural accumulation of snow which fills or covers the hole is a condition substantially more dangerous than that normally associated with snow. The invitee is not bound to anticipate that condition as an ordinary hazard resulting from the snow. He cannot be expected to protect himself from a danger which he cannot reasonably foresee. Under such circumstances, the owner \u2019s failure to correct the condition constitutes actionable negligence. The rule may be stated as in the fifth paragraph of the syllabus hereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">That being the rule of law which should have been, but was not, imparted to the jury, the question finally arises whether the charge as given, to which defendant merely generally excepted, contained an affirmative misstatement of law, <em>i. e., </em>an error of commission, rather than one of omission. If the former, defendant is entitled to the new trial awarded to it by the Court of Appeals. If the latter, the error, and any prejudicial effect thereof, was waived by the general exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">The cumulative effect of those portions of the general charge which have already been quoted was that the plaintiff might recover if the defendant negligently permitted a dangerous and unsafe condition to exist due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>either </em>to an \u201cimproper accumulation of snow and ice,\u201d <em>or </em>to \u201cmany holes of varying width and length.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The gist of defendant\u2019s quarrel with the charge is that it permitted a finding for plaintiff even though the jury might have found against plaintiff on her claim that a snow-covered hole existed into which she stepped. (Notwithstanding there was solid evidence on behalf of plaintiff that a hole existed and that she stepped into it, defendant\u2019s evidence squarely controverted this, and thus a clear factual dispute existed.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The difficulty with this claim (and the Court of Appeals\u2019 acceptance thereof), which is based on the decisions in <em>Debie, Sidle, </em>and <em>Jeswald, supra, </em>is that here the jury was permitted to find for plaintiff by reason of, <em>not </em>a <em>natural </em>accumulation of snow, but a <em>dangerous </em>condition due to an <em>improper </em>accumulation of snow.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The trial judge admonished that defendant was not an insurer of the safety of the parking area and was not bound to keep it free from every trivial defect. He defined \u201cconditions which would be dangerous\u201d as \u201csuch as might be [sic] reasonably and probably would cause injury to persons using ordinary care walking over it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The real failure of the charge was that an \u201cimproper accumulation\u201d was not defined. In the view of the majority of the court, however, this was an error of omission; serious, indeed, but no more so than if \u201cnegligence\u201d or \u201cproximate cause\u201d had been left undefined.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">The defendant could have requested a further charge. It did not. Had it done so, it would have been entitled substantially to the language set forth in paragraph six of the syllabus hereof which would have required the jury, in unmistakable terms, to find a hazard, in this case the hole, above and beyond the mere accumulation of snow.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">On the other hand, a review of the charge as a whole drives a majority of the court to the conclusion that, on balance, it imparted to the jury the duty of finding the greater hazard and that it would be unreasonable to believe that the jury was actuated into returning its plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>verdict because she slipped on the snow and not because she stepped into a hole underlying the snow.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas on the verdict is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"AO5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b111-7\">Herbert, Duncan and Johnson, JJ., concur.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></judges>\n<judges id=\"b111-8\">O\u2019Neill, C.

Therefore the burden of proving contributory negligence rests upon the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">\u201cHowever, if you find that plaintiff\u2019s evidence gives rise to an inference that his own negligence proximately contributed to his injury then to maintain his cause you must find, considering all the evidence, that such inference is equalled or balanced. If you find that such inference, if any, was not equalled or balanced by all of the evidence, then the plaintiff is contributorily negligent and cannot recover. However, if plaintiff\u2019s evidence does not create an inference of his own negligence or, if it does, and it is balanced by evidence of equal weight, the burden of establishing that the plaintiff was negligent and that such negligence proximately caused his injury remains upon the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">This instruction clearly defines the defendant\u2019s burden of proof and does not assume a \u201cright of recovery\u201d for the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b111-11\">Leach, J., dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"Auq\">As an academic proposition of law, I would agree with paragraph five of the syllabus, which essentially is a rephrasing of paragraph one of the syllabus of <em>Debie </em>v. <em>Cochran </em>Pharmacy-Berwick, <em>Inc. </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St. 2d 38. I also agree that where it is shown that the property owner has \u201csuperior knowledge\u201d of the condition causing the injury, he cannot avoid liability merely because a \u201cnatural accumulation of ice and snow\u201d adds to the existing danger. I further agree that a \u201cdeep hole\u201d in a parking lot, even though partially or even completely filled by a \u201cnatural accumulation of ice and snow,\u201d may continue to present \u201ca condition more dangerous than that normally associated with ice and snow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">Had the jury in this case been instructed within the framework of this principle of law, I would agree that a verdict in favor of plaintiff would rest upon a legally tenable foundation. The jury was not so instructed. Instead, it was instructed that it could return a verdict in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>plaintiff upon a finding that defendant was \u201cnegligent in the maintenance of this parking area in <em>any one </em>or more of the <em>respects claimed </em>by plaintiff in her petition\u201d; that she need not prove \u201ceach of the allegations of negligence set forth in her petition,\u201d but that \u201cit is sufficient for * * * [plaintiff] to recover if you find * * * that * * * [she] was directly and proximately caused injury as the result of <em>any one </em>or more of the <em>allegations </em>of negligence in her petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">There were <em>two </em>\u201callegations of negligence\u201d in plaintiff\u2019s petition. The first made no reference whatsoever to the existence of any hole or holes, but instead was based entirely upon the legal theory that any \u201cimproper accumulation\u201d (leaving entirely to the jury the question of whether any particular accumulation was \u201cimproper\u201d) of snow and ice which is permitted to exist and remain \u201cfor a considerable time after notice\u201d is negligence, supporting a recovery of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">By these instructions, the jury, in effect, was told that even if it concluded that there were no holes in the area (such claim being the basis of the second \u201callegation of negligence\u201d) it nevertheless could return its verdict in favor of plaintiff if it found the accumulation \u201cimproper\u201d and to have remained for a \u201cconsiderable time\u201d after notice. Thus, the jury was permitted to return a verdict in favor of plaintiff based on a theory of law rejected by this court in <em>Debie </em>v. <em>Cochran Pharmacy-Berwick, Inc., supra </em>(11 Ohio St. 2d 38); <em>Sidle </em>v. <em>Humphrey </em>(1968), 13 Ohio St. 2d 45; and <em>Jeswald </em>v. <em>Hutt </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St. 2d 224. We cannot assume that it did not do so merely because there was another possible basis upon which it could base a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">It might be observed that the trial of this cause took place prior to the decisions of this court in Debie, <em>Sidle </em>and <em>Jeswald. </em>The position of counsel for plaintiff was, and to a degree still is, that where the landlord in his lease agreement with his tenants assumes the duty of maintenance, including removal of ice and snow, a business invitee of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>tenant may maintain an action based solely upon failure to so remove such ice and snow. It is claimed that this position is supported by the holding of this court in <em>Oswald </em>v. <em>Jeraj </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 676. There, it was held that a <em>tenant </em>could recover from the landlord damages for her own personal injury due to a slip on ice where the landlord had assumed the duty of maintenance and snow removal. However, as observed in <em>Debie, </em>and as specifically held in <em>Sidle, </em>such retention of control and assumption of duties by the landlord does not create a cause of action in favor of a business invitee of a tenant against the landlord. In my opinion, the jury instruction here authorized the jury to return a verdict based upon such non-existing \u201ccause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The majority opinion, seemingly acknowledging that the action of the trial court in this respect was erroneous, defines it as an \u201cerror of omission.\u201d I do not agree. The specific statement of the court in my opinion was an error of commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In my opinion, therefore, the third reason set forth by the Court of Appeals for reversing and remanding is correct, and I would affirm on such basis and remand the cause for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">I agree that the first reason given by the Court of Appeals for its judgment of reversal was erroneous. My reasoning, however, is different from that stated in the majority opinion. Upon the basis that the testimony was not concerned with a \u201cmaterial fact\u201d or that a \u201cconscious falsity\u201d was not established, the majority reaches the conclusion that the contradictions and alleged contradictions in plaintiff\u2019s testimony were \u201cnot of a character to <em>require </em>the giving\u201d of such instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">By implication, therefore, the majority would seem to accept the proposition that where the <em>court </em>determines, as a matter of <em>fact, </em>that the testimony on a \u201cmaterial issue\u201d is \u201cwillfully false and given with an intention to deceive\u201d a court is then <em>required </em>to instruct the jury in accordance with such a request.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>In my opinion, instructions of this nature should never be required, even where the contradictions involve \u201cmaterial facts\u201d and \u201cwillful falsity.\u201d Such instructions do not involve any \u201crule of law.\u201d <em>Mead </em>v. <em>McGraw </em>(1869), 19 Ohio St. 55. In my view, they serve only to place the court in psychological support of the argument to the jury by counsel attacking or discounting the credibility of the witness upon such basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">I recognize that instructions of this nature have historical roots in the common law\u2014at common law a judge was permitted to \u201ccomment upon the evidence\u201d\u2014and thus in effect aid or guide (but not command) the jury in its factual conclusions, as well as its application of the facts to the law. In states, such as Ohio, where such \u201ccomment upon the evidence\u201d is not permitted, this type of charge nevertheless is sometimes given and left-handedly \u201capproved\u201d on appeal upon the basis that the giving thereof was not \u201cprejudicial.\u201d Such thereafter is submitted to a trial judge as a special instruction under the once prevalent, but now discarded, doctrine that if an instruction <em>could </em>properly be given, a refusal to so charge constituted prejudicial error. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Flesher </em>(1967), 12 Ohio St. 2d 107. In my opinion, exactly that happened here. The Court of Appeals, apparently concluding that the requested charge could have been given, then concluded that it should have been given and that it was prejudicial error not to give it.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">I would make clear that instructions of this nature, although they sometimes may be given without necessarily resulting in prejudice, <em>should </em>not be given, and are never <em>required </em>to be given.</p>\n<judges id=\"b114-7\">O\u2019Neill, C.
