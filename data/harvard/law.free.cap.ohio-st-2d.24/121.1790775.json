Where indigency of a defendant has been recognized at the trial court level, may indigency summarily be denied and the appeal dismissed merely because of the ability of the defendant to pay a small filing fee and without reference to his ability to pay all or a substantial part of the costs and expenses involved in such an appeal? We conclude it may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">The question of appellant\u2019s indigency arose for the first time in the Court of Appeals. As indicated by its judgment entry, the Court of Appeals decided that appellant was not a pauper for the purpose of paying that court\u2019s nominal filing fee, apparently because he had sufficient resources to pay the filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">The Court of Appeals based its dismissal of the appeal <em>solely </em>on appellant\u2019s failure to pay that court\u2019s nominal filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">The motion to dismiss the appeal for failure of appellant to pay <em>this </em>court\u2019s filing fee is overruled; the motion for leave to appeal is allowed; the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed; and the cause is remanded to the Court of Appeals for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b174-12\">O\u2019Neill, C.
