Partlow, </em>v. <em>Columbus </em>[1970], 22 Ohio St. 2d 1), ordering respondents to institute appropriation proceedings to appropriate aerial easements in relator\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-15\">Subsequent to the filing of the motion, and the hearing thereon, on October 19, 1970, the city council appropriated the necessary funds, and, on October 20, 1970, respondents instituted proceedings against the property of all but one of the relators. The city was unable to institute proceedings against that parcel because of lack of an appraisement. The omitted property was occupied by a tenant and the appraiser was unable to obtain access thereto. Relator\u2019s counsel agrees that this is in fact true.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-16\">The respondents now having complied with the order of this court, the motion in contempt is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-17\">Inasmuch as respondents did not comply with this court\u2019s order until after the filing of the motion in contempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>and a hearing thereon, court costs of this proceeding are assessed against respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\n<em>Motion dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b126-6\">O\u2019Neill, C.
