The petitions were dismissed by the trial court, without an oral hearing. However, the court made findings of fact and conclusions of law. Eespondent has filed a motion to dismiss relator\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">Eespondent\u2019s motion to dismiss is sustained for the reason that mandamus does not lie to control judicial discretion, and for the further reason that relator has an adequate legal remedy by way of appeal from the trial court\u2019s decision dismissing the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-14\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b83-15\">O\u2019Neill, C.
