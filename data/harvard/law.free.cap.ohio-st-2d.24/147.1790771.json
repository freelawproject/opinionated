C. 731.4<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; and that where there are no charter provisions the exercise of such power is only as provided for by the General Assembly <em>(Dubyak, supra, </em>paragraph one of the syllabus).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Our decision in <em>Shryock </em>was made within less than three years of the adoption of the constitutional provisions there interpreted. It specifically upheld the constitutionality of statutory exemption of emergency legislation from referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Such a statutory provision, nowR. C. 731.30, specifically exempts three classes of ordinances from the operation of the referendum: (1) Those providing for appropriation for current expense, (2) those providing for street improvements petitioned for by the owners of a majority of the front feet of the property benefited and to be especially assessed for the cost thereof, and (3) emergency ordinances necessary for the immediate preservation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>public peace, health or safety. That statute provides also that whenever the legislative authority is required to pass more than one ordinance or measure to complete the legislation necessary to make and pay for any public improvement, only the first ordinance or other measure required to be passed is subject to referendum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Section <em>Id </em>of Article II of the Ohio Constitution specifically exempts from referendum three classes of laws: (1) those providing for tax levies, (2) appropriations for current expenses of the state government and state institutions, and (3) emergency laws necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">It will be observed that, although Section <em>Id </em>of Article II exempts state laws levying taxes from the referendum, it. C. 731.30 contains no comparable provision as to municipal ordinances. Although it would clearly appear that, by the application of the rationale heretofore referred to, the General Assembly constitutionally could have so provided, it has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">In providing for referendum, however, a municipal charter is not restricted to the adoption of the same provisions enacted by the General Assembly. It may be less restrictive as to use of the referendum, as was the Charter of the city of Toledo which authorized referendum on all ordinances, including one levying a tax passed as an emergency measure. <em>State, ex rel. Snyder, </em>v. <em>Bd. of Elections </em>(1946), 78 Ohio App. 194. It may be more restrictive, as in <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Cleveland, supra </em>(117 Ohio St. 258), where a referendum would have been required under state law, but was not required under the provisions of the Charter of the city of Cleveland.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Section 3.03 of the Charter of the village of Oxford, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>like E. C. 731.30, exempts from the operation of the referendum ordinances (1) providing for appropriation for current expenses, and (2) where an emergency is declared to exist. E. 0. 731.30 exempts ordinances providing for \u201cstreet improvements\u201d petitioned for by the owners of a majority of the front feet of the property benefited, and Section 3.03 of the Charter contains a similar provision as to \u201cpublic improvements.\u201d However, unlike E. C. 731.30, this section of the charter also exempts (4) ordinances providing for \u201craising revenue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">As applied to an ordinance levying a municipal income tax, is such a charter provision constitutional? The test to be applied under <em>Shyroch </em>is whether the exemption from referendum, so provided, complies as to \u201ccharacter\u201d to the exemption contained in Section <em>Id </em>of Article II as to \u201ctax levies.\u201d We conclude that it does, and is, therefore, constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Thus, we hold that a provision of a charter of a municipal corporation that ordinances providing \u201cfor raising revenue * * * shall not be subject to referendum\u201d is constitutional as applied to an ordinance levying a municipal income tax, and where such a charter provision exists, there is no duty on the part of municipal officers to certify such income tax ordinance to a board of elections for referendum vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Eelator contends also that, since Section 3.05 of the Charter of Oxford provides that the initiative and referendum powers \u201cshall be exercised in the manner provided by general law under Sections 731.28 to 731.40 of the Eevised Code, in effect October 18, 1960\u201d (with certain \u25a0stated exceptions not relevant here), any provision of Section 3.03 of the Charter which is in conflict with those sections of the Eevised Code must fail. Eeading Section 3.03 of the Charter <em>m pari materia </em>with Section 3.05, that contention is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b203-9\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Schneider, Herbert, Duncan, Corrigan and Stern, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-9\">R. C. 731.41:</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">\u201cSections 731.28 to 731.41, inclusive, of the Revised Code do not apply to any municipal corporation which adopts its own charter containing an initiative and referendum provision for its own ordinances and Other legislative measures.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b202-9\"> In <em>Schick </em>v. <em>Cincinnati </em>(1927), 116 Ohio St. 16, it was claimed that this limiting of the right of referendum to the first measure of a series and denying the same as to subsequent legislation was in conflict with the referendum provisions of Section <em>If, </em>Article II, OMo Constitution, but the court concluded therein that the question was \u201cpurely a moot one.\u201d By applying the provisions of the statute (then G. C. 4227-3) prohibiting referendum except as to \u201cthe first measure,\u201d its constitutional validity necessarily was upheld in <em>James </em>v. <em>Ketterer, supra </em>(125 Ohio St. 165).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
