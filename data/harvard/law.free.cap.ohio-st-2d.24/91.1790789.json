Petitioner contends that he is being held under excessive bail. He was originally being held on two charges: aiding and abetting in the shooting of a police officer on August 23, 1970, and for shooting with intent to kill on September 1, 1970, when the police attempted to arrest him. The court set bail of $25,000 on each charge. Petitioner has been denied relief in habeas corpus both in the Court of Common Pleas and the federal District Court on the same question.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">The amount of bail in any given case is basically within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Colavecchio </em>v. <em>McGettrick, Sheriff </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St. 2d 290; <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>McGettrick, Sheriff </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St. 2d 177; <em>Bland </em>v. <em>Holden </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St. 2d 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">There are no facts alleged in the instant case which indicate in any way that the bail is excessive, or that the trial judge has abused his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-16\">\n<em>Petitioner remanded to custody.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b143-17\">O\u2019Neill, C.
