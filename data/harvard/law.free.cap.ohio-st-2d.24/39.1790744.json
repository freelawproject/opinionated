It is authorized to do, and does, business in this state as a dealer in intangibles (DIT), as defined in R. C. 5725.01.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As such, it is required to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>return for, collect and remit to the state of Ohio the DIT tax provided for in R. 0. 5725.01 to 5725.26, inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\" For the purposes of this appeal, it is sufficient to say that the burden of the DIT tax falls, not upon HFC itself, but upon its issued and outstanding shares of capital stock; but only to the extent of the fair value of the capital employed (capital stock, surplus and undivided profits) in this state, measured by the ratio which the Ohio gross receipts of HFC bear to its total gross receipts from DIT business. R. C. 5725.15.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Tlie first proposition advanced by HFC in this court is that the DIT tax may not be lawfully or constitutionally assessed against those issued and outstanding shares of capital stock which are owned and held by nonresidents of Ohio, and thus have a \u201csitus\u201d without this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">We reject this proposition for the reason that, as already shown, the tax in question is not imposed upon either the certificates of shares or upon the value of the shares themselves, but the tax is imposed upon the capital represented by the shares to the extent that the capital is employed in Ohio. In other words, if, as in the instant case, only 4.11722% of a DIT\u2019s gross receipts is attributable to Ohio, the basis of the tax upon each issued and outstanding share of the DIT\u2019s stock is 4.11722% of its fair value, as representative of the capital employed in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Moreover, the DIT tax is in lieu of <em>all other taxes </em>on the property and assets of HFC other than its real estate situated in Ohio. R. C. 5725.26.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">HFC contends that <em>Certified Credit Corp. </em>v. <em>Bowers </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 239, is not dispositive of the first question involved in this case, because there appellant was an Ohio corporation with its principal office in this state, whereas here appellant is a foreign corporation. That distinction misses the mark. In <em>Certified </em>Credit, the \u201cresi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>dent\u201d DIT corporation claimed exemption for its shares held by <em>nonresidents of Ohio, </em>which is the same claim that is presented here. That claim was denied, and the DIT tax upon the foreign-held shares was deemed not to contravene the due process or interstate commerce clauses of the Constitution of the United States (paragraph two of the syllabus, 174 Ohio St. 239).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Additionally, two years before <em>Certified Credit Corp., </em>this proposition was settled, albeit <em>sub silento, </em>in <em>National City Bank of Cleveland </em>v. <em>Bowers </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. 378. Two appeals were there involved. In No. 36781, it was held, by a four-to-three decision, that shares of stock of a financial institution owned by foreign insurance companies, domestic insurance companies, resident DITs and <em>nonresident </em>DITs are subject to the financial institution tax, the applicable provisions of which parallel the DIT tax and are imposed by the same chapter of the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Taft, J., in writing the dissent, said \u201cI concur in . . . that part of the judgment in case No. 36781 relating to bank shares owned by nonresidents of Ohio.\u201d Two other judges having joined in Judge Taft\u2019s dissent, that proposition was adopted by a unanimous court.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The second <em>National City Bank </em>case <em>(National City Bank of Cleveland </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>[1968], 15 Ohio St. 2d 235), overruled the first <em>National City Bank </em>case, but only upon the basis of Judge Taft\u2019s dissent therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">This leads us directly to HFC\u2019s second and last proposition of law, namely, that the DIT tax may not lawfully be imposed on those of its issued and outstanding shares which are owned by financial institutions, domestic and foreign insurance companies, and other dealers in intangibles, in view of the second <em>National City Bank </em>case, <em>supra </em>(15 Ohio St. 2d 235).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">We cannot reach the proposition on this record, not merely because HFC did not raise the issue in its application to the Tax Commissioner for review and redetermination or in its notice of appeal to the board (the case was decided subsequent to the later event), but for the more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>important reason that the record does not indicate that the shares, for which exemption from the FIT tax is claimed, are owned by persons who, under the second <em>National City Bank </em>case, <em>supra </em>(15 Ohio St. 2d 235), and the applicable statutes (R. C. 5725.25<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 5725.26), are eligible to claim the exemption, <em>i. e., </em>persons who are engaged as dealers in intangibles, financial institutions or insurance companies in this state, in whole or in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The parallel language of those two statutes, at least as to domestic insurance companies, financial institutions and DITs, is that their \u201creal estate . . . shall be taxed in the place where it is located, the same as the real estate of [other] persons is taxed, but the <em>tax[es] provided for in </em>[by] <em>Sections 5725.01 to 5725.26, inclusive . . . shall be in lieu of all other taxes on the other property and assets of\u201d </em>such entities. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">It seems uncommonly plain, therefore, that before HFC may claim exemption from the tax imposed by R. C. 5725.01 <em>et seq., </em>on those of its issued and outstanding shares which are, in turn, the \u201cother property and assets\u201d of its shareholders who are within the classes named in the quoted statutory language, it is incumbent upon HFC to show affirmatively that each of those shareholders is, in turn, amenable to one of the taxes imposed by R. C. 5725.01 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>All that the record here shows is a proffer by HFO \u201cthat a substantial number of shares of HFC stock is owned by dealers in intangibles, mutual funds, financial institutions, and insurance companies. \u2019 \u2019 Even assuming that mutual funds are DITs, as HFC claims, and accepting the proffer as evidence, we may not assume\u2014nor could the board or the Tax Commissioner assume\u2014that such dealers in intangibles, mutual funds and financial institutions are doing business in Ohio and thus are amenable to R. C. 5725.01 <em>et seq. </em>Neither may we assume that the \u201cinsurance companies\u201d are domestic instead of foreign, or, if foreign, that they are amenable to R. C. 5725.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Finally, the sole issue raised directly upon the filing of HFC\u2019s return (see the last paragraph of R. C. 5725.15 and <em>Wright Aeronautical Corp. </em>v. <em>Glander </em>[1949], 151 Ohio St. 29, construing similar language), although considered by the board and alluded to in both oral argument and the briefs in this court, was not presented to this court as a proposition of law and argued as such. It is therefore deemed to be abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, being neither unreasonable nor unlawful, is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b98-8\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Duncan and Corrigan, JJ., concur.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></judges>\n<judges id=\"b98-9\">Stern and Leach, JJ., not participating.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-11\"> HFC has a number of corporate subsidiaries which are also engaged as dealers in intangibles in Ohio. As the parent corporation, HFC filed a consolidated return for the dealers in intangibles tax year 1966, on behalf of itself and those subsidiaries, as permitted by R. C. 5725.14. HFC also has a number of other corporate subsidiaries which are not engaged in any business defined in R. C. 5725.01 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">No tax was assessed against the shares issued by the subsidiaries of either class which are owned and held <em>by </em>HFC. The only tax involved is that imposed upon the issued and outstanding shares <em>of </em>HFC, as explained in the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">Therefore, we fail to understand the necessity for, or the relevance of, joining any subsidiaries in the appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals, or in this appeal. Consequently, the appellants are referred to in the opinion in the singular, as HFC, which is the sole real party in interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-6\">R.
