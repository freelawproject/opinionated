We think it clear that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">The order directed to Judge Ludeman complied with relator\u2019s specific request. His only request as to action on the part of Judge Wiley was that Wiley be directed to supply a court reporter \u201cuntil such time as one has been appointed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Furthermore, an examination of E. C. 2301.18, along with E. C. 2301.19, discloses that the Common Pleas Court, within the purview of those statutes, appoints but one \u201cofficial shorthand reporter,\u201d and that, \u201cas the business of the court requires,\u201d it may also appoint \u201cassistant shorthand reporters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">The assertion of relator that the modification of the original order by the Court of Appeals on motion of Judge Wiley was \u201cboth illegal and void\u201d because Judge Wiley was represented by private counsel, involving no public expense, is patently without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>The appeal herein is dismissed at the costs of the relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b210-6\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Schneider, Herbert, Duncan, Corrigan, Stern and Leach, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b209-12\">The brief of appellee asserts that since R. C. 2101.01, as amended effective November 19, 1969, provides that \u201cas used in the Revised Code * * * \u2018Probate Judge\u2019 means the judge of the Court of Common Pleas who is judge of the probate division,\u201d it would appear that R. C. 2101.08, providing that the \u201cprobate judge\u201d <em>may </em>appoint, is still in force and effect and that, by virtue of this statute, no <em>mandatory </em>duty exists requiring such appointment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
