Respondent filed a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">In 1966, relator, while represented by retained counsel, pleaded guilty to unlawful entry of a financial institution and shooting with intent to kill. In 1969, relator filed a postconviction remedy petition. The court dismissed the petition and made findings of fact and conclusions of law. The Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">In the instant case, relator alleges in his petition that he sent a second postconviction remedy petition to one of the judges of the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-15\">The state has filed a copy of the Court of Common Pleas docket which shows that relator has no case presently pending therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-16\">Relator is seeking to compel action on a petition which has never been filed. The mere sending of a petition to a judge does not constitute a filing, nor is the judge receiving a petition under a duty to file it.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Before a writ of mandamus will issue, the relator must show a clear legal duty on the respondent to act.
