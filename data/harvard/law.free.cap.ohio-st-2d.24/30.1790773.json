In fact, all of petitioner\u2019s allegations go to his alleged mistreatment in the institution, and on this basis he contends that his convictions are void and that he is entitled to release. None of the petitioner\u2019s allegations affect the validity of his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-15\">Petitioner is presently confined as a result of judgments of conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction which had jurisdiction over his person and the subject matter of the crime. He is not entitled to release.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-16\">\n<em>Petitioner remanded to custody.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b82-17\">O\u2019Neill, O.
