Eespondents demurred to relator\u2019s amended petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Eespondents have jurisdiction over relator\u2019s permit premises. Eelator has available adequate remedies. Prohibition does not lie where there is an adquate remedy in the ordinary course of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The Ohio Eules of Civil Procedure, which became effective July 1, 1970, abolish demurrers and are to govern pending actions, where feasible and no injustice would result. Accordingly, respondents\u2019 demurrer is treated as a motion to dismiss, and the motion is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b91-8\">O\u2019Niell, C.
