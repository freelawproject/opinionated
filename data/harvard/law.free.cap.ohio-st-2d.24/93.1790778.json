It is relator\u2019s contention that such entry should be more specific.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">No such duty is imposed on respondents by R. C. 2505.21 which requires that the reviewing court shall state the errors found in the record and the reasons for its decision. Once the court has so specified it has fulfilled its duty under the statute; it is not required to point out where the record substantiates its decision. It is within the sound discretion of the court as to how comprehensive its findings or decision shall be in relation to the analysis of the facts or law upon which it is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">In respect to relator\u2019s request that the court be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>quired to file a journal entry denying the motion to certify as a conflict case, respondent states that this was done May 19, so this is now moot. The relator also challenges the refusal to certify this cause as a conflict case. Mandamus does not lie to review the refusal of a Court of Appeals to certify a cause as a conflict case. <em>State, ex rel. Wolfe, </em>v. <em>Richards </em>(1933), 127 Ohio St. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Belator argues also that the Court of Appeals should have granted his motion for separate findings of fact and conclusions of law. This is a question that cannot be raised by mandamus; relator has an adequate remedy at law by appeal. <em>State, ex rel. Foreman, </em>v. <em>Common Pleas Court </em>(1965), 1 Ohio St. 2d 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The demurrer to the petition, being now treated as a motion to dismiss under the new Buies of Civil Procedure, is sustained and final judgment is entered for respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b147-8\">0 \u2019Neill, C.
