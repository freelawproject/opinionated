C. 2953.21 <em>et seq. </em>The appellant did not appeal as of right from the judgment of conviction. Each of the matters set forth and argued herein could have been raised at trial or on an appeal as of right. Since they were not, they are <em>res judicata </em>and barred from review. Appellant does not demonstrate that he was unable to raise any of those issues at trial or on direct appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Perry </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St. 2d 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">His attempt to raise these matters by moving the Court of Appeals for leave to perfect a delayed appeal was ineffective since the motion was overruled and no appeal was taken therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Not mentioned in appellant\u2019s postconviction petition, but raised for the first time in this court, is the question of the constitutionality of defendant\u2019s sentence and present confinement in the Ohio Penitentiary. He argues that confinement for more than five years for \u201cstealing less than a dollar\u201d is in contravention of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. R. C. 2901.12, under which appellant was indicted, defines robbery as stealing \u201canything of value by force or violence, or by putting in fear,\u201d and rather than having been convicted for \u201cstealing,\u201d appellant was found guilty of unarmed robbery under R. C. 2901.12 which provides for imprisonment of not less than one nor more than 25 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Although appellant\u2019s sentence is indeterminate, the limits are definite. Constitutionality of the sentence could have been raised at the time of its imposition, or on direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>appeal; therefore, that question is barred from consideration under R. C. 2953.21 <em>et seq. </em>Furthermore, the general rule adopted by this court in <em>McDougle </em>v. <em>Maxwell, Warden </em>(1964), 1 Ohio St. 2d 68, is that if a sentence falls within the terms of a valid statute, it will not amount to a \u201ccruel and unusual punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">In his brief accompanying his motion for leave to appeal to this court, filed by appellant <em>pro se, </em>he claimed denial of a fair trial because of inadequacy of his trial counsel which is tantamount to a denial of his right to counsel in contradiction of Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. Of the number of questions raised in his motion, only that constitutional question can survive the <em>res judicata </em>limitation of review under R. C. 2953.21 <em>et seq. State </em>v. <em>Perry, supra. </em>See <em>Dayton </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St. 2d 125. Notwithstanding that reality, appointed counsel neither briefed nor argued that question in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Although, under R. C. 2505.21, this court may disregard errors not specifically pointed out in the record and separately argued, it <em>may, </em>in appropriate instances, consider errors of record which were not argued. Inasmuch as appellant in his own behalf, by brief, has presented that constitutional question in this court and in the courts below, we will consider that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">In the postconviction proceeding, the trial court found that \u201cthe petitioner [appellant] was fully and fairly represented by his assigned counsel.\u201d The judgment of that court dismissing the petition, having been affirmed by the Court of Appeals, our review of the record provides no basis for a conclusion that such judgment was erroneous. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b172-8\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Schneider, Herbert, Duncan, Krenzler, Stern and Leach, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b172-9\">Krenzler, J., of the Eighth Appellate District, sitting for Corrigan, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
