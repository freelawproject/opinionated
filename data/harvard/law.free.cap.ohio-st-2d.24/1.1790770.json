In oral argument, appellant\u2019s counsel stated that he failed to move for a directed verdict or otherwise move the court for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Additionally, a special instruction, requested by appellant and given by the court, contains the principle of law which appellant now asserts to be erroneous. Although we are sensitive to the fact that trial tactics often change during the course of the trial, a trial court cannot be placed in a position of having to choose between a party\u2019s inconsistent positions. If the reason for this change in plaintiff\u2019s position was shown in the record, and the request for the instruction withdrawn, perhaps a reviewing court would know which path the litigant elected to follow. Plaintiff\u2019s mere exceptance to his own requested instruction does not remove the badge of inducement which served to precipitate the error. R. C. 2321.03 provides, in part, that \u201cerror can be predicated upon erroneous statements contained in the charge, not induced by the complaining party * * See <em>Carrothers </em>v. <em>Hunter </em>(1970), 23 Ohio St. 2d 99; <em>Rhoades </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 107; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tudor </em>(1950), 154 Ohio St. 249. Under the circumstances, appellant\u2019s request for the instruction amounts to an inducement by appellant to the court to make the charge complained of, foreclosing appellate review of the assigned error.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b55-8\">Schneider, Acting C.
