We reverse the June 13, 2007 order awarding counsel fees and the February 13, 2008 order directing reimbursement of the expert\u2019s trial preparation fee, but otherwise affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Plaintiff and defendant, who are originally from Greece, are both naturalized United States citizens. They married in 1991 in New Jersey and resided in Boonton. They have three children, two of whom were born in New Jersey: A.A., a son, born March 25, 1992, and S.A., a daughter, born July 22, 1993. Their last child, P.A., a son, was born in Greece on July 1, 2000. In 1995, the parties returned to live in Greece where plaintiff pursued a business enterprise with a Mend that involved exporting American products to Greece. After a couple of years, the business venture proved unsuccessful, but the parties and their children remained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>in Greece. Defendant secured full-time employment with the Greek government, for whom she had previously worked. According to plaintiff, in July 2003, based upon an agreement reached by both plaintiff and defendant that the family should return to the United States, he and their two sons, A.A. and P.A., returned to Boonton with the expectation that defendant would eventually join them with their daughter. According to defendant, however, no such agreement had ever been reached. Rather, plaintiff led her to believe that he was only returning to New Jersey for a visit, as he had done in the past, because his parents were there and also for business reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">After it became clear to defendant, during a telephone conversation with plaintiff, that he was not returning, defendant filed an application on October 31, 2003, before the First Instance Court seeking temporary custody of all three children.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On December 1, 2003, defendant filed a criminal complaint with the District Attorney of the Magistrate\u2019s Court of Athens alleging that plaintiff had abducted her two children, was illegally detaining them and threatening to do likewise with respect to their daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">A hearing was conducted by the First Instance Court on March 31, 2004. Neither party personally appeared, but were represented at the proceeding by a designated representative. Two witnesses allegedly testified at this proceeding. Defendant submitted an affidavit in support of her application. On April 22, 2004, the Greek court entered an order granting temporary custody to defendant. The court\u2019s written decision, incorporated in the order, references its consideration of \u201cthe opposing partyfs] affidavit!.]\u201d However, plaintiff denies ever submitting a sworn statement in connection with this particular proceeding. The court found that the parties had not reached an agreement that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>would return to Boonton, New Jersey, and that Boonton had \u201cminimum [G]reek families and has no Greek school. Thus[,] the children are forced to attend an American school.\u201d The court also concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">[T]here are no individuals to take care of the children, since the defendant works, his parents are overage and furthermore must also take care the three minor children of his sister who died. On the contrary, the applicant is a capable mother, her parents as well as her sister assist her for [sic] the children\u2019s caret] Subsequently [sic] she is the most appropriate person to take care the children. Moreover, they must continue [t]heir studies at a Greek school as attended also during previous years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Defendant claims the order granting her temporary custody of the children was served upon plaintiff in Boonton on December 29, 2004. Plaintiff denies that he was ever served with the order. On May 10, 2004, defendant filed a complaint in the First Instance Court for divorce and custody of the three minor children. Then, on February 25, 2005, defendant commenced an action under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Hague Convention \u2014 International Child Abduction) in federal district court in New Jersey.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">On August 14, 2006, plaintiff filed a verified complaint for divorce and, in the complaint, also sought custody of the three children born of the marriage. Defendant claimed that the following month, on September 4, 2006, plaintiff was served with a copy of the divorce complaint that had been filed in Greece two years earlier. Defendant also contended that plaintiff had been served with a copy of the divorce complaint in December 2004. Plaintiff denied ever being served with a divorce complaint. On December 8, 2006, in accordance with the Hague Convention for Service Abroad of Judicial or Extrajudicial Documents in Civil and Commercial Matters, Nov. 15, 1965, 20 <em>U.S.T. </em>361, <em>T.I.A.S. </em>No. 6638, defendant was served in Greece with a copy of plaintiff\u2019s New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Jersey\u2019s summons and complaint for divorce, custody, child support, equitable distribution, counsel fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">On January 5, 2007, defendant filed a Notice of Limited Appearance, seeking a stay of plaintiffs divorce complaint and the dismissal of plaintiffs custody application. On March 23, 2007, the court denied defendant\u2019s motion, finding that it had subject matter and personal jurisdiction over the divorce action which would proceed concurrently with the Hague Convention \u2014 International Child Custody action that was pending in federal district court. On May 25, 2007, the court denied reconsideration of the March 23, 2007 order and reserved decision on plaintiffs cross-motion for counsel fees pending resubmission and an updated certification. The court found that defendant \u201cwaived any further objections to the exercise of jurisdiction, sufficiency of service or joinder of parties, pursuant to <em>[Rul\u00e9] </em>4:6-3, <em>[Rul\u00e9] </em>4:6-6 and <em>[Rul\u00e9] </em>4:6-7.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AX\">On June 13, 2007, the court entered two orders. The first, a consent order, allowed plaintiff to withdraw his April 5, 2007 request to enter default, permitted the court to \u201chave jurisdiction to enter a judgment as to marital status of the parties only[,]\u201d and allowed defendant to file a responsive pleading to plaintiffs \u201cpending Complaint for Divorce within ten (10) days.\u201d In the second order, the court awarded counsel fees to plaintiff totaling $8,500. In a statement of reasons included in that order, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5j\">The decision of May 25, 2007 was an affirmation of the prior decision and it denied defendant's application for reconsideration. The Court applied the principles set forth in [Rule] 5:3-5(c); particularly, (3) the reasonableness and good faith of the positions advanced by the parties and (7) results obtained. The issues are complex as there are three parallel litigations, in Greece, in Federal Court and in this Court. The Court has reviewed the Affidavit of Services and concludes that $7,500.00 is reasonable and appropriate for the firm of Paras, Apy <em>&amp; </em>Reiss, P.C. This firm assumed the primary burden of addressing the international issues and those issues relating to the three separate courts. The firm of Arons &amp; Solomon, P.A., as principal counsel, undertook some efforts in assistance of co-counsel. The Court has specifically not awarded fees to both firms for their appearance in Court as that would be duplicative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">A final judgment of divorce (FJOD) was entered on July 3, 2007. The FJOD expressly incorporated the Greek divorce judgment that the court acknowledged had been entered in Greece on March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>25, 2007 and stated that all other issues between the parties \u201cremain[ed] unresolved and subject to adjudication of this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">On December 3, 2007, defendant filed a notice of motion seeking to register and enforce the April 22, 2004 Greek custody order, and also seeking the entry of a declaratory order granting custody of all three children to her.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On December 21, 2007, plaintiff served a subpoena upon Dr. Ryan-Montgomery to appear as an expert witness at the New Jersey custody trial, which was scheduled for January 14, 2008. A check in the amount of $900 was issued to reserve Dr. Ryan-Montgomery\u2019s time to appear at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Trial commenced on January 15, 2008. The court first addressed defendant\u2019s motion to register and enforce the temporary custody order issued by the Greek court. Defendant argued that under principles of comity, the court was obliged to defer to the earlier Greek order because plaintiff had voluntarily submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the Greek court and had filed a counter application for custody. The court disagreed and found that because the record of the Greek proceedings was so lacking in factual findings, the court was not required to defer to the earlier decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Just before testimony commenced, the court confirmed that the parties had reached an agreement on the issue of custody as to their son, A.A., and their daughter, S.A., and that the court was being asked to only decide the issue of custody as it related to their son, P.A. Plaintiff testified and produced three witnesses on his behalf. Defense counsel stipulated to the admissibility of the custody evaluation report prepared by plaintiffs expert, Dr. Ryan-Montgomery, in lieu of her testimony. The report cards for the parties\u2019 two sons were admitted as joint exhibits. Defendant did not appear for the trial, nor did she produce any witnesses on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>her behalf or introduce any exhibits. Defense counsel, however, cross-examined the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">In summation, defense counsel indicated that in view of the court\u2019s decision denying defendant\u2019s motion to register and enforce the Greek temporary custody order and the evidence plaintiff presented, defense counsel expected that custody would be awarded to plaintiff and therefore focused his argument on whether counsel fees should be awarded. He argued that defendant\u2019s actions during the course of the litigation were motivated by good faith and that ultimately the stay of the divorce proceedings that defendant sought, which the court initially denied, was granted when the parties received a trial date on the federal action. Defense counsel further argued that throughout the course of the proceedings, the court never ruled on the validity of the Greek order granting temporary custody. Additionally, defense counsel maintained that the motion for reconsideration was filed in good faith because there in fact had been a mistake, namely, the court, during the March 23, 2007 oral argument, remarked that there was no proof that plaintiff had been served with the divorce complaint, when in fact there was proof of service in the court\u2019s file and his file that both he and the court had apparently overlooked. Finally, defense counsel argued that the economic positions of the parties were both \u201cexactly the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Plaintiffs counsel\u2019s summation addressed both custody and counsel fees. She argued that the proofs presented on plaintiffs behalf addressed all of the statutory factors, set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-4(c), which guide courts in custody determinations, and plaintiff had demonstrated the best interest of P.A was that custody be awarded to plaintiff. On the question of counsel fees, plaintiffs counsel argued that plaintiffs income was nominal, defendant\u2019s attorney refused to accept service of the divorce complaint, defendant had not yet paid the pendente lite counsel fee award ordered in June 2007, and plaintiff was required to pay a trial preparation fee for Dr. Ryan-Montgomery, only to be told on the day of trial that there was no objection to the introduction of the report in lieu <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>of her testimony. Plaintiffs counsel also argued that defendant took unreasonable positions during the course of the litigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">[Defendant] has simultaneously appeared through counsel, argued her case, and objected to jurisdiction---- [Plaintiff] has been required to pay for appearances at motions, early settlement panels, case management conferences, and trial, none of which [defendant] has appeared at.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABf\">[Defendant] through counsel agreed to attend mediation. That was an agreement that was done with the assistance of the Court. My office spent a considerable amount of time searching for a Greek \u2014 speaking mediator and speaking for a\u2014 and looking for a Greek-speaking therapist for the children because we were going to try to tie the mediation and the therapy together. And then it didn\u2019t happen. She wasn\u2019t coming.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">At the conclusion of summations, the court directed an inquiry to plaintiffs counsel: \u201cYou\u2019re asking for two things, the custody decision and the fees. Is that correct?\u201d It was at that time that plaintiffs counsel advised the court, \u2018Well, I\u2019m also asking for Your Honor to address equitable distribution.\u201d She advised the court that she was holding approximately $81,000 in her trust account, which represented proceeds from the sale of the former marital home. During the trial, plaintiff testified that the house was a premarital asset and no marital funds were used to maintain it. Defense counsel argued that the increased value of the home as of the date the parties married was subject to equitable distribution. Plaintiffs counsel disputed this position. The court made no findings at that time on the issue of equitable distribution, but did render its oral decision awarding sole legal and physical custody to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Although defense counsel presented no proofs in support of defendant\u2019s counterclaim for custody of P.A., the court expressly recognized its obligation to render a decision in the \u201cbest interest of the child.\u201d The court explained that before rendering its decision, it was obliged \u201cto view all the facts and make a clear decision regardless of whether both sides are represented, by represented I mean present testimony, or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">The court initially determined that it was not necessary that it conduct an interview with P.A. before reaching its decision because Dr. Ryan-Montgomery had interviewed both boys and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>results of those interviews were included in her report, which was introduced into evidence, without objection, in lieu of her testimony. Both boys expressed their strong preference to remain with their father and each other, in the United States, without being pressured by their mother to return to Greece.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The court then considered the relevant statutory factors set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-4(c). The court found that both parents were fit and expressed their desire to be awarded custody of P.A. However, given their geographic locations and the refusal of plaintiff to allow A.A. and P.A. to travel to Greece and defendant\u2019s refusal to permit S.A. to travel to Boonton, the court determined that it could not expect any cooperation between the parents in making decisions related to P.A.\u2019s well-being. The court concluded that for the past five years, plaintiff and his sons had been living in New Jersey, and plaintiff had provided a stable home environment, which also included his elderly parents with whom both boys enjoyed a close relationship. The court also observed that during the time the entire family lived in Greece, plaintiff had been the primary caretaker for all three children.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The court considered Dr. Ryan-Montgomery\u2019s findings that the boys were thriving in their current environment and were successful students. The court also referenced plaintiffs testimony that both boys were involved in extracurricular activities, including music and sports. The court found the school records that were admitted as joint exhibits confirmed Dr. Ryan-Montgomery\u2019s findings and plaintiffs testimony that both boys were doing extremely well.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The court expressed that it had no idea how defendant planned to meet P.A.\u2019s emotional, physical, or educational needs since \u201c[sjhe\u2019s chosen not to come here even though she\u2019s aware of the proceedings and has participated through counsel.\u201d While the court was confident plaintiff could meet P.A.\u2019s needs, it found that defendant had failed to demonstrate \u201ceither [an] ability or willingness to co-parent. She has simply stayed in Greece and objected to the kids being here.\u201d The court was therefore satisfied that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>awarding sole legal and physical custody to plaintiff was in P.A.\u2019s best interest. On February 5, 2008, the court entered an order awarding custody of P.A. to plaintiff and releasing the $81,000 being held in escrow to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In an order dated February 13, 2008, the court directed defendant to reimburse plaintiff for Dr. Ryan-Montgomery\u2019s $900 trial preparation fee and awarded plaintiff $2,500 in counsel fees. In the statement of reasons incorporated in the order, the court found that had defense counsel advised his adversary and the court within a reasonable period of time that he would not object to the admissibility of Dr. Ryan-Montgomery\u2019s report in lieu of her appearance, plaintiff would not have incurred this cost and the court would not have had to \u201cset aside as much time for trial as it had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">As to counsel fees, the court found that defendant failed to proceed in good faith regarding her claimed entitlement to equitable distribution of the $81,000 because she failed to submit a ease information statement, failed to appear at trial to provide testimony and otherwise failed to present any evidence to dispute this claim. The judge concluded that \u201c[djefendant simply required plaintiff to present its proofs and the Court to spend its time and efforts reaching a decision which was inevitable.\u201d The court viewed defendant\u2019s conduct during the course of the litigation as unreasonable and as a justification for the award of the $2,500 in counsel fees. The present appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">On appeal, defendant raises the following points for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">THE SUPERIOR COURT ERRED BY REFUSING TO DEFER THE JURISDICTION OF THIS MATTER TO THE REPUBLIC OF GREECE AND ENFORCE THE RULINGS OF THE COURTS OF THE REPUBLIC OF GREECE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">A. REPUBLIC OF GREECE HAS PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION TO DETERMINE [THE] CUSTODY OF [P.A.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-12\">B. THE RULINGS OF THE COURTS OF THE REPUBLIC OF GREECE DO NOT OFFEND PUBLIC POLICIES OF NEW JERSEY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">THE SUPERIOR COURT ERRED IN AWARDING COUNSEL FEES TO PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE BECAUSE PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-23 AND THEREFORE THE AWARD OF COUNSEL FEES SHOULD BE REVERSED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">A. THE SUPERIOR COURT FAILED TO PROPERLY CONSIDER THE FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARTIES WHEN AWARDING COUNSEL FEES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">B. THE SUPERIOR COURT FAILED TO PROPERLY CONSIDER THE BAD FAITH STANDARD WHEN AWARDING COUNSEL FEES.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">Under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-53 to -95<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (the Act), a New Jersey court has jurisdiction to make an initial custody determination only if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-13\">(1) this State is the home state of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-14\">(2) a court of another state does not have jurisdiction under paragraph (1) of this subsection ... and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-15\">(a) ... the child and at least one parent or a person acting as a parent have a significant connection with this State other than mere physical presence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-16\">(b) substantial evidence is available in this State concerning the child\u2019s care, protection, training and personal relationships;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-17\">b. Subsection a. of this section is the exclusive jurisdictional basis for making a child custody determination by a court of this State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-18\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-65(a)(1)-(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-19\">The Act also expressly provides that the term \u201cstate\u201d used in the Act includes foreign nations. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-57(a). New Jersey courts are to give full faith and credit to child custody orders issued from foreign nations except when \u201cthe child custody law of a foreign country violates fundamental principles of human rights or does not base custody decisions on evaluation of the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-57(c). <em>See VanHaren v. VanHaren, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>12, 22-23, 407 A.2d 1242 (App.Div. 1979) (declining to enforce a South Carolina order awarding a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>father permanent custody of his children because awarding permanent custody to mother was in the children\u2019s best interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Here, there was never any dispute that at the time plaintiff filed the divorce action in September 2006, the court had jurisdiction to make an initial custody determination because P.A. had been living in Boonton with plaintiff and his brother for the past three years. On the other hand, it is equally undisputed that at the time defendant sought temporary custody of P.A., along with the two other children, in the Greek court, P.A. had been residing in Greece continuously for the past eight years except for the three months that preceded the filing of the emergency application for temporary custody. In deciding it had jurisdiction to consider the custody dispute, the trial judge never resolved whether plaintiff had notice of the Greek custody proceeding, whether he had voluntarily subjected himself to the jurisdiction of the Greek court and filed a counter application for custody. Rather, the judge concluded that without a sufficient factual record by which to determine how the Greek court reached its decision and what factors it considered, the court could not determine whether the proceeding comported with fundamental principles of human rights or included an evaluation of the best interest of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">In <em>Sensient Colors v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>373, 386, 939 A.2d 767 (2008), the Court reiterated-that \u201cNew Jersey has long adhered to \u2018the general rule that the court which first acquires jurisdiction has precedence in the absence of special equities.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Yancoskie v. Del. River Port Auth., </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>321, 324, 395 A.2d 192 (1978)). Thus, the question here is not whether the trial court, under the Act, had the power to exercise jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 custody dispute, but whether the court should have restrained itself in view of the prior order issued by the Greek court.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Application of the first-filed doctrine is not inflexible and, in appropriate circumstances, may yield to \u201cspecial equities\u201d if application of the doctrine \u201cwould contravene the public or judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>policy of the forum state.\u201d <em>City of Philadelphia v. Austin, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>55, 64, 429 A.2d 568 (1981). <em>See also Gosschalk v. Gosschalk, </em>48 <em>N.J.Super. </em>566, 579, 138 A.2d 774 (App.Div.) (noting that a trial court is not under any \u201ccompulsory duty ... to stay a proceeding pending before it\u201d because a similar cause of action was first instituted elsewhere), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>73, 145 A.2d 327 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-4(c) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">In making an award of custody, the court shall consider but not be limited to the following factors: the parents\u2019 ability to agree, communicate and cooperate in matters relating to the child; the parents\u2019 willingness to accept custody and any history of unwillingness to allow visitation not based on substantiated abuse; the interaction and relationship of the child with its parents and siblings; the history of domestic violence, if any; the safety of the child and the safety of either parent from physical abuse by the other parent; the preference of the child when of sufficient age and capacity to reason so as to form an intelligent decision; the needs of the child; the stability of the home environment offered; the quality and continuity of the child\u2019s education; the fitness of the parents; the geographical proximity of the parents\u2019 homes; the extent and quality of the time spent with the child prior to or subsequent to the separ-ation; the parents\u2019 employment responsibilities; and the age and number of the children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>9:2\u20144(c).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">A trial court must not only consider these statutory factors before making a custody determination but must also make a record referencing the statutory factors it has considered and the reasons for its custody determination. <em>Gubernat v. Deremer, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>120, 139, 657 A.2d 856 (1995) (citing <em>In re Baby M., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>396, 453 n. 17, 537 A.2d 1227 (1988)). Superimposed upon the consideration of these factors is the ultimate determination that the custody decision reached by the court be guided by the \u201cbest-interest-of-the-child\u201d standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">The \u201cbest-interest-of-the-ehild\u201d standard is more than a statement of the primary criterion for decision or the factors to be considered; it is an expression of the court\u2019s special responsibility to safeguard the interests of the child at the center of a custody dispute because the child cannot be presumed to be protected by the adversarial process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\"><em>[Kinsella v. Kinsella, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>276, 317-18, 696 A.2d 556 (1997).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Here, the Greek proceeding arose from an emergent application. In its written decision granting defendant temporary custody, the Greek court referenced the fact that Boonton had \u201cmini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>mum [GJreek families and has no Greek school[,J\u201d the children were forced to attend American schools, there was no one to take care of the children, the plaintiff worked and his parents were too old to take care of the children. The decision described defendant as a \u201ccapable mother,\u201d noted that her parents and her sister assisted her with her child care needs, and that the children could continue with their Greek studies as they had done in the past. Assuming that these findings represent the Greek equivalent of a \u201cbest-interest-of-the-child\u201d determination, they fall woefully short of the factors our Legislature has mandated that New Jersey courts consider in making custody determinations. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>9:2 \u2014 4(c). Moreover, what evidence was submitted, the reliability of that evidence, and how the Greek court evaluated the evidence in reaching its conclusions is not set forth in the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Further, the decision of the Multi-Member First Instance Court of Athens issued March 27, 2007, granting a judgment of divorce by default, did not address child custody, despite the fact that defendant sought a determination of this issue in her petition. Rather, the court \u201caccepted] the complaint of [defendant,]\u201d ordered that the \u201cmarriage of the litigants is untied,\u201d and imposed \u201con the defendant the legal fees of the claimant[.]\u201d Thus, no final determination of custody was ever reached by the Greek court.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In our view, the absence of a permanent custody determination by the Greek court and the absence of any record of the Greek court\u2019s consideration of the statutory factors, as outlined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-4(e), when it rendered its temporary custody decision, contravenes the public policy of this state to safeguard the interests of children who are at the center of a custody dispute. <em>Ibid. </em>We are not unmindful, and apparently nor was the trial court, that the record suggests that plaintiff may have engaged in forum shopping. Nonetheless, the overriding objective of the court must be \u201cthe best interests of the child.\u201d Here, this consideration and the absence of a thorough record of the Greek proceeding led the trial court to properly conclude no deference should be accorded to the Greek custody determination. We are satisfied that \u201cspe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>cial equities\u201d militated against according deference to the temporary custody determination by the Greek court. <em>City of Philadelphia v.

We reverse that part of the June 13, 2007 order awarding counsel fees in connection with defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s March 23, 2007 order denying defendant\u2019s motion to stay the divorce complaint and to dismiss plaintiffs custody application and that part of the February 13, 2008 order directing defendant to reimburse plaintiff for the $900 expert trial preparation fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-7\"> Defendant has not briefed her appeal of the trial court's orders concerning equitable distribution and change of the children's surnames. We therefore deem these issues waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b162-8\"> Part II of our opinion, addressing counsel fees and reimbursement of the expert\u2019s trial preparation fee, does not warrant publication and therefore has been omitted from the published version. <em>See R. </em>1:36 \u2014 2(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\"> During the course of the New Jersey litigation, plaintiff claimed that he was unaware of the nature of the legal proceeding before the First Instance Court and simply asked his accountant to look into the matter.
