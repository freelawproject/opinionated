Both orders were entered after extended plenary hearings. After careful consideration of the cross-appeals, we modify the orders under appeal to the extent that defendant may seek an alimony award if and when he can demonstrate substantially changed circumstances. The remainder of the prenuptial agreement remains in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">We briefly summarize the facts relevant to this appeal. The parties married on May 16, 1981. At the time of the marriage, plaintiff had graduated from Princeton University and during the marriage she obtained an MBA degree from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. Defendant had a high school education and was employed by the United States Postal Service (Postal Service) at the time of the marriage. He obtained an associate science degree in physics over a period of nine years during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">During their twenty-four-year marriage, they had four children, all now emancipated. Shortly before the marriage, they executed a prenuptial agreement (agreement) on May 12, 1981. Their statements of financial condition were appended to the agreement. On June 19, 1987, defendant signed a declaration in which he acknowledged that he was \u201cfamiliar with the estate plan adopted by\u201d plaintiff and accepted \u201cthe provisions\u201d made for him under both the estate plan and the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">From 1977 to 1989, defendant was employed by the Postal Service. In 1990, he left the Postal Service and took a position as a machine operator in plaintiffs father\u2019s company, Micro-Tek Corp. (Micro-Tek). Micro-Tek is a small, technical manufacture<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>ing company specializing in drawing, stranding and insulating wires.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In January 2002, plaintiff purchased Micro-Tek from her father and defendant served as \u201cplant supervisor\u201d from January 2003 until September 2005. In 2005, defendant\u2019s gross income from Micro-Tek was $63,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">On September 2, 2005, plaintiff filed the complaint for divorce and enforcement of the agreement. Thereafter, defendant\u2019s position was changed from a salaried plant supervisor to an hourly machine operator paid at the rate of $32 per hour. Plaintiffs father assumed the job of plant supervisor until his retirement in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Notwithstanding the pending divorce, the parties continued to live in the same house until December 1, 2006, when defendant was removed by a court order after the court determined that it was in the best interest of the parties\u2019 youngest daughter. Defendant\u2019s removal was not based on any allegations of domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Defendant sought to have the trial court find enforcement of the agreement unconscionable because of the substantial change in his circumstances. According to defendant, the changed circumstances included allegations that (1) defendant had become an at-will employee of plaintiffs company and feared he would be fired upon conclusion of the divorce; (2) he is not qualified to find similar supervisory employment at his $63,000 salary because his work experience is specialized to plaintiffs business and he has limited education; (3) he contributed his \u201centire paycheck\u201d to the family, but has never controlled any of the family\u2019s finances by paying bills, making real estate decisions, paying taxes, planning vacations, paying for schooling costs, insurance, and vehicles; (4) plaintiff has not disclosed the value of her assets, or her true net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>worth, and defendant is not privy to her records because plaintiff has claimed that a majority of her assets were exempt from disclosure; and (5) plaintiff earns $578,000 while defendant currently earns $63,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Defendant argued before the trial court that the agreement should not be enforced because to do so would (1) deny defendant equitable distribution of any asset in plaintiff\u2019s name to which he contributed during the marriage; (2) leave defendant with assets only in his name, which pale in comparison to the value of assets in plaintiffs name; and (3) deny defendant alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">On February 7, 2007, the trial court began a four-day plenary hearing to determine whether enforcing the agreement would be unconscionable. The trial court rendered a decision on the record and entered an order on July 16, 2007. The court found that enforcement of the agreement would be unconscionable because \u201cit would result in the [djefendant maintaining a standard of living far below that which was enjoyed during marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Plaintiff moved for reconsideration and on October 19, 2007, after further plenary hearings, the motion was denied. The parties cross-moved for leave to file interlocutory appeals and we granted the motions on November 30,2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">In this appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred (1) in finding that unconseionability of the pre-Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> agreement should be determined at the time of enforcement rather than at the time of execution; (2) in the application of the unconseionability standard; (3) in failing to consider defendant\u2019s pre-marital lifestyle as a factor in its unconseionability determination; (4) in not determining marital lifestyle; (5) in finding that defendant would be fired from plaintiffs company once the final judgment of divorce was entered, that defendant would be unable to secure adequate subsequent employment, and that his projected post-divorce annu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>al budget would be $49,890; and (6) in improperly considering facts not in evidence to arrive at its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Defendant contends in his cross-appeal that the trial court erred in failing to include a savings component and only included a small retirement component in its analysis of defendant\u2019s post-divorce lifestyle.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">New Jersey adopted the Uniform Pre-Marital Agreement Act (the Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>87:2-31 to -41, in 1988. The Act expressly applies to agreements \u201cexecuted on or after\u201d the effective date of the Act and does not, therefore, apply to the parties\u2019 1981 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">In <em>Marschall v. Marschall, 195 N.J.Super. </em>16, 477 A.2d <em>833 </em>(Ch.Div.1984), the court distilled the prior ease law and held definitively that prenuptial agreements were valid and enforceable and that \u201c[s]uch agreements, subject to [certain] conditions ... should be welcomed and encouraged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28, 477 A.2d 833. The court indicated that principles governing property settlement agreements \u201cshould be viewed as equally applicable to antenuptual agreements governing those same issues.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Petersen v. Petersen, 85 N.J. </em>638, 645-46, 428 A.2d 1301 (1981)). The \u201cconditions\u201d under which prenuptial agreements would be deemed valid and enforceable evolved into a three prong test: (1) that there be \u201cfull disclosure by each party as to his or her financial conditions;\u201d (2) that the party sought to be bound by the agreement understood and accepted the terms and conditions of the agreement; and (3) that the agreement be fair and not unconscionable, that is, that the agreement will not \u201cleave a spouse a public charge or close to it, or ... provide a standard of living far below that which was enjoyed both before and during the marriage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29-31, 477 A.2d 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">We approved the Chancery Division\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive exposition and analysis\u201d in <em>D\u2019Onofrio v. D\u2019Onofrio, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>361, 366, 491 A.2d 752 (App.Div.1985). There, we indicated that alimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>ny provisions in prenuptial agreements need not \u201ccover all eventualities, since upon changes in circumstances a spouse may apply to the court for an appropriate modification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369-70, 491 A.2d 752 (citing <em>Lepis v. Lepis, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>139, 158, 416 A.2d 45 (1980)). We remanded the matter to the trial court for reconsideration of the agreement because it \u201cprovide[d] for no alimony and fail[ed] to establish the standards for plaintiffs continued support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370, 491 A.2d 752. We noted, however, that where the agreement provides for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">substantial equitable distribution of property and a dependent spouse\u2019s own income will be supplemented by unearned income from the investment of the distributed property, a court might determine that ... the total income of the dependent spouse might be sufficient to maintain her (or him) to the standard of living enjoyed during the marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">\n<em>[Ibid..]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">After hearing days of testimony from the parties and their experts, the trial court rendered a very extensive and detailed decision on the record of July 16, 2007. The court reviewed the Act, the pre- and post-Act case law and found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">In the present case, the parties were young and without substantial assets at the time of the marriage, but over almost a quarter of a century, circumstances changed significantly. The [c]ourt believes it would simply be absurd to conduct a lifestyle analysis comparing the defendant\u2019s lifestyle prior to 1981 versus his [prospective lifestyle in 2007.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">Secondly, although section C-3 of the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act directs one\u2019s attention to the standard of living before the marriage, ... subsection C-l adds an element not present in <em>Marschall, </em>which when read in conjunction with C-3 allows the [c]ourt to address the issue of unconscionability by considering the financial position of the spouse requiring support going forward. Clearly, under the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act, passed seven years after the execution of the present ant[e]-nuptial agreement, and remaining in effect ... require[s] a court of equity to reject those agreements which are unconscionable [and] to assist the [e]ourt in analyzing the significant issue of the case law subsequent to the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\"><em>Jacobitti </em>[v. <em>Jacobitti, </em>263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>608, 623 A.2d 794 (App.Div.1993), <em>aff'd, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>571, 641 A.2d 535 (1994)] raises interesting issues with regard to the fact-sensitive nature of enforcement. Apparently, the plaintiff husband was a physician, and at age 60, married the defendant wife who was then approximately 41.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>The marriage lasted sixteen years, and at the time of divorce, the plaintiff husband was 86, retired and in good health. To the contrary, defendant wife was 67 years old, suffering from progressively deteriorating multiple sclerosis and wheelchair bound.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">The Appellate Division affirmed the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the ant[e]-nuptial agreement was unenforceable because implementation would be unconscionable, i.e., plaintiff husband would be left a wealthy man and the disabled wife virtually penniless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">Acknowledging this .. is an extreme situation, the case is illustrative of the principle of changing circumstances and the passage of time as factors to be considered by the court of equity in determining the issue of unconscionability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">It is against this backdrop of legal authority that the [e]ourt has to determine whether the antLe]-nuptial agreement executed in 1981 should be deemed unconscionable in a court of conscience [siel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">As of the date of the marriage, plaintiff wife was employed by her father\u2019s company and the defendant husband was employed by the United States Postal Service. The parties maintained a joint account, the so-called CAP account, into which, for the bulk of the marriage, defendant husband deposited his paycheck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">In 1990, the defendant left his secure federal employment without having experienced a meteoric rise through the ranks to assume employment with the plaintiff wife\u2019s father\u2019s company as a machine operator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-11\">Plaintiff wife purchased Micro-Tek from her father in January 2003, and from January 2003 until September 2005, defendant husband served as the \u201cplant supervisor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-12\">In 2005, the defendant husband\u2019s gross salary from Micro-Tek was $63,000. Following the filing of the complaint for divorce in September 2005, the defendant husband was converted from a salaried employee to an hourly employee with his hourly rate of $32 per hour, determined by plaintiff wife to result in a yearly salary of $63,000 based upon a forty-hour work week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-13\">Defendant husband ... is an at-will employee of a business entity wholly owned by the plaintiff wife. Plaintiff wife is the sole owner of Micro-Tek Industries, having purchased the business from her father in January 2003. The business has been very successful over the years, and although the purchase price was in all likelihood substantial, the question remains unanswered as to whether or not the sale was an arms-length transaction or a partial gift.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-14\">Defendant husband owns a condominium townhouse which was purchased approximately fifteen years ago in which the defendant husband presently resides after having been removed from the marital home by the Tcjourt in December of 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Plaintiff wife resides in the marital residence, which she purchased in January 1983, for $120,000. The mortgage on the property was ... promptly paid off. In 1987 and 2000, plaintiff wife utilized home equity loans to pay for the cost of improvements, respectively, in the amount of 100 and $120,000. Both home equity loans were paid off in a relatively short period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">Plaintiff wife also owns, without encumbrance, an additional condominium in Palmyra, New Jersey, and a townhouse in Washington, D.C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">[E]mminently qualified experts were employed by both parties to address the employability of the defendant husband post-divorce and to assist the [c]ourt in conducting the lifestyle analysis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The court reviewed the experts\u2019 reports and made a detailed analysis of the parties\u2019 expenses. It then considered defendant\u2019s income and \u201cdispel[led] ... the fiction that has been engaged in during the hearing and considered by the experts, i.e., that defendant husband would remain in his present employment post-divorce.\u201d The court found that \u201c[t]he proverbial snowball has a greater chance of surviving the flames of Hades,\u201d than defendant has of retaining his employment in plaintiff\u2019s company.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The court specifically noted that \u201c[t]he [a]ppellate record in this ease will never be able to convey the intense feelings of the parties for one another, particularly the feelings of hatred and loathing evidenced by plaintiff wife during her testimony.\u201d The court found that plaintiffs \u201ctestimony concerning the job security of the defendant husband borders on ludicrous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">The court then addressed defendant\u2019s future employability and agreed with the two experts that \u201c[djefendant husband is capable of obtaining employment as a machine operator earning $30,932 to $37,062\u201d a year. The court reviewed defendant\u2019s education and employment history prior to 1990 when he left the Postal Service to work full-time in the family business and found his career \u201cunremarkable.\u201d The court concluded that at fifty-three years of age:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">Defendant husband\u2019s prospects would be further limited by the specialty nature of the work he performed as an employee of Miero-Tek which would present a problem of skill transferability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-11\">The [c]ourt also can make independent findings of fact with regard to the potential employability of the defendant husband in a supervisory capacity based upon having observed the defendant husband testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Although perhaps an excellent machine operator, he is inarticulate and seems to have great difficulty even answering the most basic of questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">In addition, his recall of events and his general awareness of even his present life situation is marginal, at best. Based upon the defendant husband\u2019s performance in court, an independent finding can be made by the [c]ourt, he is simply not supervisory material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">Again, the [c]ourt does not seek to embarrass or degrade the defendant husband, but must articulate its observations which are wholly inconsistent with those contained in [plaintiffs expert\u2019s] report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">Thus, post-divorce, the [ejourt finds, following his termination from Micro-Tek, a fai[t] accompli, the defendant husband would be capable of generating an income in the range of $30,932 to $37,062.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">The [c]ourt would be remiss if it did not include in the earning potential of defendant husband the funds he has traditionally earned from so-called side jobs. It is agreed the defendant is good with his hands and has utilized his skills to help others, both for free and for compensation. How much the defendant husband has earned in the past from side jobs is difficult to discern based upon his total lack of record keeping and his inability to provide accurate testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">In order to assign a number to the potential income to be generated by side jobs, the [c]ourt will accept, absent proof to the contrary, defendant husband\u2019s deposition response that the net profit from his side jobs in 2005 was approximately 4 to $5,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\">There is no reason why the defendant husband could not expect to generate such income post-divorce, in addition to maintaining a full-time position as a machine operator, or the like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-12\">The [c]ourt, having determined the earning capacity of defendant husband, rejecting for the reasons previously set forth, the functional ... argument of plaintiff wife concerning continued employment, the [e]ourt must now engage in a ... post-marital lifestyle analysis to determine whether enforcement of the ant[e]-nuptial agreement would result in defendant husband enjoying, once again, a standard of living far below that which was enjoyed both before and ... during the marriage, quoting <em>Marschall </em>at page 31, 477 A.2d 833.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-13\">In conducting this analysis, the [c]ourt deems it unnecessary to compare the before marriage lifestyle with the post-marriage lifestyle, as to do so would border upon the ridiculous as a result of the passage of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-14\">If the parties had been married for a short period of time, the [c]ourt could conduct such an inquiry, but how does the [c]ourt do so when the premarital lifestyle and the post-marital lifestyle are separated by roughly a quarter of a century? The mere passage of time makes such a comparison meaningless in the eyes of the [e]ourt. Accordingly, the comparison will be with the marital lifestyle and the post-marital lifestyle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-15\">The court found that \u201cthe parties chose to live a modest lifestyle ... during the marriage ... without incurring any substantial debt.\u201d In reviewing the experts\u2019 reports, the court noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>after certain adjustments, the experts did not differ substantially with respect to defendant\u2019s expenses, and found that defendant needed a post-tax income of $49,890 to meet his minimal expenses for a \u201csignificantly reduced lifestyle.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">The defendant husband cannot generate sufficient income to sustain the significantly reduced lifestyle represented by a budget of $49,890 per year. And on his adjusted gross income, he would incur significant debt as each year passed, which would shortly place the defendant husband in dire financial straits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">One lives a hand to mouth existence when one barely has the income to cover the bare necessities of life. And under the present scenario, defendant husband would not be able to support himself ... to stay within his financial means, he would have to sacrifice and do without essentials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">A comparison of the secure comfortable lifestyle enjoyed during the marriage, and the hand to mouth existence of defendant husband post-divorce, leads the [clourt to conclude, by clear and convincing evidence enforcement of the ant[e]-nuptial would be unconscionable and, thus, the ant[e]-nuptial agreement ... is unenforceable and is set aside by the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">In plaintiffs motion for reconsideration, argued on September 21, 2007, she suggested that the trial court was without jurisdiction to set aside the agreement because the complaint sought only enforcement of equitable distribution issues and the counterclaim sought only support. The trial court rejected that argument because plaintiff claimed that the agreement \u201ccircumscribes the parties\u2019 entitlement upon divorce.\u201d Moreover, the court noted that in the counterclaim defendant sought \u201cequitable distribution of all property acquired during the marriage, as well as spousal support.\u201d The motion for reconsideration was denied but the trial court modified its findings regarding defendant\u2019s food expenses and passive income.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">We are impressed with the detailed and carefully considered analysis undertaken by the trial court in its findings of fact and conclusions of law after the plenary hearings on both motions. The trial court\u2019s factual findings and credibility determinations are given great deference, particularly in the Family Part. <em>Cesare v. Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 413, 713 A.2d 390 (1998). \u201cA trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any deference,\u201d however. <em>Manalapan Realty v. Manalapan Tp. Comm., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Plaintiff first argues that the trial court erred in finding that the unconscionability of the agreement should be determined at the time of enforcement, rather than execution, and incorrectly applied the statutory standard to a pre-Act agreement. She claims that the case law relied on by the trial court dealt with unconscionability in the execution of the agreements, not enforcement. We reject that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The court\u2019s entire analysis was based upon changed circumstances, a standard first articulated in the pre-Act <em>Marschall </em>decision and reiterated by us in <em>D\u2019Onofrio, </em>also a pre-Act decision. The trial court looked to the Act and post-Act case law for confirmation and explanation of the pre-Act standard and expressly disregarded those cases that dealt with unconscionability at the time of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the enforcement of the agreement would be unconscionable is fully supported by the preAct case law. <em>D\u2019Onofrio, supra, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 369-70, 491 A.2d 752; <em>Marschall, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 28, 477 A.2d 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">It is the trial court\u2019s conclusion to set aside the <em>entire </em>agreement as unenforceable with which we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">In the agreement, the parties acknowledged that plaintiff \u201cis likely to inherit a substantial amount of money and property upon the deaths of her parents.\u201d They also acknowledged that each \u201chad the benefit of independent legal advice\u201d and had \u201cbeen fully advised as to his or her rights hereunder and in the absence of such an agreement, and, with full knowledge of such rights\u201d each was \u201cfully satisfied\u201d to waive such rights and enter the agreement. The parties \u201ceach agree[d] that there shall be no property settlement or division of property between them,\u201d except for their joint bank account and property acquired during the marriage and held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>as tenants in common. They each waived any \u201cright, title or interest in (a) the other\u2019s income, (b) the other\u2019s individual bank accounts ... or (c) any other assets or property ... now owned or hereafter acquired ... whether from ... income, from gifts ... as increments to property currently owned or hereafter acquired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Moreover, they each specifically waived \u201cclaims ... for support, maintenance or alimony,\u201d and acknowledged that each is \u201cfully capable of earning and receiving salaries adequate for his and her reasonable needs, and that his and her future prospects for employment are very favorable, and they [are] ... capable of self-support.\u201d Those acknowledgements were made, of course, in 1981 when the parties were in their early twenties and optimistic about their respective futures.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">When the parties entered the agreement in 1981, they were fully aware of the disparity in their educations, backgrounds and wealth. In 1987, defendant declared that (1) he was \u201cfamiliar with the estate plan adopted by\u201d plaintiff, and (2) he \u201caccepted] the provisions made for [him] thereunder in full satisfaction of all rights given to me under [the] ante-nuptial agreement, dated May 12, 1981.\u201d Thus, defendant essentially reaffirmed the agreement six years after initially entering it.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The trial court\u2019s factual findings regarding defendant\u2019s change in circumstances are fully supported by the substantial credible evidence in the record. We do not doubt the court\u2019s assessment of defendant\u2019s limited future with Micro-Tek. Nor do we take issue with the trial court\u2019s assessment of defendant\u2019s future employment and earning prospects. Defendant\u2019s circumstances have already changed with his demotion from a salaried plant supervisor to an hourly-wage machine operator. The trial court found plaintiff incredible with respect to defendant\u2019s future employment and determined that his circumstances will change even more substantially after the completion of litigation. Those findings are supported by the record. Nevertheless, defendant\u2019s income at Micro-Tek has remained the same and for purposes of assessing alimony, the court cannot determine loss of income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>prospectively, albeit the evidence supports the likelihood of lost income.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Moreover, we do not find that the evidence or the case law supports setting aside the entire agreement. The agreement provides for defendant to receive equitable distribution of assets acquired during the marriage and held as tenants in common, if there are any such assets. He will also retain all property acquired in his name, including the condominium in which he is now residing.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The agreement defendant executed in 1981 and reaffirmed in 1987 was clear and unequivocal in its declaration that plaintiff would in all likelihood be a wealthy woman and that, in the event of divorce, defendant would not share equally \u2014 or even equitably \u2014 in that wealth. Under <em>Marschall </em>and <em>D\u2019Onofrio, </em>both pre-Act cases, however, if defendant experiences a substantial change in circumstances from the marital standard of living to the post-marital standard, that would warrant a modification of the agreement to avoid leaving defendant at a subsistence standard of living. The trial court carefully considered the experts\u2019 reports on defendant\u2019s future earning capability, along with his needs and expenses post-judgment. The court made a credibility finding respecting plaintiffs assertion that defendant would continue his employment post-judgment, which we are not at liberty to reverse. <em>See State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>468, 470, 724 A.2d 234 (1999). Consequently, we hold that the evidence fully supports a modification of the agreement to the extent that defendant may be entitled to an alimony award if his circumstances are substantially altered. The remainder of the agreement continues in full force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">While we have not addressed each of plaintiffs arguments individually, our discussion incorporates all of the issues she has raised. With respect to defendant\u2019s cross-appeal, he argues \u201cdefensively\u201d that the trial court did not include in its decision \u201cany savings and only a relatively small retirement component into the budget for his post-divorce lifestyle analysis.\u201d (Db 60) Defendant is correct that the court did not include those elements in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>analysis. Those elements are subject to a changed circumstances analysis which would, at this juncture, be prospective. As we have indicated, defendant may seek alimony based upon his needs if and when his circumstances substantially change. To date, defendant has suffered only a demotion in status at Miero-Tek, not a diminution of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Since this appeal was interlocutory, the matter is returned to the trial court for further proceedings during which the trial court may consider an alimony award to defendant, if and when he presents evidence of changed circumstances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The standard criteria for awarding alimony shall be employed by the court at that juncture.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The orders of July 16 and October 19, 2007 are modified in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-10\"> In his certification, plaintiff stated his Micro-Tek salary was $65,000. Throughout the transcripts, however, his salary is stated as $63,000 and we will use that figure in referring to defendant\u2019s salary at Micro-Tek.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-9\"> The \"Act\u201d refers to the Uniform Pre-Marital Agreement Act adopted in 1988.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b256-13\"> We note that if defendant voluntarily leaves his employment at Micro-Tek, he may not be eligible for alimony.
