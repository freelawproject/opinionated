His order prompted his taking advantage of defendant\u2019s advertised \u201cfree bonus\u201d offer. To pay for the order, plaintiff proffered his American Express credit card, following which defendant confirmed the order on-line, and American Express \u201capproved\u201d the charge. As part of the confirmation process, however, plaintiff was advised that he was being billed an additional shipping and handling charge of $7.95 for the \u201cfree bonus.\u201d The next day, plaintiff filed a putative class action alleging common law and consumer fraud against defendant, premised on defendant\u2019s deceitful advertising of its products on the internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Unbeknownst to plaintiff, the products he selected were on backorder and not presently available. Having learned of the pendency of the lawsuit, defendant cancelled the order and never sought payment or actual transfer of funds. Plaintiff never paid for the order, and his credit card was never debited for the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Defendant filed a counterclaim for abuse of process after it learned that plaintiff had filed numerous similar actions against retailers advertising \u201cfree bonus\u201d offers. Defendant alleged plaintiff regularly filed such suits seeking to prompt defendants to settle under threat of a potential class action certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">On a motion for summary judgment, Judge Martinotti in the Law Division dismissed plaintiffs fraud claims, concluding that plaintiff did not establish an ascertainable loss. The judge also dismissed the counterclaim because defendant had not established plaintiffs malicious use or perversion of legal process. Both sides appeal, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\n<em>I.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">We expand on our discussion of the relevant facts. Defendant, a website operator and retailer operating AsSeenOnTV.com, as part of its internet marketing, advertised on the website, a \u201cfree bonus gift or offer\u201d with an \u201cinitial retail purchase.\u201d Included in small type at the bottom of the webpage and next to three asterisks, was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">Initial retail purchase is required for qualifying bonus gift or offers, along with a separate shipping and handling charge for each bonus gift or offer added to a shopping cart order(s). Bonus gifts or offers are excluded from any shipping discounts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">On June 11, 2007, plaintiff accessed defendant\u2019s site and proceeded to place an order for the purchase of a \u201cSmart Light\u201d for $29.95. After plaintiff made his selection, the screen reflecting his \u201cshopping cart\u201d contents prompted plaintiff to \u201c[cjhoose your free bonus gift or offer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">Beneath that bold-type print were pictures of nine items with brief descriptions. Included under the descriptions for each was an indication of its dollar \u201cvalue,\u201d along with the phrase, \u201cPay only the cost of S &amp; H.\u201d Plaintiff selected as his bonus item a \u201cFree Facial Trimmer\u201d with a represented \u201c$20 Retail Value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">Using his American Express card, plaintiff completed the website\u2019s online payment section. At the end of the payment process, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>the screen indicated \u201csecure checkout \u2014 completed,\u201d thanked plaintiff for his order and indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\"><em>Processing Credit Card Information ... </em>Approved</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0z\">Your order number is [xxxxxxxx]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">The following charges will appear on your credit card statement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">$44.85 to SEENONTV.COM <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">A receipt of your order has been automatically mailed to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">As a special offer we are giving you a free membership.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\"><em>Member Number: </em>[xxxxx]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">At the bottom of the screen was the statement: \u201cHere is [the] order information for your records.\u201d The information, in chart form, listed: 1) one facial trimmer, as a \u201cfree bonus offer,\u201d and that an \u201cinitial purchase [was] required\u201d but that he was being charged \u201c$0.00\u201d; 2) one Smart Light, for $29.95; 3) a \u201cSubtotal\u201d of $29.95; 4) a \u201cShipping (Standard)\u201d charge of $14.90; 5) that there was zero \u201ctax\u201d; and 5) a \u201ctotal\u201d of $44.85. The $14.85 shipping charges on plaintiffs account reflected shipping of $6.95 for the Smart Light, and $7.95 for the facial trimmer.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">Although not germane to the ultimate issue on appeal, defendant asserts that the items were not delivered because they were on back order and not available although it concedes that plaintiff appeared on the \u201cdo not sell\u201d list. Plaintiff claims that the items were not sent solely because of the \u201cdo not sell\u201d designation. Critically important, however, is that the products were never delivered, and defendant cancelled plaintiffs order.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">The dispute centered around the effect of the \u201ccharge\u201d for the order. In particular, plaintiff provided a copy of an email from American Express indicating that \u201cthere was a charge approved on your American Express account ending in [xxxxx] for 44.85 from As Seen on TV. The approval was posted on 06/11/07.\u201d Defendant counters by relying on a later email from American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Express including the additional representation that \u201c[t]he charge never appeared on the statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">To explain why plaintiff was never \u201ccharged\u201d for the June order, Charles Venniro, defendant\u2019s warehouse manager proffered that upon receiving the order, defendant \u201ccontacted USA E-Pay, a liaison between [defendant] and American Express, to request \u2018authorization\u2019 for [plaintiffs] credit card.\u201d Venniro said an \u201cauthorization\u201d \u201cmerely requests information from American Express\u201d through USA E-Pay \u201cas to whether [plaintiff] had credit available in his card in the amount of the proposed transaction.\u201d American Express then \u201cauthorized\u201d that plaintiff \u201chad the appropriate amount of credit available on his credit account,\u201d and this \u201c \u2018authorization\u2019 was posted to [plaintiffs] credit card,\u201d on June 11, 2007. Next to the word \u201cstatus\u201d in the authorization also appeared the phrase \u201cAuthorized (Will not be captured).\u201d Venniro explained that in that context, \u201ccaptured\u201d would mean that defendant \u201chas requested to charge the credit card for the transaction, American Express will charge the credit card for the transaction, and American Express will provide appropriate funds to\u201d defendant. \u201cWill not be captured,\u201d on the other hand, as appeared here, meant that defendant \u201cmerely requested information as to whether [plaintiff] had the amount of the transaction available on his credit card and did not request that American Express charge [plaintiffs] credit card or request that American Express provide funds to\u201d defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">According to defendant, it \u201cnever sought to charge\u201d plaintiffs credit card, and in fact defendant routinely did not seek to charge a credit card \u201cuntil it release[d] the products for delivery to the purchaser.\u201d Also, defendant never contacted American Express thereafter to \u201ccancel or reverse a charge\u201d on plaintiffs account, given that defendant never requested such a charge nor released to plaintiff the products plaintiff ordered on June 11. Nothing more was provided by plaintiff to establish that he was either charged or that he had a finite credit limit with American Express that was impacted by this transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Subsequent to this incident, defendant changed its website as it related to the \u201cbonus offer.\u201d Defendant changed the language \u201cChoose your free bonus gift or offer\u201d and \u201cPay only the cost of S &amp; H,\u201d to \u201c\u2018Choose your bonus gift or offer\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018Just pay separate $7.95 processing.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In support of his damage claim, plaintiff submitted the certification of his proposed expert, consultant Alan J. Salzberg, a Ph.D. in statistics. In Salzberg\u2019s opinion, plaintiff suffered a \u201cmeasurable economic loss\u201d in connection with placing his order, because at the time it \u201cauthorized\u201d the transaction American Express \u201creduc[ed] plaintiffs available credit line, or purchasing limit\u201d by the amount of the order. Salzberg\u2019s opinion was not changed by the fact that the transaction \u201cdid not result in an actual charge to plaintiffs credit card account,\u201d and for purposes of the opinion he assumed that \u201cno purchases were denied\u201d by American Express by virtue of the \u201cdiminution in [plaintiffs] credit line/purehasing limit.\u201d Salzberg\u2019s opinion neither identified the credit line nor described the nature of the \u201cmeasurable economic loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In support of its cross-motion, defendant submitted the certification of its counsel who asserted that since May 2007, plaintiff had filed \u201cat least four dozen complaints\u201d against various entities making \u201cvirtually identical allegations of consumer fraud.\u201d In each case, plaintiff had ordered \u201crelatively low-priced home and personal products\u201d from different internet vendors. Citing examples, counsel asserted that plaintiff clearly was not deceived by defendant\u2019s ads in this case, but rather initiated his suit as part of an ongoing plan to file class action fraud complaints and, \u201cbefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>seeking certification, to demand a large sum from the defendants to settle with him alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In this case, plaintiff had a settlement demand of $100,000. Counsel said that defendant\u2019s investigation had revealed that \u201cnearly all of these [other] defendants did, in fact, yield to [plaintiffs] extortion tactics and [paid] him off.\u201d But she was aware of no case in which plaintiff had actually received class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">According to counsel, during negotiations with plaintiff, he threatened to \u201cbring new lawsuits against [defendant] for its unwillingness to yield to extortion.\u201d In October 2007, moreover, using a different name and address, plaintiff succeeded in ordering from defendant another of its products, a supplement called CialaPren represented as a male enhancement. A few days after obtaining that product, plaintiff filed a new class action against defendant for fraud in connection with that transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Subsequent to the filing of the complaint, defendant changed the language on its website related to the \u201cbonus\u201d offer. Defendant changed the language \u201cChoose your free bonus gift or offer\u201d and \u201cPay only the cost of S &amp; H,\u201d to \u201cChoose your bonus gift or offer\u201d and \u201c \u2018Just pay separate $7.95 processing.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">We first address what we consider to be the dispositive issue on plaintiffs appeal \u2014 whether plaintiff demonstrated that he had suffered an ascertainable loss. Plaintiff frames the issue by asserting that \u201cthe diminution of an individual\u2019s available credit [is] a measurable economic loss.\u201d Plaintiff argues that his loss is reflected by his credit limit being reduced by the amount of the order \u2014 approximately $45.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">We begin our analysis by restating basic principles informing our consideration of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">The Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to -20 (the Act or CFA), is intended, among other things, to stop unlawful mer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>chandise and real estate sales and advertising practices aimed at consumers. <em>D\u2019Ercole Sales, Inc. v. Fruehauf Corp., </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>11, 22-28, 501 A.2d 990 (App.Div.1985). <em>See also Finderne Mgmt. Co. v. Barrett, </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>546, 566, 955 A.2d 940 (App.Div.2008) (\u201cThe legislative concern was over sharp practices and dealings in the marketing of merchandise and real estate whereby the consumer could be victimized by being lured into a purchase through fraudulent, deceptive or other similar kind of selling or advertising practices.\u201d); <em>Vort v. Hollander, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>56, 61-62, 607 A.2d 1339 (App.Div.)

Mercedes-Benz U.S.A., LLC, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>234, 244, 872 A.2d 783 (2005) <em>(citing Union Ink Co., Inc. v. AT&amp;T Corp., </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>617, 646, 801 A.2d 361 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>547, 810 A.2d 66 (2002)). <em>See also Romano v. Galaxy Toyota, </em>399 <em>N.J.Super. </em>470, 479, 945 A.2d 49 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>344, 953 A.2d 763 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Plaintiff urges two primary reasons why the motion judge erred by finding that the diminution in plaintiffs credit limit was not an ascertainable loss: 1) he failed to take into account the merits of his expert\u2019s contrasting opinion; and 2) he failed to respect that the concept of \u201cascertainable loss\u201d goes beyond mere \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d losses and includes diminution in \u201cvalue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">With respect to the former, however, plaintiffs expert, Salzberg, assumed for purposes of his opinion that the transaction did not result in an actual charge to plaintiffs account, and that \u201cno purchases were denied by American Express by virtue of the $45 diminution in [plaintiffs] credit line/purchasing limit.\u201d He provided no explanation for how, with these acknowledged facts, plaintiff has suffered an ascertainable loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Instead, he made unsupported conclusions that \u201cunder the facts presented to a reasonable degree of certainty,\u201d plaintiff had suffered \u201cactual economic loss on June 11, 2007,\u201d and that plaintiffs \u201closs is measurable.\u201d Although he added that he had \u201cdouble-eheck[ed]\u201d his conclusions by the market pricing and statistical expectations approaches, such confirmations were meaningless without an explanation of exactly how he determined plaintiffs loss was measurable in the first place. Even presuming that Salzberg totaled plaintiffs damages at approximately $45.00 \u2014 the amount of the order \u2014 he still failed to explain the basis for that conclusion. Salzberg never considered that the order was never billed or sent, nor that plaintiffs credit account was never debited. He further failed to consider that plaintiff never claimed that the diminution in his credit \u201climit\u201d caused him to forego some other desired purchasing opportunity, or caused him to suffer a rejection by American Express of some purchase he had made not realizing there had been a temporary diminution in his credit limit. In fact, plaintiff conceded at oral argument that nothing in the record supports the critical assumption that American Express imposed any credit limit on plaintiffs purchases or use of the card.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Salzberg\u2019s omissions were critical, because \u201ceonclusory and self-serving assertions\u201d in certifications without explanatory or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>supporting facts will not defeat a meritorious motion for summary judgment. <em>Puder v. Buechel, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>428, 440, 874 A.2d 534 (2005) <em>(citing Martin v. Rutgers Cas. Ins. Co., </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>320, 323, 787 A.2d 948 (App.Div.2002); <em>Brae Asset Fund, L.P. v. Newman, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 134, 742 A.2d 986 (App.Div.1999)). Competent opposition requires \u201ccompetent evidential material\u201d beyond mere \u201cspeculation\u201d and \u201cfanciful arguments.\u201d <em>Merchs. Express Money Order Co. v. Sun Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>556, 563 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>592, 874 A.2d 1109 (2005); <em>O\u2019Loughlin v. Nat\u2019l Cmty. Bank, </em>338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>592, 606-07, 770 A.2d 1185 (App.Div.) (opponent must do more than establish abstract doubt regarding material facts), <em>certif. denied, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>606, 782 A.2d 424 (2001). <em>See also James Talcott, Inc. v. Shulman, </em>82 <em>N.J.Super. </em>438, 443, 198 A.2d 98 (App.Div.1964) (noting that \u201c[mjere sworn conclusions of ultimate facts, without material basis or supporting affidavits by persons having actual knowledge of the facts, are insufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">There is, however, a more fundamental flaw in the expert\u2019s opinion. The Court has defined \u201cascertainable loss\u201d to mean \u201can actual loss.\u201d <em>Thiedemann, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 248, 872 A.2d 783. The loss \u201cmust be presented with some certainty demonstrating that it is capable of calculation, although it need not be demonstrated in all its particularity to avoid summary judgment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>But a plaintiff \u201cmust produce evidence from which the fact finder could find or infer that the plaintiff suffered an actual loss.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>And the \u201ccertainty implicit in the concept of \u2018ascertainable\u2019 loss is that it is quantifiable or measurable,\u201d even if it had yet to be \u201cexperienced as an out-of-pocket loss.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Nothing presented here, beyond a conclusory statement, provides any support for Salzberg\u2019s opinion that plaintiffs ascertainable loss was calculable, or that an authorization was a diminution in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Even assuming, moreover, that the authorization was at least a temporary hold on plaintiffs credit card in the approximate amount of $45.00, plaintiff himself failed to assert that such a hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>impacted his credit limit in a way that damaged him. In fact, at oral argument, he conceded that he had not offered anything to suggest that his American Express charging privileges were in some manner limited to any extent, a key component in suggesting that defendant\u2019s conduct impacted on his availability of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In sum, plaintiff was never charged for the items he ordered in June 2007; to the extent his credit card company authorized credit for the order, the authorization did not cause him to suffer any loss, and both he and his expert failed to identify any actual loss or damage he experienced as a result of the entire attempted transaction. <em>See Perkins v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>99, 106-07, 890 A.2d 997 (App.Div.2006) (reasoning from <em>Thiedemann, </em>we affirmed dismissal of a CFA complaint where the allegedly substandard vehicle part did not fail or require repair or replacement during the warranty period, so there was no ascertainable loss); <em>Laufer v. U.S. Life Ins. Co., </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>172, 187, 896 A.2d 1101 (App.Div.2006) (noting that \u201c[t]he plaintiff must be able to present sufficient evidence of [ascertainable] loss to survive a motion for summary judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In rejecting plaintiffs ascertainable loss argument, the motion judge also found instructive the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Meshinsky v. Nichols Yacht Sales, Inc., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>464, 475 n. 4, 541 A.2d 1063 (1988). In <em>Meshinsky, </em>the plaintiff failed to make timely boat payments when the boat developed various mechanical problems. These non-payments may have subsequently impacted the plaintiffs credit report. The Court noted, however, that at a point when the plaintiff was rejected for another loan, his credit report showed not only his delinquencies on the boat loan, but two judgments against him, and other overdue balances and late payments. Because plaintiff eventually succeeded in receiving that additional financing, he did not prove that he had suffered a loss at the defendant\u2019s hands with respect to his credit report and the prior boat loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Plaintiff attempts to distinguish <em>Meshinsky </em>by claiming that his loss was quantifiable. As we have noted, nothing in the record supports either the claim or the quantification of that loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Plaintiff also relies on <em>Cox v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>2, 23, 647 A.2d 454 (1994). In <em>Cox, </em>the plaintiff had incurred a debt for home repairs under a contract with Sears by which Sears also had a recorded lien on the plaintiff\u2019s property. The Court concluded that \u201can improper debt or lien against a consumer-fraud plaintiff may constitute a loss\u201d under the Act, yet it found that the debt and lien themselves were not Act violations, while other actions by Sears may have been. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Plaintiffs reliance on Cox is misplaced. The authorization on his American Express account is neither a debt nor a lien, and as Venniro explained the authorization was not a \u201ccharge\u201d since it was not captured or ultimately charged to plaintiffs account.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Plaintiffs reliance on <em>Dabush v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>105, 116, 874 A.2d 1110 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>265, 883 A.2d 1062 (2005), is also misplaced. In <em>Dabush, </em>the plaintiff-lessee of a motor vehicle appealed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his CFA class action suit against the manufacturer. Plaintiff could not establish an ascertainable loss when the vehicle\u2019s on-board navigation system failed to operate within the coverage area as represented, and the plaintiff was late arriving at a business meeting as a result. Plaintiff did not lose any \u201cmoney or business due to his late arrival,\u201d and we affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the manufacturer. <em>Id. </em>at 111, 124, 874 A.2d 1110. Although we noted that \u201ca plaintiff need not actually expend a sum of money as a result of defendant\u2019s unlawful consumer practice in order to demonstrate a loss,\u201d we nevertheless affirmed that \u201cthe amount of the loss must be ascertainable and must be established with reasonable certainty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116, 874 A.2d 1110. Plaintiff had the burden of showing the connection between the improper practice and the ascertainable loss. <em>Ibid. </em>Like the aggrieved party in <em>Dabush, </em>plaintiff has failed to meet that burden so as to withstand a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">We likewise reject as unsubstantiated, plaintiffs claim that he suffered a loss because defendant sold his \u201cpersonal information\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>to \u201cits marketing partners,\u201d a type of \u201ccommercial exploitation\u201d that he contends also satisfy the ascertainable loss standard. While the website made reference to defendant\u2019s reservation of rights to distribute such information, the record is barren of any proof that such distribution took place or that it amounts to an \u201cascertainable loss.\u201d This becomes most significant given the unusual facts of this case, including the premature cancellation of the order prior to fulfillment. We find no merit in this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">We reach the same result as to the common law claim. Judge Martinotti rejected plaintiffs common law fraud claim because plaintiff failed to establish how he had relied to his detriment on defendant\u2019s misrepresentation. Specifically, the judge relied on his earlier reasoning and found that plaintiff actually had not suffered any loss or diminution in \u201cpurchasing power\u201d or \u201creduction in credit limit\u201d as a result of the credit card authorization. He stated it was \u201cunbelievable\u201d that in October \u201cplaintiff relied on the misrepresentations he alleged existed in June.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Common law fraud requires a material misrepresentation of a presently existing or past fact, knowledge or belief by defendant in its falsity, defendant\u2019s intention that the plaintiff rely on it, reasonable reliance by plaintiff, and damage. <em>Gennari v. Weichert Co. Realtors, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>582, 610, 691 A.2d 350 (1997). <em>See also Triffin v. Automatic Data Processing, Inc., </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. </em>237, 246, 926 A.2d 362 (App.Div.2007); <em>Port Liberte Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. Sordoni Const. Co., </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>492, 507 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>479, 932 A.2d 30 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Plaintiff says that his receipt or non-receipt of the product was irrelevant to his common law fraud claim, because the damage he suffered was \u201cby virtue of the unconsummated purchase which defendant unilaterally canceled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Rather, he says the fraud claim was proven by: defendant\u2019s misstatement that he would receive a \u201cfree\u201d product when defendant knew it was not \u201cfree\u201d; defendant\u2019s knowledge of the statement\u2019s falsity; and plaintiffs reliance on it to his detriment in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>form of a \u201cdiminution in credit available\u201d or by dint of the \u201cuncompensated exploitation of plaintiffs personal property!,]\u201d by which he means the information he provided at defendant\u2019s behest ordering from defendant\u2019s site.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Our analysis as to the absence of ascertainable loss applies with equal force here. Plaintiff has failed to establish any damage or loss, regardless of any reliance. Plaintiffs claim, without authority, that a common law fraud claim has a lesser standard of proof of damage than a consumer fraud claim is not persuasive. Even if such standard does exist, plaintiffs claim still fails as he suffered no damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">We likewise reject his claim that when he ultimately purchased the product, he was relying on defendant\u2019s earlier website and its promotion of a free gift. Not only had defendant changed its website, it clearly described the actual charges incurred. This was the information informing plaintiff at the time of sale and nothing in the record suggests misrepresentation. Plaintiff concedes that he knew about the changes, and he does not say that as of October, the ads were still deceiving. We find plaintiffs argument disingenuous as his complaint had been filed prior to the time of the subsequent purchase. The motion judge correctly dismissed the common law fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s cross-appeal and its claim that the judge erred in dismissing its abuse of process claim. Its claim is premised on the underlying observation that this suit was \u201cmerely one of scores of nearly identical lawsuits commenced by a lawyer who deliberately trolled the internet for retailers against whom he might file \u2018class action\u2019 lawsuits,\u201d only to generate a quick settlement on his own behalf prior to seeking a class certification that he never intended to seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">In granting plaintiff summary judgment on defendant\u2019s abuse of process counterclaim, the motion judge said he disagreed that \u201cplaintiffs action is meritless.\u201d Although he acknowledged having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>granted defendant summary judgment on all plaintiffs claims, he nonetheless found that plaintiff \u201chas brought this action without malice and with a sincere belief that his claim did have merit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Moreover, the judge disagreed with defendant that plaintiffs actions during settlement negotiations or discussions indicated an \u201culterior motive\u201d or malicious intent. He also found no evidence that plaintiff had actually \u201cinvoke[d]\u201d the court\u2019s process wrongfully, because none \u201cof the lawsuits [defendant accused plaintiff of filing] were as a result of settlement discussions breaking down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">We first observe that defendant\u2019s claim was for malicious <em>abuse of process </em>rather than malicious <em>use of process. </em>The distinction between these causes of action precludes defendant\u2019s counterclaim. Our focus must not be on what prompted the suit but what action plaintiff engaged in after commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The tort of malicious abuse of process lies not for commencing an improper action, but for misusing or misapplying process after it is issued. <em>Baglini v. Lauletta, </em>338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>282, 293, 768 A.2d 825 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>607, 782 A.2d 425 (2001). To be found liable for malicious abuse of process, a party must have performed additional acts \u201cafter issuance of process \u201cwhich represent the perversion or abuse of the legitimate purposes of that process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 294, 768 A.2d 825 (citation omitted). We have further clarified that \u201cprocess is not abused unless after its issuance the defendant reveals an ulterior purpose he had in securing it by committing \u2018further acts\u2019 whereby he demonstrably uses the process as a means to coerce or oppress the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Ruberton v. Gabage, </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>125, 130, 654 A.2d 1002 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>Tedards v. Auty, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>541, 550, 557 A.2d 1030 (App.Div.1989) (quoting <em>Gambocz v. Apel, </em>102 <em>N.J.Super. </em>123, 130, 245 A.2d 507 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>485, 246 A.2d 447 (1968))), <em>certif. denied, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>451, 663 A.2d 1358 (1995). In order for there to be \u201cabuse\u201d of process, therefore, a party must \u201cuse\u201d process in some fashion, and that use must be \u201ccoercive\u201d or \u201cillegitimate.\u201d <em>Ruberton, supra, </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 130-31, 654 A.2d 1002 (quoting <em>Penwag Prop. Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number><em>Landau, </em>148 <em>N.J.Super. </em>493, 499, 372 A.2d 1162 (App.Div.1977), <em>aff'd, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>595, 388 A.2d 1265 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Plaintiff filed his initial complaint on June 12, 2007; plaintiffs filing of numerous earlier suits that defendant denominates similar to this one is irrelevant to its cause of action. As we have noted, defendant did not allege malicious use of process. <em>See Baglini supra, </em>338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 294, 768 A.2d 825 <em>(citing Ash v. Cohn, </em>119 <em>N.J.L. </em>54, 58, 194 A. 174 (E. &amp; A.1937)) (noting that malicious use of process involves \u201cemployment of process for its ostensible purpose, although without reasonable or probable cause, whereas the malicious abuse is the employment of a process in a manner not contemplated by law\u201d). <em>See also Earl v. Winne, </em>14 <em>N.J. </em>119, 128, 101 A.2d 535 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Defendant claims that plaintiffs threats to file more litigation while he was involved here, and his subsequent making good on those threats by filing the male-enhancement suit against it, were all evidence of \u201cfurther acts\u201d demonstrating plaintiffs use of process to coerce. In that regard, defendant\u2019s accusation that plaintiff filed this suit as a putative class action while never intending to seek class certification is arguably relevant. An intent to threaten the defendant with process one never intended to pursue might satisfy the abuse-of-process tort, because maliciously threatening process in an existing case could be as unfairly coercive as abusing process in some more direct way. <em>See Ruberton, supra, </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 130, 654 A.2d 1002 (observing that abuse of process includes \u201cfurther acts\u201d intended to coerce or oppress a party).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Here, however, the statements and many of the actions forming the basis of defendant\u2019s abuse-of-process complaint occurred during or in the context of the parties\u2019 ongoing settlement discussions, and those negotiations were not part of a court \u201cprocess.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 130-32, 654 A.2d 1002 (holding that a statement by counsel in settlement conference threatening criminal prosecution was not considered an abuse of process, because the settlement conference was not part of \u201cprocess\u201d counsel had caused to issue, and counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>demonstrated no further actions of an intent to use the settlement conference scheduling order to coerce).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Defendant provided evidence that plaintiff had filed \u201cover 40 purported class-action, consumer fraud lawsuits in Bergen County,\u201d most all of which plaintiff prosecuted with a similar pattern of demanding a \u201clarge sum <em>from </em>defendants to settle with him alone\u201d before he sought class certification. Our concern with reliance on this proffered information is that, as represented by counsel, many of these suits were settled before class certification could be attempted or achieved, and we are in no position to nor will we assess the bona fides of those actions or any other extant matters. Likewise, we are in no position to determine why each defendant settled these matters if such matters presented no form of exposure to them. Defendant\u2019s claim that plaintiff is engaged in a form of \u201cextortion\u201d carries little weight on this record. We find no merit in defendant\u2019s counterclaim and the motion judge properly dismissed this entire action.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">We affirm the dismissal of the complaint and counterclaim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-14\"> At various times, the website is referred to \u201cAsseenonTv.com/' \u201cAs Seen On TV'' or \u201cSeenonTv/'</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b450-7\"> According to Venniro, on October 25, 2007, four months after plaintiff's initial attempt to purchase, after the change in the website and while his suit was pending, plaintiff \"used information different from the information that he provided in connection with the June 11, 2007, order\u201d in placing a new order for a Smart Light with the Facial Hair Trimmer as a free bonus.
