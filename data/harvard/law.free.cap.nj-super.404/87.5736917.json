We must enforce this statute literally because its unambiguous language, as illuminated by its legislative history, reveals an intent to permit voting only on enumerated matters. We thus affirm the agency decision, which held sending-district representatives ineligible to vote on the appointment of the receiving district\u2019s solicitor, because it is not expressly authorized by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">The facts are not in dispute. The record reveals that Ventnor, Margate, Longport and Brigantine send their high school students to the Atlantic City district in exchange for tuition reimbursement. Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:38-8.1, these sending districts are entitled to have representatives on the receiving district\u2019s board of education. Some locales, including Atlantic City, permitted sending-district representatives to vote on various organizational matters, including the selection of board solicitor. In 2006, Scott Evans, a member of the Atlantic City board, objected to this voting practice, asserting that it violated <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:38-8.1,</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Evans filed a petition with the Department of Education, which referred the matter to the Office of Administrative Law. An administrative law judge determined that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-8.1 does not authorize a sending-district representative to participate in the receiving board\u2019s decision to appoint a solicitor. The Commissioner of Education agreed. Only Ventnor has appealed that final agency decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">In reviewing a final agency decision, we must give deference to the findings of fact upon which it is based. <em>Jackson v. Concord Co., </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>113, 117-18, 253 A.2d 793 (1969). We must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>also give \u201csome deference to [the agency\u2019s] \u2018interpretation of statutes and regulations within its implementing and enforcing responsibility,\u2019 \u201d <em>Utley v. Board of Review, Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>534, 551, 946 A.2d 1039 (2008) (quoting <em>In re Appeal by Progressive Cas. Ins. Co., </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>93, 102, 704 A.2d 562 (App.Div.1997)), but we are \u201cin no way bound by the agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute or its determination of a strictly legal issue,\u201d <em>Utley, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 551, 946 A.2d 1039 (quoting <em>Mayflower Sec. Co. v. Bureau of Sec., </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>85, 93, 312 A.2d 497 (1973)). Because the sole issue to be decided in this appeal is the purely legal question of whether a sending-district representative is authorized to vote on the appointment of the receiving district\u2019s solicitor, the Commissioner\u2019s decision regarding the scope of the statute is not entitled to any deference. In any event, we observe that the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation is consistent with our interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In ascertaining the proper scope of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-8.1, we must necessarily begin with an analysis of that statute\u2019s plain meaning. <em>Brooks v. Odom, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>395, 401, 696 A.2d 619 (1997); <em>Lammers v. Point Pleasant Bd. of Educ., </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>264, 267, 633 A.2d 526 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-8.1 declares that a sending-district representative, who otherwise meets the requirements of the statute,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB\">shall be eligible to vote on the following matters before the receiving district board of education:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">a. Tuition to be charged the sending district by the receiving district and the bill lists or contracts for the purchase, operation or maintenance of facilities, equipment and instructional materials to be used in the education of the pupils of the sending district;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">b. New capital construction to be utilized by sending district pupils;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">c. Appointment, transfer or removal of teaching staff members providing services to pupils of the sending district, including any teaching staff member who is a member of the receiving district\u2019s central administrative staff; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-10\">d. Addition or deletion of curricular and extracurricular programs involving pupils of the sending district.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">In considering the scope of this statute and in determining whether it incorporates the purported right of a sending-district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>representative to vote on the appointment of the receiving district\u2019s solicitor, we must construe the statute as written; we are \u201cnot at liberty to presume the legislature intended something other than what it expressed by its plain language.\u201d <em>Lammers, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 272, 633 A.2d 526. As a result, when a statute \u201cis clear and unambiguous on its face and allows for only one interpretation, we should \u2018delve no deeper than the act\u2019s literal terms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lewis v. Bd. of Trs., Pub. Emp. Ret. Sys., </em>366 <em>N.J.Super. </em>411, 415, 841 A.2d 483 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>State v. Butler, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>220, 226, 445 A.2d 399 (1982)), <em>certif. denied, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>357, 851 A.2d 650 (2004). Recognizing, however, that \u201cwords are inexact tools at best,\u201d it has been held that where the text of the statute is unclear or ambiguous, \u201cresort may freely be had to the pertinent constitutional and legislative history for aid in ascertaining the true sense and meaning of the language used.\u201d <em>Lloyd v. Vermeulen, </em>22 <em>N.J. </em>200, 206, 125 A.2d 393 (1956). <em>See also Gallenthin Realty Dev. Inc. v. Borough of Paulsboro, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>344, 359, 924 A.2d 447 (2007); <em>Bd. of Chosen Freeholders v. State, </em>159 <em>N.J. </em>565, 576, 732 A.2d 1053 (1999). Here, both the intrinsic evidence (the statute\u2019s wording and structure) and the extrinsic evidence (the statute\u2019s legislative history) demonstrate that the sending district\u2019s position is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The intrinsic evidence consists of \u201cthe internal structure of the statute and the conventional meanings of its words and phrases.\u201d <em>Lewis, supra, </em>366 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 416, 841 A.2d 483. In further understanding this evidence, we employ, when necessary, \u201ctime-honored guides to statutory interpretation\u201d that often reveal the legislative intent. <em>Ibid. </em>These so-called canons of construction are not binding but are utilized as aids in our pursuit of a clear understanding of a statute. <em>Elizabeth Bd. of Educ. v. N.J. Transit Corp., </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>262, 267, 776 A.2d 821 (App.Div.2001). Ultimately, ascertaining the intent <em>of the </em>statute \u201cresides in the common sense of the situation.\u201d <em>Reilly v. Ozzard, </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>529, 539, 166 A.2d 360 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>The plain language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A-.38-8.1 reveals no doubt that the Legislature chose not to authorize a sending-district representative to vote on the selection of the receiving district\u2019s solicitor. Because the statute lists four areas on which a sending-district representative is eligible to vote, it is appropriate to consider the doctrine of \u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius,\u201d which suggests that the mentioning of one or more things excludes others. In examining the statute\u2019s particular wording, there is presented no reason to conclude that the listing of four areas in which a sending-district representative may vote was intended to be only illustrative, as Ventnor argues. The Legislature did not declare that a sending-district representative is authorized to vote on board matters \u201csuch as\u201d or \u201cincluding\u201d the four itemized voting rights. Had the Legislature utilized that type of language, Vent-nor\u2019s contention that there exist other voting rights similar to those mentioned might have been arguable. <em>See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Echazabal, </em>536 <em>U.S. </em>73, 80, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>2045, 2049-50, 153 L.Ed.2d 82, 89-90 (2002) (\u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d held inapplicable in interpreting a statute containing a list preceded by the phrase \u201cmay include\u201d); <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Malec, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>1, 7-8, 514 A.2d 832 (1986) (\u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d held inapplicable in interpreting a statute containing a list preceded by the phrase \u201cin any of the following ways\u201d). Instead, the Legislature stated that a sending-district representative \u201cshall be eligible to vote on the following matters\u201d and then listed only four, none of which fairly encompasses the right urged here. The language chosen by the Legislature unmistakably precludes the inclusion of other matters not specifically mentioned. <em>See Saunders v. Capital Health Sys. at Mercer, </em>398 <em>N.J.Super. </em>500, 508, 942 A.2d 142 (App.Div.2008) (\u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d held applicable in interpreting a statute containing a list due to the absence of a preceding phrase such as \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Ventnor persists that even though \u201c[t]he plain language of the statute sets forth those areas where sending district members \u2018shall\u2019 be allowed to vote,\u201d it does not \u201cimpliedly or explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>exclude any other areas.\u201d We take this argument to suggest that even if the statute expresses a limitation on voting rights, a receiving district nevertheless possesses the discretion to allow voting in other areas. This argument is based on a clear misreading of the statute. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-8.1 does not delineate those areas where a sending-district representative \u201cshall\u201d vote; it delineates the only areas in which a sending-district representative \u201cshall be eligible\u201d to vote. To the extent receiving districts may have permitted in the past or may currently permit voting in areas not covered by <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:38-8.1, they have acted beyond the parameters established by the Legislature. Receiving districts possess no discretion to broaden the voting rights enumerated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-8.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">We are convinced that in this statute the Legislature intended to limit the voting eligibility of sending-district representatives to the four items expressed and that it did not grant sending districts the discretion to permit voting in other areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>The available extrinsic evidence further demonstrates that the State Board of Education correctly understood the intrinsic evidence. Extrinsic evidence \u201cmay take various forms, including any reliable evidence of the legislative history of a statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Lewis, supra, </em>366 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 418, 841 A.2d 483 (citing <em>Nat'l Waste Recyc., Inc. v. Middlesex County Improvement Auth., </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>209, 224, 695 A.2d 1381 (1997)). The legislative history of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-8.1 reveals that the Legislature intended to limit the eligibility of sending-district representatives to those matters expressly stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In this regard, it is noteworthy that Governor Whitman vetoed Senate Bill No. 151, which would have authorized a sending-district representative to vote \u201con all matters before the receiving district board of education, except those matters pertaining exclusively to the grades of the receiving district in which no students from the sending district are enrolled, including, but not limited, to matters of facilities, personnel and programs.\u201d In her veto message of October 20, 1994, Governor Whitman expressed concern that this language, if enacted, could provide \u201cdisproportionate representation to the sending district\u201d and would permit such representatives to vote on matters that did not affect the sending district; as a result, Governor Whitman recommended a bill that \u201climited\u201d the voting rights of sending-district representatives to four matters, i.e., those that appear in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-8.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Our courts have recognized that a governor\u2019s message in either signing a bill into law or returning it unsigned represents part of the legislative process. <em>See State v. Sutton, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>471, 483, 625 A.2d 1132 (1993); <em>McGlynn v. N.J. Pub. Broad. Auth., </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>112, 159, 439 A.2d 54 (1981); <em>Lewis, supra, </em>366 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 418-19, 841 A.2d 483. Governor Whitman\u2019s insistence upon limiting voting rights, when she rejected the earlier legislation, provides considerable insight into the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:38-8.1, because the current statute was the legislative response to the veto. In short, the process that generated the current statute reveals an intent to limit the voting rights of sending-district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>representatives and further bolsters our view that the statute should be read literally.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We would also observe that, since the adoption of the current version of the statute, members of the Legislature have, on more than one occasion, introduced bills that would authorize broader voting eligibility. These proposed expansions, however, have not been adopted, and the statute has remained unchanged since 1996.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In adopting the existing version of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-8.1, the Legislature deleted from the statute\u2019s final version a phrase that would expand subsection (c) to permit a sending-district representative to vote not just on \u201cteaching staff members\u201d but on \u201cteaching or professional administrative staff.\u201d The Legislature\u2019s resistance to expanding voting eligibility beyond the statute\u2019s clear contours strongly supports the argument that the Legislature meant to create, through its current version of the statute, only those voting rights literally mentioned in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-8.1. Although we recognize an obvious danger in placing too much weight on the significance of unsuccessful attempts to modify a statute as a means of understanding an existing statute, the subsequent failed legislative proposals further indicate the accuracy of a narrow interpretation of voting rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Because the wording and structure of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-8.1, as well as its legislative history, reveal the Legislature\u2019s intent to limit the voting eligibility of sending-district representatives to those matters expressly stated in the statute, we affirm the final agency decision under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Ventnor also argues that a custom has developed that should now be enforced, relying upon certain agency decisions that appear to have recognized more expansive rights than enumerated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-8.1. <em>See, e.g., Bloomingdale Bd. of Educ. v. Butler Bd. of Educ., </em>2004 <em>WL </em>1464887, 2004 Lexis 359 (N.J.Adm.) (finding sending-district representatives eligible to vote on procedural and organizational matters necessary to ensure the effective operation of the board); <em>Little Ferry Bd. of Educ. v. Ridgefield Park Bd. of Educ., </em>EDU 149-5/97 (July 24, 1997) (finding sending-district representatives eligible to vote in the election of board officers and other procedural matters attendant to the orderly conduct of board operations); <em>Bd. of Educ., Borough of Lincoln Park v. Bd. of Educ., Town of Boonton, </em>97 N.J.A.R.2d (EDU) 592 (1997) (finding sending-district representatives may deliberate but not vote on many subjects not mentioned in the statute). We have also been referred to <em>Callowhill v. Bd. of Educ., City of Atlantic City, </em>96 <em>N.J.A.R.2d </em>(EDU) 693 (1996) (finding sending-district representatives may offer input with respect to the hiring of a superintendent or school business administrator, but not board solicitor), which appears to support Evans\u2019s view. We reject Ventnor\u2019s argument that this alleged custom has relevance to our interpretation of the statute in this case. The scope of the statute cannot be expanded through a receiving district\u2019s past or present lax attitude toward the legislative mandate. We are not guided by past unauthorized practices but by the Legislature\u2019s literal mandate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b123-8\"> For example, Senate Bill No. 1474, which was introduced to the 212th Legislature on March 2, 2006, would have amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-8.1(c) to render sending-district representatives eligible to vote not only on the appointment, transfer or removal of those persons identified in the statute\u2019s current version but also \"any other person providing administrative, business and business support services to the receiving district, <em>including the school district solicitor or the school board attorney\" </em>(emphasis added). This bill was never enacted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
