The trial court extended the protections of <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>261, 277, 609 A.2d 400 (1992), to juvenile proceedings, concluding the right to counsel afforded a juvenile charged with delinquency attached when the prosecutor\u2019s office filed a complaint. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">The facts giving rise to this appeal are not disputed. On February 19, 2008, twelve-year-old T.B. reported she had been raped by P.M.P. The alleged incident occurred approximately five years earlier when T.B. was seven and P.M.P. was sixteen. P.M.P. is now twenty-one.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">Following the victim\u2019s video interview, Detective Ashlee Hand conducted a consensual telephone intercept. Detective Hand phoned P.M.P. pretending to be T.B. Believing Detective Hand was T.B., P.M.P. apologized for his conduct. However, the telephone call was not recorded because the recording equipment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>malfunctioned. That same day, the County Prosecutor\u2019s Office filed a juvenile delinquency complaint executed by Detective Hand charging P.M.P. with offenses, which if committed by an adult would constitute first-degree aggravated sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2(a), and third-degree endangering the welfare of a child, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The undocketed juvenile complaint was presented to the Family Part judge that evening. Detectives Hand and Daniel Holt appeared. Although not evident from the transcript, an attorney from the public defender\u2019s office was present in the courtroom, having appeared in earlier hearings. The prosecutor\u2019s office related the facts surrounding the victim\u2019s disclosure and sought a warrant to take P.M.P. into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The judge was also presiding over another Family Part matter in which P.M.P. appeared. In the other matter, P.M.P.\u2019s son was the subject of a Title 9 action initiated by the Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS). After removing the child from his mother\u2019s custody, DYFS placed the one-year-old in P.M.P.\u2019s care. In the DYFS matter, P.M.P. was represented by counsel from the Parental Representation Unit of the public defender\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Following the prosecutor\u2019s presentation of testimony supporting the delinquency charges, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">What I would like to do, however, is this. I\u2019m here all day tomorrow, but first thing would probably be better. My suggestion, Detective, would be that you apprehend [P.M.P.] on the basis of this complaint and bring him here to court tomorrow morning and let\u2019s hash it out a little bit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">[I]n the context of the hour and the fact that I think there\u2019s a household there that would be really disrupted seriously if \u2014 I have a juvenile matter I\u2019m hearing, a first detention hearing, tomorrow morning at nine o\u2019clock. But if you folks want to have him here right at nine, I\u2019ll hear you and we\u2019ll figure out what\u2019s the appropriate and safe thing to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">The court issued a warrant, in lieu of a summons, for P.M.P. to be taken into custody the next day.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>On February 20, 2008, Detectives Hand and Holt, accompanied by a local police detective, arrived at P.M.P.\u2019s home. When he saw the detectives, P.M.P. stated: \u201cI know why you are here, she called me last night.\u201d The detectives took P.M.P. to the County Prosecutor\u2019s Office for processing. He was fingerprinted, photographed, and interviewed. Prior to the interview, Detective Hand read him his Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rights from a form. P.M.P. stated he understood his rights, signed the form, and stated he waived those rights and was willing to speak to the detectives without an attorney. Detective Hand then conducted a video interview. P.M.P. confessed to sexually assaulting T.B. on two different occasions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At 11 a.m., after obtaining P.M.P.\u2019s confession, the prosecutor\u2019s office turned him over to the County Sheriff\u2019s Department to be brought before the Family Part judge for a detention hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">P.M.P. filed a motion to suppress his custodial statement. He argued the detectives were obligated to present P.M.P. before the court at 9 a.m., at which time his attorney in the Title 9 matter would have been contacted and consulted. Thus, by ignoring the Family Part order to appear at 9 a.m., defense counsel was prevented from aiding P.M.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The Family Part judge concluded the juvenile delinquency complaint initiated by the prosecutor\u2019s office was the \u201cfunctional equivalent of an indictment.\u201d Therefore, applying <em>Sanchez, </em>the court found P.M.P.\u2019s right to counsel attached when the complaint was filed. The court ordered P.M.P.\u2019s custodial statement suppressed, concluding the State\u2019s post-complaint interrogation violated P.M.P.\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The State appeals from that order arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>THE POLICE DID NOT VIOLATE A COURT ORDER.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">\n<em>POINT II.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">THIS COURT SHOULD REVERSE [THE COURT\u2019S] DECISION TO GRANT DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION TO SUPPRESS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">A. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AN INDICTMENT AND A DELINQUENCY COMPLAINT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">B. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GOALS OF THE ADULT SYSTEM AND THE JUVENILE SYSTEM.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">The State suggests the fundamental difference between the goals and procedures of the juvenile justice system and the criminal court prohibit equating a juvenile complaint with an indictment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is helpful to first review some general constructs guiding both types of proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">The adult criminal process may commence with the filing of a complaint. However, the prosecution cannot proceed absent \u201cpresentment or indictment of a grand jury.\u201d <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, paragraph 8; <em>R. </em>S:7-3(a). This constitutional guarantee principally serves to \u201cinform the defendant of the nature of the offense charged against him so he may adequately prepare his defense[.]\u201d <em>State v. Rios, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>572, 603, 112 A.2d 247 (1955); <em>State v. Lopez, </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>296, 302, 647 A.2d 1351 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>289, 654 A.2d 469 (1994). Moreover, an indictment must be sufficiently specific to enable a defendant to avoid a subsequent prosecution for the same offense, <em>State v. Wein, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>491, 497, 404 A.2d 302 (1979), and \u201cto preclude the substitution by a trial jury of an offense which the grand jury did not in fact consider or charge.\u201d <em>State v. Boratto, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>506, 519, 404 A.2d 604 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">The return of an indictment has been determined to be the pivotal point in the criminal process.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-14\">The return of an indictment transforms the relationship between the State and the defendant. By obtaining the indictment, the State represents that it has sufficient evidence to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case. Once the indictment is returned, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>State is committed to prosecute the defendant. From that moment, if not before, the prosecutor and the defendant are adversaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\"><em>[Sanchez, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 276, 609 A.2d 400.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u201cAs a general rule, after an indictment and before arraignment, prosecutors or their representatives should not initiate a conversation with defendants without the consent of defense counsel.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Even the issuance of <em>Miranda </em>warnings and a defendant\u2019s waiver of rights will not cure the constitutional violation. Any custodial statement obtained will be suppressed as a matter of law under Article I, paragraph 10 of the New Jersey Constitution. <em>State v. A.G.D., </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>56, 64, 835 A.2d 291 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">On the other hand, prior to indictment, \u201cprosecutors or their representatives, including the police, properly may interrogate a suspect without the consent of defense counsel ... after the State has filed or issued a criminal complaint or arrest warrant against that suspect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">The Court has chosen not to extend <em>Sanchez </em>to apply to preindictment proceedings concluding, \u201c\u2018the federal constitution\u2019s safeguards ... are entirely adequate.\u2019 \u201d <em>A.G.D., supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 65, 835 A.2d 291 (quoting <em>State v. Tucker, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>259, 291, 645 A.2d 111 (1994) (non-waivable right to counsel not extended to period time of first appearance)), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>1090, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>751, 130 L.Ed.2d 651 (1995). The Court stated, a conclusion to extend our State Constitution to \u201cafford greater protection to our citizens than is afforded by the Federal Constitution\u201d is warranted when \u201cgreater protection is appropriate on the basis of constitutional text, legislative history, state traditions, or other factors.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">Turning to New Jersey\u2019s Code of Juvenile Justice, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-21 to-91, \u201cdelinquency\u201d is defined to include acts by persons under eighteen, which would constitute crimes, disorderly persons offenses, petty disorderly persons offenses or other violations of penal statutes, ordinances or regulations if committed by persons over eighteen. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-23. The Code makes clear juvenile court proceedings are not \u201ccriminal [prosecutions,] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>but are exercises of the State\u2019s <em>parens patriae </em>jurisdiction in the interests of the juveniles.\u201d <em>In re State in the Interest of Steenback, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>89, 104, 167 A.2d 397 (1961); <em>State in the Interest of T.L.O., </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>331, 342, n. 5, 463 A.2d 934 (1983), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>325, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>733, 83 L.Ed.2d 720 (1985).

We acknowledge that in a small percentage of very serious cases, \u201cpunishment has joined rehabilitation as a component of the State\u2019s core mission with respect to juvenile offenders.\u201d <em>State v.

Also, the \u201cconstitutional safeguard of voluntariness\u201d applies to confessions obtained in juvenile proceedings. <em>In re Carlo, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>224, 235, 225 A.2d 110 (1966); <em>see also State v. Presha, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>304, 329, 748 A.2d 1108 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The protective philosophy of juvenile justice also permeates custodial interrogation. Taking a juvenile into custody \u201cshall not be construed as an arrest but shall be deemed a measure to protect the health, morals and well-being of the juvenile[.]\u201d <em>R. </em>5:21-1; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-33. Further, any person taking the juvenile into custody shall immediately notify the juvenile\u2019s parents, guardian or other custodian. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-33. \u201cParents are in a position to assist juveniles in understanding their rights, acting intelligently in waiving those rights, and other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>wise remaining calm in the face of an interrogation.\u201d <em>Presha, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 315, 748 A.2d 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">This longstanding safeguard emphasizes the role of a parent in the context of a juvenile interrogation. \u201cWhenever possible ... no child should be interviewed except in the presence of his parents or guardian.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, 748 A.2d 1108 (quoting <em>In re S.H., </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>108, 114-15, 293 A.2d 181 (1972)); <em>Carlo, supra, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>at 227, 225 A.2d 110. In eases where a juvenile is less than age fourteen, any confession resulting from interrogation conducted in the absence of a parent or guardian is generally deemed inadmissible as a matter of law. <em>Presha, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 315, 748 A.2d 1108. \u201cBy elevating the significance of the adult\u2019s role in the overall balance, we are satisfied that the rights of juveniles will be protected in a manner consistent with constitutional guarantees and modern realities.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Critical to the trial judge\u2019s determination and P.M.P.\u2019s argument is the analogy to criminal process: that is, the delinquency charges are a criminal prosecution that immerses a juvenile into \u201cthe intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law.\u201d <em>Rothgery v. Gillespie County, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>2578, 2583, 171 L.Ed.2d 366, 374 (2008). While we agree the juvenile delinquency process mirrors its adult counterpart in many ways, it is not the same. The admittedly different objectives of and procedures followed by the Family Part in juvenile delinquency matters cannot lead to the wholesale importation of the system of adversary criminal justice to Family Part juvenile matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">This leads us to the question of whether due process protections require the imposition of a <em>Sanchez-like </em>rule, imposing an unwaivable right to counsel during post-complaint interrogation of a minor. We conclude the due process protections afforded juveniles charged with delinquency when taken into custody satisfactorily safeguards their rights. We decline to apply <em>Sanchez </em>to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>We further comment on the unique facts of this case. Were P.M.P. an adult offender charged with criminal conduct, the procedures followed by the detectives would not have evoked objection. <em>A.G.D., supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 59, 835 A.2d 291. The issue results solely because P.M.P. was processed upon the filing of a juvenile delinquency complaint. However, we cannot overlook the reality that when P.M.P. was taken into custody he was an adult. This is significant because P.M.P. was not impeded by youthful age or immaturity when he expressed his clear desire to respond to the State\u2019s interrogation. The detectives advised, and he understood, he was being charged with the aggravated sexual assault of T.B. He recognized the gravity of the situation he faced and was properly Mirandized. There is no challenge to his knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of rights, including the right to consult counsel. <em>See Presha, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 313, 748 A.2d 1108. Moreover, P.M.P. appreciated the process of securing legal representation, as he had qualified for the appointment of a public defender to represent him in the DYFS matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">For all of these reasons, we determine no basis requires the right of counsel to attach such that a juvenile\u2019s interrogation is precluded without counsel present. We conclude the existing procedures adequately protect a juvenile who is taken into custody after a delinquency complaint has been filed but prior to his first court appearance. Accordingly, we reverse the order suppressing P.M.P.\u2019s custodial statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-11\"> We are aware of no authority granted to a Family Part judge allowing him to limit law enforcement\u2019s power to arrest, suggested by these facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b103-10\"> <em>Miranda v.
