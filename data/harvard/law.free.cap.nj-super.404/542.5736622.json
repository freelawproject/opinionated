The judge of compensation reasoned that because the alleged reaction to the perfume was the result of a personal proclivity of Sexton, any aggravation of her preexisting condition did not arise out of the employment. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">At the time of the January 3, 2004 accident, Sexton was sixty-four years old and a part-time licensed practical nurse at Cumberland Manor, a nursing home operated by the County of Cumberland. She worked weekends from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. She had previously worked there from the late 1970s until the early 1980s, and then resumed on a part-time basis in the late 1990s.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">On Saturday, January 3, 2004, Sexton arrived at work at 6:45 a.m., relieved the nurse from the prior shift, and began her usual work routine, dispensing medications in A hall. Sometime after 10:00 a.m., she went to B hall, where she detected the smell of a perfume in the air. She continued her work and by late morning went to the day room to dispense medications and feed residents. A nurse\u2019s aide sprayed the same perfume in the air. Sexton experienced difficulty breathing. She hurriedly completed her assigned task and left the day room. She proceeded directly to the nurse\u2019s station and reported what happened to the supervising nurse. Sexton told her she could not get her breath and was experiencing a breathing problem. Because of Sexton\u2019s breathing difficulties, another nurse performed Sexton\u2019s afternoon rounds, beginning at about noon. Sexton spent the remainder of her shift seated, doing desk work. As she described it, \u201cI did some paperwork, some charting, and I didn\u2019t get up and move around because I was having a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Just before Sexton completed her shift at 3:00 p.m., the nurse\u2019s aide who had previously sprayed the perfume was seated at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>nearby desk and again sprayed it. Upon smelling it, Sexton \u201cgot away from her ... went over to count the narcotics with the nurse going out\u201d and immediately clocked out, left the building, and began walking to her car. She was unable to reach her car because she was \u201cbreathless.\u201d She sat on a bench outside of the building for about twenty minutes. She then walked to her car and sat there \u201ca good long while.\u201d She then made the twenty minute drive home, arriving at about 4:80 p.m. She went directly to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The next morning, Sexton\u2019s breathing difficulties continued. Her daughter transported her to a local hospital. The hospital record stated that she was admitted due to complaints of shortness of breath resulting from exposure to perfume at work. She was discharged on January 16, 2004. Her discharge summary diagnosis was acute pulmonary disease exacerbation as a result of being exposed to odors at work. From the hospital, Sexton was transferred to a rehabilitation center until January 23, 2004, after which she was transferred to a different hospital until January 30, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Since then, Sexton has been oxygen-dependent on an almost constant basis and has never returned to work. Prior to January 3, 2004, she had an active lifestyle and worked regularly. The judge of compensation found that since then her \u201cphysical health and abilities have radically deteriorated,\u201d and her life activities have been greatly curtailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Before January 3, 2004, Sexton smoked an average of one pack of cigarettes per day for forty-three years. She has not smoked since then. She was diagnosed with COPD as early as 1989, and she used an inhaler as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The judge of compensation heard medical testimony from a pulmonary expert for each side. Sexton\u2019s expert opined that Sexton\u2019s preexisting COPD was exacerbated by the perfume inhalation and two episodes of intubation during her second hospitalization, rendering her totally and permanently disabled. Respondent\u2019s expert opined that Sexton\u2019s perfume exposure \u201cwas not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>relevant factor\u201d in her current level of disability and that the intubations might have caused only a temporary worsening of her condition. He found Sexton\u2019s overall pulmonary disability was 75% permanent partial disability, none of which was attributable to the perfume exposure or the intubations.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Because the judge of compensation determined that any aggravation of Sexton\u2019s preexisting condition was not compensable, he did not make findings on the causation issue. Instead, he dismissed Sexton\u2019s petition against her employer and the Second Injury Fund. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In a thorough and thoughtful opinion, the judge of compensation found that the perfume exposures constituted accidents, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7, not occupational exposures, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-30, -31. He found that the accidents occurred in the course of Sexton\u2019s employment. The remaining criterion for compensability, therefore, required a determination of whether the accidents arose out of the employment. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7 (rendering compensable injuries to employees caused \u201cby accident arising out of and in the course of employment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Relying primarily on <em>Coleman v. Cycle Transformer Corp., </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>285, 520 A.2d 1341 (1986), the judge of compensation concluded that no condition of employment or of the employer\u2019s premises played a role in Sexton\u2019s accident. He found \u201cthat the presence of a perfume sprayed by a co-employee on the employer\u2019s premises does not equate to such a condition.\u201d He further found \u201cthat the probability of the aggravation of [Sextonj\u2019s preexisting pulmonary condition due to the perfume exposure at work was no greater than it would be under the normal circumstances of life.\u201d He noted, for example, that the medical records revealed that in 1995 Sexton had experienced a reaction to an exposure to perfume, although it did not result in her hospitalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">The factual findings of the judge of compensation were essentially as we have set forth. They are well supported by the record, <em>see Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589, 599, 210 A.2d 753 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>(1965); <em>De Angelo v. Alsan Masons, Inc., </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>88, 89-90, 299 A.2d 90 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>581, 803 A.2d 883 (1973), and are not disputed by Sexton. It is the legal consequences flowing from those facts that form the basis of Sexton\u2019s appeal. We owe no particular deference to the judge of compensation\u2019s interpretation of the law. <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995); <em>see also Verge v. County of Morris, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>118, 123, 639 A.2d 378 (App.Div.1994) (holding that if a judge of compensation mistakenly applies the law to the facts, an appellate court \u201cmust grant appropriate relief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In <em>Coleman, supra, 105 N.J. at </em>286-87, 520 A.2d 1341, <em>during an </em>unpaid one-half hour lunch break, the employee ate her lunch, which she brought from home, in the employees\u2019 lunchroom. The employer did not serve or provide food, and employees were free to remain on or off the premises during their lunch break. <em>Id. </em>at 287, 520 A.2d 1341. After eating her lunch, the employee struck a match to light a cigarette, but as she turned her head, the match caught her hair on fire causing her injuries. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The dispositive issue was whether the accident, which occurred in the course of her employment, arose out of the employment. <em>Id. </em>at 286, 290, 520 A.2d 1341. The judge of compensation \u201cconcluded that the accidental touching of a lighted match to the petitioner\u2019s hair by the petitioner\u2019s own hand was not \u2018reasonably incidental\u2019 to her employment.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 287, 520 A.2d 1341. \u201cHe concluded: \u2018Neither the tasks of her employment, nor the place where she was eating her lunch at the time, nor any act on the part of any of her co-employees caused her injury,\u2019 and therefore \u2018the accident did not arise out of the employment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We reversed, but the Supreme Court reversed our decision and reinstated the decision of the judge of compensation. <em>Id. </em>at 286-88, 520 A.2d 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The Court noted that, in analyzing the criteria for compensability in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7, it is useful to consider the two key terms separately, \u201cwith the \u2018arising out of portion construed to refer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>causal origin, and the \u2018course of employment\u2019 portion to the time, place, and circumstances of the accident in relation to the employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288, 520 A.2d 1341 (quoting 1 A. Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 6.10 (1985)). The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">The accident, in order to arise \u201cout of\u2019 the employment, must be of such nature the risk of which might have been contemplated by a reasonable person when entering the employment, as incidental to it. <em>A risk is incidental to the employment when it belongs to or is connected with what a workman has to do in fulfilling his contract of service.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 289, 520 A.2d 1341 (quoting <em>Rafferty v. Dairymen\u2019s League Coop. Ass\u2019n, </em>16 <em>N.J. Misc. </em>363, 366, 200 A. 493 (Dep\u2019t Labor 1938)) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The Court cautioned that although \u201carising out of\u2019 and \u201cin the course of\u2019 employment are separate tests that must be independently applied and met, \u201cit should never be forgotten that the basic concept of compensation coverage is unitary, not dual, and is best expressed in the term \u2018work connection.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting Larson, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 6.10).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">To find the requisite causal connection between the employment and the injury, \u201c[i]t must be established that the work was at least a contributing cause of the injury and that the risk of the occurrence was reasonably incident to the employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290, 520 A.2d 1341. New Jersey has adopted the \u201cbut for\u201d or \u201cpositional-risk\u201d test. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c\u2018But for\u2019 connotes a standard of reasonable probability. Thus stated, the question is whether it is more probably true than not that the injury would have occurred during the time and place of employment rather than elsewhere.\u201d <em>Howard v. Harwood\u2019s Rest. Co., </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>72, 83, 135 A.2d 161 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Analysis under this test requires consideration of the nature of the risk that caused the injury. <em>Coleman, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 291, 520 A.2d 1341. Three categories have been described: (1) those distinctly associated with the employment, such as fingers getting caught in gears or excavations caving in; (2) neutral risks, consisting of uncontrollable circumstances not originating in the employment environment, such as being struck by lighting or blinded by a flying beetle; and (3) those personal to the employee, in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>the employment connection with the injury is minimal and it is the personal proclivities or contacts of the employee that give rise to the harm. <em>Id. </em>at 291-92, 520 A.2d 1341. An example of the third type is an employee attacked while working by an enemy motivated by vengeance stemming from personal contact with the employee. <em>Howard, supra, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>at 84-85, 135 A.2d 161. The first two types are compensable; the third is not. <em>Ibid.; Coleman, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 291-92, 520 A.2d 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">In <em>Coleman, </em>the Court concluded that the employee accidentally setting her own hair on fire fell into the third category and therefore did not arise out of the employment. <em>Supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 292, 520 A.2d 1341. The employee did not have to be in the lunch room during her unpaid lunch break and did not have to light a match or smoke in order to fulfill her contract of service. <em>Id. </em>at 287, 520 A.2d 1341. Therefore, the risk she encountered was not incidental to the employment. No condition of the work or the workplace was a contributing cause of her injury. <em>Id. </em>at 294, 520 A.2d 1341. Accordingly, the requisite causal connection was not present. <em>Id. </em>at 294-95, 520 A.2d 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">As part of its analysis, the <em>Coleman </em>Court considered idiopathic fall cases, in which injuries resulting from a fall occasioned by purely personal proclivities were found compensable. <em>Id. </em>at 292-94, 520 A.2d 1341. In one, the employee suffered an epileptic seizure and fell against a pot stove, burning his face. <em>Reynolds v. Passaic Valley Sewerage Comm\u2019rs, </em>130 <em>N.J.L. </em>437, 438-39, 33 A.2d 595 (Sup.Ct.1943), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>131 <em>N.J.L. </em>327, 36 A.2d 429 (E. &amp; A.1944). The pot stove was furnished by the employer, and the \u201cthing that occurred was connected with the service the employee had to perform in fulfilling his contract.\u201d <em>Coleman, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 293, 520 A.2d 1341 (quoting <em>Reynolds, supra, </em>130 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 441-42, 33 A.2d 595). Although the cause of the fall was unconnected with the employment, the pot stove was a condition of the place of employment and contributed to the injury to the employee\u2019s face, as a result of which the injury was caused by a risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>incidental to the employment and thus arose out of the employment. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In <em>George v. Great Eastern Food Products, Inc., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>44, 207 A.2d 161 (1965), the <em>Reynolds </em>rationale was extended to find compensability for an employee who fell because of a non-occupational heart attack, struck nothing on the way down, and hit his head on a level concrete floor, causing a fractured skull that later resulted in his death. In reaching that conclusion, the Court overruled its earlier contrary holding in <em>Henderson v. Celanese Corp., </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>208, 108 A.2d 267 (1954), reasoning that an accident arises out of the employment \u201cwhen it is due to a condition of the employment-\u00bfe., a risk of <em>this </em>employment, and that the impact with the concrete floor here clearly meets that test.\u201d <em>George, supra, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>at 48, 207 A.2d 161. In other words, the level concrete floor, like the pot stove in <em>Reynolds, </em>was a condition of the place of employment, and it was a contributing cause of the employee\u2019s skull fracture.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Contrasting those cases to the facts before it, the <em>Coleman </em>Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">The same cannot be said of the accident and injury in the case before us. No condition of the lunchroom played any role, in petitioner Coleman\u2019s setting her hair on fire or in the nature and extent of her injury. No employment-related instrumentality, such as the stove in <em>Reynolds </em>... or the concrete floor in <em>Henderson ... </em>and <em>George ..., </em>influenced the occurrence itself or the nature and extent of the resultant injury. Unlike <em>Gargiulo [v. Gargiulo, </em>13 <em>N.J. </em>8, 97 A.2d 593 (1953) ], in which the requirements of the employee\u2019s task took him into the line of fire of an errant arrow [shot by a neighborhood boy while the employee was working in the back yard of his employer\u2019s store], no circumstances of this petitioner\u2019s employment [were] causally related to the unhappy introduction of match to hair. The fact that the accident happened while she was on her employer\u2019s premises was the sheerest happenstance, wholly insufficient to supply the necessary nexus between the employment and the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">To hold otherwise would be to equate an \u201cincident of employment\u201d with a coincidence. There is not the slightest suggestion that it is more probable that the accident would <em>not </em>have occurred under the normal circumstances of everyday life outside of the employment____ Quite simply, it was the [petitioner\u2019s] personal proclivity for smoking, coupled with an unfortunate bit of inattention, that produced the harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-11\"><em>[Coleman, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 294-95, 520 A.2d 1341.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The Court confirmed its conclusion by reference to the so-called \u201csmoking\u201d cases. <em>Id. </em>at 295-96, 520 A.2d 1341. In one, injuries caused when a garage attendant spilled gasoline on his work clothes at work, which caught fire when he attempted to light a cigarette, were found .to arise out of employment. <em>Secor v. Penn Serv. Garage, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>315, 324, 117 A.2d 12 (1955). The result was the same for an employee whose clothing, coated with oil from his job, caught fire when matches in his pocket ignited when he bumped into a locker. <em>Steel Sales Corp. v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, </em>293 <em>Ill. </em>435, 440, 127 <em>N.E. </em>698 (1920). However, compensation was denied for an employee who, while driving a truck in the course of his employment, attempted to light a cigarette and the match head flew off into his eye. <em>Hill-Luthy Co. v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, </em>411 <em>Ill. </em>201, 205, 103 N.E.2d 605 (1952). In that case, the risk of using matches or smoking was not incidental to the employment but was unconnected to it. The Court concluded that the result in each of those three cases \u201cwas determined by the presence or absence of a risk of the employment or a condition thereof but for which the accident would not have happened----\u201d <em>Coleman supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 296, 520 A.2d <em>1341.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">In the case before us, the judge of compensation concluded that Sexton\u2019s injury was the result of her personal proclivity, namely her underlying COPD and sensitivity to a particular perfume, and that the perfume exposure could have happened anywhere in every day life. He therefore concluded that the risk was of the non-compensable third category, a risk personal to the employee. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">First, we consider the Court\u2019s explanation in <em>Howard, supra, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>at 85, 135 A.2d 161, of the two-step process by which the positional risk test must be analyzed. For purposes of its analysis, the Court accepted the factual proposition that the vicious attack on the injured employee by a co-employee was motivated by the attacker\u2019s insane delusional impulse in thinking he was punishing his common law wife for a wrong she may have done or that he thought she had done. <em>Id. </em>at 78, 81, 135 A.2d 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>In the first step, it must be determined \u201cwhether but for the fact of employment the injury would not have happened.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85, 135 A.2d 161. The \u201cpositional relation of the employment to the injury\u201d was plainly established because had the victim not been at work that day she would not have been attacked by her co-employee. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The second step evaluates the \u201cnature of risk involved.\u201d The Court found a sufficient nexus of the risk to the employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASO\">[The employer] ... urges that irrational impulses of workmen over which the employer has no control cannot be said to be a risk connected with the employment. But that argument will avail little, because even if the risk is not one directly related to the employment, it may at least be classified as neutral. We cannot with any rational degree of consistency say that an arrow shot by a boy onto the employer\u2019s premises is causally related to the employment, while an assault and battery committed upon an employee by an insane co-employee is not. The employer\u2019s lack of control over the source of the harm is obvious in either situation, and at least in the instant case it may be said that the employer placed [the co-employee attacker] in a position to do harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 86, 135 A.2d 161.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">In the case before us, Sexton plainly would not have been exposed to the perfume if she had not been at work on January 3, 2004. The first step is satisfied. The nature of the risk was that a co-employee might do something that could injure Sexton. The specific nature of the injurious conduct need not be foreseen. A co-employee might irrationally attack her, accidentally bump into her, or spill a slippery substance on the floor on which she might slip and fall. As it happened, a co-employee repeatedly sprayed perfume in Sexton\u2019s presence, allegedly injuring her. The employer placed the co-employee in a position to do harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Next, we distinguish the material facts in this case from those in <em>Coleman. </em>Here, the alleged injury was not self-inflicted, but caused by a co-employee. It did not occur when Sexton was on an unpaid break in a place she was not required by her employer to be. Sexton was performing her assigned duties as required by her employment at the time of each exposure. She was fulfilling her contract of service. Once sprayed into the air, the perfume became part of the workplace \u2014 a condition of the workplace \u2014 no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>different than the pot stove in <em>Reynolds </em>or the concrete floor in <em>George. </em>Sexton\u2019s contact with the air she was breathing in her employer\u2019s premises was no different than the contact of the employees in <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>George </em>with \u201cconditions\u201d of their places of employment. Thus, a condition of the workplace <em>did </em>play a role in Sexton\u2019s alleged injury. An employment-related instrumentality (the contaminated air) did play a role in the occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">To say that this exposure just as easily could have happened in the ordinary circumstances of every day life gives only a mechanistic application of the literal terms of the positional risk test. The same could be said about the idiopathic fall cases. The employees in <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>George </em>just as easily could have had their episodes at a shopping mall or at home, and in falling struck an object on the way down or simply fell directly to the floor. But they did not. They hit the object or the floor in the workplace while working. That was the risk of their particular employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The same is true here. The air Sexton had to breathe in order to fulfill her contract of service, contaminated by a co-employee, was a condition of the employment for Sexton and thus a risk of <em>\u201cthis\u201d </em>employment for her. <em>George, supra, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>at 48, 207 A.2d 161. Therefore, if inhaling the substance injured her, the injury arose out of the employment. As in <em>Howard, supra, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>at 86, 135 A.2d 161, no principled distinction can be drawn between the typical neutral risks resulting from an act of God or emanating from some other non-work-related source or person and this occurrence. As in <em>Howard, </em>what happened to Sexton can be deemed a neutral risk. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">This situation is readily distinguishable from <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Hillr-Luthy. </em>In those cases, the risk of striking a match and lighting a cigarette had no relationship to the work. No risk or condition of the employment contributed to the injury, which in each case was self-inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Finally, we consider whether Sexton\u2019s underlying COPD is the kind of personal proclivity that should push her into the non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>compensable third category of risks. The judge of compensation concluded that because Sexton\u2019s condition made her particularly sensitive to the perfume the risk of harm to her from exposure to the perfume was specific to her or to anyone else with that sensitivity, as a result of which her harm was caused by her personal proclivity. For the reasons that follow, we cannot accept this rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is social legislation and is liberally construed to accomplish its beneficent purpose of providing coverage to as many workers as possible. <em>Brower v. ICT Group, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>367, 373, 753 A.2d 1045 (2000). Employers take their employees as they find them, \u201cwith all of the pre-existing disease and infirmity that may exist.\u201d <em>Verge, supra, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 125, 639 A.2d 378. Accordingly, employees are \u201cnot disqualified under the requirement that the injury arise out of the employment where the pre-existing condition is aggravated, accelerated or combined with the pre-existing disease or infirmity to produce the disability for which compensation is sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126, 639 A.2d 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The Second Injury Fund (Fund) allows employers a credit if a work accident accelerates or aggravates a preexisting condition, resulting in total and permanent disability. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-95; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(d). Through this statutory scheme, \u201c[t]he Fund assumes liability for the portion of the disability attributable to the preexisting impairment.\u201d <em>Lewicki v. N.J. Art Foundry, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>75, 83-84, 438 A.2d 544 (1981). \u201cThe intent of the Fund is to \u2018encourage the hiring by industry of people handicapped by pre-existing <em>disabilities____\u2019\"Id. </em>at 83, 438 A.2d 544 (quoting <em>Paul v. Baltimore Upholstering Co., </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>111, 129, 328 A.2d 610 (1974)). \u201cGranting an employer credit for previous loss of function under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15 \u2014 12(d), while allowing the employee to recover from the Fund for unassignable previous permanent disability, allows full compensation to the employee while removing the disincentive to hiring workers with pre-exist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>ing conditions.\u201d <em>Gulick v. H.M. Enoch, Inc., </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>96, 116, 654 A.2d 987 (App.Div.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">As we have explained, the \u201carising out of\u2019 criterion is satisfied if it is \u201cestablished that the work was at least a contributing cause of the injury and that the risk of occurrence was reasonably incident to the employment.\u201d <em>Coleman, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 290, 520 A.2d 1341. In the context of aggravation of a preexisting condition, the corollary to that rule is that disqualification under the \u201carising out of\u2019 criterion occurs when the preexisting condition is the sole cause of the injury for which compensation is sought. <em>Spindler v. Universal Chain Corp., </em>11 <em>N.J. </em>34, 39, 93 A.2d 171 (1952); <em>Shaudys v. IMO Indus., Inc., </em>285 <em>N.J.Super. </em>407, 414-17, 667 A.2d 204 (App.Div.1995); <em>Verge, supra, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 128-29, 639 A.2d 378. <em>Verge supra, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 128-29, 639 A.2d 378 (holding that an employee with preexisting knee injuries could recover under the \u201cdirectly associated\u201d risk category if she reinjured it by slipping on a rug at work, but that she could not recover if her employer proved the knee simply \u201cgave-out due to an idiopathic or personal cause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">We think characterizing Sexton\u2019s underlying COPD as a personal proclivity that disqualifies her from coverage under the \u201carising out of\u2019 criterion, when the COPD was not the sole cause of her claimed injury, but was allegedly aggravated by a work-related risk, would be antithetical to the principles and policies we have described. Accordingly, we conclude that Sexton\u2019s alleged injury arose out of the employment, and we reverse the judgment dismissing her petition against her employer and the Fund. We remand to the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
