On appeal, he raises the following arguments in a pro se brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">APPELLANT ARGUES THAT THE VISITATION RULES, REGULATIONS, POLICIES, AND PROCEDURES PROMULGATED BY THE DOC AT THE SPECIAL TREATMENT UNITS ARE EXCESSIVELY RESTRICTIVE WITHIN A CIVIL COMMITMENT FACILITY AND VIOLATE HIS RIGHT TO MARITAL PRIVACY WITH HIS LAWFUL SPOUSE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">APPELLANT ARGUES THAT A STATE AGENCYS RELIANCE ON A CIVIL STATUTE TO DISENFRANCHISE HIM FROM HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS VIOLATES HIS 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th, 13th and 14th AMENDMENT RIGHTS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">APPELLANT ARGUES THAT HE HAS A RIGHT TO MARITAL PRIVACY AND FREEDOM FROM GOVERNMENT INTRUSION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">Following our review of R.R.\u2019s arguments in light of the record in the matter and applicable legal precedent, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">The record on appeal discloses that, after R.R. had been temporarily committed to the STU and while he was awaiting a final adjudication on the State\u2019s commitment petition, he filed a marriage application with the STU administration, which was subsequently granted. A marriage between R.R. and L.A. took place on September 17, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">On May 20, 2005, R.R. requested that the Department of Corrections (DOC) grant him \u201cmarital privacy and conjugal visitation.\u201d That request was denied as unauthorized, as were requests in 2006 and 2007. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-16\">On appeal, R.R. first challenges the State\u2019s failure to adopt regulations explicitly governing visitation at the STU, and the alleged determination by the Commissioner of the DOC to \u201cmerely clone ... pre-existing prison-penal visitation rules, regulations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>and policies set forth in the NJ Administrative Code.\u201d In this regard, R.R. notes that relevant provisions of the Sexually Violent Predator Act (SVPA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.24 to -27.38, require that the rules of conduct applicable to persons subject to involuntary commitment as sexually violent predators \u201cshall be established by regulation promulgated jointly by the Commissioner of Human Services and the Commissioner of Corrections in consultation with the Attorney General.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.34(d). That statute further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">The regulations promulgated under this subsection shall take into consideration the rights of patients as set forth in <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.2, governing rights of the mentally ill, tuberculosis, and mentally retarded], but shall specifically address the differing needs and specific characteristics of, and treatment protocols relating to, sexually violent predators. In developing these regulations, the commissioners shall give due regard to security concerns and safety of residents, treatment staff, custodial personnel and others in and about the facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">\n<em>Ubid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">R.R. interprets this statute as expressing the Legislature\u2019s intent that \u201cthe DOC [not] merely use a civil statute as a tool to create another prison-penal institution under the fagade of a civil commitment treatment facility,\u201d but rather that it develop <em>\u201cnew </em>[visitation] rules, regulations, and policies that [a]re less restrictive than the prison-penal institution visitation program.\u201d R.R. further argues that he has a protected liberty interest in marital privacy and conjugal visitation, upon which the State has intruded as the result of \u201cthe miscarriages of the DOC.\u201d He states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">The State can not create a constitutionally protected liberty interest, such as marital privacy in non-penal environments, and then seek to bar appellant from the pursuit of life, liberty, happiness, privacy, and procreation associated with lawful marriage. Restrictions on visitation, like other prison regulations, violate the Constitution only if they have no reasonable relationship to any legitimate penalogical goal. <em>See Bellamy v. Bradley, </em>729 F.2d 416, 420 (6th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>845, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>156, 83 L.Ed.2d 93 (1984); <em>see also, Turner v. Safley, ... </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>78, 89, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2254, 96 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>64 (1987). There is no penalogical goal in a civil commitment statute, the goal is exclusively geared toward rehabilitation] and treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">R.R. is correct that regulations applicable to the STU, like those applicable to prisons, do not authorize conjugal visitation. However, if R.R. seeks to claim that regulations governing the operation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>of the STUs were improperly promulgated, without the required input of the Department of Human Services (DHS), that position would not be well-grounded, as both it and the DOC participated in establishing the applicable regulations, set forth at <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:36A-1.1 to -4.6, and when doing so, engaged in the appropriate rulemaking process. <em>See </em>Administrative Procedure Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-1 to -15 (setting forth notice and hearing requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The regulations, among other things, enumerate rights of residents at the STU that are not subject to denial, <em>see N.J.A.C. </em>10:36A-2.2, and ones that are deniable, <em>see N.J.A.C. </em>10:36A-2.3. Among the rights that may be curtailed pursuant to regulation is the right to privacy, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:36A-2.3(a)l, and the right to see visitors during regularly scheduled visiting hours, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:36A-2.3(a)6, \u201cwhen the Department of Corrections staff determines that such restrictions are necessary to protect the resident, other residents, staff, general public, or property, or to ensure the safe, secure and orderly operation of the facility, or for other good cause.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:36A-2.3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Conjugal visits do not appear specifically among either the undeniable or deniable rights. But although a commenter suggested during the rulemaking process that such rights should be recognized, that suggestion was rejected by the Departments, which responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">The facility officials are responsible to operate these Special Treatment Units designated for the custody, care and treatment of sexually-violent predators and have determined that the list of deniable and undeniable rights are appropriate and give due regard to security and safety concerns of residents and staff. The Departments disagree with the opinions of the commenter and that the additional rights suggested by the commenter should be added.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">[39 <em>N.J.R. </em>2249(a), Comment 22 (May 9, 2007).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">R.R. notes that, in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.34d, the Legislature directed those formulating the rules of conduct applicable to persons committed to the STU to take into consideration the rights of patients expressed in the Mental Health Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights, set forth at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.2. He further notes that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.2e(10) provides that such mental health patients have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>right to \u201csuitable opportunities for interaction with members of the opposite sex, with adequate supeivision.\u201d New Jersey decisions do not discuss whether such a right encompasses conjugal conduct. However, if it does, the recognition of such a right in the context of mental health patients does not mandate its similar recognition in the context of sexually violent predators civilly committed pursuant to the terms of the SVPA. Indeed, the Legislature explicitly recognized this proposition in the portion of the SVPA that we previously quoted, which permits a modification of the Mental Health Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights to \u201cspecifically address the differing needs and specific characteristics of and treatment protocols relating to sexually violent predators\u201d and to satisfy safety and security concerns in and about the STU. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.34d.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">An agency regulation is reviewed with a \u201cpresumption of reasonableness and validity.\u201d <em>In re Comm\u2019r of Ins.\u2019s Order Regarding the Rate Filing by the Mkt. Transition Facility, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>209, 221, 624 A.2d 565 (1993). Furthermore, an agency is entitled to deference with regard to statutory interpretation when formulating regulations because of its expertise in the specialized area that the regulation governs. <em>St. Peter\u2019s Univ. Hosp. v. Lacy, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>1, 12-13, 878 A.2d 829 (2005); <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands Protect. Act Rules, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>478, 488-89, 852 A.2d 1083 (2004). The burden lies with R.R. to demonstrate that the regulation is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. <em>Dougherty v. Dept. of Human Servs., Div. of Med. Assistance &amp; Health Servs., </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>1, 6, 449 A.2d 1235 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">In this appeal, R.R. has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that the prohibition of conjugal visits in the present context should be voided as unauthorized. <em>In re Taylor, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>644, 657, 731 A.2d 35 (1999). We have previously observed that: \u201cIndividuals are civilly committed under the [SVPA] because they pose a danger to the public health and safety due to their behavior.\u201d <em>In re Civil Commitment of J.H.M., </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>599, 610, 845 A.2d 139 (App.Div.2003) (citing <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>521 <em>U.S. </em>346, 357, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>2072, 2079-80, 138 L.Ed.2d 501, 512 (1997)), <em>certif. denied, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>312, 845 A.2d 137 (2004). They are likewise in need of treatment designed to modify their sexually violent behavior and thus reduce the danger that they pose to others. Both goals are fostered by a prohibition on conjugal visitation, since that prohibition eliminates one opportunity to engage in potentially sexually aggressive behavior, and ensures that treatment goals are not subverted by conduct that may be incompatible with those goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">R.R. argues that the regulations at issue violate the Legislature\u2019s intent that the agencies would draft new regulations specific to the STUs, rather than overlaying existing regulations that apply to correctional facilities. He claims that the regulations for STUs should be different from prison regulations because, at STUs, \u201cthe goal is exclusively geared toward rehabilitation] and treatment.\u201d However, R.R. is incorrect in claiming that treatment is an exclusive goal, rather than just one of the primary objectives of the SVPA. Security concerns remain after a sexually violent predator has been civilly committed. Were R.R.\u2019s contentions to be true, there would be no need for joint authority over the STUs by the DOC, which remains responsible for security, and the DHS, which is accorded responsibility for treatment. <em>In re Civil Commitment of J.H.M., supra, </em>367 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 609, 845 A.2d 139; <em>In re Civil Commitment of D.L. &amp; C.M., </em>351 <em>N. J.Super. </em>77, 80-81, 797 A.2d 166 (App.Div.2002), <em>certif denied, sub nom, In re Civil Commitment of David L., </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>373, 845 A.2d 1255 (2004); <em>In re Commitments of M.G. &amp; D.C., </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>365, 373, 751 A.2d 1101 (App.Div.2000). The Legislature has made it clear that the SVPA is meant, in part, to address \u201cthe need for commitment of those sexually violent predators who pose a danger to others should they be returned to society.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27-25e. The civil commitment statute, itself, is the product of \u201ca reasoned balance between the liberty interest of a committee in need of treatment for emotional disorders and protection of the citizenry from those who have demonstrated an inability to control their sexual violent behavior and are highly likely to re-offend.\u201d <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number><em>Civil Commitment of </em>395 <em>N.J.Super. </em>69, 97, 928 A.2d 102 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>222, 936 A.2d 969 (2007). As set forth in the Assembly Appropriations Committee Statement to Senate, No. 895, <em>L. </em>1998, c. 71:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">The Department of Corrections will be responsible for the operation of any facility designated for the custody, care and treatment of sexually violent predators, and will provide or arrange for custodial care. The Division of Mental Health Services in the Department of Human Services will provide or arrange for treatment tailored to address the specific needs of sexually violent predators.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-7\"><em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>30:30:4-27.34a and b (allocating responsibility for custody, care and treatment of sexually violent predators).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Involuntary commitment under the SVPA requires clear and convincing evidence that the individual is likely to reoffend, <em>State v. Bellamy, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>127, 136, 835 A.2d 1231 (2003), or in the language of the statute, is \u201clikely to engage in repeat acts of predatory sexual violence if not treated for [his or her] mental conditions.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.25a. The statute further states that: \u201c\u2018Likely to engage in acts of sexual violence\u2019 means the propensity of a person to commit acts of sexual violence is of such a degree as to pose a threat to the health and safety of others.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.26. The DOC\u2019s policy of denying conjugal visits is consistent with the purpose of protecting visitors from individuals whom the court has determined are likely to commit acts of sexual violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">Moreover, the ban on conjugal visits at STUs is consistent with the other regulations concerning visitors at the facilities, including restrictions on where visitors may go inside the STU and the types of physical contacts that are permitted. Even if such regulations were to mirror those in place at correctional institutions, they still reflect legislative intent. During the rulemaking process, a commenter expressed concern that STUs would be run as correctional facilities, rather than as treatment centers. 39 <em>N.J.R. </em>2249(a), Comment 2 (May 9, 2007). In response, the agencies noted that the Legislature had specifically put the DOC in charge of operating the facilities, and thus, \u201cthe law specifically addresses the need for such predators to be kept in a secure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>facility that is operated by the DOC, which is, in fact a law enforcement agency.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>While the Legislature may not have intended that the STUs be run strictly as correctional facilities (which they are not), it is clear that it intended that the DOC ensure the safety of visitors and others to the facility. The challenged regulations implement this goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">We note that, although conjugal visits are prohibited, R.R. is not denied other contacts with his spouse. The Residents\u2019 Guide to the STU permits visitation on Wednesday evenings and on the weekend. During that time, kissing and hugging can occur at the commencement and conclusion of the visit. Additionally, hand holding is allowed, and both visitors and residents are permitted to place their arms around the shoulders of others and to place their heads on another\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">R.R. argues additionally that his right to privacy and conjugal visits is constitutionally protected, and that the State has unconstitutionally deprived him of that right, thereby violating multiple constitutional provisions. In this regard, courts have held in a penal context that, while the right to marry is constitutionally protected, the right to conjugal visits and marital privacy during incarceration does not enjoy similar constitutional protection. <em>See, e.g., Kentucky Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Thompson, </em>490 <em>U.S. </em>454, 461, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1904, 1909, 104 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>506, 515 (1989) (holding that prisoner has no due process right to particular visitors); <em>Turner v.

The proper standard for determining whether a State has adequately protected the rights of an involuntarily committed individual requires that \u201cthe courts make certain that professional judgment in fact was exercised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2461, 73 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 41.

In a related context, the New Jersey Supreme Court in large measure rejected a challenge to the State\u2019s Megan\u2019s Laws, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-1 to 5 (registration) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-6 to -11 (notification), and in the course of doing so, addressed equal protection concerns under the Federal Constitution arising from distinctions between the treatment upon release of repetitive and compulsive sexual offenders and other State residents. <em>See Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 662 A.2d 367 (1995). In its decision, the Court recognized that \u201c[ejqual protection does not preclude the use of classifications, but requires only that those classifications not be arbitrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 662 A.2d 367 (citing <em>State v. Mortimer, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>517, 536, 641 A.2d 257, <em>cert. denied, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>970, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>440, 130 L.Ed.2d 351 (1994)). The Court further observed that sex offenders did not constitute a suspect class and held that \u201c[a] classification that does not impact a suspect class or impinge upon a fundamental constitutional right will be upheld if it is rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92, 662 A.2d 367 (citing <em>Brown v. City of Newark, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>113 <em>N.J. </em>565, 552 A.2d 125 (1989)). In this connection, the Court stated that, previously, it had \u201cspecifically held that creating a separate classification for repetitive-compulsive sex offenders is not arbitrary and \u2018has a rational basis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93, 662 A.2d 367 (citing <em>State v. Wingler, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>161, 176, 135 A.2d 468 (1957)). It then concluded that: \u201cThere is clearly no question but that the trial court was correct in its conclusion that \u2018[p]ublic safety is unquestionably within the Legislature\u2019s powers and protecting the public from recidivistie sex offenders is a legitimate state interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">We find constitutional principles applicable to the equal protection claims of repetitive and compulsive sexual offenders to be equally applicable in the present circumstances to R.R.\u2019s claim of denial of equal protection in the context of his conjugal and marital privacy rights. Similarly, we find that the policies implemented by the DOC when denying conjugal rights are rationally related to the security and rehabilitative goals of the STU. Clearly, the DOC has an interest in monitoring interaction between residents and visitors in order to ensure that contraband is not passed to residents, that safety is maintained, and that treatment goals are not compromised.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In a related Fourth Amendment context, in which the policy of conducting random searches of STU residents\u2019 rooms was challenged, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">The staff of the STU are not less entitled than employees of ... other psychiatric hospitals to the security afforded by inspections to \u201censure the patients are not in a position to harm either themselves or others.\u201d <em>[State v. Stott, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>343,] 362, 794 A.2d 120 [(2002)]. A patient in a psychiatric hospital cannot expect the hospital staff to relinquish control over the security of the patients\u2019 rooms. In the same manner, R.M. cannot expect the staff at the STU to forego measures that allow them to exercise security control over the area of his room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\"><em>[R.M. v. The Northern Regional Unit, </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>229, 236, 842 A.2d 308 (App.Div.2004).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Similar factors justify the restrictions imposed in this case, which we find to be rationally related to the security and rehabilitative goals of the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Although R.R. has challenged the restrictions imposed upon his marital privacy and conjugal rights on other constitutional grounds, as we have previously specified, we find none of his arguments in this regard to warrant further discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-14\"> R.R. had previously been convicted of three counts of first-degree aggravated sexual assault, which constituted the \"sexually violent offenses\" required as a predicate to his commitment. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.26 (definitions).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\"><em>But see Turay v.

Although the confinement is onerous and has some punitive impact, that impact is the 'inevitable consequence of the regulatory provisions.\u2019 ... That is, the impact is not solely attributable to a punitive legislative intent.\u201d <em>Bellamy, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 138, 835 A.2d 1231 (quoting <em>Doe v.

The Eighth Amendment does not apply when a State takes an action that is not the result of \"a formal adjudication of guilt in accordance with due process of law. Where the State seeks to impose punishment without such an adjudication, the pertinent constitutional guarantee is the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Ingraham v.
