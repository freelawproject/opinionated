In March 2007, he was indicted on federal charges alleging, among other things, that he obtained essentially \u201cno show\u201d jobs at the University of Medicine and Dentistry and Rutgers Law School-Camden, in exchange for using his official position to obtain public funding for those institutions. He was also accused of increasing his public pension by obtaining a position as counsel to a local board of social services but failing to personally perform the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>required legal work. He did not run for re-election and his last term as Senator ended in January 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">On December 21, 2007, Senator Bryant\u2019s counsel filed a request with ELEC for an advisory opinion as to whether campaign funds could be used to pay for his legal defense against the federal criminal charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On January 25, 2008, ELEC issued <em>Advisory Opinion No. 01-2008, </em>addressing the following question, as the agency phrased it: \u201cMay an elected officeholder use campaign funds from his single candidate committee to pay for legal expenses incurred in defense of a criminal indictment issued by the United States Attorney\u2019s office?\u201d ELEC answered the question in the negative, concluding that Senator Bryant\u2019s criminal defense costs were not \u201cordinary and necessary expenses of holding public office,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-11.2(a)(6), and that spending campaign funds for those costs would contravene a prohibition on expending campaign monies for legal fees that constitute \u201cpersonal use.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:25-6.10(b). <em>See also N.J.A.C. </em>19:25-6.5(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The New Jersey Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Reporting Act (Act), <em>N.J.S.A </em>19:44A-1 to -47, limits the use of campaign funds to certain specified purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">a. All contributions received by a candidate, candidate committee, a joint candidates committee or a legislative leadership committee shall be used only for the following purposes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">(1) the payment of campaign expenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-10\">(2) contributions to any charitable organization ... except any charitable organization of which the candidate or a member of the candidate\u2019s immediate family is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>paid officer, director or employee or receives compensation for goods or services provided to the organization;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">(3) transmittal to another candidate, candidate committee, or joint candidates committee, or to a political committee, continuing political committee, legislative leadership committee or political party committee, for the lawful use by such other candidate or committee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">(4) the payment of the overhead and administrative expenses related to the operation of the candidate committee or joint candidates committee of a candidate or a legislative leadership committee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">(5) the pro rata repayment of contributors; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">(6) <em>the payment of ordinary and necessary expenses of holding public office.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-11.2a (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">These limitations on the use of campaign funds were adopted in response to a report issued in 1990 by the Ad Hoc Commission on Legislative Ethics and Campaign Finance. The Commission was created to address \u201ccertain problems and public concerns\u201d with the then-current system of campaign finance, which the Commission found had led to \u201ca slow, yet insidious erosion of public confidence in the system which is harmful not only to the reputation of the Legislature, but also to the democratic tradition in this State.\u201d Among the problems the Commission identified were: \u201cThe allowable uses of political contributions are unclear and potentially open to abuse;\u201d and \u201cA public perception that legislators use their official positions to further their personal interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">The Commission Report also expressed the members\u2019 conclusion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-12\">political contributions were donated to a candidate or officeholder for one purpose only: to get that person elected or reelected. Hence, any other use of this money must be carefully controlled. Permitting funds to be converted for personal use poses clear ethical and legal difficulties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-13\">The Commission recognized that, while the Act at that time did not address permissible uses of campaign contributions, ELEC had adopted regulations (then codified as <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:25-7.2 and - 7.4) prohibiting candidates from converting campaign contributions to their personal use.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the Commission recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>mended that the issue also be addressed by statute. For that reason, the Commission recommended that legislation be adopted to restrict the use of political contributions to five purposes: payment of campaign-related expenses, charitable contributions, payment of campaign committee expenses, contributions to other candidates or political committees, and refunds to contributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">When legislation was introduced in 1992 to implement the Commission\u2019s recommendations, it initially limited the use of campaign contributions to those recommended by the Report. <em>See Sponsor\u2019s Statement to Assembly Bill No. 100, </em>at 37 (January 14, 1992); <em>Sponsor\u2019s Statement to Assembly Bill No. 196, </em>at 2 (January 14, 1992); <em>Sponsor\u2019s Statement to Assembly Bill No. 869, </em>at 37 (February 10, 1992). However, the legislation was subsequently amended before passage to add a provision permitting contributions to be used for \u201cthe payment of ordinary and necessary expenses of holding public office.\u201d <em>See Assembly State Government Committee, Statement to Assembly Committee Substitute for Assembly Bill Nos. 100, 195, 196, 64-6, 659 and 869 </em>(May 11, 1992). The final version of the legislation included this addition. <em>L. </em>1993, c. 65, \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">While there is little in the legislative history to explain the change, the legislation\u2019s original sponsor, Assemblyman Martin, stated in a contemporaneous interview that the Legislature had \u201csubstantially followed the recommendations\u201d of the Commission. In discussing the provision concerning excess campaign contributions, Assemblyman Martin indicated that \u201csuch funds could be ... used for the \u2018ordinary and necessary expenses of political life,\u2019 like traveling expenses to political events.\u201d Jay Romano, <em>Parties Join to Cap Campaign Donations, N.Y. Times, </em>May 24, 1992. The legislation was adopted thereafter and signed into law on March 8,1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Based on the legislative amendment, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-11.2a, ELEC, the agency statutorily charged with enforcing the Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-6, adopted a regulation specifically directed at the use of campaign contributions for legal expenses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That regulation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:25-6.10, provides a non-exhaustive list of permitted uses. It specifically allows the use of campaign funds for legal fees incurred in defending against certain civil actions, including defamation suits, suits for alleged violations of the Act, and ethics charges filed by the Legislature against one of its members. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:25-6.10(a)2 to (a)4. Use of funds to pay for the costs of defending against criminal charges is not included in the list, although it is not specifically prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">However, the regulation prohibits \u201cpersonal use\u201d of the funds. The regulation provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\"><em>Permissible me of funds for legal fees and expenses shall not include such fees and expenses </em>incurred in connection with the candidate or officeholder\u2019s personal or business affairs, or <em>which would othenmse qualify as \u201cpersonal me\u201d under N.J.AC. 19:25-6.5(c).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">[N.J.A.C. 19:25-6.10(b) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">In turn, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:25-6.5(e) defines \u201cpersonal use\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\">(c) The term \u201cpersonal use\u201d ... means any use of contributions to pay or fulfill a commitment, obligation or expense of any person that would arise or exist irrespective of the candidate\u2019s campaign or <em>irrespective of the candidate\u2019s ordinary and necessary expense </em>of holding public office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-10\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">The term \u201cordinary and necessary expenses\u201d is also defined in the regulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-12\">(a) The term \u201cordinary and necessary expenses of holding public office\u201d as used in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:25-6.5(a)6 means <em>any expense that reasonably promotes or carries out the responsibilities of a person holding elective public office, </em>except that no funds received by a candidate, candidate committee, or joint candidates committee shall be used for the payment of any expense arising from the furnishing, staffing or operation of an office used in connection with the officeholder\u2019s official duties as an elected public official.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>19:25-6.7(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Appellant contends that the Act and its implementing regulations should be construed consistent with the way the Federal Election Commission (FEC) has construed the Federal Election Campaign Act, 2 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 431 to 455. As we will later explain, we find no basis to follow the federal scheme. Nonetheless, we address the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The FEC permits the use of campaign funds to pay for defense against criminal charges, so long as the charges relate to \u201cthe candidate\u2019s campaign activities or duties as a Federal officeholder.\u201d <em>See, e.g., FEC Advisory Opinion 2005-11; FEC Advisory Opinion 2003-17. </em>The federal statute, however, is phrased differently than the Act. Although, like the Act, it prohibits using campaign funds for \u201cpersonal use,\u201d the federal law also permits expenditures in a general catchall category, \u201cany other lawful purpose\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\">(\u0430) Permitted uses. A contribution accepted by a candidate, and any other donation received by an individual as support for activities of the individual as a holder of Federal office, may be used by the candidate or individual\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\">(1) for otherwise authorized expenditures in connection with the campaign for Federal office of the candidate or individual;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">(2) <em>for ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in connection mth duties of the individual as a holder of Federal office;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-10\">(3) for contributions to an organization described in section 170(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 <em>U.S.C.S. </em>\u00a7 170(c)];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-11\">(4) for transfers, without limitation, to a national, State, or local committee of a political party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-12\">(5) for donations to State and local candidates subject to the provisions of State law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-13\">(\u0431) <em>for any other lawful purpose unless prohibited by subsection (b) of this section.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_s\">[2 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 439a(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-14\">In turn subsection (b) defines and lists prohibited personal uses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-15\">(1) In general. A contribution or donation described in subsection (a) shall not be converted by any person to personal use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-16\">(2) Conversion. For the purposes of paragraph (1), a contribution or donation shall be considered to be converted to personal use if the contribution or amount is used to fulfill <em>any </em>commitment, obligation, or <em>expense </em>of a person <em>that would exist irrespective of the candidate\u2019s election campaign or individual\u2019s duties as a holder of Federal office, </em>including\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>(A) a home mortgage, rent, or utility payment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">(B) a clothing purchase;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">(C) a noncampaign-related automobile expense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">(D) a country club membership;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\">(E) a vacation or other noncampaign-related trip;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-10\">(F) a household food item;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-11\">(G) a tuition payment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-12\">(H) admission to a sporting event, concert, theater, or other form of entertainment not associated with an election campaign; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-13\">(I) dues, fees, and other payments to a health club or recreational facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-14\">[2 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 439a(b) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-15\">Based on the federal statute, the FEC has adopted regulations concerning use of campaign funds for \u201cnon-campaign\u201d expenses. However, reflecting its enabling legislation, the FEC regulations are considerably broader than the ELEC regulations in allowing use of the funds for \u201cany other lawful purpose\u201d so long as it is not a prohibited personal use. Campaign funds \u201c[m]ay be used to defray any ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the recipient\u2019s duties as a holder of Federal office,\u201d 11 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 113.2(a), including work-related travel, donation to other state or federal political organizations, or \u201cany other lawful purpose, unless such use is personal use under 11 <em>CFR </em>113.1(g).\u201d 11 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 113.2(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-16\">\u201cPersonal use\u201d is defined as it is in the federal statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-17\">Personal use means any use of funds in a campaign account of a present or former candidate to fulfill a commitment, obligation or <em>expense of any person that would exist irrespective of the candidate\u2019s campaign or duties as a Federal officeholder.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADh\">[11 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 113.1(g) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-18\">Unlike ELEC, the FEC has not adopted regulations addressing the use of campaign funds for legal expenses. Rather, it has chosen to address those uses entirely on a case by ease basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab\">(ii) The Commission will determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether other uses of funds in a campaign account fulfill a commitment, obligation or expense that would exist irrespective of the candidate\u2019s campaign or duties as a Federal officeholder, and therefore are personal use. Examples of such other uses include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-19\">(A) Legal expenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-20\">[11 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 113.1(g)(1)(n).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Moreover, the federal law and FEC\u2019s regulations define \u201cpersonal use\u201d in a way that is significantly different from ELEC\u2019s definition. Federal regulations prohibit use of campaign funds to fulfill obligations or expenses \u201cthat would exist irrespective of the candidate\u2019s ... <em>duties as a federal officeholder.\u201d </em>11 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 113.1(g) (emphasis added). <em>See </em>2 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 439a(b). The ELEC regulations define \u201cpersonal use\u201d as use of the funds to pay expenses \u201cthat would arise or exist ... irrespective of the candidate\u2019s <em>ordinary and necessary expense of holding public office.\u201d N.J.A.C. </em>19:25-6.5(c) (emphasis added). We conclude that the difference in wording is fatal to Senator Bryant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Defending against criminal charges might be an obligation that would not exist \u201cirrespective of\u2019 an officeholder\u2019s carrying out the duties of his or her elected office (albeit in an allegedly corrupt manner), but <em>would </em>exist \u201cirrespective of\u2019 the individual\u2019s \u201cordinary and necessary expense\u201d of the office. Even in an era when public officials are being called with increasing frequency to answer criminal charges of corruption in office, their legal defense costs could hardly be described as an \u201cordinary\u201d expense of office-holding. This view is also consistent with ELEC\u2019s definition of an \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d expense as \u201cany expense that reasonably promotes or carries out the responsibilities of a person holding elective public office.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:25-6.7(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">While appellant urges that ELEC should have looked to the federal law, and its construction by the FEC, the history of the Act and its 1993 amendments does not indicate that our Act was modeled on the federal law. Instead, the 1993 amendments were based on the Commission Report, which recommended strict limits on the use of campaign funds. Although the federal and state enactments do share some of the same terminology, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>federal law is more broadly worded and, as discussed above, there are significant differences in the implementing regulations adopted by ELEC and FEC. Moreover, as appellant concedes, the history of the ELEC regulations is void of any indication that ELEC modeled its regulations after the FEC rules. Therefore, we find that appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Town Tobacconist v. Kimmelman, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>85, 99-100, 462 A.2d 573 (1983), and <em>GATX Terminals Corp. v. Dep\u2019t of Environmental Protection, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>46, 53-54, 429 A.2d 355 (1981), is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">When ELEC adopted <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:25-6.7, defining the ordinary and necessary expenses of holding public office, the agency\u2019s published comments stated its goal of \u201c[promoting] public confidence in the integrity of the electoral system and its financing.\u201d 26 <em>N.J.R. </em>2754 (July 5, 1994). In adopting <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:25-6.10, governing the use of campaign funds for legal costs, ELEC indicated that the rule was intended to \u201cpromote public confidence that contributed campaign funds are being expended in accordance with campaign and officeholding purposes.\u201d 29 <em>N.J.R. </em>5056(a) (Dec. 1, 1997). These policies are consistent with the general goals of the Act as reflected in its legislative history. \u201cRegulations adopted by an agency pursuant to a legislative mandate are presumed to be valid. We will defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute unless it is \u2018plainly unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reilly v. AAA Mid-Atlantic Ins. Co. of New Jersey, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>474, 485, 946 A.2d 564 (2008) (citations omitted); <em>Merin v. Maglaki, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>430, 436-37, 599 A.2d 1256 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">There is nothing \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d in ELEC\u2019s construction of the Act or in the agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:25-6.10. We find no reason to depart here from our usual rule of deference to the agency\u2019s construction of the legislation it is charged with enforcing. <em>See In re Contest of the Democratic Primary Election of June 3, 2003, </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261, 281, 842 A.2d 820 (App.Div.2004).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Appellant urges that ELEC\u2019s opinion is inconsistent with the agency\u2019s prior advisory opinions permitting expenditure of campaign funds for a candidate\u2019s legal defense in certain civil actions, and is inconsistent with the regulation reflecting those opinions, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:25-6.10. In particular, appellant contends that the agency previously permitted campaign funds to be used to defend against a potential libel action threatened by a political rival, and to defend a State Senator against ethics charges filed at the behest of a lobbying group.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In a very brief letter dated April 3, 1980, the agency\u2019s legal counsel responded to a request for an advisory opinion on behalf of several candidates for municipal office \u201cconcerning the application of [former] <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:25-7.2 to attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in respect to a threatened libel suit.\u201d The threat occurred during a municipal election campaign and was directed at the candidates because of statements made in their campaign materials. They inquired as to whether they could use campaign funds to pay legal expenses incurred in settling the dispute during the campaign. In that limited context, the agency\u2019s legal counsel advised the inquirer that the expenditure was permissible \u201c[i]n view of the relationship of the threatened litigation to the election campaign.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">In <em>Advisory Opinion No. 18-1995, </em>dated January 4, 1996, the agency permitted Senator Cardinale to use campaign funds to defend himself against an ethics complaint pending before the Joint Legislative Committee on Ethical Standards. The complaint was initiated by the New Jersey Chiropractic Society \u201cconcerning a fundraising solicitation\u201d for a political action committee. ELEC concluded that \u201c[s]ince candidate committee funds may be used to achieve election to office, it appears consistent that <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-11.2a(6)] be understood to permit use of those same funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>for an officeholder to defend his fitness for office before the very body that has specific statutory authority to adjudicate that fitness.\u201d The letter specifically indicated that \u201cnothing contained in this opinion is intended to serve as authority for permitting the use of candidate committee funds for the legal defense of an officeholder facing any civil or criminal charge in any court of law or other forum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Neither of the advisory opinions on which appellant relies involved defense of a criminal prosecution. Moreover, both matters involved civil charges filed by private groups or individuals for arguably partisan reasons. The libel charges arose during an election campaign and were lodged by a political rival; defense against the allegations could fairly be characterized as an expense of the municipal candidates\u2019 campaign. Similarly, the ethics charges against Senator Cardinale were initiated by a private interest group. Neither matter is comparable to a criminal prosecution filed by the United States Attorney, and even if they had some binding precedential value, neither advisory opinion would preclude ELEC from reaching a different result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Nor does <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:25-6.10(a), which is consistent with those advisory opinions, preclude the result reached here. However, we need not decide whether the civil legal expenses permitted by section 6.10(a) are consistent with the Act. That issue is not before us on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Finally, while we affirm the agency\u2019s decision, we observe that in light of the importance of the issue, both those subject to the Act and the public at large might be well-served if the agency were to adopt a regulation addressing the use of campaign funds to pay for criminal defense costs, instead of leaving the matter to case-by-case adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-13\"> The request to ELEC was made in a letter from counsel for \"State Senator Wayne Bryant.\u201d This appeal was filed by the Senator\u2019s single candidate campaign committee, the Friends of Senator Wayne R. Bryant. No issue has been raised as to the organization\u2019s standing to prosecute this appeal.
