Accordingly, the State police, at the direction of the Attorney General, conducted an investigation of Santiago\u2019s background, commonly referred to as a four-way investigation. <em>See Nero v. Hyland, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>213, 217 n. 1, 224, 386 A.2d 846 (1978). The investigation includes \u201ca check of the F.B.I. \u2018rap sheet,\u2019 State Police records, and interviews of all persons with information relevant to the purposes of the check.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217 n. 1, 386 A.2d 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">Plaintiffs have sued the State and various State employees, raising constitutional, statutory and common-law claims. Among those claims are plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that they were retaliated against for reasons related to Santiago\u2019s four-way investigation. Consequently, during the course of discovery, plaintiffs requested the release of the four-way investigation report. Defendants refused plaintiffs\u2019 requests, asserting that the four-way investigation report was exempt from public disclosure based on executive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>privilege. On August 23, 2007, the trial court ordered the release of redacted portions of the report, and subsequently denied defendants\u2019 motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">On leave granted, we reverse. Plaintiffs either have not shown the requisite interest to entitle them to disclosure of the privileged documents that constitute the four-way investigation report, or to the extent that such interest has been demonstrated, their interests do not outweigh the public\u2019s interest in keeping the report confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Three sets of plaintiffs with varying degrees of involvement in the four-way investigation filed lawsuits alleging that defendants retaliated against them by transferring them to other units and by failing to promote them. The trial court consolidated the lawsuits for discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The \u201cPiniero\u201d plaintiffs, Fernando Piniero, Paul DeHope, Joseph Soulias and John Morales, claim that they were discriminated against in their employment on the basis of race because they refused to engage in racial profiling at the direction of their supervisors. They further assert that they were retaliated against for refusing to engage in illegal and criminal activities, and for informing their superiors \u201cabout violations of law and policy within the [New Jersey State Police].\u201d Their claims are based on allegations of a continuing course of conduct that began prior to the Santiago investigation. Although these plaintiffs were not involved in the Santiago investigation, they allege they were retaliated against as a result of their association with the Kushnir plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The \u201cKushnir\u201d plaintiffs, David Kushnir, Thomas Primo, and Dennis Veechiarelli, had been assigned to the State Police Organized Crime Unit. They allege that defendants retaliated against them because they reported information received from confidential sources that Santiago had ties to organized crime, and he had been using on-duty Newark police officers to construct a home. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>They memorialized their findings in a series of \u201cInvestigator\u2019s Reports\u201d that they submitted to their superiors. These plaintiffs were not involved in the four-way investigation; however, they assert \u201cupon information and belief,\u201d that \u201cmuch of the information\u201d that they uncovered was \u201csimultaneously uncovered by the individuals conducting the Four-Way investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The \u201cTemple\u201d plaintiffs, Martin Temple, Marco Peralta and Thomas Suscewicz, were assigned to the State Police Special Investigations Unit (the SIU), which conducts the four-way investigations. During the course of the Santiago investigation, some of the information was leaked to the press. The Temple plaintiffs allege that Santiago called Temple during the investigation and stated that \u201csomeone (in the SIU) was going to pay for leaking information about his background investigation to the press.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In May 2005, the trial court granted the Kushnir plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel discovery, ordering defendants to produce Santiago and former Attorney General Peter Harvey for depositions and to provide \u201cfully responsive answers to plaintiffs\u2019 paper discovery demands.\u201d Defendants moved to set aside the court\u2019s order, claiming it would require disclosure of the \u201chighly confidential internal reports relating to, and the results of, the \u2018four way\u2019 check of Santiago.\u201d The trial court granted defendants\u2019 request to exclude the four-way investigation report without prejudice to plaintiffs to establish a predicate through deposition testimony that demonstrated their need for the report.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">After partially completing depositions, plaintiffs made a motion for the results of the four-way investigation. This time the court ordered defendants to produce \u201cthe four-way investigation\u201d for use in depositions, subject to the following restrictions: only counsel submitting a certification of confidentiality, which would be contained in a consent protective order, could be present during depositions where the report was used, and plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>themselves could not attend the depositions. The next day, the court filed the consent protective order that it had prepared, setting terms for the use and disclosure of the documents; counsel for all the parties were required to sign the document. Despite the court\u2019s order prohibiting plaintiffs from attending depositions in which the four-way investigation would be used, the protective order permitted disclosure of the report to all parties. In addition to attorneys of record and any parties to the action, the protective order permitted disclosure of the \u201cconfidential\u201d documents to \u201cexperts, investigators or other persons retained by any party,\u201d persons who prepared the report, persons to whom the report was addressed or delivered, any \u201cdesignated representative\u201d of defendants, \u201cwho is questioned about the document at a deposition,\u201d and any \u201cwitness or potential witness\u201d who the attorneys \u201cwish to question\u201d about the report. The court did not specify what documents, out of nearly 4000 that had been produced for in camera review, constituted the \u201cfour-way investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">We granted defendants leave to appeal. In an unpublished opinion, <em>Piniero v. N.J. Div. of State Police, </em>A-2273-06, 2007 WL 1556290 (App.Div. May 31, 2007), we remanded the case to the trial court to clarify what documents it was referring to in the order requiring the release of the four-way investigation. We also directed the court to review the documents under the balancing test enunciated in <em>Nero, supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>213, 386 A.2d 846; and, if the court determined that the four-way investigation report should be released, to redact the identities of confidential sources of information to the extent possible without destroying the utility of the report for plaintiffs\u2019 use in depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Following the remand, the trial court delineated the documents that comprised the four-way investigation, redacted them, and ordered their release. It found that plaintiffs demonstrated the requisite interest in the report \u201cin that their participation in the investigation is the alleged impetus for the retaliatory action allegedly taken by Joseph Santiago against them;\u201d .and that \u201cthe public interest in protecting investigators from retaliation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>conducting their duties weighs heavily in allowing plaintiffs an opportunity to establish their case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Against this factual and procedural background, we examine the court\u2019s decision to release the four-way investigation report pursuant to plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests. We begin with the well-established principle that requests for discovery are to be liberally construed and accorded the broadest possible latitude to ensure that the ultimate outcome of litigation will depend on the merits in light of the available facts. <em>Shanley &amp; Fisher, P.C. v. Sisselman, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>200, 216, 521 A.2d 872 (App.Div.1987). \u201cLiberal procedures for discovery in preparation for trial are essential to any modern judicial system in which the search for truth in aid of justice is paramount and in which concealment and surprise are not to be tolerated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215, 521 A.2d 872 (internal quotation omitted). A trial court has broad discretion in determining the scope of discovery. <em>Axelrod v. CBS Publ\u2019ns, </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>359, 372, 448 A.2d 1023 (App.Div.1982). Consequently, the trial court\u2019s decisions regarding discovery are normally given deference by a reviewing court, and will not be upset on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or a mistaken understanding of the applicable law. <em>Payton v. N.J. Tpk. Auth., </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>524, 559, 691 A.2d 321 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Nevertheless, the parties\u2019 discovery rights are not unlimited. They may obtain discovery \u201cregarding any matter <em>not privileged.\u201d R. </em>4:10-2(a) (emphasis added). Thus, here, we must balance plaintiffs\u2019 right to discovery against the \u201ccommon-law qualified privilege [ ] variously referred to as the \u2018official information,\u2019 \u2018governmental,\u2019 or \u2018executive\u2019 privilege,\u201d which, in New Jersey, finds expression in both the statutes and the evidence rules. <em>Loigman v. Kimmelman, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>98, 107, 505 A.2d 958 (1986) (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-27; <em>Evid. R. </em>34, currently designated as <em>N.J.R.E. </em>515). Because these privileges run counter to the theory that the fullest disclosure of the facts will best lead to the truth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>courts generally construe them narrowly in favor of admitting relevant evidence. <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena Issued, to Galasso, </em>389 <em>N.J.Super. </em>281, 297, 913 A.2d 78 (App.Div.2006). Thus, the executive privilege is not absolute. <em>River Edge Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Hyland, </em>165 <em>N.J.Super. </em>540, 544, 398 A.2d 912 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>58, 404 A.2d 1157 (1979). Courts must balance the interests of the litigants and the public. <em>McClain v. Coll. Hosp., </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>346, 353, 492 A.2d 991 (1985); <em>see also Loigman, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 104-05, 107-08, 505 A.2d 958 (explaining the balancing of interests in which a court must engage before allowing a party access to confidential government documents).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Determining the appropriate balance of public and private interests requires the trial judge to conduct an \u201c \u2018exquisite weighing process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108, 505 A.2d 958 (quoting <em>Beck v. Bluestein, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>247, 263, 476 A.2d 842 (App.Div.1984)). \u201c[I]n civil cases in which disclosure is sought not to aid in the defense of criminal charges, but for the purpose of asserting claims for money damages, the interests of the State in maintaining ... confidentiality ... are entitled to a greater degree of respect.\u201d <em>Cashen v. Spann, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>541, 556, 334 A.2d 8 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 <em>U.S. </em>829, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>48, 46 L.Ed.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The principles guiding the release of a four-way investigation were expounded in <em>Nero, supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>213, 386 A.2d 846. The plaintiff, Nero, was a prospective gubernatorial appointee. <em>Id. </em>at 216, 386 A.2d 846. The governor chose not to appoint him to the position because the Attorney General was concerned with information revealed by the four-way investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 217, 386 A.2d 846. When the plaintiff, \u201cpresumably in order to defend his reputation,\u201d demanded disclosure of the report produced as a result of the investigation, the Attorney General considered it confidential and would not release it. <em>Id. </em>at 217, 386 A.2d 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The Court found that the report fell within the common law definition of a public record. <em>Id. </em>at 221-23, 386 A.2d 846. Under the common law rule, a citizen is entitled to inspect public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>documents provided he or she \u201cshows the requisite interest\u201d in them. <em>Id. </em>at 222, 386 A.2d 846 (quoting <em>Ferry v. Williams, </em>41 <em>N.J.L. </em>332, 334 (Sup.Ct.1879)). While the Court recognized that the plaintiff in <em>Nero </em>had a cognizable interest in the report, the existence of his interest alone did not give him an absolute right to the document. <em>Id. </em>at 223, 386 A.2d 846. The plaintiffs interest in disclosure had to be balanced against the public\u2019s interest in the confidentiality of the documents. <em>Id. </em>at 224, 386 A.2d 846. After balancing the competing interests, the Court found the public interest in the confidentiality of the four-way investigation outweighed the nominee\u2019s interest in defending his reputation. <em>Id. </em>at 226, 386 A.2d 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The Court explained that the main reason for the effectiveness of the investigation is that those offering information are assured anonymity, and disclosure of the report would have a \u201cchilling effect,\u201d preventing persons with knowledge of the appointee\u2019s unsuitability for office from coming forward. <em>Id. </em>at 224, 386 A.2d 846. Thus, confidentiality is vital because it both protects government sources of information and enhances the effectiveness of investigative techniques. <em>Id. </em>at 225, 386 A.2d 846. The public also has a vital interest in the effectiveness of the Governor\u2019s decision-making process; the privilege protects that interest by insulating the Governor\u2019s decision-making process, allowing the Governor to make decisions \u201cfreely and effectively under a mantle of privacy and security.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225-26, 386 A.2d 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\"><em>Nero, </em>however, \u201cdoes not ... sustain an absolute privilege of secrecy for all ... investigative materials\u201d in the possession of the Attorney General. <em>Loigman, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 103-04, 505 A.2d 958. The <em>Nero </em>\u201copinion made clear ... that there [is] no fixed rule for determining whether disclosure is appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104, 505 A.2d 958. Consequently, a court should balance, in each case, the individual\u2019s right to the information against the public interest in the confidentiality of the information. <em>Ibid. </em>The balancing process must be concretely focused upon the relative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>interests of the parties in relation to the specific materials requested. <em>McClain, supra, 99 N.J. </em>at 361, 492 A.2d 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">In <em>Loigman, supra, </em>in which the Court was called upon to \u201cbalance the citizen\u2019s right of access to official information with the government\u2019s need for confidentiality in the conduct of law-enforcement investigations,\u201d 102 <em>N.J. </em>at 101, 505 A.2d 958, the Court suggested factors a trial court should consider in performing its balancing function:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">(1) the extent to which disclosure will impede agency functions by discouraging citizens from providing information to the government; (2) the effect disclosure may have upon persons who have given such information, and whether they did so in reliance that their identities would <em>not be </em>disclosed; (3) the extent to which agency self-evaluation, program improvement, or other decision-making will be chilled by disclosure; (4) the degree to which the information sought includes factual data as opposed to evaluative reports of policymakers; (5) whether any findings of public misconduct have been insufficiently corrected by remedial measures instituted by the investigative agency; and (6) whether any agency disciplinary or investigatory proceedings have arisen that may circumscribe the individual\u2019s asserted need lor the materials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 113, 505 A.2d 958.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Within the framework of these tenets, we now turn to the individual groups of plaintiffs to evaluate their entitlement to disclosure of the documents that constitute the four-way investigation. In permitting discovery of the four-way investigation, the trial court grouped all plaintiffs together, and found that they had the requisite interest to warrant its release. The court further found that \u201cthe public interest in protecting investigators from retaliation for conducting their duties weighs heavily in allowing plaintiffs an opportunity to establish their case.\u201d We disagree with the court\u2019s reasoning for two primary reasons. First, the court mistakenly grouped all plaintiffs together; the separate groups of plaintiffs have different, if any, interests in the four-way investigation. Second, although we do not disagree with the court\u2019s conclusion that the public has an interest in protecting investigators from retaliation for doing their job, the analysis does not end there. That interest must be balanced against the effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>disclosure would have on the Governor\u2019s right to make decisions \u201cfreely and effectively under a mantle of privacy and security,\u201d <em>see Nero, supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 226, 386 A.2d 846, as well as the effect disclosure would have on the individuals interviewed who are asked to give opinions as to the fitness and character of the nominee. That said, we now turn to how these principles are applied to each set of plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">A. The Piniero Plaintiffs</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The Piniero plaintiffs were not involved in the Santiago investigation. They did not report any information to superiors related to Santiago that was incorporated in the four-way investigation. Their complaint alleges that they were discriminated against in their employment on the basis of race because they refused to engage in racial profiling at the direction of their supervisors; and that they were retaliated against for refusing to engage in illegal and criminal activities and for informing their superiors \u201cabout violations of law and policy within the [New Jersey State Police].\u201d They have demonstrated no nexus between their allegations of retaliation and the gathering of information for the four-way investigation or the fruits of that investigation. They simply claim that they were retaliated against because of their \u201cassociation\u201d with the Kushnir plaintiffs, who themselves were not involved in the four-way investigation. That does not constitute the requisite interest necessary to gain access to the four-way investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">B. The Kushnir Plaintiffs</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The Kushnir plaintiffs have also failed to demonstrate the requisite interest in the four-way investigation to justify its release to them. These plaintiffs were not involved in the four-way investigation. They allege that defendants retaliated against them because they reported information received from confidential sources that Santiago had ties to organized crime, and he had been using on-duty Newark police officers to construct a home. These plaintiffs memorialized their findings in a series of \u201cInvest\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>gator\u2019s Reports\u201d that they submitted to their superiors. Their assertion that, \u201cupon information and belief,\u201d \u201cmuch of the information\u201d that they uncovered was \u201csimultaneously uncovered by the individuals conducting the Four-Way investigation,\u201d may give them a cognizable interest in their own reports, but it does not give them the requisite interest to justify release of the four-way investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">They further argue that they \u201crequire the information contained in the Four-Way investigation to properly depose witnesses and to develop their theory that Santiago retaliated against [them] after learning of the information contained in the report.\u201d They have not, however, explained how the information in the four-way investigation, which, as noted, does not include the reports that they prepared, will assist them in deposing witnesses or developing their retaliation theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Furthermore, at least in part, these plaintiffs base their arguments on the theory that Santiago had knowledge of the contents of the four-way investigation, which led him to retaliate against them. The evidence does not show, however, that Santiago was aware of what the four-way investigation report stated or who the report identified as sources of information. To the contrary, at his deposition, Santiago denied ever seeing the report. Although Santiago was briefed by former Attorney General Harvey before his appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Harvey only \u201cidentified the areas that were explored during the four-way investigation,\u201d so that Santiago would be aware of potential questions related to these areas during the confirmation process. On this record, to assume that the contents of the four-way investigation will assist the Kushnir plaintiffs in preparing for depositions and developing their theory of retaliation is nothing more than speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">To the extent, however, that the Kushnir plaintiffs have demonstrated a requisite interest in the four-way investigation, for the same reasons as we will discuss with regard to the Temple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>plaintiffs, <em>infra </em>at pp. 210-12, 961 A.2d at pp. 10-11, the Kushnir plaintiffs\u2019 need for disclosure does not outweigh the public\u2019s need for confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">C. The Temple Plaintiffs</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The Temple plaintiffs were assigned to the SIU, which conducts the four-way investigations. Temple was the chief investigator assigned to Santiago\u2019s investigation; Suscewicz was his direct supervisor. As the preparers of the four-way investigation report, the Temple plaintiffs have demonstrated a requisite interest in the report; their interest, however, does not outweigh the vital public interest in ensuring anonymity and confidentiality for individuals who disclose information as part of the gubernatorial appointment process.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">These plaintiffs allege that Santiago stated \u201cthat someone [in the SIU] was going to pay for leaking information about his background investigation to the press.\u201d They assert that Santiago followed through with that threat by reassigning them to different positions. They argue that the four-way investigation report contains Santiago\u2019s direct threat to Temple. They also claim that the report will refute defendants\u2019 claims that plaintiffs were the source of leaks to the press; it will refresh their recollections as to facts supporting their claims; and the report itself forms the basis of defendants\u2019 alleged retaliation against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The primary flaw in the Temple plaintiffs\u2019 argument for release of the four-way investigation is that their request is based principally on their claim that they were retaliated against because the information in the report was leaked to the press; they do not claim with any specificity that they were retaliated against because of what their investigation disclosed. Put simply, they have failed to show how the contents of the report would lead to discoverable information regarding who, if anyone, in the SIU, leaked the information in the report to the press.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The Temple plaintiffs also claim that they require the report to refresh their recollections. They suggest that the report will allow them \u201cto booster their credibility\u201d and to \u201ctestify accurate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>ly.\u201d Plaintiffs do not explain, however, how the contents of the report will refresh their ability to testify with regard to the allegations that they were retaliated against because the report was leaked.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Nevertheless, even if the contents of the four-way investigation could somehow refresh the Temple plaintiffs\u2019 recollections as to what occurred when they were conducting the investigation, that benefit to plaintiffs in pursuing their civil suit is not sufficient to overcome the potential adverse effects that disclosure could have upon persons who provide confidential information. Simply because information is discoverable does not overcome the executive privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Individuals provide confidential information in reliance upon their identities not being disclosed. Disclosure would discourage individuals from providing confidential information that a governor may require to properly evaluate potential nominees for public office. As the Nero Court explained, the primary reason for the effectiveness of the investigative process is that those offering information are assured anonymity. 76 <em>N.J. </em>at 224, <em>386 </em>A.2d 846. Persons interviewed during the four-way investigation provide not only factual data, but also, in some cases, their personal opinions as to the nominee\u2019s fitness and character. Knowing that these opinions could become public would discourage many individuals from speaking candidly to investigators, if in fact they choose to speak to them at all. The disclosure of the investigation report would have a chilling effect, preventing persons with knowledge of the appointee\u2019s unsuitability for office from coming forward. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Here, on balance, plaintiffs have not overcome the vital public interest in confidentiality of the four-way investigation. The sources of the information obtained in the investigation must be confident that their identities will not be subject to public disclosure, that what they said will remain confidential, and that they will not be subject to retaliation for speaking honestly and freely.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">We add too that we have reviewed the documents as redacted by the trial court, but conclude that even as redacted, the informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>tion must remain confidential. Even with the redactions, the identities of the persons who provided the information would be easily discovered. Simply redacting their names and references to their positions or relationships with Santiago is insufficient to protect the identity of the individuals who supplied the confidential information from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">We are mindful, as the trial court correctly pointed out, that the investigators must be free from the threat of retaliation by their superiors for conducting the four-way investigation. If not, their ability to collect the information needed by the Governor to evaluate potential nominees would be substantially impaired. That concern is, however, significantly diminished, in that what occurred here, State police officers investigating the individual who would become their \u201cboss,\u201d appears to have been a one-time-only event. The parties have represented to this court that measures have been taken by State officials so that State police will no longer investigate gubernatorial nominees for Superintendent. Thus, although protecting the investigators from retaliation is a valid consideration, it does not outweigh the vital public interest in keeping the investigation confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In sum, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by releasing the report. To the extent that plaintiffs have an interest in the report, their interests do not outweigh the potential chilling effect disclosure of the report would have upon persons with knowledge of a potential appointee\u2019s unsuitability for office from coming forward. Accordingly, we reverse the order permitting disclosure of the four-way investigation report.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\"> All proceedings before the trial court were conducted under seal. Consequently, plaintiffs have not been provided with the four-way investigation report.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
