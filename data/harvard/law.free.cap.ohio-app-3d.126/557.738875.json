Young, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">Defendant-appellant, Dillon Sargent, appeals his convictions for aggravated arson in violation of R.C. 2909.02(A)(1) and felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">On October 2, 1996, at approximately 9:15 a.m., the Middletown Fire Department was called to extinguish a fire in a residence located at 1902 Baltimore Street in Middletown, Ohio. When fire fighters arrived on the scene, the home was extensively involved in fire, and it took approximately thirty to thirty-five minutes to control the Are. The residence was occupied by Helen Tarbox, who was renting the home at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-14\">Tarbox testified that at approximately 9:00 a.m. on the morning of the fire, she was awakened from sleep by appellant, her former live-in boyfriend. Tarbox stated that appellant was \u201cbanging on the [back] door,\u201d demanding that she move a washing machine that was blocking the door and let him inside. When she arrived home from work earlier that morning, Tarbox had filled a washing machine with water and clothes and placed it in front of the back door in order to keep appellant from entering. According to Tarbox, she told appellant to go away and leave her alone because their relationship was over. When Tarbox <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>returned to her bedroom and reached for the telephone to call the police, she heard appellant\u2019s truck start and leave the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Upon hearing appellant\u2019s truck start, Tarbox lay down on her bed for a few minutes and then got up and entered the bathroom, which is near the back door. Tarbox noticed a strange odor, looked out her bathroom window, and saw flames. Tarbox ran into her bedroom, called 911, and then ran out the front door of the home to a neighbor\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">On December 17, 1996, appellant was indicted by the Butler County Grand Jury for aggravated arson and attempted murder in connection with the fire at Tarbox\u2019s residence. The indictment also alleged that appellant was a repeat violent offender. Following a jury trial, appellant was found guilty of aggravated arson and felonious assault.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court subsequently held a hearing regarding appellant\u2019s status as a repeat violent offender, and on May 1, 1997, found appellant to be a repeat violent offender. The trial court sentenced appellant to ten years\u2019 incarceration for aggravated arson and eight years\u2019 imprisonment for felonious assault, to run concurrently. In addition, the trial court increased appellant\u2019s respective sentences by ten years based upon the court\u2019s determination that appellant was a repeat violent offender. Therefore, appellant was sentenced to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment for aggravated arson and eighteen years\u2019 imprisonment for felonious assault, to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Appellant now appeals, setting forth the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of defendanNappellant when it found that he was a repeat violent offender.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant-appellant when it introduced certain documents into evidence at the repeat violent offender hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">Assignment of Error No. 3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-13\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of defendanfi-appellant when it found that the repeat violent offender statute was constitutional as it applied to Sargent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">Assignment of Error No. 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-15\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant-appellant when it allowed testimony regarding other acts to be admitted into evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>In his first assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred by finding that he was a repeat violent offender (\u201cRVO\u201d). Appellant argues that he could not be classified as an RVO because he did not previously commit an act that is substantially similar to one of the crimes enumerated in R.C. 2929.01(EE)(2)(a)(i). Appellant also argues that because the crime upon which the trial court\u2019s RVO determination was based was committed while he was a juvenile, the state must bear the burden of proving that the juvenile court either relinquished its jurisdiction over him or made the requisite findings in accordance with R.C. 2929.01(EE)(2)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">R.C. 2929.01(EE) describes a \u201crepeat violent offender\u201d as a person who satisfies both of the following criteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">\u201c(1) The person has been convicted of or has pleaded guilty to, and is being sentenced for committing, for complicity in committing, or for an attempt to commit, aggravated murder, murder, involuntary manslaughter, a felony of the first degree other -than one set forth in Chapter 2925. of the Revised Code, a felony of the first degree set forth in Chapter 2925. of the Revised Code that involved an attempt to cause serious physical harm to a person or that resulted in serious physical harm to a person, or a felony of the second degree that involved an attempt to cause serious physical harm to a person or that resulted in serious physical harm to a person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">\u201c(2) Either of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">\u201c(a) The person previously was convicted of or pleaded guilty to, and served a prison term for, any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">\u201c(i) Aggravated murder, murder, involuntary manslaughter, rape, felonious sexual penetration in violation of former section 2907.12 of the Revised Code, a felony of the first or second degree that resulted in the death of a person or in physical harm to a person, or complicity in or an attempt to commit any of those offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-10\">\u201c(ii) An offense under an existing or former law of this state, another state, or the United States that is or was substantially equivalent to an offense listed under division (EE)(2)(a)(i) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-11\">\u201c(b) The person previously was adjudicated a delinquent child for committing an act that if committed by an adult would have been an offense listed in division (EE)(2)(a)(i) or (ii) of this section, the person was committed to the department of youth services for that delinquent act, and the juvenile court in which the person was adjudicated a delinquent child made a specific finding that the adjudication should be considered a conviction for purposes of a determination in the future pursuant to this chapter as to whether the person is a repeat violent offender.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Following a hearing on the matter, at which evidence and testimony were presented, the trial court determined that appellant was an RVO and sentenced him accordingly. The trial court\u2019s finding was based upon appellant\u2019s 1966 convictions in Kentucky for two counts of robbery for which appellant was sentenced to ten years in prison. The trial court found that appellant\u2019s Kentucky convictions for robbery were substantially equivalent to a conviction in Ohio for robbery pursuant to the provisions contained in R.C. 2911.02(A)(2), a second degree felony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The record indicates that in 1966, when appellant was approximately seventeen years old,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he was convicted of robbery in Laurel Circuit Court in Kentucky. The record indicates that appellant and a co-defendant either attempted or threatened to cause physical harm to several victims during the robberies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The documents submitted at the RVO hearing indicate that although appellant was a juvenile when the offenses were committed, his case was \u201ccertified\u201d to the Laurel Circuit Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The record further indicates that appellant was indicted by the Laurel County Grand Jury for armed robbery and that he subsequently pled guilty to reduced charges of robbery. Appellant was sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment at the state reformatory in LaGrange, Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">After carefully reviewing the record of the RVO hearing and the documents and testimony presented, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s classification of appellant as an RVO. There is no question that appellant satisfied the first prong of the RVO classification in that he had been convicted of and was being sentenced for aggravated arson, a first degree felony involving an attempt to cause serious physical harm to another person. See R.C. 2929.01(EE)(1). In terms of the second prong which must be satisfied in order to classify a person as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>an RVO, the record indicates that in 1966 appellant was convicted of robbery in Kentucky, a crime which is substantially similar to the provisions of R.C. 2911.02(A)(2), which describes robbery, a second degree felony. See R.C. 2929.01(EE)(2)(a)(ii). Therefore, the record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that appellant satisfied the conditions of R.C. 2929.01(EE) and was an RVO.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In addition, we find that the state presented sufficient evidence pursuant to which the trial court could find that the Kentucky juvenile court relinquished its jurisdiction over appellant and that appellant was tried and convicted as an adult in Laurel Circuit Court in Kentucky. Appellant\u2019s juvenile case was certified to the Laurel Circuit Court, he was indicted by the Laurel County Grand Jury, and following his guilty plea to reduced charges of robbery, was sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment in a Kentucky state reformatory. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In his second assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred by admitting Kentucky police reports into evidence at the RVO hearing. Appellant argues that while the police reports may be considered ancient documents in accordance with the Rules of Evidence, they were not properly authenticated so as to be admissible at the RVO hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Generally, an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted constitutes hearsay and is not admissible at trial. Evid.R. 801(C) and 802. However, there are numerous exceptions to the hearsay rule that permit introduction of hearsay testimony or evidence. See Evid.R. 803 and 804. Evid.R. 803(16) recognizes an exception to the hearsay rule for certain ancient documents and provides that \u201c[statements in a document in existence twenty years or more the authenticity of which is established\u201d are not excluded by the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Documents are sufficiently authenticated so as to pass the threshold of admissibility if there is evidence introduced that is \u201csufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d Evid.R. 901(A). Evidence that an ancient document \u201c(a) is in such condition as to create no suspicion concerning its authenticity, (b) was in a place where it, if authentic, would likely be, and (c) has been in existence twenty years or more at the time it is offered\u201d is sufficient to authenticate the ancient document for admissibility purposes. Evid.R. 901(B)(8). Furthermore, as part of the authentication requirement, the burden is upon the state to establish the chain of custody of a particular item of evidence. <em>State v. Brown </em>(1995), 107 Ohio App.3d 194, 200, 668 N.E.2d 514, 517-518; <em>State v. Barzacchini </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 440, 458, 645 N.E.2d 137, 148-149. \u201cThe state\u2019s burden, however, is not absolute since \u2018[t]he state need only establish that it is reasonably certain that substitution, alteration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>or tampering did not occur.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown </em>at 200, 668 N.E.2d at 517, quoting <em>State v. Blevins </em>(1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 147, 150, 521 N.E.2d 1105, 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The trial court has broad discretion in the admission and exclusion of evidence and absent a clear abuse of discretion, a reviewing court will not disturb the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>State v. Combs </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 278, 284, 581 N.E.2d 1071, 1077-1078; <em>State v. Finnerty </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 104, 109, 543 N.E.2d 1233, 1238.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">At the RVO he\u00e1ring, Timothy Payne, Fire Marshal for the Middletown Division of Fire, testified concerning indictments and police reports that he requested from the Kentucky State Police regarding appellant\u2019s 1966 convictions in Kentucky for robbery. Payne stated that he contacted the Kentucky State Police Repository in Frankfort, Kentucky, to request certified copies of indictment charges against appellant and the underlying Kentucky police reports concerning the indictments. Payne stated that he spoke with Diane Smith of the Kentucky State Police Repository, requested the information, and subsequently received certified copies of the indictments, as well as copies of the police reports, by certified mail, return receipt requested.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The police reports are ancient documents as defined by Evid.R. 803(16), as they are more than twenty years old.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We further find that the Kentucky police reports were properly authenticated and admitted into evidence as ancient documents. See Evid.R. 803(16) and Evid.R. 901(B)(8). The condition of the police reports does not raise any suspicion with respect to their authenticity, as they were recovered from the Kentucky State Police Repository, a place where they would likely be if authentic, and they have been in existence for at least twenty years. See Evid.R. 901(B)(8). In addition, the state presented sufficient evidence regarding the chain of custody of the police reports so as to negate the possibility that the documents were altered. See <em>Brown, </em>107 Ohio App.3d at 200, 668 N.E.2d at 517-518. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">In his third assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred by finding that the repeat violent offender statute was constitutional as it applied to him. Appellant argues that for predicate offenses committed prior to July 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>1996, the RVO statute violates the Double Jeopardy and <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The trial court sentenced appellant to ten years\u2019 imprisonment and eight years\u2019 impxisonment for aggravated arson and felonious assault x-espectively, the maximum pxison sentence pex-mitted by statute for those offenses. See R.C. 2929.14(A)(1) and (2). Following its determination that appellant was an RVO, the trial court increased each respective sentence by ten years. R.C. 2929.14(D)(2)(b)(i) and (ii) permit a court to impose an additional pxison term of one to ten years upon an offender who the court has determined is an RVO if the court finds that the maximum prison term authorized by R.C. 2929.14(A) is \u201cinadequate to punish the offender and protect the public from future crime\u201d and is \u201cdemeaning to the seriousness of the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The Double Jeopardy Clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions protect an accused from multiple criminal prosecutions and punishments for the same offense. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution; Section 10, Article I, Ohio Constitution; <em>Hudson v. United States </em>(1997), 522 U.S. 93,-, 118 S.Ct. 488, 493, 139 L.Ed.2d 450, 458-459; <em>State v. Gustafson </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 425, 435, 668 N.E.2d 435, 443. A statute which permits a coux-t to enhance the penalty for a subsequent crime based upon the offender\u2019s px-ior criminal conviction is not a separate, additional sentence imposed for the earlier offense and does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, since the offender is not subjected to duplicate punishment for the earlier offense. <em>State v. Walton </em>(1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 243, 249, 583 N.E.2d 1106, 1109-1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause prohibits the states from passing laws that inflict punishment upon a person for an act which was innocent when it was committed, aggravate a crime or make it greater than when it was committed, or change the punishment or inflict a greater punishment than was provided when the crime was committed. Section 10, Article I, United States Constitution; Section 28, Article II, Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">\u201cStatutes which enhance the penalty for repeat offenders based in part upon cx-iminal conduct occuxring prior to passage of the enhancement provision do not constitute <em>ex post facto </em>legislation. The enhancement provisions do not puxxish the past conduct; rather, the enhancement provisions merely increase the severity of a penalty imposed for criminal behavior that occurs after passage of the enhancement legislation.\u201d <em>State v. Sanders </em>(Sept. 29, 1995), Miami App. Nos. 95 CA 11 and 95 CA 12, unreported, 1995 WL 634371, citing <em>United States v. Ykema </em>(C.A.6, 1989), 887 F.2d 697, 700; <em>In re Allen </em>(1915), 91 Ohio St. 315, 323-324, 110 N.E. 535, 537-538.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>We conclude that the enhanced penalty provisions found in R.C. 2929.14(D)(2)(b) do not violate the Double Jeopardy and <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clauses. The Double Jeopardy Clause neither bars appellant\u2019s trial for a separate offense, namely aggravated arson, nor prohibits the trial court from sentencing appellant for his commission of that separate offense. The trial court\u2019s enhancement of the penalty imposed upon appellant for the current offense, based upon his prior Kentucky robbery convictions, does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because the sentence is imposed for the current crime and is not additional punishment for the previous Kentucky crimes. See <em>Walton, </em>66 Ohio App.3d at 249, 583 N.E.2d at 1109-1110. Furthermore, R.C. 2929.14(D)(2)(b) merely increases the severity of the punishment imposed for appellant\u2019s current offense based upon his past convictions and does not constitute an <em>ex post facto </em>law. See <em>Allen, </em>91 Ohio St. at 323-324, 110 N.E. at 537-538. \u201cAll convicted felons face the possibility that their past acts will have future consequences.\u201d <em>State v. Lyttle </em>(Dec. 22, 1997), Butler CA97-03-060, unreported, at 27, 1997 WL 786216, citing <em>State ex rel. Matz v. Brown </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 279, 282, 525 N.E.2d 805, 808. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In his fourth assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred by allowing testimony regarding other acts to be admitted into evidence. Appellant argues that in a criminal prosecution, it is improper to allow testimony regarding prior wrongs or acts committed by the defendant in order to show action in conformity with those other wrongs or acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Evid.R. 404(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Threats made by an accused can constitute verbal acts in terms of Evid.R. 404(B). <em>State v. Kuhn </em>(Aug. 23, 1993), Clermont App. No. CA93-01-007, unreported, 1993 WL 319633. For admissibility purposes, other acts evidence is subject to the relevancy requirements found in Evid.R. 403. <em>State v. Soke </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 226, 249, 663 N.E.2d 986, 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">During the trial, Barbara Boyce, Tarbox\u2019s next-door neighbor, testified as to threats she had previously heard appellant make with regard to the burning of Tarbox\u2019s home. Boyce testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">\u201cQ. [Prosecutor]: Ma\u2019am, have you ever previously heard Dillon Sargent threaten Helen Tarbox in any particular way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>\u201cA. [Boyce]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">\u201cQ. Ma\u2019am, specifically do you remember what that threat was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">\u201cA. Saying he was going to burn her house down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\u201cQ. O.K. And is that something that you had heard on one occasion or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">\u201cA. A few occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">\u201cQ. And those were statements that were made by Dillon Sargent to Helen Tarbox?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-10\">\u201cA. Made to \u2014 Well, he was friends with my husband and I\u2019ve heard him say it around my husband.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-11\"># *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-12\">\u201cQ. Ma\u2019am, when in reference to the day of the fire had you heard these threatening comments made by Dillon Sargent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-13\">\u201cA. It was about a couple of months before that because he was not supposed to be over there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-14\">\u201cQ. O.K. Did you hear them all at one time or was it over a period of time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-15\">\u201cA. It was over a period of time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-16\">We find that the trial court properly admitted Boyce\u2019s testimony pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B). The testimony as to appellant\u2019s prior threats to burn Tarbox\u2019s home was directly related to proof of motive, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, and absence of accident as allowable under Evid.R. 404(B). Boyce\u2019s testimony indicates that appellant\u2019s statements consisting of threats to burn Tarbox\u2019s home were specifically directed toward Tarbox and occurred only a few months prior to the fire at Tarbox\u2019s residence. Because appellant\u2019s statements were close in time to the fire and reflected the type of knowledgeable conduct with which appellant was charged, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that the statements were admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B). Appellant\u2019s statements were also probative of whether the fire was accidental. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-17\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b600-18\">Walsh and Powell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-16\">.
