We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Jeffry Vincent Kufchak was named the beneficiary of a life insurance policy issued to his father. Upon his father\u2019s death, Jeffry, a minor, received the proceeds from that policy. Jeffry\u2019s mother, Stephanie Kufchak, then applied to the Medina County Probate Court to be appointed guardian of Jeffry\u2019s estate. Geoffry Kufchak, Jeffry\u2019s paternal grandfather, made a competing application to be appointed guardian of Jeffry\u2019s estate. Attorney Robert Campbell provided legal services to Geoffry Kufchak in pursuit of the appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">On September 11,1996, in an agreed journal entry, the probate court appointed Stephanie Kufchak as guardian of her son Jeffry\u2019s estate. In that entry, the probate court set out investment plans for the estate, as well as requirements for the guardian\u2019s administration of the estate. Campbell -withdrew as counsel for Geoffry Kufchak on October 4, 1996. On March 12, 1997, Campbell sought an order from the probate court requiring Jeffry\u2019s estate to pay his attorney fees for representation of Geoffry Kufchak. The guardian objected to payment of the fees. On October 6, 1997, the probate court, without offering any reasons for its decision, ordered that Campbell\u2019s attorney fees be paid from Jeffry\u2019s estate. The guardian timely appealed the decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The guardian presents the following assignment of error for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s order granting [Campbell\u2019s] application for the estate of minor Jeffry Kufchak to pay the legal debt owed by third-party Geoffrey [sic] Kufchak to [Campbell] is in contravenience [sic] with R.C. 2111.14 and is a reversible error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">We find this assignment of error well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">In his application to the probate court for payment of the attorney fees, Campbell maintained that such payment was governed by R.C. 2111.14. R.C. 2111.14 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-12\">\u201cIn addition to his other duties, every guardian appointed to take care of the estate of a ward shall have the following duties: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-13\">\u201c(C) To pay all just debts due from the ward out of the estate in his hands[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">Campbell asserted that R.C. 2111.14 \u201cprovides that the guardian of the estate shall pay from the estate assets any expense that directly benefits the estate or the ward.\u201d Campbell based this assertion upon the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>In re Wonderly </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 40, 10 OBR 304, 461 N.E.2d 879.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Campbell misunderstands the holding of <em>Wonderly </em>as it applies to the case at bar. In <em>Wonderly, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[a]bsent a specific demonstration that the actions are beneficial to the estate or ward, a <em>guardian </em>may not be reimbursed from the estate for legal expenses incurred in proceedings relating solely to the determination of whether the guardian may serve in that capacity.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 42, 10 OBR at 306, 461 N.E.2d at 881. The proceedings in which Campbell was employed by Geoffry Kufchak, and for which he seeks payment, were proceedings to determine who would serve in the capacity of guardian of Jeffry\u2019s estate. We note that Campbell\u2019s former client, Geoffry Kufchak, at no time served as Jeffry\u2019s guardian. As such, Campbell is not entitled to payment pursuant to the standard set forth in <em>Wonderly.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Furthermore, Campbell failed to demonstrate that his representation of Geoffry Kufchak in pursuit of the appointment as guardian was beneficial in any way to Jeffry\u2019s estate. Campbell maintains that Geoffry Kufchak\u2019s pursuit of the appointment \u201c[ejnsured that [Jeffry\u2019s] estate would be protected from misappropriation by the guardian of the estate.\u201d However, he fails to offer any evidence in support of this conclusion. Upon review of the record, we find nothing to indicate that Geoffry Kufchak\u2019s participation in the proceedings provided a benefit to Jeffry\u2019s estate. Additionally, the probate court\u2019s order lacked any reasoning in support of its decision to award the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">We will reverse the decision of the probate court to award attorney fees in the event of an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Guardianship of Rider </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 709, 712, 589 N.E.2d 465, 466-467. An abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or judgment, but instead implies that the court\u2019s attitude was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Cedar Bay Constr., Inc. v. Fremont </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 19, 22, 552 N.E.2d 202, 205. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we believe that the probate court\u2019s decision was both unreasonable and arbitrary in that the court failed to offer any reasoning in support of its decision, and review of the record indicates that the decision is unsupported by the evidence. Accordingly, we find that the probate court abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees to Robert Campbell.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The guardian\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained. The judgment of the Medina County Probate Court awarding attorney fees to Robert Campbell is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b462-8\">Baird, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b462-9\">Quillin, P.J., concurs in judgment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Quillin, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AUV\">concurring in judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Because I believe that the attorney had no standing to bring his own claim for attorney fees, I concur in judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
