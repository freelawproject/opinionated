We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">Bernard owns real estate in Barberton that is roughly pie-shaped, with West Heatherwood Street running along the \u201ccrust\u201d of the pie. Bernard sought to develop this real estate by building attached one-family housing units. Bernard proposed to subdivide this pie shape into several long, narrow lots, all with frontage on West Heatherwood Street. Most of the resulting lots would be thirty-five feet wide, with a depth ranging from one hundred thirty-eight to two hundred eighty-eight feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">Both parties agree that the proposed lots meet the minimum width, minimum square footage, and total lot-size requirements of Barberton\u2019s Zoning Code. However, Barberton rejected Bernard\u2019s proposal because it did not meet the objectives and minimum requirements of Barberton\u2019s Land Planning and Subdivision Regulations. Barberton explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-14\">\u201cThe objectives of the Subdivision Regulations are listed in Section 1.03, Objectives, which states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-15\">\u201c \u2018It is intended that the provisions of these regulations shall be administered to achieve the following objectives: Orderly development of the land, harmonious and stable neighborhoods ....\u2019 [Ellipsis sic.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-16\">\u201cPlanning Commission did not believe the proposed development pattern, as submitted, was harmonious with the established neighborhood. <em>The elongated </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>lots were disproportional and inharmonious to the established pattern and as a result could jeopardize the stability of the neighborhood.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">\u201cSpecifically, the concern with disproportional lots is addressed in the Land Planning and Subdivision Regulations, Section 7.05, Lot Design [:]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">\u201ca. Building Sites. The lot lines shall be designed to form a good building site on each lot and not merely geometric shapes enclosing the minimum area permitted. The lots shall be more or less rectangular in form; triangular, elongated or other shapes that restrict its use as a building site shall be avoided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">\u201cc. <em>[sic </em>] The mean depth of lots abutting a local street, one family subdivision, shall not exceed 2.5 times its width. This ratio shall be increased when the rear line of such lots abuts a railroad or other incompatible non-residential land use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\"><em>\u201cThe proposed configuration of the 11 lots subdivided from lot 115, as submitted, contains a width to depth ratio ranging from 1:1 </em>\u2014 1:8 <em>which well exceeds the depth requirement of 1:2.5 ratio required in the Subdivision Regulations. </em>Planning Commission approval may only be granted if the lot design meets the objectives and requirements of the Land Planning and Subdivision Regulations.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Bernard appealed this decision to the court of common pleas. The case was assigned to a magistrate, who proposed to reverse the Barberton decision because the subdivision regulations were too vague. The magistrate\u2019s decision was adopted by the trial court. Barberton appeals the reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">Barberton assigns one error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-12\">\u201cThe trial court erred by finding the city of Barberton subdivision regulations void for vagueness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">In analyzing whether a zoning provision is unconstitutional, courts must begin with a strong presumption of validity. <em>Franchise Developers, Inc. v. Cincinnati </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 28, 32, 30 OBR 33, 37, 505 N.E.2d 966, 970. The unconstitutional-vagueness argument \u201cis inherently deficient in a zoning case where the zoning resolution, by its very nature, puts a property owner on notice that use of the property is subject to regulation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-14\">In this case, Barberton has not only put Bernard on notice that use of its property is subject to lot-size and shape restrictions but has also provided Bernard with a uniform mathematical standard for determining the permissible length of the proposed lots. We find nothing vague in this simple mathematical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>formula. Therefore, the trial court erred in adopting the magistrate\u2019s proposal and reversing the Barberton decision on grounds of vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b635-6\">Baird and Dickinson, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
