In her single assignment of error, she now alleges that the trial court erred by granting the defendants-appellees\u2019 motion for dismissal. We agree and thus reverse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>Holloway worked in food services at Mallard Cove Retirement Community. Her job duties required her to climb stairs and walk from one of the five buildings to the next. She testified that at her peak she worked seventy to eighty hours per week, and that almost all of the work required her to be on her feet. She' stated that she spent the majority of time on the bottom floor of the fourth building, where the kitchen and dining room were located. According to Holloway, the kitchen had originally been a storage room and the floor was concrete covered with tile. The dining-room floor, she testified, was covered with unpadded carpet.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Holloway started working at Mallard Cove in December 1992. By May 1993, she had begun to experience problems with pain and tightening in her right thigh and knee. Eventually, she testified, her knee began to lock. She stated that the problems would subside when she stopped working for several days. According to Holloway, the problems with her right leg persisted for a period of two- years until she left Mallard Cove in April 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">While suffering problems with her right leg, Holloway consulted a chiropractor, Dr. Mary J. Glass. Dr. Glass diagnosed \u201cinternal derangement of the right knee, contracture of the hamstring, hip/thigh strain, right SI [sacroiliac] tendonitis.\u201d Asked her opinion as to the cause of Holloway\u2019s diagnosed condition, Glass stated that Holloway\u2019s \u201cwork-related activities such as standing and walking\u201d had produced \u201ccontinued microtrauma to the knee, which, in turn, caused contracture of the hamstring into the thigh and into the SI area.\u201d Glass also testified that, based upon Holloway\u2019s job description, she considered Holloway to be at a greater risk for her type of injury than another individual working in a different capacity. Glass stated further that she also treated Holloway for left leg and knee problems, which could have resulted from Holloway using her left leg more prominently to compensate for the pain in her right. Upon cross-examination, Glass conceded that she did not originally treat Holloway\u2019s complaints as work-related; she explained, however, that this was prior to arriving at a diagnosis and before noting the pattern of .Holloway\u2019s complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Dr. Carla Ross, who specializes in occupational medicine, examined Holloway on March 14, 1996, and March 28, 1996. Dr. Ross diagnosed Holloway as having \u201coveruse syndrome of the right lower extremity,\u201d and further concluded that this condition was caused by the \u201clong hours of work, walking and standing on concrete floors\u201d in her work- at the retirement community. She also stated that Holloway was put at greater risk for her type of injury than an employee who was not required to work sixty hours per week and walk extensively on a concrete floor covered with tile. Upon cross-examination, Ross conceded that work is not the only way to develop leg or knee problems, and that sometimes such problems are sports-related or related to nonoccupational overuse. She testified, however, that she did not consider Holloway\u2019s problems related to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>activity in which she may have engaged in the past, such as roller-skating, jogging, or water-skiing.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">Dr. David C. Randolph, a physician board-certified in occupational medicine, examined Holloway on March 30, 1995. He testified that he could not find an objective basis for Holloway\u2019s complaints on physical examination. He stated further that he could not find any evidence of a contracture of the hamstring, or a hip or thigh strain. He stated that \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing\u201d as SI tendonitis as diagnosed by Dr. Glass. Randolph further stated that in his opinion there was no relationship between Holloway\u2019s subjective complaints and her job-related activities. He gave his explanation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-5\">\u201cWell, as I said, even if we allow that these [symptoms] exist, there has to be an injury. Something had to have happened to cause this. There is nothing that existed here \u2014 there is no history of injury. Some of those other documents that we referenced earlier continuously describe the onset of her symptoms with no injury. There is no description of an injury, nothing happened, she just started having pain. This is \u2014 it\u2019s absurd under the circumstances to say that just because she has pain that it\u2019s related to her job. It\u2019s equally as absurd to say the rooster crows, the sun comes up, and there\u2019s a cause and effect relationship; it doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Randolph further testified that there was no evidence of overuse syndrome. He stated: \u201cIf one presumes that these symptoms have occurred as a consequence of prolonged standing, walking or prolonged activity of the lower extremities, then, why is it that there\u2019s no involvement of the left leg? That makes no sense.\u201d Upon cross-examination, he allowed that if Holloway had suffered \u201cbilateral pain in both knees,\u201d then his opinion on causality may have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">A trial court\u2019s decision to grant judgment for the defendant pursuant to Civ.R. 41(B)(2) will not be set aside so long as it is not erroneous as a matter of law or against the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>First Natl. Bank v. Cianelli </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 781, 788, 598 N.E.2d 789, 794. In considering a motion for involuntary dismissal under the rule, a court may weigh the evidence, resolve conflicts, and grant judgment for the defendant only if the plaintiff has failed to show any right to relief. <em>Faber v. Queen City Terminals, Inc. </em>(1994), 93 Ohio App.3d 197, 201, 638 N.E.2d 115, 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">Interpreting the statutory predecessor of current R.C. 4123.68, the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>State ex rel. Ohio Bell Tel. Co. v. Krise </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 247, 71 O.O.2d 226, 327 N.E.2d 756, set forth the following criteria for a nonscheduled occupational disease:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-9\">\u201cAn occupational disease is compensable under R.C. 4123.68(BB) where the following criteria exist: (1) the disease is contracted in the course of employment; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>(2) the disease is peculiar to the claimant\u2019s employment by its causes and the characteristics of its manifestation or the conditions of the employment result in a hazard which distinguishes the employment in character from employment generally; and (3) the employment creates a risk of contracting the disease in a greater degree and in a different manner than in the public generally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">In announcing its decision to grant the defendants-appellees\u2019 motion for involuntary dismissal, the trial court made the following remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-6\">\u201cAnd the Court has weighed, and the Court is having trouble and fails to find that the conditions of Ms. Holloway\u2019s employment resulted in a hazard which distinguishes her employment from employment, in general, walking issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-7\">\u201cI think that I have a hard time finding that walking is a condition that resulted in a hazard, which distinguishes her employment in character from employment in general.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-8\">\u201cAnd I have difficulty finding that Ms. Holloway\u2019s employment at [Mallard Cove] created a risk of contracting whatever this occupational disease is in a greater degree and a different manner than the public, in general. I just can\u2019t find those things to be present in this case. And consequently, I feel I must grant the motion under Rule 41(B)(2) and dismiss this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">The trial court later gave as a reason for its decision the fact that \u201cconcrete sidewalks are all over the place, concrete floors in any office building, concrete floors everyplace; streets, and sidewalks, and so forth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">We hold this reasoning to be erroneous as a matter of law. Specifically, we hold that the trial court incorrectly applied the second and third prongs of <em>Krise </em>when it identified as the distinguishing condition of her employment only the fact that she was required to walk on concrete. That reasoning completely ignores the repetitive nature of the work and its strain on the human body. Clearly it was not only the fact that Holloway\u2019s job required her to walk on concrete, but that it required her to do so extensively, for sometimes sixty to eighty hours per week, that allegedly distinguished her employment and put her at greater risk for overuse syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">Holloway\u2019s two medical experts, Drs. Glass and Ross, both testified that Holloway\u2019s having to work long hours on tiled concrete and unpadded carpet put her at greater risk of contracting overuse syndrome than employment that did not require her to do so. Holloway testified that in her experience in other food-service jobs most floors were cushioned in some manner. Two other employees of the retirement community testified that they, too, had experienced leg problems similar to Holloway\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">Given the expert and lay testimony, we hold that Holloway presented sufficient evidence to satisfy the second and third criteria of <em>Krise, </em>and that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>erred in its consideration of this evidence because it failed to grasp that the distinguishing characteristic of Holloway\u2019s employment was not only that she was required to walk over concrete, but that she was required to do so repeatedly and for long hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">We also reject the defendants-appellees\u2019 argument that the record is devoid of any evidence relevant to the third criterion, that Holloway\u2019s work exposed her to a risk different from that of the public generally. The gist of the defendants-appellees\u2019 position appears to be that the third criterion requires separate expert testimony establishing that claimant\u2019s occupation statistically produces a greater incidence of the disease \u2014 in this case overuse syndrome \u2014 than is experienced by the public generally. See <em>Burch v. Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. </em>(Dec. 1, 1993), Summit App. No. 16169, unreported, 1993 WL 498177. It is doubtful, however, whether any valid scientific study has ever been done \u2014 or will ever be done \u2014 to compare the incidence of overuse syndrome among employees required to work on hard floors with the incidence among those who are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">To satisfy the third criterion of <em>Krise, </em>it was necessary for Holloway to show only that she had a greater risk of contracting overuse syndrome in a different manner than did the public generally. <em>State ex rel. Republic Steel Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 193, 196, 15 O.O.3d 216, 218, 399 N.E.2d 1268, 1269-1270. There is no requirement of statistical proof. See <em>Patterson v. Connor </em>(1984), 19 Ohio App.3d 304, 19 OBR 476, 484 N.E.2d 240. The Ohio Supreme Court has made clear that reviewing courts are to be mindful of the requirement in R.C. 4123.95 to construe the workers\u2019 compensation statutes liberally in favor of employees. <em>Bedford Hts. v. France </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 55, 58, 616 N.E.2d 177, 179-180. In this spirit, we hold that the third criterion can be satisfied inferentially from the expert and lay testimony of record here. Obviously a member of the general public who suffers pain from repetitive movement has the luxury of stopping and doing something else, whereas an employee whose job requires such movement does not. It does not require expert testimony to conclude that the employee is at greater risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">We hold, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s application of the second and third criteria of <em>Krise </em>was erroneous as a matter of law. It is clear that, because of its error, the trial court did not proceed to weigh the medical evidence of record, which is conflicting on the issue of causality. As noted, although both Dr. Glass and Dr. Ross concluded that Holloway\u2019s overuse syndrome arose out of the peculiar characteristics of her employment, Dr. Randolph disputed both the diagnosis and the cause. The resolution of that conflict is for the trier of fact.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>Accordingly, we sustain Holloway\u2019s assignment of error challenging the trial court\u2019s order granting the defendants-appellees\u2019 motion for involuntary dismissal. The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with the law set forth herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b852-5\">Painter, P.J., Gorman and Sundermann, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-14\">. We have <em>sua sponte </em>removed this case from the accelerated calendar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b851-8\">. We do note, however, that Randolph's opinion appears to hinge largely on the lack of any history of pain in the left leg, whereas Glass testified that she treated Holloway for compensatory pain in that limb as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
