The trial court determined all of appellants\u2019 claims were time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-16\">Appellants argue material issues of fact remain concerning the following: (1) the applicability of the doctrine of equitable estoppel to appellee\u2019s statute-of-limitations defense, and (2) whether the application of the statute of limitations was tolled in this case either by appellants\u2019 \u201cdelayed discovery\u201d of their injuries or their mental \u201cdisabilities.\u201d This court finds the trial court\u2019s order was appropriate and therefore affirms its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>The record reflects that the appellants lived in the city of Avon Lake, Ohio as children. During the relevant time period, which encompassed the years from approximately 1954 until 1966, the appellants were either parishioners, neighbors or acquaintances of Father Carl Wernet. Father Wernet was the pastor of St. Joseph\u2019s Catholic Church and Elementary School, which are located in that city and are under the jurisdiction of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">On September 3,1993, appellants filed a six-count complaint against appellee in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. Appellants alleged they had been \u201csexually abused, molested, raped, assaulted and/or battered\u201d by Father Wernet between \u201c1955 and 1965.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants alleged appellee was responsible for Father Wernet\u2019s acts based upon <em>respondeat superior. </em>Appellants further alleged negligence, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and breach of fiduciary duty against appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Appelle\u00e9\u2019s answer denied the pertinent allegations of the complaint and raised the defense that all of the appellants\u2019 claims were barred pursuant to the applicable statute of limitations. Thereafter, the parties pursued discovery in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">On July 19, 1995, appellee filed separate motions for summary judgment as to each of the appellants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Each motion was supported by a brief and evidentiary materials. In each brief, appellee asserted that the evidence proved that appellant\u2019s claim was barred by the applicable statute of limitations since every appellant admitted she had been aware of the injury more than two years prior to the filing of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Appellee attached to each motion copies- of the following: (1) a certificate of death demonstrating that Father Wernet had died in 1980, (2) the particular appellant\u2019s deposition testimony, and, (3) if applicable, the psychological evaluation done by Dr. Deborah Koricke, a clinical psychologist, at appellants\u2019 counsel\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">On October 16, 1995, appellants filed a single brief in opposition to appellee\u2019s motions for summary judgment. Therein, appellants argued material issues of fact remained concerning whether their claims were time-barred. Appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>asserted the following in support of their argument: (1) appellee \u201cinduced\u201d them to be silent about the abuse perpetrated upon them, (2) appellee fraudulently \u201cconcealed\u201d relevant evidence of Father Wernet\u2019s \u201ccrimes,\u201d (3) appellants were \u201cdelayed\u201d in them discovery of their causes of action, and (4) appellants were \u201cdisabled\u201d pursuant to R.C 2305.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Appellants attached to their brief the following evidentiary materials: (1) the affidavits of each appellant without anonymity, (2) a transcript labeled \u201caffidavit\u201d testimony by Antone F. Feo, a clinical psychologist, (3) a transcript labeled \u201caffidavit\u201d tesimony by Deborah A. Koricke, a clinical psychologist, (4) appellant Toth\u2019s psychological medical records, (5) copies of newspaper articles and letters, (6) originals of letters addressed to appellant Toth, (7) portions of deposition testimony of Bishop Alexander T. Quinn, (8) a copy of deposition testimony of Father Urban A. Reichlin, (9) a copy of appellee\u2019s responses to appellants\u2019 requests for admissions, (10) copies of portions of books and other treatises, and (11) copies of police complaint reports.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">On December 5, 1995, appellee filed a reply brief that was supported only by case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">On February 6, 1996, the trial court issued its opinion and order granting all of appellee\u2019s motions for summary judgment as to appellants\u2019 claims. The trial court stated that appellants\u2019 claims had been brought well outside the limitations periods set forth in R.C. 2305.111, 2305.10 and 2305.16. The trial court further found that appellants could prove neither \u201cdelayed discovery\u201d of their claims nor that their mental states had precluded them from filing their action earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Appellants have filed a timely appeal from the trial court\u2019s order, presenting four assignments of error for this court\u2019s review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 assignments of error will be addressed in logical order and combined when appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Appellants\u2019 fourth and second assignments of error follow: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>plaintiffs were delayed in discovery and then [sic] individual memories were not \u2018verifiable\u2019 until one of their number came forward.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>\u201cThe trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in light of evidence in the record that the individual</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>\u201cThe trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on plaintiff Mary Lewis\u2019 claims because a genuine issue of material fact exists about whether the \u2018discovery rule\u2019 operated to toll the statute of limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Appellants argue in these assignments of error that summary judgment for appellee was improper because the evidence before the trial court was sufficient to raise questions of fact concerning whether the statutes of limitation that applied to~their action were tolled by the \u201cdiscovery rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The Ohio Supreme Court determined in Doe <em>v. First United Methodist Church </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 531, 537, 629 N.E.2d 402, 407-408, that with respect to a cause of action premised upon acts of sexual abuse, R.C. 2305.111 applies; therefore, the action must be commenced within one year after the cause of action accrues. The Supreme Court also determined that claims of negligence for \u201cfailing to protect\u201d a child victim from \u201csexual behavior\u201d are subject to R.C. 2305.10, <em>i.e., </em>a two-year statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>However, pursuant to R.C. 2305.16, neither statute is triggered until the child victim reaches the age of eighteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Subsequently, in the context of a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) dismissal of a victim\u2019s complaint on statute-of-limitations grounds, the Ohio Supreme Court declared the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d applicable to sexual abuse cases. <em>Ault v. Jasko </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 114, 637 N.E.2d 870. The court indicated the rule applies only \u201cwhere the victim of childhood sexual abuse <em>represses </em>memories of that abuse until a later time\u201d; the Supreme Court reiterated that the statute of limitations \u201cbegins to run when the victim <em>recalls </em>or otherwise discovers <em>that he or she was sexually abused, </em>or when, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, the victim <em>should </em>have discovered the sexual abuse.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 117-118, 637 N.E.2d at 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">In this case, appellee filed evidentiary materials that demonstrated that all of the appellants continuously were both aware of the harmfulness or inappropriateness of the priest\u2019s acts from childhood and also suffered from this awareness; therefore, no memories were repressed and the discovery rule did not apply. <em>Doe v. First United Methodist Church, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Appellant Laura Livingston stated in her deposition as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">\u201cQ.

But you did know that things had happened on more than one occasion between you and Father Wernet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-19\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-20\">\u201cQ. And you <em>didn\u2019t always remember each thing that happened </em>each time, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-21\">\u201cA. That is <em>correct.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-22\">\u201cQ. But <em>you knew that he had done things to you way back when you were a young child, </em>correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-23\">\u201cA. <em>Yes, </em>yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-24\">\u201cQ. And <em>you knew that he had done things that were not right.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-25\">\n<em>\u201cA. That\u2019s right.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-26\">\u201cQ.

Yes.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Similarly, after describing some of the incidents of abuse, appellant Toth testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">\u201cQ. And now did you continue to go to church at St. Joseph\u2019s in Avon Lake while you were in high school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">\u201cQ. And was Father Wernet still the pastor there at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">\u201cA.

And did you ever have occasion during your teenage years to talk to Father Dickard about anything dealing with Father Wernet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-16\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-17\">\u201cQ. Did you have occasion at any time subsequent to your teenage years to have a conversation, with Father Dickard regarding Father Wernet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-18\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-19\">\u201cQ. When would that have been?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-20\">\u201cA. In 1989.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-21\">\u201cQ. And where did that take place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-22\">\u201cA. It took place at a Knights of Columbus picnic in Avon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-23\">\"* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-24\">\u201cQ. What did you say to Father Dickard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-25\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I asked him where Father Wernet was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-26\">\"* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-27\">\u201cQ. What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-28\">\u201cA. He said what do you want to know for and I said because I need to know. What did they do to him, what \u2014 where did they put him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>\u201cQ. And what did you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\">\u201cA. I wasn\u2019t sure what I meant by that at the time. Really didn\u2019t understand what I was even asking him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">\u201cQ. And what did Father Dickard respond thereafter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">\u201cA. He said well, he is dead and I said well he is dead but what did they do to him? And he said they transferred him to another parish. And I said yeah, but what did they do to him? <em>Did they punish him? </em>And he said punish him? And <em>I said yeah. He said what for? And I said well, the man raped me and that is the first time I ever said it out loud.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">\u201cQ. So you told Father Dickard that you had been raped by Father Carl Wernet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">\u201cA. Correct'.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\">\u201cQ. <em>This was at a picnic in 1989.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-10\">\n<em>\u201cA.

What other conversation did you and Father Dickard have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-12\">\u201cA. <em>I said what do you mean, was it me. It was my sister too and at that point my father walked by and Father Dickard grabbed my father and asked my father if this was true. And I had said </em>you tell him, tell Father Dickard <em>what Father Wernet did to Jan and [me]. </em>(Sic) Father Dickard asked dad if it was true and dad said yes. Father Dickard said oh my god, Ray, I\u2019m so sorry for you and my father walked away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-13\">\u201cQ. Now you went home after the picnic was over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-14\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-15\">\u201cQ. And <em>did you follow up </em>on any of the information you had learned from Father Dickard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-16\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-17\">\u201cQ. Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-18\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Because <em>I basically felt like it didn\u2019t matter, nobody cared, </em>I couldn\u2019t do anything about it anyhow and they weren\u2019t interested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-19\">\u201cQ. And how did you get Mr. Feliciano\u2019s [appellee\u2019s counsel\u2019s] name from Jim Cross?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u201cA. In the course of getting a haircut, one of the hairdressers who worked with Mr. Cross was also a patient of mine at Kaiser. Her daughter had been raped so we were discussing her rape, the mother and I were discussing the rape. And Mr. Cross and another girl chimed in and said well, I was molested too. He said so yes, there is a lot of people and I <em>said oh, well yeah, I was too, you know and </em>\u2014 but <em>I don\u2019t know what to do, can\u2019t do anything about it. My perpetrator is dead, </em>the man who hurt me is dead and he said well, you should still file a complaint and he gave me \u2014 he said Mr. Feliciano, this is the person you should report it to, here is his number, I used to do his wife\u2019s hair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\">\u201cQ.

All right, and how did it come to be that you spoke with your mom about this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-14\">\u201cA. Going through a crisis in my life and I needed to let her know about this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-15\">\u201cQ.

Alice Risdorf?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-17\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-18\">Carolyn Kepic Kuznik, a.k.a. \u201cJane Doe III,\u201d testified that she had been abused by Father Wernet in 1964 at the age of ten, had \u201cflashbacks\u201d throughout her life that caused her to recall his \u201cfinger being on my body,\u201d told her husband of the abuse shortly after her marriage in 1982, and had \u201calways\u201d been aware of Father Wernet\u2019s assaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-19\">Sallie Ann Huber Schneider, a.k.a. \u201cJane Doe IV,\u201d stated that she \u201calways knew [Father Wernet] masturbated on me\u201d and that when she attended his funeral in 1980, she forgave him for \u201cthe things he did\u201d against her that she described during her deposition testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Although Eileen Ann Motolik Fergus Meyers, a.k.a. \u201cJane Doe V,\u201d told Dr. Koricke that she had \u201calways been aware of her abuse\u201d by Father Wernet, at the time of her deposition, Meyers indicated that she could remember almost nothing of what had occurred during three incidents she had by then recalled; however, Meyers \u201calways remembered\u201d the fourth incident, which occurred when she was in fourth grade. Meyers testified that she had attended confession with her sister, Kathleen Haney; afterward, Father Wernet spoke to them in the sacristy, then he was \u201cgrabbing ahold\u201d of her across her chest, \u201cmoving\u201d his hand there. She further testified that following their escape from the situation, although she and her sister did not speak of it with each other, she remembered \u201cbeing scared.\u201d When appellee\u2019s counsel commented, \u201cBut you knew that whatever happened with Father Carl Wernet wasn\u2019t right,\u201d Meyers\u2019 response was \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Appellant Mary Lewis, who had been treated by psychologists numerous times in her life, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">\u201cQ. When was the first time that you recall being abused by Father Wernet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">\u201cA. See, <em>always was able to remember. </em>It just was something I didn\u2019t tell people about that <em>he put his hand in my blouse. </em>But I didn\u2019t remember <em>the part </em>about him asking me to take my panties off until mom told me how I came running to her. All that started then, I remember the feelings and everything and you know, then I remembered it was just weird that <em>I just hadn\u2019t remembered him trying to get me to take my panties off </em>or anything of that and that this weird guy stuck his hand in my blouse, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">\u201cQ.

And walked or left the rectory with those in your hand, you can\u2019t remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-11\">\u201cA. <em>Yeah.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-12\">\u201cQ. <em>But you have always remembered that Father Wernet had unbuttoned your blouse.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-13\">\u201cA. <em>Yeah.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-14\">\u201cQ. <em>And stuck his hand inside of your blouse.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-15\">\u201cA. <em>Yeah.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-16\">\u201cQ.

But <em>the first part </em>about the blouse and the hand <em>you always recalled.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\"><em>\u201cA. Yeah, I thought it was bad.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">A review of the depositions thus reveals that each appellant testified to the same effect. Unlike Civ.R. 12(B)(6), Civ.R. 56(C) makes summary judgment proper when the evidence demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Norris v. Ohio Std. Oil Co. </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 1, 24 O.O.3d 1, 433 N.E.2d 615. A properly supported motion for summary judgment forces the nonmoving party to produce evidence on any issue for which that party bears the burden of production at trial. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 662 N.E.2d 264; <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Civ.R. 56 also sets forth the type of documentary evidence necessary in order to support or oppose a motion for summary judgment. In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, therefore, a court is <em>precluded </em>from considering any documentary evidence of a type not specified in Civ.R. 56(C). <em>Spier v. Am. Univ. of the Caribbean </em>(1981), 3 Ohio App.3d 28, 3 OBR 29, 443 N.E.2d 1021; see, also, <em>Jackson v. Alert Fire &amp; Safety Equip., Inc. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 48, 567 N.E.2d 1027. The issue of evidentiary quality is thus a matter of law, since the court is not determining credibility, but admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Obviously, the appellants in this case did not wish to directly confront their memories of the sexual abuse they suffered; therefore, they suppressed them. However, it is equally obvious even from reading their affidavits that none of appellants had suffered a <em>repression </em>of her memories as a result of the abuse within the clinical meaning of that term. As defined by appellants\u2019 medical experts, repression signifies the <em>involuntary </em>and <em>complete </em>loss of memory of an event, whereas suppression is merely an intentional forgetting.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Appellants suggest that <em>Ault </em>should be interpreted to suspend application of the statute of limitations until each \u201cverified\u201d her memory, arguing that each appellant\u2019s injury was not \u201cdiscovered\u201d until the first came forward to <em>report </em>the abuse. This court cannot accept their suggestion, since <em>Ault </em>considered the discovery rule as applied to sexual abuse cases only in the context of a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) dismissal. In contrast, in a case in which the victim, upon reaching the age of majority, \u201cknew that [s]he had been sexually abused, and [s]he knew the identity of the perpetrator,\u201d this knowledge was sufficient to trigger the running of the statute of limitations. <em>Doe v. First United Methodist Church, </em>68 Ohio St.3d 531, 629 N.E.2d 402; see, also, <em>Flowers v. Walker </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 546, 589 N.E.2d 1284; <em>Scott v. Borelli </em>(1995), 106 Ohio App.3d 449, 666 N.E.2d 322; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number><em>Peters v. Medaglia </em>(Apr. 13, 1989), Cuyahoga App. No. 55208, unreported, 1989 WL 36709.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">For the foregoing reasons, summary judgment for appellee on the basis that appellants\u2019 claims were time-barred was proper. Appellants\u2019 fourth and second assignments of error lack merit and are, accordingly, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Appellants\u2019 third assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motions for summary judgment on plaintiff Lynn Toth\u2019s claims because genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the tolling provisions of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2305.16 apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Appellants argue that the evidence was sufficient to raise a question of fact as to whether appellant Lynn Toth was disabled within the meaning of R.C. 2305.16 at the time her cause of action accrued, thus tolling the statute of limitations and making summary judgment as to her claims inappropriate. This argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">R.C. 2305.16 provides that if a person is \u201cof unsound mind\u201d at the time her cause of action accrues, it may be brought within the respective times of either R.C. 2305.111 or 2305.10 \u201cafter the disability is removed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">In this case, appellant Toth testified she was born on August 28, 1950; therefore, Toth was eighteen years of age in 1968. Despite her deposition testimony quoted earlier in this opinion, which demonstrates that appellant Toth was fully aware of her cause of action throughout her adult years, appellants argue that Toth\u2019s health care providers indicate that Toth was \u201cof unsound mind\u201d until \u201cAugust or September 1992,\u201d when she terminated her relationship with a social worker provided to her by appellee. This argument is presented despite the lack of evidence that any health care provider who'knew Toth during this period so stated. <em>Moore v. Schiano </em>(1996), 117 Ohio App.3d 326, 690 N.E.2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">One of appellants\u2019 experts who examined Toth after the commencement of the instant action opined that Toth was suffering from \u201cpost-traumatic stress disorder\u201d and \u201cmajor depression\u201d that \u201cwould prohibit her from * * * coming forth.\u201d Although appellants\u2019 other medical evidence may have supported this diagnosis, R.C. 1.02(C) defines \u201cunsound mind\u201d to include \u201call forms of mental retardation or derangement.\u201d The Ohio Supreme Court has recently stated that the foregoing phrase \u201chas been equated with insanity.\u201d <em>Fisher v. Ohio Univ. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 484, 487, 589 N.E.2d 13, 16. Thus, the earlier and broader interpretation of unsoundness of mind set forth in <em>Bowman v. Lemon </em>(1926), 115 Ohio St. 326, 154 N.E. 317, has been superseded by a stricter interpretation of what constitutes mental disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>In view of the fact that the Supreme Court indicated in <em>Doe v. First United Methodist Church </em>that evidence of depression, guilt, anxiety, and other forms of emotional distress in victims of childhood sexual abuse is insufficient to toll the statute of limitations, this court is unable to determine that appellants\u2019 evidence was sufficient to raise a question of fact with regard to the application of R.C. 2305.16 to Toth\u2019s claims. <em>Detweiler v. Slavic </em>(Dec. 15, 1994), Cuyahoga App. No. 66718, unreported, 1994 WL 706151; <em>Peters v. Medaglia, supra; Horn v. Reese </em>(Oct. 11, 1995), Hamilton App. No. C-940934, unreported, 1995 WL 596065; cf. <em>Hogle v. Harvey </em>(Sept. 29, 1995), Ashtabula App. No. 94-A-0055, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Therefore, the trial court did not err in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>Casey v. Casey </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 830, 673 N.E.2d 210; <em>Winters v. Cleveland Clinic Found. </em>(May 1, 1997), Cuyahoga App. No. 71110, unreported, 1997 WL 218416; cf. <em>Wells v. Bowie </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 730, 622 N.E.2d 1170.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Accordingly, appellants\u2019 third assignment of error is also overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Finally, appellants\u2019 first assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment because genuine issues of material fact exist for reasonable minds to find that the doctrine of equitable estoppel barrs [sic] defendant from the benefit of the statute of limitations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Appellants argue that the conduct of appellee and its priests caused them to delay asserting their claims against appellee; therefore, the doctrine of equitable estoppel should be applied to preclude appellee from asserting a defense based upon the statute of limitations. Under Ohio law, the doctrine of equitable estoppel may be employed to prohibit inequitable use of the statute of limitations. <em>Schrader v. Gillette </em>(1988), 48 Ohio App.3d 181, 183, 549 N.E.2d 218, 220-221; see, also, <em>Cerney v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co. </em>(1995), 104 Ohio App.3d 482, 662 N.E.2d 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">This court has recently addressed the issue of equitable estoppel in a context similar to that of the case subjudice'and stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-10\">\u201cThe doctrine of equitable estoppel may be employed to prevent a defendant from asserting an otherwise valid right. <em>Lewis v. Motorists Ins. Cos. </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 575 [645 N.E.2d 784], * * * In order to establish equitable estoppel, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) that the defendant made a factual misrepresentation; (2) that it is misleading; (3) that induces actual reliance which is reasonable and in good faith; and (4) which causes detriment to the relying party. <em>Doe v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Ohio </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 369 [607 N.E.2d 492].\u201d <em>Moore v. Schiano, supra, </em>at 331, 690 N.E.2d at 600.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>With regard to the first two elements set forth above, the Ohio Supreme Court has indicated that a showing of \u201cactual or constructive fraud\u201d is necessary. <em>State ex rel. Ryan v. State Teachers Retirement Sys. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 362, 368, 643 N.E.2d 1122, 1128. Furthermore, in the context of a statute-of-limitations defense, plaintiff must show either \u201can affirmative statement that the statutory period to bring an action was larger than it actually was\u201d or \u201cpromises to make a better settlement of the claim if plaintiff did not bring the threatened suit,\u201d or \u201csimilar representations or conduct\u201d on defendant\u2019s part. <em>Cerney v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>104 Ohio App.3d at 488, 662 N.E.2d at 830. See, also, <em>Walworth v. BP Oil Co. </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 340, 678 N.E.2d 959.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">It must first be noted that appellants made no claim of fraud against appellee in their complaint. Cf. <em>Lewis v. Motorists Ins. Cos. </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 575, 585, 645 N.E.2d 784, 790, fn. 2. Appellants also failed to introduce any competent evidence in response to appellee\u2019s motions for summary judgment to demonstrate that either appellee or its priests engaged in any misrepresentations or conduct aimed at misleading appellants with regard to the filing of their claims. In their affidavits, appellants merely made statements to the effect that they were told by priests that they were \u201cnot to' tell\u201d of the incidents or that appellants would \u201cbring down the church\u201d if they filed suit. These statements, however, were insufficient to establish the first two elements of the doctrine of equitable estoppel. <em>State ex rel. Ryan v. State Teachers Retirement Sys., </em>71 Ohio St.3d 362, 643 N.E.2d 1122; <em>Cerney v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>104 Ohio App.3d 482, 662 N.E.2d 827. Appellants\u2019 allegations that appellee destroyed evidence, moreover, were completely unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Secondly, appellee\u2019s evidence demonstrated that appellants neither reasonably nor in good faith relied upon appellee\u2019s \u201cauthority\u201d over them in failing to timely assert their claims. Most of the appellants acknowledged in their deposition testimony that they felt little attachment to either appellee or their church. In the absence of evidence to contradict these admissions, appellants thus were unsuccessful in establishing the third element of the doctrine of equitable estoppel as well. <em>Schrader v. Gillette, </em>48 Ohio App.3d 181, 549 N.E.2d 218; cf., <em>Walworth v. BP Oil Co., </em>112 Ohio App.3d 340, 678 N.E.2d 959.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Therefore, the trial court did not err in failing to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel to bar appellee from asserting its statute-of-limitations defense on appellants\u2019 claims. Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is, accordingly, also overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b347-9\">Nahra, P.J., and Timothy E. McMonagle, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b333-10\">. The complaint named two plaintiffs, <em>viz., </em>Laura Livingston and Linda Rae Lotko-Toth; the remainder of the plaintiffs were designated as \"Jane Doe\u201d I through V. Subsequently, on August 1, 1994, appellants hied an amended complaint, which named as another plaintiff Mary V. Lewis. The allegations of the amended complaint were same as those of the original.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b333-11\">.

Nevertheless, since this court presumes regularity in the proceedings below and conducts a <em>de novo </em>review of the trial court\u2019s order, no prejudice results from the trial court's failure to rule on appellee\u2019s motion to strike.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b334-12\">.
