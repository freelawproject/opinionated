Appellant, Carol J. Miller, appeals from a judgment entry affirming the decision of the Ohio Unemployment Compensation Board of Review denying appellant unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">Appellant taught at appellee Sts. Peter and Paul School. Upon the end of her tenure with the school, appellant applied for unemployment compensation, and her request was disallowed. Appellant filed a request for reconsideration of the denial, and the disallowance was affirmed. Appellant then appealed to the board of review, which affirmed the administrator\u2019s determination that appellant was ineligible for unemployment compensation. On July 25,1995, the board of review disallowed appellant\u2019s application to institute further appeal of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">Pursuant to R.C. 4141.28(0)(1), appellant appealed the board of review\u2019s decision to the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas on August 22, 1995. The case was assigned to Judge Stuard. Appellee Ohio Bureau of Employment Services (\u201cOBES\u201d) filed a motion to dismiss, which was subsequently joined by the school and appellee Diocese of Youngstown.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-15\">On August 12, 1996, Judge McLain, sitting by assignment for Judge Stuard, issued a judgment entry reversing and vacating the decision of the board of review, finding that the school was not operated primarily for religious purposes. Consequently, the court held that the school was not exempt from furnishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>unemployment compensation to its employees. Furthermore, the matter was remanded to OBES to determine whether the school or the church was appellant\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">On August 14, 1996, OBES filed a motion to reconsider the court\u2019s judgment. \u25a0In a subsequent entry signed by Judge Stuard, the court held that the judgment entry filed on August 12, 1996 was \u201cimprovidently granted.\u201d The court further overruled appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss and set a briefing schedule to consider the merits of appellant\u2019s appeal from the decision of the board of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The parties filed briefs on the legal issues involved. In a judgment entry filed on January 6, 1997, the court held that the decision of the board of review was supported by competent, credible evidence, was not unlawful or unreasonable, and was not' against the manifest weight of the evidence. Appellant timely filed a notice of appeal and asserts the following as error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-6\">\u201c[1.] The lower court abused its discretion when it granted the motion for reconsideration after a final judgment entry had entered from such court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-7\">\u201c[2.] The lower court abused its discretion when it determined that the [djecision of the Board of Review is not unlawful, unreasonable or against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">In the first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the court of common pleas erred by considering appellees\u2019 motion for reconsideration, because such a motion is a nullity under the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Pitts v. Dept. of Transp. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 378, 380, 21 O.O.3d 238, 239, 423 N.E.2d 1105, 1107; see, also, <em>Anderson v. Anderson </em>(Nov. 21, 1997), Ashtabula App. No. 97-A-0030, unreported, at 8, 1997 WL 752622. However, this court has held that \u201c[t]he Rules of Appellate Procedure can be applied to administrative appeals when they are relevant and not in conflict with Chapter 2505 of the Revised Code. See R.C. 2505.03(B).\u201d <em>Trickett v. Randolph Twp. Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(Aug. 18, 1995), Portage App. No. 94-P-0007, unreported, at 12-13. In other words, the court of common pleas was not functioning as a tidal court, but as an appellate court. As a result, the Appellate Rules apply, and the court of common pleas could properly consider appellees\u2019 motion for reconsideration pursuant to App.R. 26(A). That rule recognizes an application for reconsideration and requires that it be filed within ten days of the announcement of the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Appellees filed a motion for reconsideration just two days after Judge McLain\u2019s judgment entry was filed. Therefore, the motion for reconsideration was appropriate and was not a nullity. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>In the second assignment of error, appellant contends that the court of common pleas erred by affirming the decision of the board of review denying her application for unemployment benefits. The court of common pleas may reverse or vacate the decision of the board of review only if \u201cthe decision was unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d R.C. 4141.28(0)(1). Our standard of review of the judgment of the court of common pleas is whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Angelkovski v. Buckeye Potato Chips Co. </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 159, 161, 11 OBR 242, 243-244, 463 N.E.2d 1280, 1282-1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">R.C. 4141.01(B)(3)(h)(i) states that an unemployment compensation claimant is not eligible for benefits if she worked \u201c[i]n the employ of a church or convention or association of churches, or in an organization which is <em>operated primarily for religious purposes </em>and which is operated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church or convention or association of churches.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Therefore, the primary substantive legal issues in the instant matter are first, whether appellant\u2019s employer, was an organization \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes,\u201d and, second, whether appellant\u2019s employer was an entity that was \u201csupervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">As a preliminary matter, we reject appellant\u2019s assertion that her employer was the Diocese of Youngstown. The board of review decided that \u201c[t]he record is clear that [appellant] was not employed by [the] Diocese of Youngstown during her base period.\u201d We agree. Sister Margaret Mary Schima, principal of the school, testified before the board of review that appellant had never been employed by the Diocese of Youngstown. Further, Thomas Welsch, personnel director with the Diocese of Youngstown Department of Education, testified that appellant was not employed by the Diocese of Youngstown during her base period for determining unemployment compensation. Therefore, the board of review\u2019s finding that appellant was not employed by the Diocese of Youngstown is supported by ample competent, credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">However, a question still remains with respect to whether appellant\u2019s employer was Sts. Peter and Paul Church or the school. The board of review did not answer this question and merely stated that regardless of which of the two entities was appellant\u2019s employer, appellant still would not be eligible for unemployment benefits pursuant to the exemption in R.C. 4141.01(B)(3)(h)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">In interpreting R.C. 4141.01(B)(3)(h)(i), the court in <em>Czigler v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Serv. </em>(1985), 27 Ohio App.3d 272, 272-273, 27 OBR 316, 316, 501 N.E.2d 56, 57, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>\u201c \u2018Primarily\u2019 is an adverb and, as the word implies, it modifies the verb \u2018operated.\u2019 It has no purpose or implication in this sentence as to the relative proportion of subject matter of a religious nature that must be provided. * * * The exemption statute simply requires that the purpose of the organization and its operation or support be primarily religiously oriented in the conduct of its activity. This exemption statute does not require or suggest the weighing of hours of secular and religious instruction or other activity. * * * Whether [secular or religious instruction] constitutes a majority of hours of instruction is irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-5\">\u201cThe exemption is determined by the purpose of the existence and operation of the school. If that purpose be primarily of a religious nature, the exemption applies without regard to the proportion of time devoted to religious instruction. As indicated, \u2018primarily\u2019 modifies the purpose of the operation, not the relative amount of religious activity or instruction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.Rev.1991) 1190, defines \u201cprimary\u201d as \u201c[f|irst; principal; chief; leading. First in order of time, or development, or in intention.\u201d It also defines \u201cprimary purpose\u201d as \u201c[t]hat which is first in intention; which is fundamental. The principal or fixed intention with which an act or course of conduct is undertaken.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1191.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">In the present matter, the board of review held that \u201c[t]he primary purpose of the school was teaching Catholic doctrine and perpetuating the Byzantine Rite. That purpose is clearly a religious purpose.\u201d Although a credible argument may be made that the primary purpose of the school is to educate children in all subjects, including religion, the court of common pleas did not abuse its discretion in affirming the board of review\u2019s conclusion. Despite the fact that the school\u2019s curriculum included instruction in secular subjects as well as religion, the principal of the school, Sister Schima, testified that the school was organized in 1955 in order to teach the Byzantine Rite and Catholic doctrine. Therefore, based upon this evidence, a reasonable and direct inference is that the reason for creating and operating a school affiliated with a religious denomination is to offer a learning experience dominated by a religious environment; a situation distinctly different than that offered in public schools. Consequently, the court of common pleas did not abuse its discretion in affirming the board of review\u2019s conclusion that the primary purpose of operating a school of this type is religious in nature, regardless of whether the school or the local church was appellant\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">The second issue is whether the school was supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church. Sister Schima testified that \u201c[t]he pastor of the parish runs the school.\u201d The only individuals authorized to sign paychecks, for the school were Sister Schima and the church\u2019s pastor. Furthermore, the record reflects that the pastor of the church exercised substantial control over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>the operations and spending of the school, as his consent was required to hire new teachers and to purchase supplies. Accordingly, the court of common pleas did not abuse its discretion in affirming the board of review\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s application for unemployment benefits. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">For the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s assignments of error are not well taken. The judgment of the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b799-7\">Edward J. Mahoney, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b799-8\">William M. O\u2019Neill, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b799-9\">Edward J. Mahoney, J., retired, of the Ninth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b799-10\">William M. O\u2019Neill, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AK4\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">I respectfully dissent from the opinion of the majority on two bases. First, I remain convinced that a motion for reconsideration is a nullity under <em>Pitts v. Dept. of Transp. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 378, 380, 21 O.O.3d 238, 239, 423 N.E.2d 1105, 1107. Therefore, I would hold that the trial court erred in considering appellees\u2019 motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the court could have considered appellees\u2019 motion for reconsideration, appellees failed to demonstrate the type of extraordinary circumstances that generally require granting relief under App.R. 26(A). In order for an appellate court to grant a motion for reconsideration, the movant must identify \u201can obvious error in its decision\u201d or demonstrate that the court did not properly consider an issue. <em>Matthews v. Matthews </em>(1981), 5 Ohio App.3d 140, 143, 5 OBR 320, 323, 450 N.E.2d 278, 282. In the instant matter, the only reasoning provided in the court\u2019s subsequent entry granting the motion for reconsideration was that Judge McLain\u2019s entry was \u201cimprovidently granted.\u201d In my view, such a conclusion does not rise to the level of the type of relief envisioned by App.R. 26(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">Furthermore, if appellant\u2019s employer was the school, I cannot agree with the conclusion that the primary purpose was religion. The evidence very clearly demonstrated the purpose of the school was to educate children, and any religious aspect was laudable, but incidental to that mission. The majority relies upon <em>Czigler v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Serv. </em>(1985), 27 Ohio App.3d 272, 27 OBR 316, 501 N.E.2d 56, to establish that the primary purpose of a religious school is religion. However, in that case, the school was a \u201cpervasively religious educational institution operated, conducted and financed exclusively by the Jewish community <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>for the purpose of preserving its religious traditions and practices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274, 27 OBR at 317, 501 N.E.2d at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
