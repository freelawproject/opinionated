Defendants refuse to further employ plaintiffs because plaintiffs decline to resign from and disassociate themselves with the American Jai-Alai Players Association, an organization to which plaintiffs belong. Defendants\u2019 fronton in Miami is the only place in continental United States where jai-alai is played, and plaintiffs are the only available jai-alai players who are United States citizens. Defendants, the Fronton Company and its managing officers, conspired with divers aliens who are jaialai players in other countries to unlawfully enter the United States as \u201ccontract laborers\u201d and supplanted plaintiffs with them as professional players at the Miami fronton, thus depriving plaintiffs of their means of livelihood. Plaintiffs contend that as a result of the alleged conspiracy to vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>late 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 136(h) they have been deprived of \u201cthe opportunity to earn a livelihood as professional jai-alai players, * * and, unless redress is here granted, their privileges and immunities as citizens 'will be abridged, and they will be denied the equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Resting jurisdiction upon 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343, plaintiffs seek an injunction restraining defendants from further importing alien players, and \u201csuch monetary damages as the facts, evidence and circumstances shall warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">The fallacy of plaintiffs\u2019 position lies in the assumption that 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 136(h) confers upon them a \u201ccivil right\u201d which is personal to plaintiffs, a conspiracy to deprive them of which may be redressed under 8 U.S.C.A. 47(3)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">Title 8 U.S.C.A. section 136(h) is a part of a general alien exclusion law founded upon broad concepts of public policy relating to immigration, and excluding certain designated classes of aliens, amongst which are \u201ccontract laborers.\u201d Its enforcement is confided to the Commissioner of Immigration under the direction of the Attorney General. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 102, 103, 131. The statute is designed to prohibit, not the mere injury to an individual which might result from the prohibited acts, but the harm to the general public which would be occasioned by the evils against which -the statute is directed. While the plaintiffs, like any other citizens, are entitled to the benefits of the statute generally, it confers no specific rights which are individual or personal to the plaintiffs to have any particular alien or class of aliens excluded. Consequently, there is no right or privilege which may be redressed under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 47(3) at the instance of plaintiffs. There can be no deprivation of a right or privilege that is nonexistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-13\">Moreover, under the statute the exclusion of alien contract laborers is not absolute. The act clothes the Attorney General with discretionary authority to admit skilled labor when in his judgment certain conditions prescribed by the act are fulfilled. The aliens in question were admitted, as temporary visitors, under this discretionary authority, so their entry into this country, which is alleged to have been the object of the conspiracy, was a lawful entry. Such an entry involves no denial to the plaintiffs of equal rights, privileges or immunities under the laws, hence the alleged activities of the defendants in procuring it would not be actionable under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 47(3). The complaint alleges no inequality of treatment by the public officials charged with the duty of executing the law, nor does it charge a conspiracy on the part of the defendants to bring about such inequality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-14\">Viewing the complaint as a whole, it appears that what the plaintiffs really seek to redress is the deprivation of their former employment, forcing their re-employment by defendants by cutting off the supply of alien jai-alai players from abroad. The right of employment, and its redress when invaded, is exclusively within the domain of the state. It is not a federal civil right. Love v. Chandler, 8 Cir., 124 F.2d 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-15\">The complaint was properly dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">. \u201c(3) If two or more persons * * * conspire * * * for the purpose of depriving * * * any person * * * of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws; * * * in any case of conspiracy set forth in this section, if one or more persons engaged therein do, or cause to be done, any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or property, or deprived of having and exercising any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States, the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages, occasioned by such injury or deprivation, against any one or more of the conspirators.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
