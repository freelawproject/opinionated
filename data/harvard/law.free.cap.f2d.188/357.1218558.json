Mullett, an officer of respondent, that it had partially complied with the Labor Board\u2019s order by offering re-employment to most of said former employees. Attached to the affidavit and made a part thereof are copies of letters alleged to have been written to said former employees offering them employment, pursuant to the order of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">The National Labor Relations Board opposes respondent\u2019s petition to adduce such additional evidence on the ground that it is immaterial in enforcement proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">In National Labor Relations Board v. Mexia Textile Mills, 339 U.S. 563, 567, 70 S.Ct. 826, 828, the Supreme Court said: \u201cWe think it plain from the cases that the employer\u2019s compliance with an order of the Board does not render the cause moot, depriving the Board of its opportunity to secure enforcement from an appropriate court. * * * A Board order imposes a continuing obligation; and the Board is entitled to have the resumption of the unfair practice barred by an enforcement decree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-15\">And again, 339 U.S. at page 569, 70 S.Ct. at page 830, the Supreme Court said: \u201cIf compliance with an order of the Board is irrelevant to the reviewing court\u2019s function after the new evidence has been adduced, we do not see that there is point in adducing evidence of that compliance. This Court has emphasized that the 'power to adduce additional evidence granted to the Circuit Court of Appeals by \u00a7 10(e) cannot be employed to enlarge the statutory scope of judicial review/ \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-16\">. In that case a dissenting opinion by Mister Justice Frankfurter started with the sentence, 339 U.S. at page 570, 70 S.Ct. at page 833: \u201cCompliance with an order of the National Relations Board is, of course, no defense to the Board\u2019s petition for judicial enforcement of its order.\u201d See also National Labor Relations Board v. Pool Manufacturing Co., 339 U.S. 577, 70 S.Ct. 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-17\">Since the evidence sought to be adduced is immaterial, the petition of <em>the respondent is </em>denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
