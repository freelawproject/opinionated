The Board alleges on information and belief that the action in the State court was instituted and prosecuted as part of a plan of stockholders and officers of the Hardwood Company to prefer their claims against the Company to that of the Board, and thus to defeat the jurisdiction of this court to enforce the Board\u2019s back pay order now before the court on the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement. It seeks the order of this court compelling respondents to disclose to the Board the consideration for the debts of the Hardwood Company to secure which the Company executed the mortgages foreclosed by the decree of the State court.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-22\">The insurmountable obstacle in the way of the Board\u2019s petition is the final decree of the State court in the foreclosure action. The State court in its decree has determined the considerations the dates when incurred, and the validity of the obligations of the Hardwood Company secured by mortgages involved in the foreclosure action. The Board was not a necessary party to the foreclosure action in the State court. That it had no notice of the State court action until after the entry of its final decree is therefore of no significance. But if the Board considers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>it is a proper party in the foreclosure action, the State court has retained jurisdiction for the protection of the rights of intervening parties. This court is without power to review the State court decree in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The petition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
