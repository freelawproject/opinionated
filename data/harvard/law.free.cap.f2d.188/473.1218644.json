We are to say that the judge was bound to accept his story that on a fire escape outside his window in Manhattan, he could and did discover, and incorporate as the first step of his process, the \u201ccure\u201d of ground pork at a temperature which in winter ranged for three days between 22 and 26 degrees Fahrenheit. Again the judge was bound to accept it that he maintained in a steel cylinder, contrived by himself, a <em>\u201cvacuum\u201d </em>of twelve pounds <em>\u201cpressure\u201d </em>by means of the evaporation of dried peas which continued during the <em>\u201ccooling\u201d </em>period. Again, the judge was to accept the authenticity of the confirmatory document of October, 1933, which consisted of a page of recipes given to his friend\u2019s wife for her personal use in the household, interpolated into which was what he supposed to be the defendant\u2019s formula, followed by the words: \u201cready for trade.\u201d This recipe itself was as follows: \u201ccook in Vacuum 225\u00b0 F. 12 lb. pressure for 1 Hour.\u201d How such a direction, had it been physically possible at all, could have been thought serviceable in a kitchen, we are not advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-24\">We need go no further; we have seldom encountered a tale so patently trumped up; it was not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d to disbelieve it; on the contrary, not only would it have been \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d it would have been fatuous, to do otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-25\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
