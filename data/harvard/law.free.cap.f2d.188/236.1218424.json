The complaint alleged that while the insurance \u201cwas in force, the steam cylinder operating the cotton compress in the said premises exploded, causing the piston to penetrate the cylinder walls and fly through the roof, falling upon the building and damaging it * * *.\u201d The defendant filed a motion to dismiss upon the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, urging that the explosion alleged was not a risk insured against. The trial Court, in a memorandum opinion, held that the provisions of the exclusion clause were unambiguous and subject to construction by the Court as a matter of law, and specifically, that the words \u201csteam engine\u201d were unambiguous and \u201csubject to judicial cognizance as a scientific fact,\u201d and that the word \u201c \u2018engine\u2019 when used in connection with steam, can only mean a contrivance which harnesses the steam.\u201d Finding the \u201ccylinder\u201d to be the most important part of a steam engine and \u201cmore the steam engine than any other composite part,\u201d the Court thought the allegation that \u201c \u2018the steam cylinder * * * exploded\u2019 \u201d instead of a \u201c \u2018steam engine\u2019 \u201d was only a \u201cplay on words,\u201d since the words \u201csteam engine\u201d were construed as \u201csynonymous with the excluded explosion.\u201d The Court accordingly sustained the motion to dismiss. , The plaintiff appeals from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-19\">It is the contention of appellant, as finally summarized, in argument and brief before us, that under Article 1946 of the Louisiana Civil Code reading: \u201c \u2018The words of a contract are to be understood, like those of a law, in the common and usual signification, without attending so much to grammatical rules, , as to general and popular use\u2019, it should have the opportunity of showing what the general and popular use of the term \u2018steam engine\u2019 embraces. * * * The sole question is whether the thing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>exploded is one and the same as a \u2018steam engine.\u2019 No question of construction of the contract is involved. Briefly stated, in ordinary and common parlance, and apart from technical definitions, is a \u2018steam engine\u2019 a \u2018steam compress\u2019 and <em>mee versa,, </em>is a \u2018steam compress\u2019 a \u2018steam engine\u2019?\u201d The appellee, to the contrary, contends that the meaning of words of the policy provision are a matter for the determination of the Court and not for a jury, and that \u201cthe explosion of the cylinder is nothing less than, and nothing more than, an explosion of the engine.\u201d Definition of the words \u201ccylinder,\u201d \u201cengine,\u201d and \u201csteam engine\u201d are urged in support of this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Our consideration of the issues involved leaves us not entirely with either the appellant or the appellee. We think that the construction and application of the exclusion clause is a matter for the Court, but we are of the opinion that the trial Court erred in his interpretation of the breadth and scope of the exclusion provision and in holding, in effect, that the allegation that a steam cylinder operating the cotton compress exploded must, as a matter of law, be taken to mean that within the terms of the exclusion, a steam engine exploded.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The proper approach to a determination of the coverage of the insurance against direct loss by explosion provided by the policy, as restricted by the terms of the exclusion provisions, requires consideration of the language employed. While the matter is not entirely free from doulbt, we are of the opinion that the term \u201csteam engine,\u201d when considered in connection with its associated language and the provision as a whole, should be held to have a meaning restricted in application as thus determined by the words with which it is associated. The ruling of the trial Court gives to the words \u201csteam engine\u201d a meaning sufficiently broad to include any contrivance or apparatus operated by steam. The language of the provision in question,' which includes also boilers, pipes, steam turbines and flywheels, properly means, we think, steam engines of the conventional type, those which, broadly stated, by the devolutions -of its shaft provides a means of motive power when connected to machinery. The words \u201csteam engine\u201d, in general and popular use have an accepted meaning, we think, of an engine operated by steam to produce motive power by its revolutions induced by the set and forced operation of not only the force of steam in the cylinder, but its application upon the piston by means of the eccentric rod and valve rod opening and closing the valves to permit the entrance and exhaust of steam, and which by the revolutions thereby induced produces and furnishes motive power. Without attempting a technical discussion, we think the words \u201csteam engine\u201d in common acceptation mean an engine operated by steam and having the same function as the usual gas engine, so similar as a means of propulsion of machinery and automobiles. We are supported in this view by the dictionary and encyclopedic definitions and illustrations of steam engines. This conclusion is not weakened by the fact that a piston and cylinder are important parts of the conventional steam engine. The fact that some piece of machinery might have a part similar to that also found in a steam engine does not establish that such apparatus is a steam engine. If the term \u201csteam engine\u201d as employed in the provision now under consideration was intended to or should be held to have the same meaning as steam machinery or steam apparatus, there would be no necessity for the inclusion along with it of the term \u201csteam turbine.\u201d It should be observed that a steam turbine (exclusion for explosions of which is expressly specified preceding the words \u201csteam engine,\u201d), has a similar meaning and resultant use as we have applied to the conventional steam engine, only the method of application of steam energy to obtain such result being different. Our conclusion is further strengthened by the association in connection with steam engines and steam turbines in the exception of \u201cfly-wheels.\u201d This is a component and generally employed part of the conventional steam . engine providing motive power by its revolutions, the purpose of which is to prevent fluctuations of speed, in the revolution of the engine, and as defined by Webster, especially a heavy wheel \u201con an engine crankshaft to counter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>act variable torque during; the stroke and to carry the engine over the dead centers.\u201d In the light of these considerations, we think the trial Court gave to the language of the exclusion too broad a meaning when he ascribed to it an exemption of liability from the explosion of any machinery operated by the application of steam energy by means of a cylinder and piston.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">With the proper meaning of the terms of the policy provisions established, it results that there was error in sustaining the motion to dismiss. The question remains as to what feature of the case remains to be tried, since it is conceded by the appellee that there is no dispute as to the amount of damage, or insurance payable if the Court determines coverage under the policy. Thus the only issue which could remain is whether the steam compress, being operated as alleged by a steam cylinder, comes within the definition of a steam engine which we have enforced under the provisions of the policy. While we might be justified in declaring coverage as a matter of law based upon our understanding of the operation of a cotton compress, we prefer not to conclusively determine the matter upon the concessions made since the precise similarity or dissimilarity between the steam compress in question and a steam engine is not conceded. We therefore only reverse the judgment of the trial Court in sustaining the motion to dismiss and remand the cause for further proceedings in accordance with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-16\">.
