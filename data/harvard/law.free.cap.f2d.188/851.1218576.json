The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>petition proposed an arrangement by which unsecured merchandise creditors were to receive payment of 50% in six months and the balance at the end of the year, while the other unsecured creditors were to receive 2% within three months and 5% every three months thereafter until the remaining 98% was paid; the debtor was to continue in possession, operating the business, and to set aside all money it received, to be used in carrying out the proposed arrangement. Appellant, not a merchandise creditor, has a claim on a note for $12,-480.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b909-5\">The judge, on January 24, made an order restraining any proceeding against the debtor and continuing the debtor in possession, operating the business. Shortly thereafter all the unsecured creditors, except the appellant, accepted the arrangement, but no meeting of creditors was ever held.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b909-6\">Some eight months later, on November 13, the debtor filed (a) a petition for leave to sell all of its assets to a designated purchaser at a price of $29,500 and (b) a petition proposing the following modified arrangement: Out of the proceeds of the sale, there were to be paid in full (1) payroll and taxes of $876.96, (2) the principal and interest on a loan of $1,647.95 (owing to the debtor\u2019s president, and contracted with the court\u2019s approval), and (3) the merchandise creditors with claims aggregating $4,605.34; the balance of the proceeds, or approximately $22,000.00, was to be paid pro rata to the other unsecured creditors with aggregate claims of some $56,520.00, consisting of salary claims of $6,600 and claims on notes in the amount of $49,920.00. The petition for the sale stated that the operation of the oil and gas lease still continued to produce oil; that \u201cthe oil runs continued to decrease,\u201d and the petitioner \u201cfinds it unfavorable to operate the property any more, * * * in view of the rising costs of labor and the decrease in production\u201d ; that \u201cthe greatest value that * * * the lease now has is the value of the pipe and machinery\u201d; that the cost of pipe has risen and new pipe is not readily available, so \u201cthat the present is the most propitious time for the sale of the same\u201d; that petitioner had endeavored to sell the property to many persons; that the best offer received was $29,500.00 and petitioner believes it could receive no better offer; and that because of the condition of the oil lease, petitioner cannot obtain the cash required under the provisions of the proposed modified arrangement. Attached to the original petition, filed in January, were statements of the debtor showing that the cost of its land and fixed assets was $434,741.41; its pipe and fittings were there shown to have cost $104,638.78, and its power and well equipment, $93,823.32.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b909-8\">All the unsecured creditors except appellant consented to the sale and to the modified arrangement. The petition for leave to propose the modification of the arrangement also referred to the sale and prayed (1) leave to propose the modification and (2) authority to make the sale. This petition stated that no notice of the application should be given to any creditor except appellant since all other unsecured creditors had consented. On November 13th the court ordered appellant, \u201cthe only adverse party,\u201d to show cause why the court should not authorize the sale and the petition for leave to propose the modified arrangement. On December 4, 1950 the court, without calling a creditors\u2019 meeting, entered two orders; one order confirmed the modified arrangement, and the other authorized the sale. Appellant has appealed solely from the order approving the sale.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b909-9\">Raichle, Tucker &amp; Moore, Buffalo, N. Y. (Frank G.

This section is worded the same as \u00a7 116(3), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 516(3), relative to such a sale in a Chapter X proceeding. It has been held that to prove \u201ccause\u201d for a sale under \u00a7 116(3) it is necessary to show that the assets are, in effect, \u201cperishable\u201d; such a sale must \u201cbe confined to emergencies where there is imminent danger that the assets of the ailing business will be lost if prompt action is not taken.\u201d In re Solar Mfg. Corp., 3 Cir., 176 F.2d 493, 494. See also In re V. Loewer\u2019s Gambrinus Brewing Co., Inc., 2 Cir., 141 F.2d 747, 748, where we stated the facts as follows: \u201cThere was no working capital on hand sufficient to operate the business and the creditors \u00e1nd stockholders were unwilling to furnish any. With the approach of warm weather the vats, kettles and other brewery machinery would deteriorate rapidly and lose substantially all their value, while both real and personal property would be absorbed by the mortgagee.\u201d We think \u00a7 313(2) must be similarly interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">The debtor here, therefore, was obliged to allege and had the burden of proving the existence of an emergency involving imminent danger of loss of the assets if they were not promptly sold. The petition for sale fell far short of alleging such facts. Nor is there a finding of fact, based upon evidence; supporting the conclusion that \u201ccause\u201d had been shown. Such a finding is required.<footnotemark>1a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">Section 216(10), applicable to a Chapter X proceeding, provides that a plan may authorize the sale of all the assets \u201cat not less than a fair upset price\u201d and the distribution- of the proceeds among the creditors. Although Fidelity Assurance Ass\u2019n v. Sims, 318 U.S. 608, 63 S.Ct. 807, 87 L.Ed. 1032, throws some doubt on the scope of that section, the Sims case has been held to authorize a sale in pursuance of a Chapter X plan, at least where the original Chapter X petition was filed in good faith<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But Chapter XI, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 701 et seq., contains no provision such as- \u00a7 216(10) ; and Section 101, part of Chapter X, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 501 et seq., states: \u201cThe provisions of this chapter shall apply exclusively to proceedings under this chapter.\u201d A report of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in connection with the 1938 revision of the Bankruptcy Act, said that \u00a7 101 \u201cprevents the extension and application of any provisions of Chapter X to other chapters of this bill.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">There are good reasons why Congress, provided that a sale of all assets may be-part of a Chapter X plan but did not so-provide with respect to a Chapter XI arrangement: In Chapter X, under \u00a7 167, an independent trustee ordinarily investigates, all matters relating to the property of the company, examines the officers of the debtors and others concerning.such matters;, under \u00a7 169, the trustee prepares and presents the plan which the judge considers together with objections or alternative plans-proposed by any creditor; under \u00a7 175,, only after the judge approves the piando the creditors vote on it; under \u00a7 176, consents to a plan can ordinarily not be-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>obtained until the judge has approved it; and under \u00a7 216(10) the sale must be \u201cat not less than a fair upset price\u201d. The difference between a Chapter X and a Chapter XI plan is the more striking when, as here, the Chapter XI petition is filed under \u00a7 322, for then no trustee is appointed to administer the estate before confirmation of the arrangement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">It is true that \u00a7 306(1) defines a Chapter XI arrangement as \u201cany plan of a debtor for the settlement, satisfaction, or extension of the time of payment of his unsecured debts, upon any terms\u201d. It is urged that this section imports into Chapter XI something the equivalent of \u00a7 216 (10)\u2014 <em>i. </em>&lt;?., that it authorizes a plan for a sale of all the assets and the liquidation of the unsecured debts. This would mean that a Chapter XI plan could bring about the same result as ordinary bankruptcy proceedings but minus the protective provisions which are part of the latter, especially as to a sale of all the assets.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We cannot accept that interpretation of \u00a7 306(1). It must be read together with \u00a7 356 which provides that \u201cAn arrangement * * * shall include provisions modifying the rights of unsecured creditors\u201d. We agree with the following comment :<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cBut notwithstanding the breadth of the definition of an arrangement under Chapter XI, the arrangement must comprehend something more than a mere surrender by the debtor of all his assets for liquidation and distribution to creditors; an arrangement is defined as a \u2018plan of the debtor,\u2019 but there is no \u2018planning\u2019 by a bankrupt in proposing that his creditors be given what the law provides in liquidation under straight bankruptcy. The requirement that an arrangement shall include provisions modifying the rights of creditors clearly means some modification devised by the debtor, not by Congress.\u201d From the facts meagerly appearing in this record, we assume that, in ordinary bankruptcy, the merchandise creditors, with claims aggregating $4,605.34, and the salary claims aggregating $6,600.00, would have been entitled to priority over the other unsecured creditors, with note claims aggregating $49,920.00.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The only difference between the confirmed liquidation arrangement and ordinary bankruptcy is, then, that holders of salary claims, aggregating $6,-600, have consented that their claims are to be subordinated to the $4,605.34 of claims of the merchandise creditors. That subordination of those salary claims, with the result that they cannot be paid in full, would have been invalid without their consent, either in ordinary bankruptcy or under Chapter XI, at least without the consent of a majority in number and amount of that class, \u00a7 362, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 762. The mere consent to such subordination by one small group of creditors does not (at least in a case, like this, where no emergency is pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>ent) validate a Chapter XI liquidation plan which deprives any other non-consenting creditor (who will not be paid in full) of the benefits of the provisions safeguarding a sale in ordinary bankruptcy. Accordingly, the sale here cannot be justified as a part of a valid Chapter XI arrangement. The fact that the great majority of the note-holders consented to the invalid sale is immaterial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">We conclude, therefore, that the order authorizing the sale was in error and must be reversed. As there was no stay or supersedeas bond, and as the district court had jurisdiction, if the sale was completed and confirmed before the appeal, the sale cannot be undone, if the purchase was bona fide, <em>i. e., </em>not made indirectly for the debtor or for some other party or parties to the Chapter XI proceeding.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cBut whether or not the sale in this case was bona fide, and should stand, is not a question which can be determined now, or which should be allowed to affect the character or scope of our action on the appeal.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">If on the remand it should appear that the sale was not bona fide,<footnotemark>10a</footnotemark> then, as the debtor will presumably be unable to deposit the funds pursuant to the previously confirmed arrangement, this will follow: The Chapter XI proceedings must be dismissed or transferred to ordinary bankruptcy,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> unless the debtor either (1) reverts to the arrangement originally proposed in the original petition or (2) offers a new valid modified arrangement. If either (1) or (2) occurs, then the court (pursuant either to \u00a7 334 or \u00a7 365) should promptly call a creditors\u2019 meeting, at which the debtor will be examined; before confirming either the initial or a new modified arrangement, the court must see that all the requirements of \u00a7 366 are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-17\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b910-6\">. In these circumstances, we are not to be taken as saying that the original arrangement was valid or filed in good faith, for we have no occasion to consider those questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1a\">\n<p id=\"b910-7\">.

The claims of the unsecured creditors other than the merchandise and salary creditors consisted of notes held by the small number of stockholders for loans to the debtor apparently in proportion to their holdings of stock.

No one doubts that the original plan of arrangement satisfied the requirements of Chapter XI or that it was offered in good faith. The question presented is whether a bankruptcy court may, after an initial plan has proved unworkable, order the sale of the debtor\u2019s assets and distribute the proceeds pursuant to an arrangement under Chapter XI. In my opinion the provisions of Chapter XI are broad enough to permit it to do so. In section 306(1), 11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 706(1), \u201carrangement\u201d is defined to include \u201cany plan of a debtor for the settlement, satisfaction, or extension of the time of payment of his unsecured debts, upon any terms\u201d. The court \u201cmay\u201d authorize the sale of \u201cany property of the debtor * * * upon such terms and conditions as the court may approve\u201d. Section 313(2), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 713(2). The arrangement \u201cmay\u201d include provisions for the continuation of the debtor\u2019s business or \u201cany other appropriate provisions not inconsistent with this chapter.\u201d Section 357(5) and (8), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 757(5) and (8). In sharp contrast with the grants of permissive authority which these sections vest in the court, section 356, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 756, is mandatory: the arrangement \u201cshall include provisions modifying or altering the rights of unsecured creditors\u201d. The modified arrangement, which the court confirmed, divided the creditors into three classes, provided payment in full for two of the classes and pro rata partial payment for the third class, and proposed a sale of the debtor\u2019s assets to obtain the funds necessary to carry out the arrangement. In my opinion the proposed alteration of the rights of the third class is within section 357(1) and the proposal to raise the necessary funds by a sale is a permissible provision within section 357(8). My brothers suggest that the confirmed arrangement made no change in the rights of the unsecured creditors as between merchandise creditors and note-holder creditors, since the merchandise creditors would be entitled in ordinary bankruptcy to priority over the note-holders (stockholders) listed in class three. I am not convinced that the evidence in the record sustains this conclusion. But passing this, I can see no basis for thinking that the merchandise creditors would in bankruptcy proceedings be entitled to priority over the salary claims held by three of the listed creditors. Such priority as the plan gives the merchandise creditors over the salary claims is by virtue of \u00a7 362, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">In neither of the cases cited by my brothers for the proposition that the power of sale is confined to perishable assets was the sale made pursuant to a plan of reorganization. Authority for a sale under a Chapter X plan is found in section 216 (10), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 616(10). Because no similar section appears in Chapter XI, my brothers think that authority is lacking to order a sale of the debtor\u2019s assets pursuant to a plan of arrangement. If a plan of arrangement which alters the rights of one class of unsecured creditors and proposes a sale to obtain the funds necessary to carry it out, is confirmed by the court, as it was in the case at bar, I cannot believe that the court lacks power to authorize the sale.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nor am I alarmed by the absence of a provision such as is found in section 216(10), with respect to \u201ca fair upset price.\u201d The appointment of an appraiser is within the court\u2019s discretion. Section 333, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 733. If the power to order a sale is not to be found in section 313(2), of which I am not convinced, I would invoke section 2, sub. a(7), 11 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 11, sub. a(7), which invests courts of bankruptcy with power to \u201cCause the estates of bankrupts to be collected, reduced to money and distributed,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or would imply the power as one necessary to carry out a confirmed plan of arrangement. I would affirm the order on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-26\">. Such was the situation in Matter of Western Steel &amp; Equipment Corp. (Ref. Oregon), 45 Am.Bankr.Rep.,N.S., 361.
