In their complaint they charged defendant with having infringed the copyrights, and with unfair competition. The copyrights cover \u201cstatuettes\u201d and fall under classification (g), Section 5, Title 17 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5(g), which provides protection for \u201cWorks of art; models or designs for works of art.\u201d One of the copyrights is for a \u201cSculptured Figure of Female Balinese Dancer,\u201d and the other for a male Balinese dancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">The record discloses that a hearing was had on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, and on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint. In its motion to dismiss, defendant urged, <em>inter </em>alia, that the copyright laws prevent the copyright registration of an article of manufacture such as electric lamps, even if the same is artistically made or ornamented; that the copyrights, if valid, are restricted to statuettes and not to electric table lamps; and that defendant does not manufacture or sell statuettes but is engaged in the selling and distribution of an electric lamp which is an article of manufacture for a utilitarian purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">It is true that plaintiffs have never manufactured and sold any statuettes such as they registered in the Copyright Office; they have, however, manufactured and sold electric table lamps which embody the design of the copyrighted statuettes, marked with a copyright notice, that is, plaintiffs have added lamp sockets and shades to the statuette and used it as a base or standard for table lamps, and it is undisputed that defendant has placed on the market and is selling table lamps which are identical in every respect with those of plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">The trial judge held that plaintiffs\u2019 submission of the statuettes with the lamp mounting stubs to the Copyright Office was evidence of the practical use to which the statuettes were intended to be put, and that plaintiffs could not monopolize such use under the copyright statute. He denied the motion for an injunction and dismissed the complaint insofar as it related to the alleged copyright infringement. To reverse this order, plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">In arguing for a reversal, plaintiffs make the point that the fact that the statuette may be utilized for some practicable use does not change the character of it. They insist that a sculptured statue is a \u201cwork of art,\u201d and since statuary is registrable matter they are entitled to protection, and the copyrights must be enforced. On the other hand, defendant , contends that plaintiffs\u2019\" copyrights do not cover or protect an electric table lamp, and that the Copyright Office cannot grant a monopoly on such a device. In support of plaintiffs\u2019 contention they cite, among other cases, Bleistein v. Donaldson Co., 188 U.S. 239, 23 S.Ct. 298, 47 L.Ed. 460; Pellegrini v. Allegrini, D.C., 2 F.2d 610; and United States v. Backer, 2 Cir., 134 F.2d 533. We have examined and considered all the cases cited but are not persuaded that a design of an electric lamp may be protected as a monopoly by means of a copyright registration, registered without an examination as to originality, novelty or inventiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-14\">Congress has provided two separate, and distinct classes or fields of protection; the copyright and the patent. Copyright registrations are granted by filing with the Copyright Office two reproductions of the \"work of art\u201d with copyright notice and a fee of $4.00. The Copyright Office makes no examination or search as to the originality or novelty of the claimed \u201cwork of art.\u201d Applications for design patents are filed in the United States Patent Office and are subject to an examination in which the examiner searches through all available publications, prior patents and all prior art available, to determine if the design <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>possesses the qualities requisite to granting a design patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">It is true that the Copyright Act protects \u201cWorks of art; models or designs for works of art,\u201d but the Act does not refer to articles of manufacture having a utilitarian purpose nor does it provide for a previous examination by a proper tribunal as to the originality of the matter offered for copyright and \u00a7 202.8, 17 U.S. C.A. following \u00a7 207 provides: \u201cWorks of art (Class G)-(a) In general. This class includes works of artistic craftsmanship, in so far as their form but not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects are concerned, such, as artistic jewelry, enamels, glassware, and tapestries, as well as all works belonging to the fine arts, such as paintings, drawings and sculpture. * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The purpose of the design patent law, 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 73, is to promote the decorative arts and to stimulate the exercise of inventive faculty in improving the appearance of articles of manufacture. Hueter v. Compco Corp., 6 Cir., 179 F.2d 416. It provides that \u201cAny person who has invented any new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture, not known or used by others in this country before his invention thereof * * * may * * * obtain a patent therefor.\u201d That is to say, to authorize a design patent, the exercise of inventive faculty is required. S. Dresner &amp; Son, Inc., v. Doppelt, 7 Cir., 120 F.2d 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">We have been told that an object of practical use is subject to patent protection, Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. 99, 25 L.Ed. 841, and it has been held that copyrighting \u201cworks of art\u201d or \u201cdesigns of works of art\u201d does not give a copyright owner a monopoly on the article itself if it is to be used for an article of manufacture. Kemp &amp; Beatley v. Hirsch, D.C., 34 F.2d 291; compare Gorham Mfg. Co. v. White, 14 Wall. 511, 81 U.S. 511, 525, 20 L.Ed. 731, and Taylor Instrument Companies v. Fawley-Brost Co., 7 Cir., 139 F.2d 98. It is possible that plaintiffs might have obtained design patents for the statuettes as a part of an article of merchandise, a question we do not decide, but since they have no such patents, it follows that the order of the District Court must be affirmed. It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
