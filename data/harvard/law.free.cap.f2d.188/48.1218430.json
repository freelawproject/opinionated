Goetten, Asst. U. S. Atty., Washington, D. C., with whom George Morris Fay, U. S. Atty., and William S. McKinley and Joseph M. Howard, Asst. U. S. Attys., all of Washington, D. C., were on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b104-19\">Before EDGERTON, BAZELON, and FAHY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b104-20\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b104-21\">Appellant has been convicted of obtaining money by false pretenses. D.C.Code (1940) \u00a7 22 \u2014 1301, 50 Stat. 628. He represented a bad check as good and got a hotel to cash it. He then left the District of Columbia without paying his hotel bill. He was arrested in Tennessee, and returned here for trial, several years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-22\">The statute of limitations, on which he relies, did not run during his absence. This is true even if he did not, as apparently he did, leave to avoid prosecution. \u201cThe question is not whether he remained out of the District for any particular reason, or at all; it is enough that he did not remain for three years within the District.\u201d McGowen v. United States, 70 App. D.C. 268, 269, 105 F.2d 791, 792, 124 A.L.R. 1047.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-23\">The court rightly admitted in evidence some 13 other bad checks which appellant represented as good, and for which he got cash, at about the same time as the one on which he was convicted. \u201cThe question was one of fraudulent intent or not; and upon questions of that sort * * * it has always been deemed allowable * * * to introduce evidence of other acts and doings of the party, of a kindred character.\u201d Wood v. United States, 16 Pet. 341, 41 U.S. 341, 358, 10 L.Ed. 987. \u201cKnowledge of the falsity of the other representations need not be shown * * * It is the mere recurrence of similar incorrect (not necessarily knowingly false) representations which leads to the belief that they could not have been made innocently; we may assume that any given one might have been innocent, but cannot concede this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>when we notice the recurrence.\u201d 2 Wig-more on Evidence, 3 ed., \u00a7 321(2) (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Since \u201cjurisdiction in a criminal case is not impaired by the fact that the accused was brought before the court in an unlawful manner,\u201d Sheehan v. Huff, <em>78 </em>U.S.App.D.C. 391, 142 F.2d 81, we need not consider appellant\u2019s criticism of the warrant on which he was arrested. Cf. Gillars v. United States, 87 U.S.App.D.C. 16, 182 F.2d 962, 972. \"</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">We find no merit in appellant\u2019s other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
