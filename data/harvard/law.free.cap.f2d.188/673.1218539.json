The District Court dismissed the appellant\u2019s complaint by which the appellant sought to have the court authorize the issuance of a design patent. The refusal of the patent by the Patent Office and the District Court was based upon lack of invention over the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-21\">The application involved in this proceeding discloses a design for a phonograph cabinet comprising a box, essentially square in conformation but having a thickness substantially less than other dimensions. The casing is provided with rounded corners, two side-by-side grills near the top of one of the larger faces, and a handle folded into one of the edges. Each one of these features is contained in a prior patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-22\">We feel the lower court was quite correct when it held that \u201cA number of references may be used in rejecting a claim to a design if each of the features is old and no invention is involved in combining them.\u201d Therefore, the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b729-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
