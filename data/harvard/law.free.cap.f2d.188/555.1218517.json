The cases were tried to the court without a jury, two in the Eastern District of New York and one in the Southern District. The coffee beans involved in the three actions were all part of a common lot of 253 bags which were shipped in interstate commerce from Hoboken, New Jersey, to Brooklyn, New York, for the account of O. F. Bayer &amp; Co. Bayer &amp; Co. retained some of the bags, sold others to Savoy Tea and Coffee Co. Inc., of Brooklyn and Still others to Polin Bros., Inc., who brought them to Manhattan. Judge Rayfiel in the Eastern District held that the goods there seized were \u201cfood\u201d within the statutory definition, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 321(f), were \u201cadulterated\u201d when introduced into and while in interstate commerce within the meaning of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 342(a)(3), and were subject to condemnation pursuant to. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 334(a). From the resulting judgments, the respective claimants, O. F. Bayer &amp; Co. in one case and Savoy Tea and Coffee Co. Inc. in the other, appealed. In the Southern District case, upon substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>the same evidence, Judge Clancy dismissed the libel, and the United States has appealed. In this case the claimant was Poliu Bros. Inc. Judge Clancy\u2019s decision was rested on two \u201cfindings of fact\u201d: (1) \u201cno evidence in the case * * * that green coffee is a food,\u201d and (2) \u201cno evidence in the case that the customary and necessary process to which the green coffee is subjected before intended for human consumption cannot render this seized material wholesome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The statutory definition of food is quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the briefs for the claimants concede, it is common knowledge of which a court may take judicial notice, that the drink called \u201ccoffee\u201d is made from roasted coffee beans. It is also common knowledge that green coffee beans are used to produce the roasted coffee beans. Hence no evidence is necessary to establish that green coffee beans are a \u201cfood\u201d as defined by the statute. Whether or not they are edible before being roasted, they are certainly \u201ccomponents\u201d of an article used for food. Hence they fulfill the statutory definition of \u201cfood.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nor is it material that a further process, \u201croasting,\u201d is necessary before they are intended for human consumption. A \u201cfood\u201d does not have to be ready to eat or drink before it can be adulterated and subject to condemnation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Decisions so holding are cited in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Southern District case cannot be supported on either of the court\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Judge Rayfiel found that the articles seized were coffee sweepings, and that \u201cThere was mixed with the coffee sweepings extraneous filthy matter in the nature of dirt, wood splinters, matted fibers and other miscellaneous debris which was swept up with the coffee after it had been spilled\u201d in the ship\u2019s hold or on the deck where the coffee was unloaded from the carrying vessel. He found also that prior to seizure an attempt was made by Arbuckle\u2019s Jay Street Terminal, Brooklyn, <em>N. Y., to </em>clean the coffee sweepings. This produced 58 bags of waste and 195 salvaged bags of coffee beans from the 253 bags subject to the cleaning operation. All of the articles seized were part of the 195 salvaged bags. \u201cThe articles seized still contain large quantities of dust, wood splinters and other foreign substances.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These findings are not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d; the evidence amply supports them. Indeed, we think contrary findings would not have been sustainable. The claimants urge that the cleaning operation was merely inadequate and that the foreign matter will be eliminated by the roasting process to which the green beans will be subjected. But as already noted, food which is adulterated may be condemned even though it is intended to have the adulteration elim inated by a future process.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">Finally, it is urged that the court should have exercised \u201cits statutory discretion\u201d to permit the claimants to export the seized articles, and section 334(d) of 21 U.S.C.A. is cited in support of this contention. This argument wholly misconceives the extent of the judge\u2019s authority under that section. Judge Rayfiel\u2019s decree made provision for salvage of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>coffee under the supervision of the Federal Security Agency pursuant to section 334 (d), but no authority is given him by section 334(d) or by any other provision of the Act to permit export after condemnation. We so held in United States v. Kent Food Corp., 2 Cir., 168 F.2d 632, certiorari denied 335 U.S. 885, 69 S.Ct. 237, 93 L.Ed. 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The judgments of condemnation are affirmed. The judgment of dismissal is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\">.
