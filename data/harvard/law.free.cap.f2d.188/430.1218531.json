The proceedings out of which the present controversy arose are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In a complaint filed on December 22, 1948, the appellee asserted ownership of the trade-mark \u201cEskay,\u201d and alleged unfair competition and an infringement of its proprietary rights in same by the appellants. On February 1, 1949, appellants filed their answer, denying the material allegations of the complaint. On July 7, 1949, by consent of the parties and on motion of their attorneys, a final judgment was entered in which it was decreed that the appellants had , infringed upon appellee\u2019s trade-mark rights by the use in commerce of the word \u201cEskay,\u201d on and in connection with the sale of drugs, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, beers, wines, and liquors, without consent of the appellee. The consent judgment permanently enjoined the appellants from in any way directly or indirectly infringing upon appellee\u2019s trade-mark, and in particular from using the word \u201cEskay,\u201d or any colorable imitation thereof, on or in connection with the sale of any drugs, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, beers, wines, and liquors.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">On January 30, 1950, appellee filed a petition for an order of civil contempt, pleading that appellants were continuing to use the word \u201cEskay\u201d in wilful violation of the injunction. On February 20, 1950, in response to an order to show cause as to why they should not be held in contempt, appellants admitted that they had technically violated the court\u2019s decree, but asserted that such violation was caused by appellee\u2019s conduct in rejecting all proposed changes of the name \u201cEskay.\u201d They further pleaded that they had changed the name of their drug stores to Enkay Drugs, and their labels and advertising to \u201cEnkay.\u201d On February 21, 1950, the lower court entered an order which held appellants\u2019 response insufficient, and, without receiving evidence from either side, further held that the name \u201cEnkay,\u201d adopted by the appellants, was a colorable imitation of the word \u201cEskay,\u201d in violation of its decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">On this appeal, the appellants contend that the lower court erred in arbitrarily ruling that \u201cEnkay\u201d was a colorable imitation of appellee\u2019s trade-mark \u201cEskay\u201d without hearing any testimony as to the nature of the business engaged in by the respective parties, and without inquiring as to whether the public would be confused by the appellants\u2019 use of the term \u201cEnkay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">We see no merit in the foregoing contention raised by the appellants. If this case had gone to trial on the issue of infringement, it would certainly have been necessary and proper for the trial court to receive evidence as to the nature of appellants\u2019 business, and whether there was a possibility of deception by the use of the term \u201cEnkay.\u201d But since there was an admission of infringement in the consent decree, and since appellants were enjoined from the further use of the term \u201cEskay\u201d or any colorable imitation thereof, there was no longer present the issue of infringement. Appellants waived their right to submit such evidence when they consented to the final judgment. When the appellee filed its petition for an order of civil contempt, the proceedings were justifiably beyond the stage of a trial on the issue of infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">The injunction in this case permanently enjoined appellants directly or indirectly from infringing appellee\u2019s trade-marks, and from using the word \u201cEskay\u201d or any color-able imitation thereof.' Thus we have left for decision the sole question of whether appellants\u2019 use of the word \u201cEnkay,\u201d in the same way it had previously used appellee\u2019s trade-mark \u201cEskay,\u201d is a colorable imitation of the trade-mark \u201cEskay.\u201d We think it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">Appellants do not necessarily have to use the identical word to invade the rights of appellee. It is sufficient if they adopt a trade-mark so like appellee\u2019s in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>form, spelling, or sound, that a person who does not have a very definite or clear recollection of the real trade-mark is likely to become confused or misled. That is the reason the injunction specifically prohibited appellants\u2019 use of any colorable imitation of the word \u201cEskay.\u201d In such a case as this, where the appellants have been found guilty of infringing the trade-mark rights of others, they should thereafter be required to keep a safe distance away from the dividing line between violation of, and compliance with, the injunction. They must do more than see how close they can come with safety to that which they were enjoined from doing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants, by the use of the word \u201cEnkay,\u201d are trying to come about as close as is conceivably possible to a\" continuance of the use of the word \u201cEskay,\u201d which they .are prohibited from using by the final judgment. If this court permitted such an act, it would render ineffective the consent decree entered into between these same parties, which we do not intend to do. The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-11\">. Nims on. Unfair Competition &amp; Trade Marks, p. 1188, Section 373(g).
