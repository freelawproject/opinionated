We think not. The rule does not in terms require the instruction. If there is no evidence to justify a verdict of simple assault a jury should not be so instructed. Burcham v. United States, 1947, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 283, 163 F.2d 761. To do so would only tend to confuse and mislead the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-25\">The defendant was tried upon a three count indictment for separate assaults upon a man and two women. The man was shot in his chest by a pistol in appellant\u2019s hand. Appellant then clubbed the women upon their heads with the pistol, causing lacerations which required sutures and hospital treatment. He claimed that his actions were in self-defense, and, also, that the shooting was accidental. As to both defenses appellant concedes that the jury was \u201ccarefully instructed.\u201d Obviously the shooting, if not accidental, was nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>less than an assault with a dangerous weapon. We also think the pistol used as a club in the violent manner shown by the evidence was still a dangerous weapon. Hickey v. United States, <em>9 </em>Cir., 1909, 168 F. 536, 538, 22 L.R.A.,N.S., 728. Serious injury will very likely result from such use of a pistol, and did result in this case. We think the evidence offered no justification for an instruction on simple assault. Burcham v. United States, supra. See also Sparf and Hansen v. United States, 1895, 156 U.S. 51, 15 S.Ct. 273, 39 L.Ed. 343. Moreover, there was no request for such an instruction. Hence, the present assignment of error comes too late. Fed.R.Crim.P. 30; Villaroman v. United States, 1950, 87 U.S.App.D.C.240, 184 F.2d 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1065-17\">.
