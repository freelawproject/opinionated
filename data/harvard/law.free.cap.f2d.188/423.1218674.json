The amended complaint founded jurisdiction on 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 43, which affords redress to the injured party for violations of his civil rights. In substance, the amended complaint alleged that the City of Jacksonville, acting through the Superintendent of its Prison Farms, and under col- or of law, regulations, .ordinances, and customs of the City, and while the plaintiff was a prisoner confined at its Prison Farms, \u201cdid unlawfully and wilfully shoot off and discharge a pistol against, into, and upon the plaintiff,\u201d and that such act constituted a deprivation of the plaintiff\u2019s civil rights, for which an action is authorized Under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 43. The Superintendent of the Prison Farms is not made a party to this suit.' The appellant stakes his entire case on his claim against the City of Jacksonville.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The lower court, in refusing to allow the amended complaint to be filed, held that the word \u201cpersons\u201d used in the Civil Rights statute, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 43, does not include a State or its governmental subdivisions acting in their sovereign, as distinguished from their proprietary, capacity. It further held that the appellant\u2019s assertion that he was shot by the Superintendent of the Prison Farms did not constitute a sufficient allegation of fact to charge a deprivation of civil rights within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">We are in accord with the views expressed by the lower court; and, on the authority of Charlton v. City of Hialeah, 188 F.2d 421, this day decided by this court, the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
