National Labor Relations Board, 71 S.Ct. 456, and National Labor Relations Board v. Pittsburgh Steamship Company, 71 S.Ct. 453, to support the Board\u2019s findings that the petitioner violated Section 8(a) (1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 61 Stat. 140, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (1) and (3). We conclude that the evidence supporting the Board\u2019s decision is substantial when viewed in the light furnished by the record in its entirety, including the body of evidence opposed to the Board\u2019s view. We are also of the opinion that the decision of the Board is reasonable and fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">We will enforce the Board\u2019s order. A decree may be submitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
