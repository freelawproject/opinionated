The Supreme Court has held that when unanimous action of the donees is necessary to such destruction then the interests of several donees are \u201cfuture interests,\u201d and the donor is not entitled to the exclusion under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1003(b). See Ryerson v. United States, 312 U.S. 405, 61 S.Ct. 656, 85 L.Ed. 917; United States v. Pelzer, 312 U.S. 399, 61 S.Ct. 659, 85 L.Ed. 913. The taxpayer contends<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that unanimous consent was here not necessary, because each of the donees had the immediate individual power to bring about an individual severance of the joint assignments and thus to obtain at once his share of the cash surren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>der value of the policies. We assume, arguendo, that this would be true, absent a contrary intention of the donor. But here the Tax Court found that the donor intended that joint action was necessary for such a severance, and we think the evidence amply sustains that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-30\">.
