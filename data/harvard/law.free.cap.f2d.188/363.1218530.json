It assumes that in our discussion of the question of jurisdiction based upon diversity of citizenship, we failed to consider other jurisdictional grounds presented in its reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"ADp\">It is our conclusion that if there be any ambiguity in the final paragraph of the opinion which suggests facts to be considered by the district court upon retrial, there should now be added to such direction the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">\u201cThe court will, of course, upon retrial, be free to consider any ground of jurisdiction other than that based upon diversity of citizenship, if it be found that the appellant is the real party in interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Judge MILLER is of the opinion that jurisdiction exists under \u00a7 1331, Title 28 U.S.C.A. and that the order appealed from should be reviewed on the present record.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
