He was advised by the court that he was entitled to be represented by an attorney; that if he was without funds to employ an attorney the court would appoint one for him. In repetition of the question he made the same response. There is no merit to this ground of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-25\">It has repeatedly been held that one coming lawfully into possession of property, either <em>with </em>the intent at the time to appropriate it to his own use or arrives at that intention after possession, the crime is larceny. Tredwell v. U. S., 4 Cir., 266 F. 350, certiorari denied 253 U.S. 496, 40 S.Ct. 587, 64 L.Ed. 1031; Beck v. U. S., 62 App.D.C. 223, 66 F.2d 203; John v. U. S., 65 App.D.C. 11, 79 F.2d 136; Stewart v. U. S., 8 Cir., 151 F.2d 386. There is likewise no merit' to the appellant\u2019s second point.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-26\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
