Ozanic, who had been master of the ship \u201cPetar,\u201d originally brought the suit under the Public Vessels Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to recover for her loss on March 8, 1942, in a collision with a tanker owned by the United States, in which both ships were at fault. At the time of the collision, and when the suit was commenced, a Yugoslav corporation owned the \u201cPetar\u201d; but in December, 1946, the \u201cPraesidium\u201d and National Assembly of Yugoslavia \u201cnationalized\u201d the corporation by proceedings which professed to make the claim \u201cstate property\u201d; and it is common ground that it became so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On July 31, 1947, an agreement was executed between the British Government, the Yugoslav Government, the \u201cnationalized\u201d successor of the original corporate owner of the \u201cPetar,\u201d one Bateson and Shipping Assets Clearing, Ltd., which settled the claims of the British Government against the Yugoslav Government, touching shipping transactions, including claims arising out of the disposal by the Yugoslav Government of \u201cthe assets of the Yugoslav owners held or situate outside Yugoslavia.\u201d In consideration of the release by the parties of their claims against it, the Yugoslav Government agre\u00e9d to assign to Shipping Assets Clearing, Ltd., a number of maritime claims which it held against third persons, among which was the claim in suit; and on August 26, 1947, in implementation of this agreement the Yugoslav Government by a separate instrument assigned the claim to Shipping Assets Gearing, Ltd. On July 19, 1948, the Secretary of State of the United States and the \u201cDeputy Minister of Finance\u201d of Yugoslavia, entered into a general agreement settling the claims of the United States for \u201cLend-Lease\u201d benefits granted Yugo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>slavia during the late war. Among other claims against the United States, which the Yugoslav Government agreed to release as part of the consideration for its release by the United States, were five classes of claims of which the fifth was described as follows: \u201cClaims arising out of maritime collisions * * * occurring on and after April 6, 1941, and prior to July 1, 1946.\u201d In reliance upon its assignment in 1947, which therefore antedated this release, Shipping Assets Clearing, Ltd., filed a petition in this suit .on November 30, 1948, for leave to intervene. This petition Judge Rifkind denied in an opinion filed on March 10, 1949, D.C., 83 F.Supp. 4, and on July IS, 1949, Judge Ryan ordered that the final decree in Ozanic\u2019s favor should be marked \u201csatisfied\u201d and that the petition for intervention be denied. This is the order from which Ozanic and Shipping Assets Clearing, Ltd., have appealed. . The appellants\u2019 argument is (1) that the Anti-Assignment Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not invalidate the assignment of August 26, 1947; (2) that in any event the United States was already charged with notice of it, before the agreement of July 19, 1948; (3) that moreover that agreement did not cover the claim in suit. The United. States answers (1) that the assignment, not being involuntary, was within the Anti-Assignment Act; (2) that it was not charged with notice of the assignment; and (3) that, since the claim was not negotiable, Shipping Assets Clearing, Ltd., as assignee, took subject to any set-offs or counterclaims, including the claims covered by .the agreement of July 19, 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The argument that the assignment to Shipping Assets Clearing, Ltd., was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d and was therefore not within the Anti-Assignment Act does not appear to us to have basis in the record. Had the assignee represented the expropriated shareholders of the corporate owner of the \u201cPetar,\u201d conceivably it might be passible to regard the assignment as restitution for the original expropriation, as therefore \u201cinvoluntary,\u201d and within the implied exceptions to the Anti-Assignment Act. Although the appellants in their brief assert that the assignment of the claim to Shipping Assets Qearing, Ltd., was to it \u201cas representative of the Foreign Interests including the shareholders of the original corporate owner of the \u2018Petar\u2019,\u201d we can find nothing to indicate that it was for the benefit of. those shareholders. It is true that among the \u201cManagers\u201d wham Bateson represented (and whom we assume Shipping Assets Clearing, Ltd., also came to represent) appear a British corporation and a New York corporation who had represented the original Yugoslav corporation that owned the \u201cPetar\u201d; but that is no indication that the shareholders of that corporation were to be beneficiaries \u2022 of the agreement. On the other hand when. we look at the \u201cForeign Interests\u201d which. Bateson also represented, the appropriate schedule contains no names of shareholders of the original corporation, or any mention whatever of that corporation. There is not a syllable which we can find to suggest that the expropriated shareholders were beneficiaries, or that the assignment of the claim in suit was intended as restitution to them. The general purpose of the agreement apparently was to make a settlement with a number of claimants, including expropriated shareholders \u201cnow outside Yugoslavia,\u201d but only those. The argument that a purpose of restitution, if it did exist at all, would make the assignment \u201cinvoluntary\u201d is doubtful at best; but for it to have any weight it would have to appear that the claim was allocated to-the shareholders of the \u201cPetar,\u201d' and to&gt; them alone. Certainly there was. nothing, of that sort in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The other argument to meet the Anti-Assignment Act has more substance; it is that under the Suits in Admiralty Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (whose procedure was carried over into the Public Vessels Act), suits, proceed \u201caccording to the principles of law and to the rules of practice obtaining in like cases between private parties\u201d; and that the Act repealed all inconsistent acts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>In the admiralty the assignee of a chose of action is recognized as the obligee and may sue in his own name,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and it has twice been held that the Suits in Admiralty Act \u2014 particularly the repealing section\u2014 made inapplicable the Anti-Assignment Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We do not, however, find it necessary to decide as to this reasoning and arguendo we shall assume that it is sound, because even so we think that Shipping Assets Clearing, Ltd., cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">It is true, as the United States argues, that the assignee of a non-negotiable chose in action takes subject to all existing set-offs and counterclaims;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and in the case at bar all the claims of the United States against the Yugoslav Government which constituted the consideration for that government\u2019s release of the United States, were in existence when the agreement of 1947 was made. It might therefore appear at first blush that this was an answer to the claim in suit. However, it is not, because, if the Yugoslav Government had sued in the district court under the Public Vessels Act the privilege of the United States to interpose any set-off or counterclaim would have been limited to such as arose \u201cout of the same contract or cause of action for which the original libel was filed\u201d ;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and there were none. Therefore, this ground of avoiding the assignment would not be good; but we think that there is another one which is. Although the agreement of 1948 was not a treaty, and did not in terms profess to repeal the consent of the United States to be sued which the Public Vessels Act had granted, we .regard it as overriding that consent, and asserting the immunity of the United States from suit upon any claims whose release was part of the consideration of the United States for the release of its \u201cLend-Lease\u201d claims against the Yugoslav Government. The constitutional power of the President extends to the settlement of mutual claims between a foreign government and the United States, at least when it is an incident to the recognition of that government;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and it would be unreasonable to circumscribe it to such controversies. The continued mutual amity between the nation and other powers again and again depends upon a satisfactory compromise of mutual claims; the necessary power to make such compromises has existed from the earliest times and been exercised by the foreign offices of all civilized nations. The case at bar would be a particularly inept occasion to import into it an exception. In the first place the exception could stand only upon an ancient detail of admiralty procedure, generally now superseded. Again, it can arise only in those relatively rare instances in which the Anti-Assignment Act does not invalidate an assignment of the claim. Finally, it contravenes the general policy of the Set-Off Act<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that claims against the United States are always to be subject to set-off. These considerations alone would go far \u25a0to persuade us that, even though the Agreement of 1948 stood only upon the constitutional power of the President to come to an accommodation with a foreign government upon mutual claims between the two nations, it would suffice to withdraw the consent to be sued:</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">However, there is more. The agreement in question here was \u201ca settlement for lend-lease,\u201d made under the \u201cLend-Lease Act\u201d of March 11, 1941,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>\u00a7 412(b) of which provided that \u201cthe terms and conditions upon which any such, foreign government receives any aid * * * shall be those which the President deems satisfactory, and the benefit to the United States may be payment or repayment in kind or property, or any other direct or indirect benefit which the President deems satisfactory.\u201d On October 28, 1941, by subdivision 2 of Executive Order 8926,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the President authorized the administrator of \u201cLend-Lease\u201d to exercise all the President\u2019s powers under the act, except that \u201cthe master agreement with each nation * * * <em>setting </em>forth <em>the </em>general terms and conditions under which such nation is to receive such aid, shall be negotiated by the State Department, with' the advice of the Economic Defense Board and the Office of Lend-Lease Administration.\u201d The \u201cmaster agreement\u201d with Yugoslavia, which was \u201cnegotiated\u201d by the Secretary of State, recited that it was \u201cexpedient that the final determination of the terms and conditions upon which the Royal Yugoslav Government receives such aid and of the benefits to be received by the United States of America in return therefor, should be deferred until the extent of .the defense aid is known and until the progress of events makes clearer the final terms and conditions and benefits which will be in the mutual interest.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Article VI provided that \u201cin the final determination of the benefits to be provided to the United States of America * * * full cognizance shall be taken of all property, services, information, facilities or other benefits or considerations provided by the Royal Yugoslav Government.\u201d These passages show that the considerations moving to the United States in exchange for \u201cLend-Lease\u201d benefits were purposely left undetermined at the time. That was indeed inevitable, but it resulted that \u201cthe terms and conditions\u201d of the \u201cmaster agreement\u201d were finally fixed only by the agreement of July 19, 1948, and that that agreement was within the Secretary\u2019s authority. He then chose to accept a release of the claim against the United States for the loss of the \u201cPetar\u201d as one of the \u201cterms and conditions\u201d of the original \u201cLend-Lease\u201d contract, and he did so by authority delegated to him by the President under the Act of March 11, 1941. The validity of the assignment of a contract as against the obligor depends upon the law of the place of performance,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and it is therefore the law of the United States to which we must look to decide whether the assignee, Shipping Assets Clearing, Ltd., may recover. \u2022 Since under that law the release was valid, the decree was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">We have not discussed the appellants\u2019 final argument that the release by its terms did not include the claim in suit, because it is too apparent that it did. Besides, if there was any doubt as to that as mere matter of interpretation, the \u201cPetar\u201d claim had been one of those about which th\u00e9 parties were in negotiation before the agreement was executed, and the language chosen for the release necessarily covered it.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-16\">. \u00a7 781 et seq., Tide 46 U.S.C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b285-19\">.
