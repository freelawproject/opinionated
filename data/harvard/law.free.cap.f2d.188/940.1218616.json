HAND, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">The Allied Latex Corporation appeals from a judgment, holding valid and infringed Claims Nos. 1, 8, 9,11,15,16,17,18, 19, and 20 of Patent No. 1,605,445, issued to Fred L. Killian, on November 2, 1926; and Claims Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 14 and 15 of Patent No. 2,128,827, issued to the same patentee, on August 30, 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-12\">The \u201cBead-Roller Patent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b997-13\">The claims of the first patent are the same as those which we had before us and held valid and infringed in 1934 j<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we may refer to our opinion in that case for a description of the patented machine. The Eighth Circuit also held the same claims valid in 1939 ;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Judge Westenhaver in the Northern District of Ohio held them valid in two unpublished opinions. Concededly, the nearest approach to Killian\u2019s disclosure is Hadfield\u2019s Patent No. 1,097,917, which issued on May 19, 1914, more than eleven years before the date of the application for the patent in suit. In all the former actions the defendants appear to have principally relied, not upon the disclosure of Hadfield\u2019s patent, but upon a prior use of his machine, which the district judges uniformly found that the evidence did not sustain: a finding which the Eighth Circuit and we affirmed. Having done so, we said that it seemed to be \u201cconceded that the Hadfield machine was better than the machine of the Had-field patent and the nearest thing in the art to the machine of the Killian patent\u201d, and we concluded that, \u201cif the machine was not\u201d \u2014an anticipation \u2014 \u201cneither was Hadfield\u2019s patent.\u201d 73 F.2d 55. With deference, that was. a <em>non sequitur, </em>for we had disposed of the machine by discarding it as an established prior use, and without considering how nearly it anticipated the patent. In the case at bar the Hadfield patent alone is in evidence; and upon inspection it at once appears that Killian\u2019s variants upon it, unless we consider the elimination of one of the two brushes, were trivialities of design: <em>1. e. </em>in the means by which the \u201cforms\u201d were frictionally rotated, and were held upon their supports against the lifting actions of the brush. It is not conceivable that any court would have regarded these as patentable, had the Hadfield patent made any impress on the art; and only because it had not done so did Judge Westenhaver refuse to treat it as an anticipation. This appears from the following passage: \u201cWhether an apparatus constructed in accordance with the Hadfield patent would have operated, I do not know. * * .* The device as disclosed * * * I think would not have operated. Be that as it may, here was a patent applied for in January, 1912, issued in 1914, and never went into general or commercial use. It remained, so far as the record shows, a paper patent. With all the industry needing and calling for the Killian apparatus, all manufacturers continued for fourteen years using hand labor, wholly uninfluenced by the existence of Hadfield. It is apparent that Hadfield brought to the industry nothing. His patent did nothing to carry forward the useful arts.\u201d (The plaintiff at bar does not challenge the operativeness of Hadfield\u2019s patent.) We in our turn, took substantially the same view, so far as we considered Hadfield\u2019s patent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>at all; we said on page 56 of 73 F.2d: \u201cthat Killian\u2019s conception was within the skill of any good mechanic is. refuted by the fact that the art felt the need of a machine, but continued to roll beads by hand until Killian arrived.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">It is true that, when a substantial period has passed between the appearance of an earlier disclosure and the application of the patent in suit, the reasoning which we have quoted has been again and again applied. We have ourselves often used it:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> moreover the Supreme Court appears still at least to countenance that approach.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the other hand, as we said in Condenser Corporation v. Micamold Radio Corporation, supra, 145 F.2d 879: \u201cThe lapse of time between one invention and another of itself tells very little. * * * lapse of time alone is no test of the difficulty of taking a last step, until it appears that the art in fact knew the earlier steps, already taken.\u201d Countless patents lie in patent of-' fices, in fact unknown either because they were premature, or were not exploited, or because all their uses were not foreseen; yet an inventor is charged with an acquaintance with all of them. So far as they in fact anticipate his invention they stand on precisely the same footing as though he had had them before him. The fact that the art has not profited by them is irrelevant unless it also appears that they were generally known; and they are then relevant only in so far as they may indicate that the originality, necessary to step from them to the invention. in suit, does not appear to have been part of the equipment of others versed in the subject matter. The phrase, \u201cpaper patent,\u201d is a mere bit of rhetoric, usually employed as a makeweight by judges who wish to support the patent in suit, but are embarrassed by a reference, of an escape from which they are not too confident. It is a meaningless platitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">Assuming, as we will, that automatic \u201cbead rolling\u201d would have been as desirable before the advent of latex as it became later, there were nevertheless obstacles to the manufacture of \u201cprophylactics\u201d in 1912 which had, or at least may have, largely disappeared by 1925. We said in Stevens v. Carl Schmid, Inc., supra, 55,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of Hadfield\u2019s machine: \u201cits continued operation was prevented by public authorities in 1912 because of the character of the articles that were being manufactured\u201d ; and we do not know for how long that opposition continued to be strong enough to make it undesirable to use such machines with the inevitable publicity that would follow. That was one reason why Hadfield\u2019s machine was \u201cdismantled and abandoned for fourteen years until the litigation in Ohio furnished occasion for recollection of it\u201d; and the elev\u00e9n years that passed warrants no stronger inference of patentability than does a comparison of the two. We agree with Judge Westenhaver that Hadfield did not \u201cenrich the art\u201d; but we cannot agree that this justified the conclusion that Killian\u2019s invention was patentable. To this there is possibly one theoretical exception: Killian only disclosed, and all his claims were limited to, a single brush, while Hadfield disclosed two. Only one is necessary, arid as a new question we could not support a patent upon the omission of one of Hadfield\u2019s two. Nevertheless, it so happens that in all the earlier actions the infringers used a single brush; and the invention, supposing it can be thought to have been an invention at all, was entitled to the narrowest of all equivalents. Thus it become possible to decide this action upon the issue of non-infringement without actually overruling any of the past decisions. Moreover, since the patent has long since expired, none of those objections apply to that course, which have been raised in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>case of living patents, for the claims will not remain <em>in terrorem. </em>The judgment will he reversed, and the complaint upon the first patent will be dismissed for non-infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">The \u201cDistributing Patent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Judge Bondy has described this patent in his opinion in the district court<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> fully enough to serve as an introduction to our discussion of the questions involved. Killian\u2019s specifications state that the machine is to make \u201cthin rubber articles, such as rubber balloons, finger cots, nipples, rubber gloves,\u201d and it has in fact been used to some extent to make balloons; but it is agreed that the only important use of it and other such machines is to make the \u201cprophylactics,\u201d which have come . to be manufactured in enormous quantities during the last twenty years.. The disclosure does not indeed confine the machine to the use of pure latex; it extends to \u201cliquid latex or rubber cement,\u201d to \u201cnatural or partly coagulated rubber latex\u201d; and to a \u201crubber latex partly reduced by a coagulated process to a desired consistency, or in the form of a cement consisting of rubber dissolved in naphtha or other solvent.\u201d However, the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s expert witness makes it clear that in the manufacture of \u201cprophylactics\u201d only pure latex is desirable, or indeed possible, if the necessary thinness is to be achieved. The \u201ccoagulent process\u201d is not \u201cpractical for thin rubber articles; that is, very thin rubber articles\u201d; by which the witness meant those of about six thousandths of an inch. So far as he knew that process had never been \u201cused for the commercial production of prophylactics\u201d; indeed, he did not think that the machine \u201cwould work satisfactorily in its present form with a solvent.\u201d Latex did not, however, begin to come into this \u25a0 country until 1920; nor was it until 1924 that it was imported in substantial quantities. After that the tonnage grew, somewhat unevenly, until in 1930 when it amounted to nearly 4,500. Just what use the arts made of it in the ten years between 1920 and. 1930 does not appear; there were a good many patents, some eight of which are in evidence and several of which were for its use without a coagulent. Yet it was apparently only in 1926 that \u201clatex articles that had been developed were being offered for sale,\u201d and \u201cprophylactics\u201d of \u201clatex as distinguished from dipped rubber cement\u201d did not appear until 1931 or 1932. It would therefore be unsafe to assume that there was a \u201csurplus\u201d available for use for \u201cprophylactics\u201d before 1928, or at the earliest, 1926. On the other hand throughout this period, whether it was four or two years, between its first availability in quantity and 1930, the demand for \u201cprophylactics\u201d must have been substantially as great as it is now; and Killian is entitled to whatever merit is due to the first person who satisfies a long existing need. Moreover, presumably he designed his machine from the ground up and without suggestion or cue; and we may well agree that, taken as a feat, that displayed enough originality to support a patent. However, as we have just said in disposing of the \u201cBead-Rolling Patent,\u201d the law does not use such a subjective test in judging a patent; on the contrary it imputes to the inventor an omniscience which will again and again deprive him of the reward that his talents as an individual might otherwise deserve. That is a corollary of a monopoly, not limited to plagiarists.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">In the case at bar there appeared in 1917 a Dutch patent, which disclosed a machine closely parallel in structure to Killian\u2019s, and to him must be imputed an acquaintance with it. It is true that the two machines were not identical and their purposes were widely different, for the Dutch patent was designed to make \u201crubber balls\u201d of latex, apparently for ease in shipment. Nevertheless, with one exception they are so far alike that the Dutch machine could have been substituted for the patent in suit after changes that certainly could not of themselves sustain a patent. Killian, disclosed a series of arms at each side of his conveying belt, and he replaced the \u201csticks\u201d of the Dutch patent with \u201cforms,\u201d which had been a commonplace in the art of making \u201cprophylactics\u201d for nearly twenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>years; on neither of these can he depend. On the other hand he did add the feature that, after a \u201cform\u201d had been dipped in its bath of latex and had been raised back again to horizontal, it was raised, still rotating, above the horizontal, so as to insure a more uniform spread of latex. The Dutch patent did not disclose that step and did not need to, because uniformity of distribution was no part of its aim, any more than curing the latex in a smoke chamber was part of Killian\u2019s aim. In 1921 Mitzel disclosed a machine for making \u201crubber articles\u201d on \u201cnipple forms,\u201d consisting of a conveyor belt, carrying a series of \u201cnipples.\u201d These were first inverted and immersed in a \u201cdipping chamber,\u201d where they were coated with a liquid solution of rubber; after which the conveyor carried them in a drying chamber, in which through a devious course they were alternately inverted and raised upright. The purpose of these changes of position was the better to distribute the rubber over the surface, and thus to make the \u201carticle\u201d of a uniform thickness. However, the \u201cnipples\u201d were not rotated, evenness of distribution being effected only by the inversion and reversion we have described. Nevertheless, had an inventor, bent on adapting the Dutch machine to the manufacture of \u201cprophylactics\u201d found that rotation of the \u201cforms\u201d at horizontal resulted in an uneven thickness, he would have been a curiously sluggish experimenter, if with Mitzel before him, he did not try out the effect of the method Mitzel disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">The case therefore comes down to this: How much insight was required to observe that the Dutch machine could be used for the new purpose. That insight once achieved, the necessary adaptations were easily within the reach of ordinary perseverance. The Dutch specifications as they read gave at least an intimation of their possible use for making thin sheaths, although their purpose was, as we have said, only to make \u201crubber balls.\u201d That appears in the following passages. \u201cThe stick is successively immersed in a similar manner * * * so that after a certain length of time a good sized ball of raw rubber has formed at the end of the stick where layer upon layer of latex has coaguated,\u201d Again, \u201cThe latex coagulates very rapidly: a stick, on leaving tunnel, m, arrives above receptacle, s, containing latex and is again immersed in order to collect a fresh layer of latex. This process is repeated * * * until rubber balls of proper size have formed around the latter\u201d (the \u201csticks\u201d). That is the description of a series of superimposed thin layers of latex, their number being whatever will produce a ball of \u201cproper size.\u201d Each immersion added a layer; the number of layers depended upon how big a \u201cball\u201d one thought \u201cproper.\u201d Stop the \u201cprocess\u201d at two immersions and a \u201cprophylactic\u201d results: that, coupled with the mechanical changes that we have mentioned, is the full measure of all that can be attributed to Killian. We cannot agree that, if an inventor wished to supply the market with such articles and had the Dutch disclosure before him, this step demanded that degree of exceptional endowment which \u2014 especially in recent years \u2014 is necessary to support a patent. All that was needed was to stop the repetition of the \u201cprocess\u201d of imposing \u201clayer upon layer of latex\u201d at the right thickness. Even if the time had been much longer between the commercial availability of latex and the date of Killian\u2019s application, we should hesitate to hold that such a discovery was enough. As in the case of Hadfield\u2019s patent, we should have to be satisfied that the Dutch machine had been widely known in the art; a most unlikely possibility. As we have said, the inventor must justify his contribution against all that has gone before, known and unknown. Yet when he seeks to use the art\u2019s failure to anticipate him as evidence of his own perspicacity, he must appraise the art\u2019s ineptitude by the art\u2019s actual knowledge; he may not impute to it an acquaintance with any part of what went before of which it was not aware. It may result that he will benefit the art by a discovery of what it had practically never possessed or had possessed and lost. But there is no room for \u201clost arts\u201d in the case of inventions, \u201cdescribed in printed publications in this or any foreign country\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>the statute is plain and inexorable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As to the second patent also the judgment must be reversed and the complaint dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Judgment reversed; complaint dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b997-14\">.
