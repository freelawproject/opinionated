The action was removed from the state court where it had been brought against that defendant and the Pennsylvania Railroad Company for damages done to two separate shipments of meat contained in refrigerator cars- leased by the defendant to the plaintiff and received for carriage by the railroad. The judge who granted the order did -not \u201cdirect .the entry of a final judgment * * * upon an express de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>termination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment.\u201d In the absence of such a determination and direction there is no final judgment, Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. rule 54(b), 28 U.S.C.A. and the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">If the plaintiff procures from the judge the prescribed action, it may file a new appeal; and if both parties file a consent to this course, we will decide the questions raised upon the present appeal upon the record, as supplemented, and upon the briefs already filed. The judge will of course understand that our decision leaves him altogether free to make or refuse the necessary determination and direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
