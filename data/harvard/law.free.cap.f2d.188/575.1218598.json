These are: (1) that he has long ago fully served his original prison sentence; (2) that, after having served it, he was, for conduct in violation of his probation, occurring long after the prison term had been served, sentenced to a revocation of his probation and to serve the suspended term; (3) that that judgment was appealed from and affirmed here, and now has been nearly served; and (4) that repetitious proceedings of the kind and nature of this one should sometime-have an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-27\">The judgment was right. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b631-28\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-20\">. Weber v. U.
