Appellant-husband argues that the order was an abuse of discretion ; he alleges that the wife\u2019s conduct had amounted to constructive desertion; and he emphasizes that she had been unsuccessful in an earlier suit against him for limited divorce on the ground of cruelty. On the other hand, appellant advised the court that he would refuse to receive the wife in a common home, though she stated that she would be willing to join him. Under all the circumstances we think that the action of the District Court was entirely proper. See Melvin v. Melvin, 76 U.S.App.D.C. 56, 57, 129 F.2d 39, 40; Quarles v. Quarles, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 41, 42, 179 F.2d 57, 58; Schulz v. Schulz, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 43, 179 F.2d 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
