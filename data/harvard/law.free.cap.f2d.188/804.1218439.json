The present suit sought recovery for the resulting damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The district judge held that the charterer\u2019s designation of \u201cBoston Harbor Hingham Bay Anchorage\u201d was a sufficiently precise designation of a \u201cplace\u201d under the terms of the charter party; that Hing-ham Bay was a \u201csafe place\u201d in as much as it contained areas where the vessel could have anchored without danger of grounding; and, since the charterer wa,s under no obligation to designate the exact spot where the vessel was to anchor, the pilot was not performing the charterer\u2019s work, but the shipowner\u2019s, in selecting the anchorage; consequently, the negligence of the pilot which caused the grounding was attributable to the shipowner, and the libel was dismissed. With these conclusions we are unable to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">The issue presented for decision is whether the charterer or the owner was obligated to select a safe berth for discharging into lighters in an area containing both safe and unsafe berths. The answer must be sought in the language of the safe berth clause, which permits the vessel to discharge at any one of three <em>loci </em>provided she \u201ccan proceed thereto, lie at, and depart therefrom always safely afloat.\u201d The three <em>loci </em>are \u201cany safe place or wharf, or alongside vessels or lighters reachable on her arrival.\u201d Specifically the question is whether the word \u201cplace\u201d means the spot selected to drop anchor (plus the area over which the tanker may swing on a tide) when she is to discharge into lighters. Both the language and the purpose of the clause require an affirmative answer. The \u201cplace\u201d must be one \u201cat\u201d which the vessel can lie. This is appropriate language to refer to her specific berth while at anchor, but is wholly inappropriate if \u201cplace\u201d is construed to include an area as large as Hingham Bay. Moreover, the natural meaning of \u201csafe place\u201d is a place entirely safe, not an area only part of which is safe. The appellant\u2019s construction of the clause also finds support in the <em>ejusdem generis </em>rule of interpretation. Only a specific anchorage spot is the equivalent of a berth at a wharf. If the charterer had designated a \u201cwharf\u201d for discharging and the berth at which the vessel was moored proved to be unsafe, no one would say that the charterer had performed its duty in designating a wharf at which one berth was safe and another unsafe, and had thereby cast upon the ship\u2019s master responsibility for finding the safe berth. The contrary, in effect, was held in Cities Service Transp. Co. v. Gulf Refining Co., 2 Cir., 79 F.2d 521, where the court said that \u201cthe charter party was itself an express assurance, on which the master was entitled to rely, that at the berth \u2018indicated\u2019 the ship would be able to lie \u2018always afloat.\u2019 \u201d So far as we have discovered the word \u201cplace\u201d has been given a spatially limited construction by all courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>which have considered similar safe berth clauses,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">The purpose of the clause also supports the construction we give it. The charterer wishes to control the manner and place of discharging its cargo. The most advantageous place for the charterer will be a wharf at the refinery. If the discharge is into lighters the closer the ship can get to the refinery the less the cost of lighterage. Hence the charterer bargains for the privilege of selecting the precise place for discharge and the ship surrenders that privilege in return for the charterer\u2019s acceptance of the risk of its choice. To give the charterer only the privilege of designating a general area rather than a specific berth and to put on the shipowner the' responsibility of finding a fair berth in that general area is to misconstrue the intention of the parties and to defeat the very purpose of the safe berth clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The district court found that pilot Cleverly was employed by the libellant and not by the charterer. But this finding is immaterial to the decision if, as we hold, the charterer had the duty to procure a specific anchorage within Hingham Bay. Having covenanted that it would be a \u201csafe place,\u201d the respondent was responsible for the conduct of Cleverly as a \u201cborrowed servant.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although in the libellant\u2019s employ, the pilot was performing a service for which the charterer was responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">The charterer contends that evefl if its covenant to designate and procure a safe berth were broken, the breach was not the proximate cause of the groundings because the ship was at fault in that she had only British charts of Hingham Bay and in that her officers did not intervene when they saw where pilot Cleverly was dropping anchor. The district court made no finding of fault on the part of the ship\u2019s officers and we see no basis in the evidence for such a finding. The December grounding was due to dragging anchor because it was dropped on bad holding ground. No examination of the charts, whether British or American, would have shown poor holding ground. The January grounding was not due to dragging anchor and was at a point some 400 yards distant from the December anchorage and on a shallow spot not shown on any chart. Hence the officers\u2019 knowledge of the first grounding gave them no reason to question the pilot\u2019s judgment in selecting the January anchorage. They were not negligent in failing to intervene unless the pilot was doing something obviously dangerous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, since the officers had no knowledge of the danger, the charter party was an express assurance that the berth was safe, on which they were entitled to rely.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-13\">Decree reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-6\">.
