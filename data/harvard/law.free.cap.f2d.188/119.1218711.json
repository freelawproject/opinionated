Before SIMONS, ALLEN and MCALLISTER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b175-23\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b175-24\">Appellant was convicted of possessing whiskey in unstamped containers and concealing whiskey theretofore unlawfully removed, in violation of \u00a7 2803(a), I.R.C., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>and \u00a7 2913, I.R.C., 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2803(a), 2913. A motion to suppress evidenc'e - was overruled. As this evidence was vital to conviction, the questions raised on the hearing in this court are the same as those presented on the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Jury was waived and the case was tried to the court. The conceded facts are that at about one-thirty or two o\u2019clock in the afternoon of September 29, 1948, officers of the Alcohol Tax Unit received from a source which they considered reliable, information that appellant was storing whiskey in his house. Without securing a warrant two officers went to appellant\u2019s premises at about eight o\u2019clock that evening and stationed themselves, in a cornfield adjacent to appellant\u2019s garage, some 25 feet from the house. The cornfield was separated from the house by a fence, behind which the officers stood. At about nine o\u2019clock a truck was driven in, backed up to the stoop at the rear of appellant\u2019s house, and Gene Webb and Virgil Ball got out and entered. The officers heard a voice from within saying, \u201cHow many cases do you want us to bring up ? \u201d and a voice also from within answered, \u201cBring it all up.\u201d Webb and Ball proceeded to carry up cartons and load them in the truck. The officers thereupon climbed the fence and approached the stoop; one of the cartons was dropped and the officers smelled whiskey. Webb was arrested at the back of the truck and the officers entered -appellant\u2019s house and arrested Ball in appellant\u2019s bedroom. The four cases which had been put in the truck and the five cases which the officers \u201cbrought out\u201d contained 66 gallons of whiskey in unstamped containers.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The' entry of the house and the arrest of Ball plainly violated \u00a7 2236, 18 U.S.C.A. Dennert v. United States, 6 Cir., 147 F.2d 286. The only government, witness, an officer, stated that there was no search of the house; but he also said, \u201cwe brought out five more cases.\u201d The officers were looking in the house for cases .which they brought out, and were also looking for Ball. This constituted a search. . The fact that there was no further search after appellant stated \u201cthat\u2019s all the whiskey there is\u201d does not alter the undisputed fact that a search was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">This is not the case of a rapidly moving automobile or any emergency situation, where immediate action is necessary. Cf. Alvau v. United States, 9 Cir., 33 F.2d 467; Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 283, 69 L.Ed. 543; Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879. As the court declared in the Carroll case, the conference report which preceded the legislation \u201cleft the way open for searching an automobile, or vehicle of transportation, without a warrant, if the search was not malicious or without probable cause.\u201d In the same case the Supreme Court held that this distinction was consistent with the guaranties of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">The District Court found that the officers were trespassers upon the premises. Here we have a search of the curtilage, Roberson v. United States, 6 Cir., 165 F.2d 752, 754, and an entry and search of a dwelling house. Moreover, the agents received their information at least by two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, in Newport, Tennessee, where there was a United States Commissioner, and it was clearly feasible to apply for the necessary warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">The motion to suppress evidence should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">We think this conclusion is compelled by the decision in McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 69 S.Ct. 191, 93 L.Ed. 153. Also it is in accord with the decision of this court based upon similar facts, Roberson v. United States, supra, which involved a search of the curtilage.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded' for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
