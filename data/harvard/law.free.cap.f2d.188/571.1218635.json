He presents no meritorious challenge to the validity of the fifth count which charged violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7, 661. The maximum penalty under this section is five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-21\">Count five supports the judgment. It is settled law that if a sentence is supported by any valid count it must stand.
