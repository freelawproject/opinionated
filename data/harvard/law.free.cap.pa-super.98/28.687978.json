And as it is agreed that the injury occurred during working hours, the second part of the question involves inquiry whether the employe abandoned his employment and sustained injury while on an adventure of his own. Whether the evidence brings the claim within the statutory definition is a question of law: Boscola v. Penna. Coal Co., 90 Pa. Superior Ct. 456 ; Carville v. Bornot, 288 Pa. 104, 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\">Injury occurring in the course of employment is defined in Art. Ill, Sec. 301 of the Act (1915, P. L. 738) and it has been described as \u201cbroad enough to include every injury received on the premises of the employer, during the hours of employment, so long as the nature of the employment demands the employee\u2019s presence there, regardless of whether his presence at the particular place where the injury occurred is actually required, if there is nothing to prove a virtual abandonment of the course of his employment by the injured person, or that, at the time of the accident, he was engaged in something wholly foreign thereto.\u201d (Callihan v. Montgomery, 272 Pa. 56.) When, as here, there is evidence that the employee was injured by the employer\u2019s shifting engine operating in the employer\u2019s plant during his working hours, a prima facie case is made out, and to avoid liability, the employer must show some condition or conditions which, under the statute, relieve him from paying compensation. In Black v. Herman, 297 Pa. 230, 232, it is said: \u201cWhile the term \u2018premises\u2019 does not include all property owned by the master, it does include so much thereof as is necessary for the conduct of the business and may even embrace a public street maintained by him: Meucci v. Grallatin Coal Co., 279 Pa. 184. On the other hand roads or paths over remote properties of the master, not a part of the plant, although sometimes used by employees in going to and from work, are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>a part of the employer\u2019s premises within the statute: See Palko v. Taylor-McCoy C. <em>&amp; </em>C. Co., 289 Pa. 401; Shickley v. Phila. &amp; Reading C. <em>&amp; </em>I. Co., 274 Pa. 360; Humbert v. P. &amp; R. C. &amp; I. Co., 93 Pa. Superior Ct. 250; Boscola v. Penna. Coal &amp; Coke Co., 90 Pa. Superior Ct. 456.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The Baldwin plant at Eddystone oceupies 600 acres. At various parts are large shops; one of them referred to in the evidence \u2014 the tender or tank shop \u2014 alone covers 13% acres. These shops are connected with inter-plant railroad tracks in large number. A switching engine driven by a fellow employee, moving on one of these tracks struck Johnson and so injured him that he died within a few hours. He was a rigger employed at setting up machinery incidental to the removal of the locomotive works from Philadelphia to Eddystone, an excellent workman who also acted as sub-foreman or leader of a gang; such workmen had no fixed place of employment. He was in good health. His foreman was McDermott. On the day of the accident, Johnson and others were placing machinery in the tank shop. During the lunch hour he and McDermott were outside the tank shop (less than 300 feet north of the place of injury) and at about 1 o \u2019clock McDermott instructed Johnson to go on with the work in the tank shop, while he, McDermott, went to the power house in another part of the yard southwest of the tank shop entrance where they had been standing. Johnson and his men finished placing machinery, and after a grinder was set in place, Johnson, ydthout saying where he was going, left the gang; this, according to one witness, was at about 1:55 P. M. No witness was called who saw or heard anything of him until about 2:30 when a shifting engine struck him on a plant railway track at a point about 280 feet south of the entrance to the tank shop. The place of injury was not an isolated spot far away from the plant activity but, as the map <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>in the record shows, was a place more or less surrounded by plant operations. While there is much conjecture in the briefs concerning his movements and occupation between 1:55 P. M. and 2:30 P. M. (all inferences from the evidence are to be drawn in claimant\u2019s favor: Conin v. American Oil Co., 298 Pa. 336) appellant admitted on the record that there were periods of no-work, called rest-periods, between jobs, and that during such periods, these workmen might-rest, and while doing so, could not be regarded as having abandoned their work; (Granville v. Coal Co., 76 Pa. Superior Ct. 335, 341; Palko v. Taylor-McCoy, 289 Pa. 401, 405). It is also in evidence that if it was necessary to go about to find his foreman, or to get tools, it was Johnston\u2019s duty to do so. One of the inferences proposed is, that as McDermott, the foreman, had told Johnson he was going to the powerhouse, Johnson, having finished his job in the tank house, might have gone to the powerhouse in search of his foreman, and that his course to or from that point could have taken him along the railroad track on which, he was injured. Employes constantly went along the railroad tracks, and there was no restriction against it. But we attach little importance to these conjectures in reaching our conclusion - on the merits. The evidence supports the finding that the place of injury was part of the employer\u2019s premises for one engaged as Johnson was; the injury took place during working hours; there is no proof of \u201cvirtual abandonment of the course of his employment......or that he...... was engaged at something wholly foreign thereto\u201d (Callihan v. Montgomery, supra), nor is there any proof that would destroy the effect of the prima facie case so made out as shown by the finding of the referee which the statute has made conclusive on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Claimant\u2019s husband was in the course of his employment on the employer\u2019s premises within the rule ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>plied in the following cases in which the rule was discussed and in which it was held that the injury occurred on the premises: Flucker v. Steel Co., 263 Pa. 113; Tolan v. Phila. <em>&amp; </em>Reading C. <em>&amp; </em>I. Co., 270 Pa. 12 ; Malky v. Kiskiminetas Coal Co., 278 Pa. 552; Granville v. Coal Co., 76 Pa. Superior Ct. 335; Berlin v. Crawford, 86 lb. 283; McAdams v. Pearson, 92 lb. 152; Waite v. Limestone Co., 78 lb. 7; Herman v. Black, 297 Pa. 230; and the conclusion is consistent with the following cases in which by the application of the same rule, it was held that the employe when injured was not on his employer\u2019s premises: Kuca v. L. V. Coal Co., 268 Pa. 163, 166; Short v. Hughes Coal Co., 96 Pa. Superior Ct. 237; Boscola v. Pa. C. <em>&amp; </em>C. Co., 90 lb. 456; Humbert v. P. &amp; R. C. <em>&amp; </em>I. Co., 93 lb. 250 ; Hunter v. American S. &amp; W. Co., 293 Pa. 103; Shickley v. Penna. &amp; Read. C. &amp; I. Co., 274 Pa. 360; Gurski v. Coal Co., 262 Pa. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">But the court below has not entered judgment as required by the statute. The order made is that \u201c...... judgment is hereby entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant under the Act of June 16, 1919, P. L. 665, Section 427.\u201d That is not sufficient but the omission can be rectified without difficulty. Sec. 427, P. L. 466, requires that \u201c........ the court shall enter judgment for the total amount stated by the award or order to be payable whether then due and accrued or payable in future instalments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The record is remitted with instructions to amend the order entering judgment to comply with the statute, and, so amended is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
