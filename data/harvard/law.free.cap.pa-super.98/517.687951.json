The court directed a verdict for the plaintiffs for the amount of their claim. A motion for judgment n. o. v. for the defendant was refused, which resulted in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">On the 26th of January, 1924, the defendant company executed and delivered to the plaintiffs a Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>siclence Theft Policy, blanket form, insuring their jewelry, precious and semi-precious stones, etc., in the sum of $1,000, for a term of one year beginning February 27,1924.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\">On the same date that the policy of the defendant company became effective, the plaintiffs renewed a policy of insurance with the Lloyd\u2019s, known as an All Bisks Jewelry Policy, for a period of one year. In the defendant\u2019s policy there was a provision that \u201cthe insurance hereunder shall not cover articles separately valued in, or specifically insured under the policy of any other insurer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Payment of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was refused by defendant on the ground that the protection of its policy was forfeited as the plaintiffs had the $600 diamond set as a companion stone in what had been a solitaire diamond ring, which was specifically insured under the Lloyd\u2019s policy and described as \u201c1 diamond solitaire, about 2.50 \u2014 1000.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The plaintiffs presented a claim for $1,000 for the diamond covered by that policy and that amount was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">It is argued by the appellee that the description of the article insured in the Lloyd\u2019s policy shows that it was not a ring, but a diamond, designated by weight and value, that was covered by that policy. There would be force to the contention if we were not confronted with a stipulation of the following facts which were agreed to and placed of record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">\u201cThat said policy of insurance covered, inter alia, one diamond solitaire ring, specifically valued at the sum of $1,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">\u201cThat said policy of insurance was in the form offered in evidence as part of this record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-9\">\u201cThat in the month of June, 1924, the plaintiffs herein changed the solitary (sic) diamond ring to a two diamond ring by adding another stone thereto, by the purchase of another diamond, which shortly after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>June 27th, 1924, was set in the solitaire ring valued and approved in the Lloyd\u2019s policy, in one ring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">\u201cThat on the 2'4th day of November, 1924, plaintiffs herein filed a proof of loss with the Employers\u2019 liability Assurance Corporation, which is herein offered in evidence, wherein it is stated, inter alia, \u2018We hereby make claim of The Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Company for $600, being the difference in the actual value of the ring taken and the amount of insurance carried on same to Lloyd\u2019s London. One-two stone diamond ring valued at $1,600, insurance $1,000, difference $600.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">It thus appears from the settled facts, which we are bound to accept and decide the case upon, that it was \u201c1 diamond solitaire ring, specifically valued at $1,000\u201d that was covered by the Lloyd\u2019s policy and that the claim made against this defendant company was for the difference in the value of the ring taken and the amount of insurance carried with the Lloyd\u2019s. We can but, therefore, conclude that the plaintiffs were claiming for the loss of a ring that was insured with Lloyd\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">When another stone was added to the ring, it became an integral part thereof, and as the ring was covered by the Lloyd\u2019s policy, there was no liability upon the part of the defendant under the above provision in its policy to pay for this loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The defendant\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v. should have been granted. The decree of the lower court is reversed and judgment is now directed to be entered for the defendant. Costs to be paid by the appellee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
