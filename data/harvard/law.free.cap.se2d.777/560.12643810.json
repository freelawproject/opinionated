ARTHUR KELSEY.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this case, a jury awarded wrongful death damages to several statutory beneficiaries, including separate awards to two minors, who were brothers of the decedent. Over the objection of the decedent's personal representatives, the parents of the children, the trial court ordered that the awards to the minors be held by the clerk\n   of court until they reach the age of majority. In doing so, the personal representatives argue, the trial court erred. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2009, a tragic school bus accident killed four-year-old Jameer Khamarie Woodley. His parents initially qualified as co-administrators of his estate, posting a $64,000 bond. Later, they qualified as co-administrators specifically \"under Va.Code \u00a7 8.01-50,\" posting a $100 bond and filing a wrongful death suit against the Southampton County School Board and three bus drivers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A jury awarded damages to the statutory beneficiaries, including the decedent's three older brothers. Jaylon Woodley, twelve years old at the time of the verdict, was awarded $750,000. Jaleel Woodley, five years old at the time, was awarded $200,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parents presented to the trial court two proposed irrevocable trusts to receive the funds awarded to their minor sons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trusts would be professionally managed by an independent trust company serving as trustee. The parents would have no \"ongoing rights,\" including the \"right to control, alter, amend, or terminate [the] Trust Agreement.\" The agreements emphasized that the trust assets were to be used exclusively for the benefit of each minor son and not to be used without court permission as a substitute for the parents' legal duty of support. The agreements also gave the trustee the discretion to spread out over time the distribution of the assets after the sons reached the age of majority, subject to judicial review if requested by one of the sons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parents also presented the trial court with an affidavit from the proposed trustee. The trustee verified that she served as an officer in a trust company that provides professionally managed trust and investment services. The company, she stated, has been \"recognized as a fiduciary by both The Bureau of Financial Institutions and The Federal Reserve.\" Consistent with the stated purpose of the minor beneficiaries' trust instruments, the \"trust assets would typically be invested in a mixed portfolio of conservatively chosen stocks and bonds.\" The trust company projected a possible 7% rate of return on the trust assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court rejected the proposed trusts and directed payment of the awards to the clerk of court. By letter, the clerk advised the parties that the funds would be deposited in a savings account at SunTrust Bank with a \"current rate-of-return\" of \"one tenth of one percent (.10%).\" After filing an unsuccessful motion to reconsider, the parents appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, the parents contend that the trial court erred when it ordered payment of the minors' wrongful death awards to the clerk of court.

Code \u00a7 8.01-54(C). This statutory duty necessarily presupposes that the\n   distribution will be made in full conformity with the personal representative's fiduciary obligations. When the beneficiaries are adults, the distribution duty is purely ministerial-each adult beneficiary receives whatever he is entitled to receive. In contrast, when the beneficiaries are minors, the distribution duty requires a multitude of judgment calls by the personal representative. How and for what length of time should the funds be preserved? What type of entity should manage the funds and with what type of investment vehicle, governed by what level of risk-reward ratio?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Nothing in the Death by Wrongful Act Statute authorizes a trial court presiding over a wrongful death award to dictate proactively the specific choices that a personal representative should make on these issues. In this case, the parents sought to establish professionally managed, irrevocable trusts, to appoint a disinterested and experienced officer of a well-recognized institution to serve as trustee, to govern the trusts through trust instruments that expressly precluded any interference by the parents, and to provide for a gradual payout of the trust assets throughout the early years of their sons' adult lives. The trial court presiding over the wrongful death awards in this case had no authority to disregard the statutory command directing that the award \"shall be paid\" to the personal representatives. Code \u00a7 8.01-54(C).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Our confidence on this subject is bolstered by other provisions conspicuously present in the Code. Code \u00a7 8.01-55 authorizes a personal representative to \"compromise any claim\" so long as he obtains the approval or consent of the circuit court. When a settlement of a wrongful death claim involves a minor beneficiary, Code \u00a7 8.01-424(A) grants the circuit court \"the power to approve and confirm\" the proposed compromise. If the court approves the compromise, Code \u00a7 8.01-424(E) authorizes the court, in its discretion, to direct payment \"to the parent or guardian of the minor to be held in trust for the benefit of the minor.\" If the court deems it appropriate, the approved trust may provide for its termination \"at any time following attainment of majority.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20S.E.2d%20409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The presence of specific authorization for court review and approval of wrongful death settlements involving minors contrasts sharply with the absence of any such authority over the distribution of wrongful death awards to minors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The reason for this could be quite simple. In some cases, like the present one, the personal representatives (parents of the deceased child) are themselves statutory beneficiaries. Allowing them to have unreviewable power to structure a global settlement on behalf of all beneficiaries (which is the norm in this type of litigation) would place their personal interests in conflict with the interests of the minor beneficiaries. No such potential conflicts of interest exist, however, when a judge or jury\n   decides by verdict the specific amounts awarded to each statutory beneficiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We may hypothesize policy reasons for treating wrongful death awards differently than wrongful death settlements, but our decision does not depend on such speculations.
