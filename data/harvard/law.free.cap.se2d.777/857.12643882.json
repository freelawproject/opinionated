Facts and Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The underlying facts in this case are undisputed. Preston L. McKellar (\"McKellar\"), worked for 42 years as a structural welder for Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding (\"Northrop Grumman\"). On or about April 1, 2010, McKellar notified Northrop Grumman that he would be retiring effective May 1, 2010. Shortly thereafter, on April 15, 2010,\n   McKellar tripped and fell while working on the construction of a submarine. McKellar injured his back, hip, knees, hands, and wrists. Following the accident, McKellar received medical treatment from a shipyard clinic and was placed on restricted duty for the remainder of April 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 1, 2010, McKellar retired as scheduled. When he continued to experience pain, an orthopedic surgeon examined McKellar, found him to be totally disabled, and placed him on \"no-work status.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   McKellar then filed a claim against Northrop Grumman with the Virginia Worker's Compensation Commission (\"Commission\"), seeking medical benefits and temporary total disability compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A deputy commissioner reviewed McKellar's medical records and conducted a hearing on January 12, 2013. The deputy commissioner found McKellar's evidence and testimony sufficient to warrant an award of medical benefits as well as temporary total disability benefits. At the hearing, McKellar admitted that he had not pursued employment since his retirement from Northrop Grumman, explaining that \"[m]y doctors put me on a no-work status, and I don't feel that I can work anywhere.\" The deputy commissioner found that, although McKellar was retired, his total incapacity entitled him to benefits under the Commission's decision in\n   <em>\n    Browder v. Southside Regional Medical Center,\n   </em>\n   71 O.I.C. 289 (1992) (holding that a claimant's post-injury resignation did not preclude claimant from receiving total temporary disability benefits).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Northrop Grumman subsequently appealed the deputy commissioner's decision to the full Commission. On appeal, a majority of the Commission affirmed the deputy commissioner's award of medical benefits but denied the claim for temporary total disability benefits.\n   <em>\n    McKellar v. Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   No. VA00000254165, slip op. at 7 (Va. Workers' Comp. Comm'n Oct. 23, 2013). The Commission found that McKellar's \"wage loss would have occurred regardless of his compensable injury.\" Therefore, \"[a]warding temporary total disability benefits would, in effect, provide [McKellar] with an additional stream of retirement income denied to similarly situated coworkers who were not injured.\" Commissioner Marshall dissented, asserting that a claimant suffering from a total disability need not show that he sought or intended to seek alternative employment. The dissent further noted that McKellar's \"total disability, not his retirement, removed him from the labor market.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   McKellar appealed the Commission's decision to the Court of Appeals of Virginia. In a published opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision from the Commission and denied McKellar's award of temporary total disability benefits.\n   <em>\n    McKellar v.

In keeping with that purpose, the Act expressly distinguishes injuries which render a claimant partially incapable of work from those which cause total incapacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B. Compensation for Total Incapacity\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Code \u00a7 65.2-500(A) governs compensation in cases of total incapacity, and states in relevant part that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   when the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is total, the employer shall pay, or cause to be paid, as hereinafter provided, to the injured employee during such total incapacity, a weekly compensation equal to 66\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   /\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   percent of his average weekly wages, with a minimum not less than 25 percent and a maximum of not more than 100 percent of the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth as defined herein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The plain language of this statute provides that employers \"shall pay ... during such total incapacity\" two-thirds of the injured worker's weekly earnings. Therefore, Code \u00a7 65.2-500 applies to totally disabled workers who have lost the capacity to earn wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Past decisions of our Court, the Court of Appeals, and the Commission indicate that loss of earning capacity is the proper test for awarding compensation in total disability cases.

In\n   <em>\n    Kelly v. Elkins Energy Corp.,\n   </em>\n   62 O.I.C. 270, 274 (1983), the Commission ordered that temporary total disability benefits resume for an injured coal miner who was laid off from selective employment. In another case, an injured worker received temporary total disability benefits despite being terminated from light duty due to her insubordination, tardiness, and rudeness to customers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Potomac Edison Co. v.

Benefits for temporary total incapacity will continue to flow even where a claimant is incarcerated in federal prison.\n   <em>\n    See Escobar v. L.M. Sandler &amp; Sons, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   68 O.I.C. 206 (1989);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baskerville v.

They illustrate why the loss of earning capacity test is the proper standard for awarding compensation in cases of total incapacity under Code \u00a7 65.2-500. As such, a retired worker whose work-related injury causes total incapacity need not produce evidence of a pre-injury intent to reenter the workforce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   C. Compensation for Partial Incapacity\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   By contrast, Code \u00a7 65.2-502(A) governs cases of partial incapacity.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [W]hen the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is partial, the employer shall pay, or cause to be paid, as hereinafter provided, to the injured employee during such incapacity a weekly compensation equal to 66\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   /\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   percent of the difference between his average weekly wages before the injury and the average weekly wages which he is able to earn thereafter, but not more than 100 percent of the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth as defined in \u00a7 65.2-500.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As the statute indicates, employers are required in such cases to pay two-thirds of \"the difference\" between the partially disabled worker's pre- and post-injury wages. Consequently, Code \u00a7 65.2-502 presumes that where an injured worker is only partially disabled, that employee can continue working either on restricted duty or in an altogether new job. As a result, economic loss is the appropriate test for the compensation award in cases of partial incapacity whereas loss of earning capacity is the proper test for such awards in cases of total incapacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   D. Application of Proper Standard\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In denying McKellar's award of temporary total disability benefits, both the Commission and the Court of Appeals failed to apply the plain language of Code \u00a7 65.2-500. Instead of applying the test for total incapacity as delineated by Code \u00a7 65.2-500, the\n   court and Commission below improperly conflated the analyses for total incapacity and partial incapacity. The Court of Appeals cited extensively to cases decided under Code \u00a7 65.2-502, the partial incapacity statute, holding that it \"provides for payments in much the same fashion as the statutory provision for total incapacity, Code \u00a7 65.2-500.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230230\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/63/448/\">\n    63 Va.App. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   455 n. 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230230\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/63/448/\">\n    758 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   107 n. 3. This conclusion is plainly erroneous. Although both Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-500 and -502 provide payments for injured workers, the corresponding tests differ significantly. As explained above, Code \u00a7 65.2-500 governs total incapacity and applies a loss of earning capacity test, while Code \u00a7 65.2-502 pertains to partial incapacity and applies an economic loss test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court of Appeals relied heavily on\n   <em>\n    Arlington County Fire Department v.

This conclusion ignores the uncontested fact that at the time of the hearing McKellar was totally disabled and incapable of earning a salary. McKellar is not similarly situated to retirees who are not totally disabled and who have the option of re-entering the workforce at some time.

Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Virginia Worker's Compensation Act provides distinct and independent tests for total incapacity versus partial incapacity. When an employee is totally disabled and medically precluded from working, the appropriate test under Code \u00a7 65.2-500 focuses on the loss of earning capacity, not the economic loss. The deputy commissioner correctly found that McKellar was totally disabled and that he lacked all earning capacity. Therefore, McKellar is entitled to temporary total disability compensation. Accordingly we will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and we will remand the case to the Court of Appeals with direction that it remand the case to the Worker's Compensation Commission with\n   instructions to reinstate the award of compensation as determined by Deputy Commissioner Wilder's March 11, 2013 opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The court held that \"Stebbins\n    <em>\n     is entitled to no compensation\n    </em>\n    because he reported no earnings for the preceding fifty-two weeks.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2311805\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/21/570/\">\n     21 Va.App. at 573\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2311805\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/21/570/\">\n     466 S.E.2d at 126\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).

The Court of Appeals misconstrues that holding. Stebbins was entitled to benefits insofar as he proved total incapacity resulting from a work injury. However, because Stebbins had no income during the statutory look-back period used to calculate the amount of benefits due, the court was faced with a zero-benefits award and thus ultimately denied the claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2311805\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/21/570/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2311805\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/21/570/\">\n    at 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2311805\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/21/570/\">\n    466 S.E.2d at 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
