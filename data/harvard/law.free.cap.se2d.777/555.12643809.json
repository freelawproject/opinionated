LEMONS.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this appeal, we consider the preclusive effect of a misdemeanor acquittal on subsequent felony convictions, when the misdemeanor and felony charges arose from the same course of conduct and the trier of fact provided specific grounds for dismissal of the misdemeanor charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Facts and Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties agree on the material facts of this case. Ronald Taft Davis, III (\"Davis\") was arrested on November 16, 2008, following a fatal shooting outside a restaurant in Surry County in which the shooter fired ten or more gunshots into an occupied parked car, killing Keonta Fountain. Davis was charged with first-degree murder, maliciously shooting into an occupied vehicle, and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. He was also charged with a misdemeanor offense of reckless handling of a firearm under Code \u00a7 18.2-56.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 16, 2008, Davis appeared in the General District Court of Surry County (\"district court\") for a trial on the misdemeanor charge and a preliminary hearing on the felonies. Several witnesses testified at the hearing, and a court reporter was present to transcribe the proceedings. A deputy sheriff testified that he responded to the Colonial Farmhouse Restaurant and Tavern shortly after 2 a.m. and found the victim lying face down in a parked car with gunshot wounds to the head. Joanna Butler\n   (\"Butler\"), a friend of the victim, testified that she observed a verbal dispute between several people outside of the restaurant. Butler said that as she and the victim turned to get into a car, she heard shots, ducked down, and could not see who was shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Another restaurant patron, Tim Johnson (\"Johnson\"), testified that he heard gunshots and saw someone wearing a black shirt and holding a gun approximately fifteen to twenty feet away from the vehicle. When asked specifically whether Johnson could identify Davis as the shooter, Johnson responded that he could not.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Q: Did you see Ron Davis?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   A: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Q: Did you see who started the shooting?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   A: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q: Look over there. Do you know Ron Davis?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A: Yeah, I know him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q: You can't say that it was him, but it was someone dressed in black; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A: I can't say. I don't know if it was him or not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Juan Giles (\"Giles\"), who was riding with Davis after the shooting, testified that Davis spoke about having \"got[ten] rid of a gun,\" but Giles did not know what gun Davis was referencing. On direct examination, Giles disavowed a prior statement to police in which he had implicated Davis, saying that police threatened him into making his earlier statement. Giles also testified that Davis\n   wore a shirt which was primarily white, red, and green, with a black background.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, Davis' attorney asked the district court to acquit Davis on the misdemeanor charge and to dismiss the felony charges for lack of probable cause. After considering the evidence, the district court dismissed the misdemeanor reckless handling of a firearm charge and refused to certify Davis' felony charges to the circuit court for lack of probable cause. The district court judge made three specific findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   On the issue of probable cause, clearly the Commonwealth has met its burden as to whether a felony was committed or not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   On the issue of whether or not you've shown it reasonable to believe Mr. Davis was the one that fired the weapon, I find that you have not met that burden, and I find no probable cause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   On the misdemeanor charge as to whether or not you've proven the case beyond a reasonable doubt, I would find that you have not. I'm going to find him not guilty of that charge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The district court judge then signed and placed a checkmark in the printed square on the reverse side of the warrant designated \"not guilty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Commonwealth subsequently brought the case before a grand jury and obtained direct indictments charging Davis with first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder. Before trial, Davis moved to dismiss the indictments on collateral estoppel grounds because of his acquittal on the misdemeanor charge. In his motion, Davis argued that if the facts were insufficient for the general district court to convict him of recklessly handling \"any firearm so as to endanger the life, limb, or property of any person,\" then \"[c]learly the evidence was insufficient to establish\" that he was the shooter. The circuit court denied Davis' motion and the case proceeded to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After a two-day trial, the jury convicted Davis of first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder. The circuit court sentenced Davis to 60 years' imprisonment. Davis then appealed his felony convictions to the Court of Appeals, arguing that the circuit court erred in denying his pre-trial motion to dismiss on collateral estoppel grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A divided three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals reversed Davis' convictions and dismissed the indictments.\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

All three charges stemmed from the same alleged course of criminal conduct. All three charges required proof of the same issue of ultimate fact: that Ronald Davis fired a weapon at a vehicle in the parking lot outside the Colonial Farmhouse Restaurant on the night of November 16, 2008. The district court's finding that the evidence was insufficient to prove the identity of the shooter was a determination of that fact that was applicable to all three charges. Upon the entry of a final judgment of acquittal on the misdemeanor, the Commonwealth was precluded from trying Davis on any other charge which required proof of that specific fact as an element of the crime. When the Commonwealth obtained felony convictions\n   that relied on that specific fact, it put Davis twice in jeopardy for the same offense and violated his rights under the Fifth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   It is important to clarify that our decision is based on the final judgment of acquittal and not on the district court's refusal to certify the felony charges.

The preclusion in this case was triggered by the misdemeanor acquittal. The specific reasons for that acquittal are abundantly clear in the record: the Commonwealth failed to prove that Davis was the shooter. Davis has proven that his subsequent felony convictions were premised on the same issue of ultimate fact that was actually and necessarily decided in his favor in the misdemeanor trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Our decision today is premised upon the record of the proceedings below. As we observed in\n   <em>\n    Lee,\n   </em>\n   \"district courts frequently mark misdemeanor warrants 'dismissed' without assigning specific grounds.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2133555\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/219/1108/\">\n    219 Va. at 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=254%20S.E.2d%20126\">\n    254 S.E.2d at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"When grounds for a dismissal are not assigned and do not otherwise appear of record, the doctrine of collateral estoppel will not be applied.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=254%20S.E.2d%20126\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, even when a charge is dismissed on a general verdict of acquittal, we \"examine the record of [the] prior proceeding, taking into account the pleadings, evidence, charge,\n   <em>\n    and other relevant matter,\n   </em>\n   \" to determine the precise fact on which the acquittal stood.\n   <em>\n    Ashe,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054849\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/436/#p445\">\n    397 U.S. at 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054849\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/436/#p445\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Both the Commonwealth's attorney and Davis' counsel focused their arguments on the identity of the shooter.
