Risperdal is among a class of drugs prescribed primarily for the treatment of schizophrenia. The Attorney General of South Carolina believed that Janssen had violated the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (SCUTPA)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   by engaging in unfair methods of competition by willfully failing to disclose known risks and side effects associated with Risperdal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 24, 2007, the State and Janssen entered into a tolling agreement concerning the statute of limitations. SCUTPA has a three-year statute of limitations, as section 39-5-150 of the South Carolina Code provides that \"[n]o action may be brought under this article more than three years after discovery of the unlawful conduct which is the subject of the suit.\" The State filed its Complaint on April 23, 2007, seeking statutory civil penalties against Janssen on two claims. The first claim arose from the content of the written material furnished by Janssen since 1994 with each Risperdal prescription, the so-called labeling claim. The second claim centered on alleged false information contained in a November 2003 Janssen-generated letter sent to the South Carolina community of prescribing physicians, the so-called Dear Doctor Letter. Because both claims arose more than three years prior to January 24, 2007, Janssen pled the statute of limitations as a bar to the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The matter proceeded to trial. A jury rendered a liability verdict against Janssen on both claims. The trial court rejected\n   Janssen's defenses, including the statute of limitations, finding that both claims were timely. The trial court imposed civil penalties against Janssen for both claims totaling $327,073,700 based on 553,055 separate violations of SCUTPA in connection with its deceptive conduct in the sales and marketing of Risperdal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Janssen appeals. Because this is an action at law, our review of factual challenges is limited to determining whether there is any evidence to support the verdict. As for properly preserved questions of law, our review is plenary. We affirm the liability judgment on the labeling claim but modify the judgment to limit the imposition of civil penalties to a period of three years from the date of the tolling agreement, which is essentially coextensive with the three-year statute of limitations, subject to an additional three months by virtue of the time period between the January 24, 2007, tolling agreement and the filing of the Complaint on April 23, 2007. We further remit the civil penalties on the labeling claim to $22,844,700. We affirm the liability judgment on the DDL claim, but remit those civil penalties to $101,480,000. Accordingly, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for entry of judgment against Janssen in the amount of $124,324,700.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    FDA Regulatory Process and Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A brief summary of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) regulatory authority over the pharmaceutical industry and the evolution of antipsychotic drugs provides a helpful backdrop to the facts of this case. \"In the 1930's, Congress became increasingly concerned about unsafe drugs and fraudulent marketing, and it enacted the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Wyeth v.

Schizophrenia is a chronic, debilitating mental illness that affects approximately 1% of the population. Following onset, schizophrenia is a lifelong, incurable disease, and treatment almost always involves the use of an antipsychotic drug. Between the 1950s and 1990s, medical practitioners prescribed typical antipsychotics such as Thorazine (chlorpromazine ), Prolixin (fluphenazine ), Haldol (haloperidol ), Loxitane (loxapine ), and Mellaril (thioridazine ) to treat schizophrenia. Although effective, these typical antipsychotics posed a number of negative side effects, including involuntary muscle movements and tardive dyskinesia, a long-lasting movement disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   By the 1980s, clozapine was being investigated for the treatment of schizophrenia on the theory that it might be more effective and cause fewer movement disorders than typical antipsychotics. Clozapine was termed an \"atypical antipsychotic\" because it affected a different part of the brain than the older, typical antipsychotics. The medical community soon discovered that clozapine, too, had negative side effects, including agranulocytosis -a dramatic and sometimes deadly decrease in white blood cell count. Thus, in spite of its efficacy in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia, clozapine\n   was usually used only as a \"last resort\" drug, prescribed for only about 10% of the schizophrenic population.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In 1994, Janssen introduced Risperdal in the United States as the second atypical antipsychotic drug on the market. In the first several years Risperdal was on the market, it steadily captured market share from typical antipsychotics, despite costing ten times as much. From 1994 to 1996, Risperdal held a unique place in the market-it was promoted as being more effective than the older, typical antipsychotics, without the dangerous side effects associated with clozapine. In 1996, Eli Lilly (Lilly) introduced a third atypical antipsychotic drug to the market: Zyprexa. Zyprexa was dramatically successful when it hit the market, and Lilly and Janssen competed to capture the antipsychotic market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Spurred by this fierce competition, Janssen developed a marketing strategy to distinguish Risperdal and protect its market share. By 1998, Janssen was promoting Risperdal as having a lower risk of weight gain and a lower metabolic risk profile than Zyprexa.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite the claims made by Janssen, post-marketing studies, some as early as 1994, revealed Risperdal posed a serious risk of substantial weight gain, increased prolactin levels,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and hyperprolactinemia in patients taking atypical antipsychotics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This increased the long-term risk of developing various kinds of cancer, osteoarthritis, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. Additionally, atypical antipsychotics greatly increased the risk of diabetes mellitus, which can have very serious, even life-threatening consequences. By 1997, Janssen also had information that Risperdal posed a serious risk of stroke, cardiac arrest, and sudden death in the elderly. Despite this clinical information, it was several years before Janssen updated the Risperdal label to accurately reflect the frequency and severity of the risk of hyperprolactinemia, weight gain and diabetes, or stroke, cardiac arrest, and sudden death in the elderly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In 1997, Janssen commissioned a clinical trial (Trial 113) designed to establish Risperdal's superiority over Zyprexa as to metabolic side effects, including weight gain and diabetes. In 1999, the results of Trial 113 were not what Janssen desired, as the study concluded that there was no difference between Risperdal and Zyprexa in terms of long-term weight gain or the onset of diabetes mellitus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Janssen did not disclose or publish the results of Trial 113 and continued to claim that Risperdal was superior to Zyprexa in terms of these negative metabolic side effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   By August 2000, Janssen also received results from two epidemiological studies. One study was based on a review of the records of patients treated with atypical antipsychotics in a New England insurance database (ERI study). The ERI study showed that Risperdal patients developed diabetes mellitus\n   at a significantly higher incident rate than patients taking Zyprexa. The second study was commissioned by Janssen (HECON study), and it concluded that Risperdal was not associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus. By this time, and notwithstanding Janssen's furtive efforts, the risks and adverse side effects associated with atypical antipsychotic drugs were fairly well known.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In May 2000, the FDA asked sponsors of atypical antipsychotic drugs to submit a comprehensive review of all clinical data pertaining to metabolic side effects. In response, Janssen did not disclose the results of the Trial 113 study but disclosed\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the favorable results from its own HECON study, affirmatively indicating to the FDA that no long-term trials pertaining to metabolic side effects had taken place. The FDA's review was not thwarted by Janssen's efforts, as the FDA's investigation prompted it to request that product labeling for all atypical antipsychotic medications, including Risperdal, include a warning about hyperglycemia and diabetes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Janssen was concerned that the FDA-mandated label warning would result in a substantial loss of Risperdal market share. Notwithstanding the Trial 113 and ERI study results suggesting an association between Risperdal and diabetes, in October 2000, Janssen's Associate Director of Central Nervous System Medical Affairs wrote an email to her colleagues urging that Janssen must avoid Risperdal being \"lumped in to [sic] the atypical class for diabetes.... [W]e need to work hard on a strategy to avoid risperdal being thought of as a diabetes-inducing medication. Instead, when worried about diabetes, we want doctors to prescribe Risperdal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Janssen then determined it would take control of how the message surrounding the new diabetes warning would be communicated. Janssen officials' strategy was to \"soften the blow\" through what is known in the industry as a Dear Doctor Letter (DDL).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The inspiration came from a DDL that Lilly sent to prescribers, informing them that the entire class of atypical antipsychotics was now subject to a new \"class label\" for diabetes and hyperglycemia. A senior vice president for Janssen's parent company wrote in an internal email that \"Lilly's DDL is pretty clever. How much commercial liability\n   would we incur if we sent a similar letter about Risperdal, assuming the FDA is unwilling to communicate the issue?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On November 10, 2003, Janssen disseminated a DDL, which did not include the text of the new diabetes /hyperglycemia warning, but stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Hyperglycemia-related adverse events have infrequently been reported in patients receiving RISPERDAL. Although confirmatory research is still needed, a body of evidence from published peer-reviewed epidemiology research suggests that RISPERDAL is not associated with an increased risk of diabetes when compared to untreated patients or patients treated with conventional antipsychotics. Evidence also suggests that RISPERDAL is associated with a lower risk of diabetes than some other studied atypical antipsychotics.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   To put it mildly, the November 2003 DDL contained false information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Additionally, in training its employees on the labeling update, Janssen communicated to its field sales team that Risperdal had a \"0%\" increased diabetes risk compared to placebo. This was part of the message communicated to physicians in DDL follow-up visits with physicians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Meanwhile, by January 2004, Janssen had updated the Risperdal label to include the new diabetes /hyperglycemia warning. Janssen determined that the negative sales impact had been minimal because of its deceptive efforts in the November 2003 DDL. In other words, the November 2003 DDL worked, as far as Janssen was concerned, in protecting its market share.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Thereafter, in April 2004, the FDA's Division of Drug Marketing Advertising and Communications (DDMAC)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   issued a \"Warning Letter\" to Janssen, characterizing the November 2003 DDL as \"false or misleading\" in violation of the FDCA. Specifically, the letter provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   DDMAC has concluded that the DHCP\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   letter is false or misleading in violation of Sections 502(a) and 201(n) of the\n   Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) (21 U.S.C. 352(a) and 321(n) ) because it fails to disclose the addition of information relating to hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus to the approved product labeling, minimizes the risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse events, which in extreme cases is associated with serious adverse events including ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, and death, fails to recommend regular glucose control monitoring to identify diabetes mellitus as soon as possible, and misleadingly claims that Risperdal is safer than other atypical antipsychotics. The healthcare community relies on DHCP letters for accurate and timely information regarding serious risks and associated changes in labeling and the dissemination of this letter at a time critical to educating healthcare providers is a serious public health issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The FDA also determined that the scientific studies referenced in the DDL \"do not represent the weight of the pertinent scientific evidence\" nor did the DDL accurately describe the results of the cited studies. As a result of the FDA's warning, Janssen issued a corrective letter in July 2004, acknowledging that the November 2003 DDL \"omitted material information about Risperdal, minimized potentially fatal risks, and made misleading claims suggesting superior safety to other atypical antipsychotics without adequate substantiation, in violation of the [FDCA].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As to Risperdal's label, Janssen did not update the label to include a boxed warning regarding the risk of stroke, cardiac arrest, and sudden death in the elderly until February 2005, and no warning about hyperprolactinemia\n   appeared in the label until August 2008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    The State's Unfair Trade Practice Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In April of 2007, the Attorney General of South Carolina filed a state law claim against Janssen, seeking civil penalties under SCUTPA. The State pursued two claims against Janssen, one in connection with the Risperdal label (the labeling claim) and the second concerning the November 2003 DDL (the DDL claim). Following a twelve-day trial, the jury returned a verdict on liability in favor of the State, finding that Janssen's actions with respect to both the labeling and DDL claims were willful violations of SCUTPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   After dismissing the jury, the trial court separately considered evidence and arguments during a two-day hearing to determine the appropriate penalty for Janssen's SCUTPA violations. The trial court issued an order assessing penalties against Janssen of $152,849,700 for the labeling claim and $174,224,000 for the DDL claim, for a total penalty of $327,073,700. This appeal followed.

While the only section of SCUTPA at issue in this case is an enforcement action brought by the Attorney General, we note the distinction between the two types of actions. In an action brought by a citizen under section 39-5-140(a) of the South Carolina Code, there is a requirement beyond the tendency to deceive element that the person suffer an \"ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by another person of an unfair or deceptive method, act or practice.\" Thus, SCUTPA requires that a private claimant suffer an\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   loss, injury, or damage, and requires a causal connection between the injury-in-fact and the complained of\n   unfair or deceptive acts or practices.

In addition, the nature of counsel's comments is more closely associated with what Janssen believes was a grossly excessive award of civil penalties, and the jury's role was limited to determining liability. The jury had no role in determining the amount of the civil penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    Admission of 1994, 1999, and 2004 DDMAC Letters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Janssen argues that the admission of several DDMAC letters was reversible error\n   because the letters constitute inadmissible hearsay and should also have been excluded under Rule 403, SCRE. Once again, we find that Janssen has not preserved these assignments of error for appellate review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if we were to reach the merits of these claims, however, we would affirm the admission of these letters pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR.

We disagree, for the conflicting evidence presented a jury question as to whether Janssen had violated SCUTPA. Concerning the \"adverse impact\" legal argument, we reject Janssen's attempt to ascribe an injury-in-fact element in an individual claim to an Attorney General directed claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Janssen's attempt to judicially impose an injury-in-fact element to an Attorney General initiated SCUTPA claim is nothing more than an \"if we lied, nobody fell for it\" defense, which we reject.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The provisions of SCUTPA allow three types of enforcement actions: (1) lawsuits initiated by the Attorney General seeking injunctive relief; (2) lawsuits by the Attorney General seeking civil penalties; or (3) lawsuits by private parties who have suffered ascertainable losses.

S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-5-140(a). Additionally, a private party may recover treble damages\n   if the unlawful acts at issue are determined to be willful or knowing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20S.C.%20L.%20Rev.%20543\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On the other hand, where the Attorney General files suit on behalf of the State, he is not required to show any injury-in-fact to recover a civil penalty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 39-5-110, -140.

If the Attorney General determines that an enforcement action \"would be in the public interest,\" he is statutorily authorized to proceed without making any such showing of injury-in-fact or reliance. S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-5-50(a). As noted above, the Attorney General must establish that a defendant's conduct has a tendency to deceive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Indeed, the \"in the public interest\" aspect of an Attorney General SCUTPA claim mirrors one of the underlying purposes of the FTCA-namely, \"to make clear that the protection of the consumer from unfair trade practices, equally with the protection of competitors and the competitive process, is a concern of public policy.\" Statement of Basis and Purpose, Unfair or Deceptive Advertising and Labeling of Cigarettes in Relation to the Health Hazards of Smoking,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20Fed.%20Reg.%208324\">\n    29 Fed. Reg. 8324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8349 (1964). As the Federal Trade Commission has stated, most enforcement actions are brought \"not to second-guess the wisdom of particular consumer decisions, but rather to halt some form of seller behavior that unreasonably creates or takes advantage of an obstacle to the free exercise of consumer decisionmaking.\" Federal Trade Commission, Policy Statement on Unfairness (Dec. 17, 1980) [hereinafter Unfairness Policy Statement],\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/1980/12/ftc-poli cy-statement-unfairness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Thus, Janssen misconstrues the legislature's manifest purpose in providing for an Attorney General directed claim, for a SCUTPA action brought by the State is to protect the citizens of South Carolina from unfair or deceptive acts in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Janssen's contention to the contrary is not only fundamentally at odds with unambiguous legislative intent in authorizing an Attorney General SCUTPA claim, but is also inconsistent with well-established law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   On the issue of liability, our case law interpreting and applying SCUTPA is clear-while a private party SCUTPA action requires the traditional showing of an injury, an action brought by the Attorney General on behalf of the State contains no actual injury element. For the foregoing reasons, we hold that, although the State had the burden of proving Janssen's representations had a\n   <em>\n    tendency to deceive,\n   </em>\n   the State was not required to show actual deception or that those representations caused any appreciable injury-in-fact or adversely impacted the marketplace.

The import of Dr. Wecker's testimony would have been that, notwithstanding Janssen's false representations, the community of prescribing physicians was well aware of the risks and side effects of Risperdal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   We are again presented with an issue that was not properly preserved for appellate review. When the trial court filed its order on February 25, 2011, excluding the testimony of Dr. Wecker on relevancy grounds, Janssen waited until March 21, 2011, to make an offer of proof of his testimony.

We do acknowledge there was evidence presented, which otherwise tended to support Janssen's thesis that its deceptive conduct had no effect on the community of prescribing physicians,\n   for they knew the truth concerning the risks and side effects associated with Risperdal. Excluding Dr. Wecker's testimony, therefore, resulted in no prejudice to Janssen.

For example, in the Policy Statement on Deception, the FTC reviewed case law and Commission decisions and noted that \"deception cases\" may include representations or omissions in connection with the sale of a product \"without adequate disclosures.\" Policy Statement on Deception,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   FTC guidance further instructs that \"there must be a representation, omission, or practice that is likely to mislead the consumer\" and that \"the act or practice must be considered\n   from the perspective of the reasonable consumer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The FTC has additionally issued a Policy Statement on Unfairness, which acknowledged that the concept of \"unfairness is one whose precise meaning is not immediately obvious.\" Policy Statement on Unfairness,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   FTC guidance provides the following general characteristics of an unfair practice claim: \"(1) whether the practice injures consumers;\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) whether it\n   violates established public policy; (3) whether it is unethical or unscrupulous.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The jury instruction was in substantial accord with the FTC guidance. Janssen makes the argument that there was no tendency to deceive (or likelihood of causing consumer injury) because the intended audience of its representations was the medical community, and further because the medical community knew or should have known the truth, Janssen must be absolved of any liability. Janssen's argument is not without merit, for the context surrounding a practice or representation is a weighty consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Policy Statement on Deception,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   (\"[A] practice or representation directed to a well-educated group, such as prescription drug advertisement to doctors, would be judged in light of the knowledge and sophistication of that group.\") Janssen essentially seeks a categorical rule that insulates a pharmaceutical company from SCUTPA liability for misrepresentations made to prescribing physicians, a sophisticated group. We decline to recognize such a rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   This \"sophisticated audience\" argument was vetted by the parties and charged to the jury in that the jury was required to assess the alleged unfair and deceptive practice in light of the \"facts and circumstances surrounding what someone's done\" and \"in the context of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement or the doing of the act.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether Janssen's actions and representations to the medical community constituted a violation of SCUTPA was a jury question.

We disagree concerning the DDL claim and affirm, but agree in part with Janssen regarding the labeling claim. The statute of limitations bars the labeling claim insofar as the trial court imposed civil penalties for violations that occurred more than three years prior to the parties' tolling agreement. Because of the ongoing nature of Janssen's deceptive conduct, we affirm the judgment on the labeling claim but limit the imposition of civil\n   penalties to a three-year period, coextensive with the statute of limitations, subject only to the additional period of time between the tolling agreement and the filing of the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   At the close of all of the evidence, the State moved for a directed verdict as to Janssen's statute of limitations defense, arguing that Janssen failed to present any evidence that the Attorney General's office had actual or constructive notice of Janssen's unlawful conduct prior to the commencement of the three year statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the State argued there was no evidence that the Attorney General, more than three years prior to the commencement of the statute of limitations on January 24, 2004, knew or should have known about the deceptiveness of the DDL and the Risperdal label, the concealed studies, or the unlawful promotion of Risperdal in South Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The trial court granted the State's motion for a directed verdict, finding that neither the DDL claim nor the labeling claim was barred by the three-year statute of limitations. Specifically, the trial court noted that although the medical community was generally aware of the risks associated with Risperdal, some even as early as the mid-1990s, the point in time at which the side-effects of Risperdal became known was not the gravamen of the State's claims. Rather, the specific conduct at issue was Janssen's false and misleading statements in the DDL and Janssen's failure to update its label to reflect the known degree of risks associated with Risperdal. Accordingly, the relevant inquiry was the point at which the State should have known that Janssen's\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   as to the DDL and the Risperdal label was unfair or deceptive and, thus, gave rise to a SCUTPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   As to the DDL claim, the trial court found that claim was not barred by the statute of limitations because there was no evidence that the false or misleading nature of the DDL could have been discovered before the DDMAC issued its warning letter to Janssen in April 2004, which was within the timeframe of the tolling agreement. As to the labeling claim, the trial court found that because Janssen took affirmative steps to prevent disclosure of unfavorable clinical trial results that revealed the serious degree of risks associated with Risperdal, the statute of limitations was equitably tolled during the period of time in which Janssen knew, but failed to disclose and shielded from public knowledge, the true degree of risks associated with Risperdal. The trial court found the labeling claim likewise was not barred by the statute of limitations, and awarded a civil penalty for each of the of 509,499 Risperdal \"sample boxes\" distributed in South Carolina from 1998 through the date of the Complaint, April 23, 2007, each of which included the drug label in the sample packaging.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Janssen argues this was error and that both claims are barred by the statute of limitations because the State had actual or constructive knowledge of the claims before January 24, 2004. Specifically, as to the DDL claim, Janssen contends that the claim was discoverable from the face of the DDL itself, and therefore, the statute of limitations began to run at the time the DDL was mailed in November 2003. As to the labeling claim, Janssen contends that claim is barred because\n   the risks associated with Risperdal were widely known by the mid-1990s and that the alleged inadequacies in the labeling were apparent from the face of the label itself; therefore, Janssen posits that the labels themselves put the State on notice of its labeling claim as early as 1994, and that the three-year statute of limitations thus ran long before the State's Complaint was filed in 2007. Janssen further argues the doctrine of equitable tolling should be sparingly applied and that there is no basis for applying it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   We first address the DDL claim. SCUTPA provides for a three-year statute of limitations. S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-5-150 (1985). Under the discovery rule, the three-year clock starts ticking on the date the injured party either knows or should have known by the exercise of reasonable diligence that a cause of action arises from wrongful conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <em>\n    Dean v.

We have carefully reviewed the record in light of the appropriate standard of review, and we agree with the trial court. As a matter of law, the only reasonable conclusion supported by the evidence at trial was that the existence of a claim, i.e. the deceptive and unfair nature of Janssen's conduct in disseminating the DDL, could not have reasonably been discovered prior to April 2004 when the FDA issued the Warning Letter to Janssen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"92265\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/321/360/#p363\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"92265\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/321/360/#p363\">\n    at 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"92265\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/321/360/#p363\">\n    468 S.E.2d at 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that where the only reasonable conclusion supported by the evidence was that the lawsuit accrued on a particular date, there was no issue for the jury to decide and a directed verdict was proper). We affirm the trial court's finding that the DDL claim was timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   We turn to the labeling claim. The procedural dilemma we confront is that the statute of limitations issue concerning the labeling claim was resolved at trial through principles of equitable tolling. A determination in equity is not proper for a directed verdict motion insofar as determining what matters should be submitted to the jury. It was therefore\n   legal error to resolve the issue of equitable tolling pursuant to a directed verdict motion. Under our\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of this equitable issue, we agree with Janssen that there is an insufficient basis for application of that doctrine to preserve the timeliness of all labeling violations, reaching back to the time Risperdal was first introduced in 1994.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hooper v. Ebenezer Sr. Servs. &amp; Rehab. Ctr.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3862699\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/386/108/#p117\">\n    386 S.C. 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 117,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3862699\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/386/108/#p117\">\n    687 S.E.2d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 33 (2009) (noting the doctrine of equitable tolling should be used sparingly and only when the interests of justice demand its use). However, we do not view the error as one mandating reversal and a new trial, given the continuing nature of the accrual of labeling violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Clearly, much of the labeling claim accrued more than three years prior to the January 24, 2007 tolling agreement. The risks associated with atypical antipsychotics, like Risperdal, were becoming well known by the late 1990s. The State's experts testified that the Risperdal label was inadequate as early as 1994 when Janssen began marketing the drug. By all accounts, in the early 2000s, evidence of the risks was pervasive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   We find that the only reasonable conclusion supported by the evidence is that the Attorney General knew, or most assuredly should have known, of potential SCUTPA violations regarding the Risperdal label prior to January 24, 2004. Thus, the labeling violations occurring prior to January 24, 2004, were therefore barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Nevertheless, the labeling claim presents ongoing violations of SCUTPA that continued\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   January 24, 2004 and during the three-year-period prior to the tolling agreement. In requesting that the entire labeling claim be dismissed as time barred, Janssen assumes, wrongly so, that its ability to successfully invoke the statute of limitations to bar the labeling claim prior to January 24, 2004, ends the labeling claim altogether. We reject Janssen's position, for Janssen misapprehends the statute of limitations and the concept of continuous accrual of this SCUTPA cause of action. The\n   labeling claim presents a series of discrete, independently actionable wrongs that are at the core of the typical unfair trade practice action. The principles of this type of continuous accrual respond to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   the inequities that would arise if the expiration of the statute of limitations period following a first breach of duty or instance of misconduct were treated as sufficient to bar suit for any subsequent breach or misconduct; parties engaged in long-standing malfeasance would thereby obtain immunity in perpetuity from suit even for recent\n   and ongoing malfeasance. In addition, where misfeasance is ongoing, a defendant's claim to repose, the principal justification underlying the limitations defense, is vitiated.... [Accordingly,] separate, recurring invasions of the same right can each trigger their own statute of limitations....

However, we agree with Janssen concerning the labeling claim insofar as civil penalties were awarded for violations occurring from 1998 until January 24, 2004 (three years prior to the tolling agreement). Under these facts, it was error to award the State civil penalties for violations in connection with the labeling claim outside the statute of limitations.

Janssen thus concludes that this \"federal claim\" is preempted and may not be maintained. Because Janssen's argument is based on a false premise, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   It is true that the State pursued a SCUTPA claim based on the November 2003 DDL. It is also true that the State introduced the April 2004 DDMAC warning letter as evidence in support of its DDL claim. It is not true that the sole evidence establishing the false and misleading nature of the DDL comes from the subsequent April 2004 DDMAC warning letter. Janssen not only views the DDL claim myopically, but conflates the concepts of evidence and claims. There was substantial additional evidence relating to the deception surrounding the November 2003 DDL, much of which is noted above. For example, the State presented evidence that, scientific proof to the contrary, Janssen's Risperdal sales strategy specifically sought to differentiate Risperdal from competing drugs by emphasizing that Risperdal caused less weight gain relative to other atypical antipsychotics such as Zyprexa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Moreover, the State presented internal emails between Janssen executives, one of which included discussion of Janssen's desire to gain market share over competitors by avoiding being subjected to a class labeling requirement as to diabetes /hyperglycemia. Yet another email indicated that at least one Janssen scientist supported glucose screening and monitoring for Risperdal patients, but that such a position was \"not the company line.\" Janssen's broad, aggressive, and deceptive marketing strategy resulted in the discrete DDL claim. In short, the record is replete with evidence beyond the 2004 DDMAC warning letter to support the State's DDL claim. Further, at the end of trial, the jury was charged with determining several factual issues, each of which was based solely on the provisions of SCUTPA, and the trial judge\n   assessed penalties under SCUTPA framework. Accordingly, we find\n   that the State's SCUTPA claim concerning the DDL is not preempted by the FDCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    Implied Conflict Preemption of the Labeling Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Janssen argues that the State's labeling claim is barred by implied conflict preemption. Janssen failed to raise the doctrine of implied conflict preemption in its motion for summary judgment or its initial directed verdict motion at the close of the State's case-in-chief. Accordingly, this argument was waived because it was not asserted in Janssen's initial motion for directed verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freeman v.

Before the trial court, Janssen moved for a directed verdict, arguing that the\n   <em>\n    Wyeth\n   </em>\n   \"exception to preemption\" did not apply since the State failed to establish that Janssen could have, and should have, updated the Risperdal label without prior FDA approval. Given this purported failure of proof, Janssen argued that the State's labeling claim was preempted. The trial court rejected Janssen's argument and found that\n   <em>\n    Wyeth\n   </em>\n   was controlling. In contrast, Janssen now argues that the State's SCUTPA claims sought to impose labeling requirements different from those required by the FDA, and thus, according to Janssen, the doctrine of implied conflict preemption bars the State's claims. This argument, however, is not preserved for appellate review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dunbar,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"623738\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/356/138/#p142\">\n    356 S.C. at 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"623738\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/356/138/#p142\">\n    587 S.E.2d at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A party may not argue one ground at trial and an alternate ground on appeal.\" (citing\n   <em>\n    Prioleau,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"656663\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/345/404/#p411\">\n    345 S.C. at 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"656663\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/345/404/#p411\">\n    548 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   216 ;\n   <em>\n    Benton,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"147870\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/338/151/#p157\">\n    338 S.C. at 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"147870\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/338/151/#p157\">\n    526 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   231 )).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Nonetheless, even were we to find Janssen's argument not to be procedurally barred, we would find it is without merit. Janssen suggests that the State sought to impose labeling requirements different than those imposed by the FDA. The State's claim, however, did not seek to penalize Janssen for distributing its FDA-approved label. Rather, the State sought civil penalties based on Janssen's actions in failing to discharge its ongoing, affirmative duty to keep its label updated and ensure \"that its warnings remain adequate as long as the drug is on the market.\"\n   <em>\n    Wyeth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p566\">\n    555 U.S. at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p566\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20201.80\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.80\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2049605\">\n    73 Fed.

We agree with Janssen in part. There are certain factors common to the labeling and DDL claims. First, Janssen's deceit was substantial. In order to maintain its market share, Janssen's furtive efforts to mislead prescribing physicians about the risks and side effects associated with Risperdal were reprehensible and in callous disregard for the health and welfare\n   of the public. Janssen's desire for market share and increased sales\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   knew no bounds, leading to its egregious violation of South Carolina law, particularly in connection with the DDL. Janssen's conduct is irrefutably linked to its longstanding efforts to conceal the truth regarding Risperdal. This corrupt corporate culture through the years was a factor, and understandably so, in the trial court's imposition of such a substantial penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   We agree in part with Janssen that its conduct likely had little impact on the community of prescribing physicians. The\n   truth about the risks associated with atypical antipsychotics was well known, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry. This begs the question of why Janssen would go to such lengths to perpetuate and defend a lie. Whatever the answer, the point remains that Janssen did go to such lengths. Yet, the absence of significant actual harm resulting from Janssen's deceptive conduct leads us to conclude the trial court erred in part in its penalty assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    Violations and Reduced Civil Penalty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    Labeling Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The trial court assessed a $300 civil penalty against Janssen for each Risperdal \"sample box\" distributed to South Carolina prescribers from 1998 through the date of the Complaint, April 23, 2007, for a total of 509,499 violations. As discussed, we reverse the civil penalties awarded for conduct that occurred prior to January 24, 2004, for that part of the State's labeling claim is barred by the statute of limitations. Based on the record, during the period of time from February 2004 until the filing of the Complaint in April 2007, Janssen made 20,575 visits to prescribing physicians in South Carolina and distributed 228,447 sample boxes containing deceptive labeling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Janssen challenges the penalty award of $300 per sample box on numerous grounds, including the argument that the penalty is excessive. We agree and find the $300 penalty per sample box excessive. Based on the totality of the circumstances and consideration of the\n   <em>\n    Reader's Digest\n   </em>\n   factors, we remit the penalty to $100 per sample box, for a civil penalty of $22,844,700.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    DDL Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Janssen mailed 7,184 DDLs to South Carolina physicians in November 2003. The trial court considered each letter a separate violation and imposed a penalty of $4,000 per letter,\n   for a penalty of $28,736,000. In addition, the trial court counted each follow-up sales call to the DDL by a Janssen representative as a separate violation. There were 36,372 follow-up sales calls. The trial court again assessed a penalty of $4,000 for each sales call, for a penalty of $145,488,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Janssen challenges the penalty award on numerous grounds, including excessiveness. While the question presented is close, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in assessing the $28,736,000 penalty associated with the 7,184 DDLs. A $4,000 penalty per each DDL is indeed substantial. But Janssen's deceit, as described above, was also substantial. The DDL was especially egregious, for it represented not mere nondisclosure but a corporately sanctioned decision to affirmatively lie and an attempt to mislead the medical community. We affirm the civil penalty of $28,736,000 penalty associated with the 7,184 DDLs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Janssen's misconduct in the more than 36,000 follow-up visits may be similarly viewed, for the follow-up visits were designed to continue the false DDL narrative. Nevertheless, a penalty of $4,000 per follow-up visit is excessive as a matter of law under the circumstances. We find in most instances, these were follow-up calls to the same prescribing physicians who received the DDL in the mail. In fact, in many instances there were multiple calls to the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   physicians. We remit the penalty to $2,000 per follow-up sales call, for a penalty of $72,744,000. When\n   combined with the penalty for the DDL mailing, the total penalty assessed against Janssen for the DDL claim is $101,480,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The combined civil penalty for the labeling and DDL claims is $124,324,700.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <strong>\n    Constitutionality of the Penalty Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Janssen also raises a number of constitutional challenges to the trial court's penalty order. First, Janssen claims that the $327 million penalty violates the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article 1, Section 15 of the South Carolina Constitution. Second, Janssen claims that the penalty award violates due process because\n   it is grossly excessive. We analyze this argument on the basis of the remitted penalty of approximately $124 million. We find no constitutional violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   \"The touchstone of the constitutional inquiry under the Excessive Fines Clause [of the U.S. Constitution] is the principle of proportionality: The amount of the forfeiture must bear some relationship to the gravity of the offense that it is designed to punish.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, the penalty award is not grossly disproportionate to Janssen's pattern of unfair and deceptive behavior, and, thus, we hold that the award does not violate the Excessive\n   Fines Clause of the South Carolina or the United States Constitution.

We decline to set forth a bright-line rule or ratio to delineate what level of penalties are appropriate, instead undertaking a case-by-case determination based on the severity of the underlying conduct. While the\n   penalty award against Janssen is quite large, the penalty must be analyzed in context in view of the clear legislative intent of SCUTPA to deter unfair and deceptive behavior in the conduct of trade and commerce in South Carolina. When all factors are considered, we find that the penalty award does not violate the Due Process Clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   And finally, we comment on the amicus curiae brief filed by the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber seeks clarity from this Court to provide a predictable and favorable business climate in this state. The Chamber is especially distressed by the $327 million penalty, which it\n   views as excessive and as \"overt hostility toward business.\" While we agree the penalty awarded by the trial court was excessive, the Chamber's additional concerns are based on a series of false premises. The Chamber posits that Janssen's conduct is being \"judged according to subjective, intangible standards.\" More to the point, the implication is that South Carolina stands alone in arbitrarily singling-out Janssen for what amounts to nothing more than an aggressive marketing strategy. That is simply not the case. Because of its deceptive conduct in the marketing of Risperdal, Janssen has been the subject of litigation throughout the country. Indeed, the deceptive marketing that gave rise to this action also formed the basis of federal civil and criminal claims against Janssen and its parent company for, among other things, making \"false statements about the safety and efficacy of Risperdal.\" The federal litigation has thus far resulted in agreed upon penalties in excess of $2 billion. When viewed objectively based on the jury verdict, Janssen over the course of many years consciously engaged in lies and deception in the marketing of Risperdal. Thus, the suggestion that the Attorney General of South Carolina stands alone in pursuing amorphous and subjective claims against Janssen is without merit. Moreover, the argument that today's decision will impermissibly chill business in South Carolina must likewise be rejected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FTC v.

Moreover, Dr. Haas acknowledged that despite Janssen's awareness of the heightened reproductive risks Risperdal posed to children and adolescents, no warnings or information about those concerns appeared on the Risperdal label because the FDA had not approved Risperdal for use in patients under the age of eighteen.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    Trial 113 showed Risperdal was significantly more likely than Zyprexa to result in increased prolactin levels.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    This agency is now known as the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    Dear Health Care Provider, which is another term for a Dear Doctor Letter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-209\">\n    To be sure, prior versions of the Risperdal label mentioned the risk of \"cerebrovascular adverse events\" in elderly patients, increased prolactin levels, and hyperprolactinemia; however, Janssen's categorization of those risks on the label underrepresented and minimized the frequency and severity of the risks associated with Risperdal.

Given that this is our first opportunity to address the appropriate factors for assessing a civil penalty in an Attorney General directed claim under SCUTPA, we direct that, prospectively, the following list of non-exclusive factors be used in assessing civil penalties under SCUTPA: (1) the degree of culpability and good or bad faith of the defendant; (2) the duration of the defendant's unlawful conduct; (3) active concealment of information by the defendant; (4) defendant's awareness of the unfair or deceptive nature of their conduct; (5) prior similar conduct by the defendant; (6) the defendant's ability to pay; (7) the deterrence value of the assessed penalties; and (8) the actual impact or injury to the public resulting from defendant's unlawful conduct.

In submitting supplemental authority to the Court concerning the amount of the penalty, Janssen notes that the \"Arkansas matter\" was settled \"for $7.75 million\" and \"an average of $4.89 million settlement per state [was] reached in the multi-state settlement announced by the Texas Attorney General.\" We have considered Janssen's understandable settlement of many state court claims, but we decline to rely on average settlements as dispositive, especially when we are constrained by an abuse of discretion standard of review.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-185\">\n   Justice PLEICONES, dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   With great respect for the majority's thorough treatment of these complex issues, I dissent from those portions of its opinion addressing: (1) the timeliness of the labeling claim; and (2) the reduction of the DDL penalty award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   I agree the Attorney General knew or should have known prior to January 24, 2004 that he may have had a SCUTPA claim against Janssen based, in part, on research indicating\n   Janssen's Risperdal label misled consumers insofar as it failed to disclose the drug's side effects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kreutner v. David,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1126178\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/320/283/#p285\">\n    320 S.C. 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 285-86,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1126178\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/320/283/#p285\">\n    465 S.E.2d 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 90 (1995) (discussing the discovery rule for purposes of triggering the limitations period and finding that where the evidence is overwhelming a reasonable person should have known she might have a claim at a time beyond the statute of limitations, then such claim is time-barred). I therefore agree with the majority's conclusion that the Attorney General's SCUTPA claim for labeling violations occurring before January 24, 2004 was time-barred, and that the trial judge erred in holding equitable tolling removed the bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   My disagreement is with the majority's application of the continuous accrual doctrine. I would not apply the doctrine in this appeal because doing so does not affirm the statute of limitations ruling to the extent the trial judge found the pre-January 24, 2004 labeling claim timely and permitted that claim to go to the jury. In my opinion, we may invoke our authority to affirm on any ground appearing in the record only when the result is to affirm the trial judge's ruling in toto.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 220(c), SCACR. Here, the effect of applying the continuous accrual doctrine is only a partial affirmance. Further, we have no way of knowing whether the jury's liability determination was based on conduct outside the limitations period since we cannot know whether this jury would have found a SCUTPA violation had it considered only Janssen's labeling conduct after January 24, 2004. I do not agree that reducing the amount of the penalty for the labeling claim cures the prejudice to Janssen given the unreliability of the jury's liability determination. Thus, I respectfully submit we should not apply the continuous accrual doctrine\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   in this appeal as doing so prejudices Janssen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Accordingly, I would reverse the jury's finding of liability because the labeling claim is barred by the statute of limitations. I would also reverse the trial judge's labeling claim penalty because the claim is untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   <strong>\n    DDL Penalty Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   As for the reduction of the DDL penalty award, I would find the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in awarding $174,224,000 based on Janssen mailing 7,184 deceptive DDLs and following up with 36,372 sales calls to sanction the deception already perpetrated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

As for Janssen's contention that the follow-up sales calls were made to the same prescribing physicians who had already received the DDL, I would find the trial judge properly considered this argument and exercised his discretion in finding Janssen's culpability (\n   <em>\n    Reader's Digest\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Factor 2) outweighed the actual impact or injury resulting from Janssen's unlawful conduct (\n   <em>\n    Reader's Digest\n   </em>\n   Factor 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Ultimately, the trial judge was in the best position to evaluate Janssen's conduct, the degree of culpability, the duration of Janssen's conduct, Janssen's active concealment of Risperdal's side effects to South Carolina health care providers, Janssen's awareness of its deceptive conduct, Janssen's ability to pay, and the actual impact, if any, resulting from Janssen's deceptive conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reader's Digest Ass'n,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1185535\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/662/955/#p967\">\n    662 F.2d at 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on the trial judge's articulation of the\n   <em>\n    Reader's Digest\n   </em>\n   factors and his proper consideration of those factors, I would find Janssen has not shown the court abused its discretion in awarding a $174,224,000 civil penalty for the DDL claim, an amount within the limits set forth in SCUTPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wallace v.
