BERNARD GOODWYN.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this appeal, we consider whether the circuit court erred in denying a demurrer and holding that letters written to an attorney and a beneficiary did not violate a trust's no contest clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Dimitri B. Georgiadis (Dimitri) established a revocable trust on December 21, 1989 that designated his new wife, Margaret Georgiadis (Margaret), and his only children, two sons from a previous marriage, Paul Georgiadis (Paul) and Basil Georgiadis (Basil) (collectively, the sons), as beneficiaries. The sons were named co-trustees of that trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 27, 2012, Dimitri amended and restated the trust (August trust). The August trust removed the sons as co-trustees and appointed Dimitri as the trustee with Celia Rafalko (Rafalko or trustee) as the successor trustee after his death. Further, the August trust eliminated the previously required distribution to the sons upon Dimitri's death. Instead, Margaret was made the income beneficiary of those funds, thus deferring any distribution to the sons or other descendants until after Margaret's death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The sons complained to Dimitri about the changes to the trust and they exchanged several emails. The sons expressed their displeasure with their father not providing for them or their families during Margaret's lifetime. They also questioned the appointment of Celia Rafalko, whom they believed to be a close friend of their stepmother, as the contingent trustee of the trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dimitri died on December 3, 2012. Paul wrote a letter dated January 3, 2013 to Timothy H. Guare (Guare), the attorney who drafted the August trust, asking him to preserve documents relating to Dimitri's estate plan, and stating that \"the testamentary documents purportedly executed in your office on or about August 27, 2012 by my father shortly before his death will be the subject of a contest.\" On January 4, 2013, Paul wrote a letter to Margaret asking her to agree with the sons to terminate the August trust and distribute its assets with one-third going to her and one-third to each of the sons, claiming it would be in their mutual best interests to do so. The letter also warned that \"[s]hould we be forced to contest the August 27, 2012 will and trust and file suit to set them aside,\" Basil and Paul would assert that there was undue influence upon Dimitri and challenge Dimitri's testamentary capacity when the changes were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Soon after Paul had sent the letters to Guare and Margaret, Paul and Basil received separate letters from Rafalko, sent pursuant to Code \u00a7 64.2-775, which provided a copy of Dimitri's will and trust. Unbeknownst to the sons, the testamentary documents executed by Dimitri on August 27, 2012 had been superseded; Dimitri amended, ratified and reconfirmed the August trust on September 21, 2012\n   (September trust). The September amendments added a provision allowing the trustee to distribute the trust assets to a charity of his or her choosing if Margaret and Dimitri died and no beneficiaries remained. Further, the September amendments added Article VII(L), which provided as follows in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   L.\n   <em>\n    No Contest Clause and Release of Claims.\n   </em>\n   I intend to eliminate the possibility that any beneficiary of mine will challenge the decisions that I have made concerning the disposition of my assets during my lifetime or at my death, and my Trustee shall take all appropriate steps to carry out this intent. Accordingly, I direct the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1. Absent proof of fraud, dishonesty, or bad faith on the part of my Trustee, if any beneficiary or potential beneficiary under this trust agreement shall directly or indirectly, by legal proceedings or otherwise, challenge or contest this trust agreement or any of its provisions, or shall attempt in any way to interfere with the administration of this trust according to its express terms, any provision I have made in this trust agreement for the benefit of such beneficiary shall be revoked and the property that is the subject of such provision shall be disposed of as if that contesting beneficiary and all of his or her descendants had predeceased me. Absent proof of fraud, dishonesty, or bad faith on the part of my Trustee, the decision of my Trustee that a beneficiary or potential beneficiary is not qualified to take a share of the trust assets under this provision shall be final.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   2. My Trustee shall obtain from each then living adult child and adult grandchild of mine a written release of any and all legal claims that such child or grandchild might make against the personal representative of my estate, my Trustee, any person who acted as my attorney-in-fact under a power of attorney executed by me, or any beneficiary under this trust agreement, relating to the conduct of any financial affairs prior to my death\n   and the disposition of assets passing pursuant to my will, this trust agreement, any beneficiary designation that I may have executed during my lifetime, or my decision to cause assets to be titled in joint names with rights of survivorship with myself and another individual as joint owners.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 7, 2013, Basil sent a letter to Margaret disavowing himself from the January 4 letter written by his brother. Neither Basil nor Paul were aware of the September amendments to the trust until after Paul had sent the letters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In a letter dated January 31, 2013, Rafalko informed the sons that she was considering whether the letters sent by Paul violated the no contest clause and asked them for any information \"you believe might bear on my decision,\" in writing on or before February 15, 2013. As required by the September trust, she also sent releases to be signed by the sons. She gave them thirty days to execute and return the releases. Rafalko acknowledges receiving the releases, which were signed on February 19, 2013 by both sons, and by which they released all claims concerning any challenge to the will or the trust or to their administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In providing information solicited by Rafalko, Paul's counsel informed her counsel that Paul was unaware of the no contest clause when he wrote the letters, would not be challenging or interfering with the administration of the trust in any way and that the \"clear import\" of the January 4 letter was \"to introduce the concept of a non-judicial settlement agreement,\" expressly authorized by statute. He also claimed that the specter raised concerning challenging the August trust was at most a threat which did not constitute a challenge, contest or interference with the administration of the September trust. However, her counsel noted in his memorandum that he had been told that if Rafalko decided that Paul had violated the no contest clause, Rafalko would \"be in for a dog fight.\" Basil's explanation admitted that he \"was aware of Paul's January 4 letter when he wrote it, but thereafter immediately disavowed it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In a letter dated May 28, 2013, Rafalko notified the sons that she had decided that the letters sent by Paul violated the no contest provision. Rafalko stated: \"I have concluded that both of you have violated the No Contest Provision of the Trust. Therefore, neither of you is qualified to take a share of the Trust assets, and the descendants of each of you are also barred from taking a share of the Trust assets.\" Rafalko attached a memorandum drafted by her attorney. The memorandum concluded that the letters written by Paul were \"an attempt\" to \"interfere\" with the administration of the trust \"according to its express terms,\" which justified disqualifying Dimitri's descendants as beneficiaries\n   to the trust and that ignorance of the \"no contest\" clause was irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On June 24, 2013, the sons filed suit in the Henrico County Circuit Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the sons' conduct did not trigger the no contest clause and that they and their descendants are rightful beneficiaries of the trust. They alleged that Rafalko's interpretation of the no contest clause was arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law and public policy, and contrary to Dimitri's intent. They also argued that neither of them had taken any legal steps to contest the trust or interfere with its administration and that the letters they sent to Guare and Margaret did not violate the terms of the no contest clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Rafalko demurred, arguing that the sons failed to allege that her decision was a product of bad faith, dishonesty or fraud and to plead any facts supporting a finding of bad faith, dishonesty or fraud. In response, the sons argued that Virginia law provided the court authority to review Rafalko's decision to ensure she was abiding by the terms of the trust even if she was not acting in bad faith. Alternatively, the sons argued that they had alleged in their complaint that Rafalko's decision was arbitrary and capricious, and that this allegation was enough to allege bad faith. The circuit court overruled the demurrer, finding that the complaint alleged that Rafalko did not act in conformity with the trust language, so there were sufficient grounds alleged for the action to go forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After hearing evidence, upon trial of the matter, the circuit court issued a letter opinion that construed the no contest provision. The circuit court ruled that the language of the no contest clause limited its applicability to challenges directed at the September 21, 2012 trust documents. The circuit court ruled that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [t]he use of the word \"\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   \" instead [of] words such as \"any prior agreement\" or\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   agreement or specifically mentioning all agreements must result in the conclusion that Mr. Georgiadis intended to require forfeiture if any of the acts described were aimed at\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   agreement, dated September 21, 2012. The letters in question specifically addressed the August 27, 2012 trust and did not address the trust with the added provisions of September 21, 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Emphasis in original.) It interpreted the no contest clause language \"this trust agreement,\" to mean the testamentary trust agreement documents executed on September 21, 2012 and not the ones executed in August or earlier. Therefore, the circuit court concluded any acts that would cause forfeiture had to be directed at the trust as it existed after the addition of the September amendments for the no contest clause to be applicable. The court found that the sons did not violate the no contest clause because their letters specifically addressed the August 27, 2012 trust documents and did not challenge the execution or operation of the September trust. Therefore, \"no acts were done that would allow the trustee to enforce\" the no contest provision added on September 21, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Rafalko filed a motion for reconsideration, claiming that the circuit court had based its decision on a misquotation of the no contest clause because it inserted the word \"agreement\" after trust in its rendition of the no contest clause. Further, Rafalko argued that the sons presented no evidence that she had acted fraudulently, dishonestly or in bad faith, so her decision could not be overturned. She specifically asked the circuit court to address whether or not it found bad faith. In response, at the hearing on the motion to reconsider, the circuit court found that Rafalko had acted in bad faith. It also affirmed its previous decision. The circuit court entered a final order holding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   a. That Paul D. Georgiadis and Basil D. Georgiadis, have not at any time prior to the date of this Order, engaged in any action violative of the provisions of Article VII(L)(1) of the Dimitri B. Georgiadis Trust dated August 27, 2012, as amended (\"the Trust\"); [and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   b. That the determination made by Celia A. Rafalko, Trustee, as memorialized in her letter dated May 28, 2013 and the enclosed memorandum of law, that Paul D. Georgiadis and Basil D. Georgiadis had violated the provisions of Article VII(L)(1) of the Trust was made in bad faith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It ruled that the sons and their respective descendants are the rightful remainder beneficiaries of the trust. The court awarded the sons their attorney's fees and costs pursuant to Code \u00a7 64.2-795. Rafalko filed an appeal in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Rafalko's assignments of error are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   1. The trial court erred in overruling the Trustee's demurrer because the [sons'] Complaint failed to allege that the Trustee acted fraudulently, dishonestly, or in bad faith when she determined that the [sons] were disqualified as trust beneficiaries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   2. The trial court erred in finding that the Trustee's decision disqualifying the [sons] was made in bad faith, where the [sons] failed to adduce any evidence that the Trustee acted fraudulently, dishonestly, or in bad faith or abused her discretion in any way and the evidence was uncontroverted that the Trustee acted in good faith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   3. The trial court erred in finding that the [sons'] conduct of writing threatening letters to the Trustee's lawyer and the Trust's Income Beneficiary, for the admitted purpose of convincing the Income Beneficiary to agree with them to terminate the Trust and distribute its assets in contravention of the Trust's dispositive plan, was not an \"attempt to interfere with the administration of this trust according to its express terms\" that disqualified the [sons] from any interest in the Trust.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   4. Because the [sons] had violated the provisions of the Trust and were properly disqualified by the Trustee, the trial court erred in awarding the [sons] their attorney's fees and costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Initially, we note that there is no dispute in this case over whether, even though perhaps not favored, a \"no contest\" clause can be enforced. No contest clauses in trusts that are part of a testamentary estate plan are given full effect, as they are in wills.\n   <em>\n    Keener v.

We shall examine each of the appellant's assignments of error in order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Assignment of Error 1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In her first assignment of error, Rafalko asserts that the circuit court erred when it overruled her demurrer because the complaint \"failed to allege that the Trustee acted fraudulently, dishonestly or in bad faith when she determined that the sons were disqualified as trust beneficiaries.\" Rafalko notes that the trust states that a trustee's decision is final unless there is a showing of \"fraud, dishonesty, or bad faith\" on the part of the trustee. She argues that the circuit court erred in overruling her demurrer because the sons' complaint did not allege that she acted fraudulently, dishonestly or in bad faith when she decided that the sons violated the no contest clause and were disqualified as beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The sons argue that the court did not err in overruling Rafalko's demurrer. They assert that while the trustee had discretion to remove the sons as beneficiaries to the trust, she was not allowed to act arbitrarily and capriciously in exercising that discretion. In the complaint, they alleged that Rafalko's decision that they had violated the no contest clause \" 'relied upon an interpretation of the\n   terms of the No Contest Clause that is arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, contrary to the clearly expressed intent of the Grantor,' and 'in violation of the public policy of the Commonwealth of Virginia.' \"\n   We review a circuit court's decision on demurrer de novo.\n   <em>\n    Ayers v.

In other words, it alleged that her decision was without authority because it was contrary to the purposes of the trust and an abuse of the discretion she was afforded under the terms of the trust. Thus, judicial review of the trustee's exercise of discretion is allowed pursuant to Virginia jurisprudence and Code \u00a7 64.2-703(B)(2) to discern whether the trustee has abused the discretion vested in her by the trust or acted arbitrarily.

In direct response to Rafalko's inquiry about the issue, the circuit court ruled that Rafalko had acted in bad faith. Subsequently, the final order also contained the holding that the trustee's decision was made in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The assignment of error presented by Rafalko challenging the circuit court's finding of bad faith by its terms raises a sufficiency of evidence challenge.

Webster's Third New International Dictionary 978 (1993); Black's Law Dictionary 808 (10th ed.2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In this particular instance, Paul wrote a letter to the lawyer who drafted the August trust instrument, asking him to preserve documentation because he was considering contesting the August testamentary documents. He also wrote a letter to his stepmother, asking her to consider terminating the August trust and insinuated that if she did not agree with that, he and Basil would contest the August trust documents. Both letters were sent before the sons knew that the August trust documents had been superseded by the September trust which added the no contest provision and other changes to the August trust documents which made it legally impossible for the sons and their stepmother to agree to terminate the trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Upon learning of the no contest provision and other amendments to the trust executed in September, within three days of the\n   January 4 letter being sent, Basil completely disavowed the January 4 letter. By the end of February, both sons had signed releases agreeing not to contest the will or trust or interfere with the trustee's administration of the trust in any way. Over three months later, Rafalko concluded that the letters written by Paul were an attempt to interfere with her administration of the trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The stated purpose of Article L, which included the no contest clause and a provision for releases to be sent to the beneficiaries, was to \"eliminate the possibility that a beneficiary would challenge the Trust.\" Upon notification of the existence of Article L and upon being presented with the releases required to be sent to them, the sons expressed their desire not to challenge the trust in any way and executed the releases. After the releases were signed, the intent of the no contest and release clauses was accomplished. The possibility that the beneficiaries would challenge the trust had been eliminated without litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   However, the trustee thereafter used the trust proceeds to spend three months collecting information and consulting attorneys and others concerning whether the actions taken by the sons, before they knew of the no contest clause, could possibly be considered a challenge to the trust or an attempt to interfere with the administration of the trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   At trial, Rafalko offered into evidence several emails showing exchanges between the sons and their father after the sons found out that they would no longer be receiving a distribution from the trust upon their father's death. The emails say unflattering things about Dimitri, Margaret and Rafalko, including an accusation that Dimitri believed impugned Rafalko's honesty. Rafalko argued that the sons were \"horrible people\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   even though neither the emails nor the sons' behavior toward their father was relevant to whether the no contest clause had been violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Rafalko admitted that the named beneficiaries stood to gain nothing by her pursuing whether the letters violated the no contest clause, after the sons had signed releases of all claims and the stated purpose of Article L had been accomplished. Also, Rafalko had been told that declaring the sons in violation of the no contest clause based upon the January letters would result in a legal \"dogfight\" that would no doubt cost the estate some expense. Additionally, it was revealed through evidence at trial that if the\n   sons were eliminated as beneficiaries, the remainder of the trust would be left for distribution at Rafalko's discretion pursuant to the terms of the trust. There is sufficient evidence upon which a court could determine that Rafalko's decision to find the sons in violation of the no contest provision was not motivated by a desire to carry out the testator's intent or to protect the beneficiaries and was therefore done in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Even if there was no evidence to support the circuit court's finding of bad faith, this assignment of error does not require reversal. As explained above, the circuit court's decision was grounded on its determination that the letters sent by the sons to Margaret and Dimitri's attorney concerned the trust as it existed on August 27, 2012. In its letter opinion, the circuit court, construing the no contest provision narrowly, clearly stated that the no contest provision which prohibited interference with \"\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   trust agreement and any provisions made in\n   <em>\n    'this\n   </em>\n   trust agreement,' \" meant that the applicability of the no contest clause was restricted to challenges directed to the September trust documents. (Emphasis in original.) Accordingly, the circuit court concluded that \"[t]here was no prohibition against challenging any prior agreement or\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   trust agreement as written in 1989 or August 27, 2012.\" (Emphasis added.) This was the reason for the circuit court's determination that the sons' actions did not violate the no contest provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Rafalko's second assignment of error does not challenge the operative holding of the circuit court-that the sons' actions did not amount to a contest because the no contest provision only applied to challenges aimed at the testamentary documents in place on September 21, 2012. At best, the finding of bad faith by the circuit court was an alternative or additional ground for the circuit court entering judgment in favor of the sons, in addition to the trustee acting arbitrarily or abusing her discretion by misapplying the terms of the trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In summary, we reject Rafalko's second assignment of error because the record supports the circuit court's determination of bad faith. We also reject this assignment of error because there is no challenge to the primary holding by the circuit court that the no contest provision contained in the September 2012 testamentary document applied only to challenges directed against that document and that the sons' actions were directed only to the August\n   2012 testamentary document, and therefore there was no interference with or contest to the September 2012 testamentary document. This alternative ground remains an independent ground for the circuit court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Assignment of Error 3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In her third assignment of error, Rafalko claims that the circuit court erred in holding that the sons' letters, written \"for the admitted purpose\" to convince Margaret to agree to \"terminate the trust and distribute its assets in contravention of the Trust's dispositive plan, was not an 'attempt to interfere with the administration of this trust according to its express terms' that disqualified the sons from any interest in the trust.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The holding of the circuit court was that the actions of the sons were specifically directed to the August 2012 testamentary documents and the no contest provision only applied to challenges directed to the testamentary documents existing as of September 2012. Accordingly, this assignment of error, like the previous assignment of error, does not address the circuit court's construction of the no contest clause, which formed the basis of its conclusion that the no contest clause was not violated. Failure to assign error to the substantive ruling of the circuit court\n   precludes consideration of whether that ruling was correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Nevertheless, considering the trustee's arguments does not dictate a different result. \"The question whether a no-contest clause in a [trust] has been triggered presents, on appellate review, a mixed question of law and fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Keener,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=278%20Va.%20435\">\n    278 Va. at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=682%20S.E.2d%20545\">\n    682 S.E.2d at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Construing this clause narrowly, as we must, it only prohibits actual attempts to interfere with the administration of the trust. Proposing actions whose goal, if accomplished, may interfere with the administration of the trust is not prohibited. Evidence that the sons \"cherished a desire\" to terminate the trust is not \"sufficient to bring them under the ban of this clause.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Puller v.

They include: dividing Dimitri's assets into the marital and family trusts; distributing income; paying debts; making productive use of Dimitri's property; allocating assets in the best interests of the beneficiaries; and dividing property into equal shares for distribution to Dimitri's descendants. Dimitri also incorporated by reference the numerous powers set forth in Code \u00a7 64.2-105.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   These are the \"express terms\" of the trust regarding its administration that Dimitri wanted free from interference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The sons took no action that can be characterized as an attempt to interfere with the administration of the trust. Neither\n   letter sent by the sons implicate any of the trustee's powers of administration or affect her ability to exercise those powers. First, as the sons alleged in their complaint, neither letter was sent to the trustee herself. One was sent to a fellow beneficiary, Margaret, and the other was sent to Dimitri's former attorney who prepared the trust documents. The trustee fails to explain how words stated to third parties about a previous version of the trust could interfere with her administration of the trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Moreover, neither letter necessitated any action by the trustee, affected the trust's administration, or even attempted to do so. In their letter to their stepmother, the sons expressed their discontent with the terms of the trust and indicated their interest in a\n   non-judicial settlement pursuant to Code \u00a7 64.2-709. Regardless of whether the ultimate realization of their proposal could ever interfere with the administration of the trust, the sons did not pursue this matter further.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In the letter to Guare, the sons merely instructed him to retain relevant documents because a legal contest was likely. Again, this action had no effect whatsoever on the trustee's administration of the trust \"according to its express terms.\" Telling Dimitri's former lawyer to retain documents did not interfere, or attempt to interfere, with any of the trustee's powers of administration as set forth in the trust and Code \u00a7 64.2-105. The letter accomplished nothing more than the preservation of evidence at a time when the sons were evaluating their rights and remedies respecting their father's estate. When the sons learned of the no contest clause, the provision had its intended prophylactic effect and the sons committed no further action in preparation for a contest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lavine v.

A court must ensure that the trustee remains true to the intent of the testator as those intentions are expressed in the text of the trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Accordingly, the record supports a conclusion that the letters at issue did not interfere with the trustee's administration of the trust, and should not have resulted in the disqualification of the sons as beneficiaries. Additionally, the assignment of error does not address the holding of the circuit court that the no contest clause only applies to challenges directed at the September 21, 2012 trust documents.

We also affirm the circuit court's judgment that Paul D. Georgiadis and Basil D. Georgiadis and their respective descendants are rightful beneficiaries of the trust, subject to all provisions of the trust, because no assignment of error challenged the circuit court's holding that the no contest clause in the September 2012 testamentary documents only prohibited challenges directed to those testamentary documents, and therefore there is an unchallenged alternative basis for the circuit court's judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we also affirm the circuit court's judgment awarding the sons' attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of $45,977.58.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, even considering the second and third assignments of error, we conclude that the record supports the circuit court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    According to Rafalko, under the terms of the 1989 Trust, prior to the August 27, 2012 amendment, the sons would have received a distribution of approximately five million dollars upon the death of their father.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    The circuit court attributed the letters to both Paul and Basil despite the fact that Paul authored both letters.

Thus, it appears that a court can always review a trustee's decision if the court believes it is in the best interest of justice. However, the circuit court in this case based its decision on the fact that it believed the sons alleged that Rafalko did not act in conformity with the trust language and made no finding regarding whether justice demanded it to act.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    The trust identifies Code \u00a7 64.1-57, the predecessor to Code \u00a7 64.2-105.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    Moreover, because the September amendment added a charitable contingent beneficiary, the stated goal of the letter was an impossibility, as the trustee noted in her decision memorandum.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Code \u00a7 64.2-709.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    In light of our holdings, we need not address the assignments of cross-error.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    The trustee assigned error to this award based only on the theory that the sons had violated the terms of the trust.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-79\">\n   Justice MIMS, dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   I disagree with the majority's conclusion that no assignment of error challenges the circuit court's ruling that the no-contest clause\n   applied only to the changes made in the September 2012 amendment. To the contrary, I believe the trustee presents that challenge in her third assignment of error. I also disagree with the majority's conclusion that the evidence supports the circuit court's\n   judgment that the trustee's decision to disqualify Paul and Basil Georgiadis (\"the sons\") for violating the no-contest clause was improper. Accordingly, I disagree with the majority's decision to affirm the circuit court's awarding attorney's fees to the sons. I therefore respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Initially, I must address the sons' assignment of cross-error in which they assert that the September 2012 amendment violates Code \u00a7\u00a7 64.2-703(B) and 64.2-777(B). This is a threshold issue because it broadens the scope of the circuit court's review of the trustee's decision. Article VII(L) of the trust agreement as amended by the September amendment provides that \"[a]bsent proof of fraud, dishonesty, or bad faith on the part of my Trustee, the decision of my Trustee that a beneficiary or potential beneficiary is not qualified to take a share of the trust assets [under the no-contest clause] shall be final.\" The parties agree that the plain language of this provision bars any challenge to a decision by the trustee to apply the clause to disqualify a beneficiary unless the challenge is based on one of the three specified grounds. However, the sons argue that this restriction is too narrow and is not permitted by the statutes. I agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   We review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.\n   <em>\n    Roop v. Whitt,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=289%20Va.%20274\">\n    289 Va. 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 278,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=768%20S.E.2d%20692\">\n    768 S.E.2d 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 694-95 (2015). The grantor of a trust in Virginia may not exempt a trustee from the fiduciary duties imposed by statute. Code \u00a7 64.2-777(B) expressly states that a trustee's exercise of power under a trust is subject to the statutory fiduciary duties. Those duties include administering the trust and investing its assets in good faith, Code \u00a7 64.2-763, so administration of the trust in bad faith is necessarily a breach of fiduciary duty. However, the statutory fiduciary duties are broader than mere bad faith or the two other grounds set forth in the trust agreement for challenging the trustee's decision to disqualify a beneficiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As an illustrative, non-exclusive example of these statutory fiduciary duties, Code \u00a7 64.2-765 imposes a duty of impartiality. Partiality cannot be simply a form of bad faith because that would\n   make Code \u00a7 64.2-765 duplicative of Code \u00a7 64.2-763. Such an interpretation violates our canons of construction.\n   <em>\n    Owens v. DRS Auto.

Yet the trust agreement does not appear to permit a beneficiary to challenge a trustee's decision that he or she is disqualified on the ground that such a decision was not impartial, or breached any other statutory fiduciary duty. To the extent that the trust agreement purports to restrict a beneficiary's ability to do so, the agreement is superseded by law. Code \u00a7 64.2-703(B)(11). Accordingly, the trust agreement may not limit the sons' ability to challenge the trustee's decision solely on the bases of fraud, dishonesty, or bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Turning to the trustee's assignments of error with this standard in mind, I note that she first asserts that the circuit court erred by overruling her demurrer to the sons' complaint because they did not allege any of the three grounds set forth in the trust agreement as the basis for challenging her decision to disqualify them.

As noted above, administering a trust in bad faith is a breach of fiduciary duty. Code \u00a7 64.2-763. But the record includes no evidence supporting such a finding, or that the trustee breached any other statutory fiduciary duty. The evidence indicated that the trustee had been a friend of the sons' father (the grantor) and step-mother and included letters and emails in which the sons disparaged their father, their step-mother, and the trustee. The trustee testified that these communications-or so many of them as the sons' father received while he lived-upset him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   However, these facts do not establish any breach of fiduciary duty by the trustee, nor do they support a reasonable inference of such a breach. To the contrary, the trustee testified that she sent the sons copies of the trust documents as quickly after their father's death as she could gather the documents, identify who was entitled to them, and make and send copies. She sent them on January 3, 2013, sooner than required by law. Code \u00a7 64.2-775(B). Coincidentally, that day, scarcely a month after his father's death, was the same day Paul mounted his assault on the trust by informing their father's attorney that it would be contested. The next day, Paul wrote his step-mother that the trust would be challenged if she did not agree to divide its assets equally between her and the sons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As soon as the trustee learned of Paul's letters, she met with counsel. She did not discuss the letters with the step-mother or ask\n   her opinion of whether the letters violated the no-contest clause. The trustee testified that her decision to disqualify the sons was based solely on Paul's letters and the legal advice of counsel. She expressly denied that her decision was tainted by her knowledge that the sons' communications had upset their father before he died. She testified that the decision was a difficult one for her because of its \"far reaching implications.\" Nevertheless, she believed it was not her place as trustee to determine whether the outcome was fair, but whether the trust agreement compelled it. Neither the trustee nor the step-mother benefited from the trustee's decision. While the trustee's counsel referred to the sons as \"horrible\" in closing argument, there is no indication that was the trustee's personal view of them, or even if it was, that she had formed that view before reaching her decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In considering whether the sons violated the no-contest clause, the trustee was required by law to make a neutral assessment of whether Paul's letters and the sons' actions constituted a \"direct[ ] or indirect[ ]\" \"challenge or contest\" to the trust agreement, \"by legal proceedings or otherwise.\" She bore a statutory burden of impartiality with regard to the sons and the contingent beneficiaries (who would share in the trust assets in their place if the sons violated the clause).

No such showing has been made in this case. The underlying question in this case is not whether the no-contest provision was violated. It is who gets to make that call. Absent egregious circumstances, the settlor of this trust intended his trustee-not the litigation machinery of the court system-to umpire this dispute.

At the time of his death, he had been married to his wife for 23 years. On January 3, 2013, Paul wrote to the attorney who had drafted the August 2012 restatement and who had served as the trustee's initial legal counsel, declaring that \"the testamentary documents purportedly executed in your office on or about August 27, 2012 by my late father\"-which replaced the sons as co-trustees with their father's financial advisor as successor trustee and increased their stepmother's ability to use the corpus of the trust during times of need-\"will be the subject of a contest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 293. He made this threat with the agreement of his brother, Basil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   A day after announcing that the trust \"will be the subject of a contest,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   Paul wrote a letter to his stepmother, at Basil's urging,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 233-34, attempting to persuade her to terminate the trust outright and to agree to the immediate conveyance of two thirds of the trust assets to him and his brother. The letter asked for her agreement to the sons' desire \"that the trust be set aside and dissolved.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 294. If she failed to capitulate, leaving the sons\n   \"forced to contest\" their father's trust and will, Paul warned his stepmother that she \"would lose a substantial share of [her] income,\" that Basil and he\n   \"would take the $5.1 million distribution,\" and that, upon her death, Basil and he \"would still take the remainder.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 295. Paul added that he would \"not belabor the legal issues of undue influence and lack of testamentary capacity,\" given that he and his brother would \"save [their] arguments for the Court and jury if needed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Paul gave his widowed stepmother ten days to respond in writing to his threats, \"[s]o that no one has to incur needless legal expenses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The attorney who drafted the September 2012 amendment retained the document in his office and did not provide it to the trustee until December 12, 2012. Upon her receipt of the document, the trustee promptly forwarded it to the sons. In response, legal counsel for Paul wrote the trustee's counsel stating that the sons were unaware of the no-contest provision and that, in any event, he did not believe that they had violated it. Paul merely wanted, counsel argued, \"to introduce the concept of a non-judicial settlement agreement\" for their stepmother's consideration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 304. Paul's counsel admitted that Paul's January 3, 2013 letter \"can be fairly said to be a threat\" but, counsel contended, it was \"nothing more.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 305.

The trustee's counsel investigated the matter and issued a lengthy legal memorandum opining that the sons had violated the no-contest provision of the trust. After seeking legal counsel from the amendment's drafting attorney, reviewing her independent counsel's legal opinion, and considering the arguments made by the sons and their counsel, the trustee informed the sons that she had made her own independent determination that, in fact, both of them had violated the no-contest provision of the trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The sons responded by filing suit to contest the trustee's determination. Their complaint characterized the September 2012 amendment as a \"revo[cation] by a subsequent will and trust\" rather than a mere amendment to the August 2012 restatement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   They argued that the trustee misinterpreted the no-contest provision in an \"arbitrary and capricious\" manner \"contrary to both the Grantor's intent as well as the laws and public policy of the Commonwealth of Virginia.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. They also contended that the no-contest provision, properly interpreted, only applies when the contestant initiates actual legal proceedings and does not apply as a matter of law to anything short of that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The trustee responded by demurrer, pointing out that the complaint failed to mention, much less take into account, that the no-contest provision expressly delegated the final determination to the trustee: \"Absent proof of fraud, dishonesty, or bad faith on the part of [the] Trustee,\" the clause emphasized, \"the decision of [the] Trustee that a beneficiary or potential beneficiary is not qualified to take a share of the trust assets under this provision shall be final.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66-68;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 299. Because the sons did not allege fraud, dishonesty, or bad faith, the trustee contended, her determination should be deemed final.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The trustee also addressed the sons' argument that nothing short of filing legal proceedings could violate the no-contest provision. By its own terms, she argued, the provision applied when any beneficiary shall \"directly\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   indirectly, by legal proceedings\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   otherwise, challenge\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   contest this trust agreement\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   any of its provisions,\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   shall attempt in any way to interfere with the administration of this trust according to its express terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67 (emphases added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 299.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In their opposition to the demurrer, the sons conceded that they did not plead fraud, dishonesty, or bad faith by the trustee. They said a \"specter of bad faith\" may be present, but they were not attempting to plead or prove bad faith because, to obtain a court order nullifying the trustee's determination, it was \"enough\" for them \"to simply establish that the Trustee 'got it wrong.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74. They \"were not required to establish bad faith,\" the sons reasoned, because the issue was merely \"whether the Trustee had properly\n   interpreted the Trust's terms.\" Appellees' Br. at 2-3. With respect to the disjunctive clauses of the no-contest provisions, the sons argued that the court should find them overly broad and thus unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   At the demurrer hearing, the sons' counsel contended that the trustee's argument \"entirely misses the point.\" J.A. at 147. \"We don't have to establish bad faith. We don't have to establish fraud [or] dishonesty,\" counsel contended.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 149. If the court disagrees with the trustee's interpretation of the no-contest provision, they argued, it may do so without any pleading or proof that the trustee acted in bad faith. Without elaboration, the court denied the demurrer and set the matter on the docket for a later bench trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   At trial, both sons testified. Neither accused the trustee of fraud, dishonesty, or bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 169-91 (testimony of Paul), 192-201 (testimony of Basil);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 232 (deposition transcript of Paul read into the record). They acknowledged the letters and emails sent to their father before his death and attempted to justify their displeasure with their father's trust and will. The trustee moved to strike the evidence \"on the grounds that they have not put on any evidence whatsoever of bad faith or fraud, dishonesty at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 202. The sons' counsel replied: \"I thought we kind of got through this on the demurrer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When the trial court asked the sons' counsel, \"Well, ultimately, what do you want me to decide as far as the trustee is concerned in this case?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Counsel responded, \"Did she get it right?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 203.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   After the trial court denied the motion, the trustee presented her evidence. The trustee testified that she was a professional investment and wealth manager. She had no self-interest in any aspect of the trust distribution. She did not receive a copy of the September 2012 amendment to the trust until more than a week after the father had passed, but she nonetheless forwarded copies to the beneficiaries after she was able to \"collect all the information, get all the documents, make copies,\" locate \"all the names of the [beneficiaries]\" entitled to receive copies, and \"send them out.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 207. The trustee sent out the notice required under the Virginia Uniform Trust Code, as well as copies of the September amendment to the trust, a full month before the notice date required by statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 64.2-775(B)(3) (requiring a trustee to provide a statutory\n   notice within 60 days of a revocable trust becoming irrevocable at the settlor's death and giving beneficiaries an opportunity to request copies of the trust agreement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The no-contest provision, she explained, expressly placed on her shoulders the duty to apply its terms and to make a final determination. She consulted with the attorney who had drafted the amendment, she hired independent legal counsel to advise her on the subject, and she requested input from the sons and considered all information they provided to her. The trustee said that her deliberations \"took a couple of months,\" but in the end, \"the decision itself seemed very straightforward.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 211.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The trustee said that she never discussed the situation with the stepmother or \"ever ask[ed] her\" for input.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 210. The stepmother, as income beneficiary, stood to gain nothing from the trustee's determination. The consequences of the trustee's determination implicated only the primary remainder beneficiaries (the sons) and the contingent remainder beneficiaries (the charitable organizations that would later be named). When asked on cross-examination if she thought there was an overriding \"fairness\" issue for her to resolve, the trustee responded: \"I am not in the position of deciding what's fair. I'm in the position of deciding what the trust tells me to do.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 214.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   After the trustee's counsel completed her case-in-chief, the sons' counsel in his rebuttal case called Paul to the stand \"on the issue of bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 235. When Paul stated that the trustee's decision was \"flawed by bad faith,\" the trial court interrupted, \"he's not going to argue this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 237. If counsel \"want[ed] to ask him something factually that I've heard in evidence,\" the judge stated, \"I'll be happy to allow you to do that.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When the sons' counsel could not come up with any factual questions to ask, the trustee's counsel objected to Paul's testimony. The court shut the rebuttal case down, characterizing it as simply \"legal argument.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In closing argument, the court invited the sons' counsel to address a distinction not raised in the pleadings, testimony, or argument. \"Let's assume,\" the court stated, that the sons were \"attacking the trust.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 241. \"[W]hat is your position on what he was attacking, if anything?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 242. When counsel did not get the gist of this question, the court put the question more plainly:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \"Can he contest the trust agreement as amended in September ... when he didn't even know what it was?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After the sons' counsel agreed and implied that he had made this very distinction earlier, the court stated: \"So it would be your contention, if-and I understand your position is he was not, but if he was, that he was contesting the trust agreement made on August 27 ... [n]ot the trust agreement with the amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 242-43. \"Exactly,\" the sons' counsel responded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 243.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In its letter opinion following the trial, the court invalidated the trustee's determination under the no-contest provision. On three significant points, however, the court agreed with the trustee. First, the court held as a matter of law that the \"fact that neither brother was aware of the [no-contest] provision is not dispositional.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 125. Second, the court concluded that the letters written to the trustee's counsel and to the stepmother constituted a prohibited contest under the no-contest clause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (\"The Court concludes that the aforesaid letters were as enumerated in the 'no-contest' provision.\"). Third, the court held the sons acted in concert with each other. The contesting actions of one, therefore, would be imputed to the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Despite these findings, the trial court ruled in favor of the sons. In doing so, the court relied exclusively on the theory that it had raised during closing argument with the sons' counsel. The court reasoned that the sons' contest of the trust did not target the trust as it existed at the time of their challenge. Their post-September 2012 actions were directed only at the un-amended August 2012 restatement of the trust. The no-contest provision, the court concluded, only applied to contests directed solely at the September 2012 amendment, which added the no-contest and release provisions. Applying this logic, the court held: \"There was no prohibition against challenging any prior agreement or\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   trust agreement as written in 1989 or August 27, 2012.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 125 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The trustee's counsel filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the court had misquoted the no-contest provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Later during\n   the hearing, when discussing an award of attorney fees, the trustee's counsel also stated: \"I don't think [the sons' counsel] actually made the argument that was the basis for your decision. I'd never heard that until the Court raised it itself at the end of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 260. The court disagreed, denied the motion, reaffirmed its reasoning in the letter opinion, and entered a final order finding, for the first time, that the trustee was guilty of \"bad faith\" when she made her no-contest determination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 131.\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   On appeal, the trustee raises several assignments of error seeking a reversal. The sons raise cross-assignments of error seeking an affirmance for reasons that the trial court either rejected or failed to address. All of the assertions of error, however, cluster around a single question: Did the sons plead and prove sufficient grounds for the trial court to overturn the trustee's no-contest determination?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   A. The Threshold Question of Deference to the Trustee's Determination\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The ultimate question in this case-whether the trial court correctly set aside the trustee's determination-requires us first to decide what, if any, judicial deference the trial court owed the trustee. The parties sharply differ on the answer to this threshold issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Quoting from the text of the no-contest provision, the trustee points out that the trust obligated her to determine if any beneficiary had violated the provision. She could not look the other way in the face of an apparent violation because the provision stated that the violator's share of the trust \"shall be revoked,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 299, if a violation occurred. The provision then ends with a clear, but not absolute, allocation of delegable authority: \"Absent proof of fraud, dishonesty, or bad faith on the part of my Trustee, the decision of my Trustee ... shall be final.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The sons concede that the text of the provision says what it says, but they contend that it violates \u00a7\u00a7 64.2-703(B) and 64.2-777 of the Virginia Uniform Trust Code. They argue that these provisions, coupled with general equitable principles governing trusts, render unenforceable on public policy grounds the \"shall be final\" wording of the no-contest provision. From there, the sons reason that the trial court should have reviewed the trustee's decision de novo (without the need for a last-minute bad faith finding) and should have concluded (for various other reasons) that the sons did not violate the no-contest provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Consideration of this threshold issue should begin with a review of the history of no-contest provisions and the settled principles governing them. There appears to be something basic and natural about a giver wanting his gifts, particularly those given after his death, to be received without rancor and disputation. Examples of testamentary no-contest provisions date back to the ancient times.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   English common law and chancery courts enforced no-contest provisions, subject to various limiting principles, throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Early American courts did as well.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smithsonian Inst. v.

On the other hand, the inflexibility of strict enforcement cannot be predicated on supposed inferences of settlor intent that are not reflected in the actual text of a no-contest provision.

The sons argue that this restriction does not go far enough. They propose that we adopt an \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard of judicial review to cover situations when a trustee makes an outrageously wrong determination under a no-contest provision of this kind-but does so innocently, with honest motives, and in good faith. Appellees' Br. at 14-18. I find the argument purely academic in this case.

I see no merit in this argument. The father intended the forfeiture to be mandatory (\"shall be revoked\") if either son directly or indirectly asserted a challenge or contest via litigation (\"by legal proceedings\") or by any other means (\"or otherwise\"). J.A. at 299. He also intended the forfeiture to be similarly mandatory if his sons \"attempt[ed] in any way to interfere with the administration\" of the trust.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Va.%20%2811%20Gratt.%29%20348\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   No legitimate exercise in textual interpretation would justify the conclusion that this provision applies only to contests and challenges asserted in court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   As I noted earlier, the \"wording of the 'no contest' provision\" determines its scope and identifies the circumstances that constitute \"a contest or attempt to defeat\" the trust.\n   <em>\n    Keener,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=278%20Va.%20435\">\n    278 Va. at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=682%20S.E.2d%20545\">\n    682 S.E.2d at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Womble,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2058553\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/198/522/#p529\">\n    198 Va. at 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20S.E.2d%20213\">\n    95 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   219 ).

This assertion may have some emotive value, but that does not translate into legal relevance. The law does not give parties an inviolate right to cure a fully consummated breach. Nor has any precedent ever suggested that the legal\n   efficacy of a conditional gift necessarily depends on the donee's knowledge of the condition. And for good\n   reason: If there were such a rule, a donor's condition could be avoided unilaterally simply by a donee willfully ignoring it, falsely claiming ignorance, or conceding knowledge of the condition but protesting his misunderstanding of it. I thus cannot conclude that the trustee acted arbitrarily or capriciously by not giving dispositive weight to the sons' expression of regret for their actions upon discovering their father's no-contest provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Even in cases in which the no-contest provision applies only to litigation contests, the \"general rule is that 'a resort to the means provided by law for attacking the validity of a will amounts to a contest, although the contestant subsequently withdraws before the final hearing and even though the contestant subsequently treats the will as valid and seeks construction.' \"\n   <em>\n    Womble,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2058553\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/198/522/#p529\">\n    198 Va. at 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20S.E.2d%20213\">\n    95 S.E.2d at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   1 Harrison &amp; Cox,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 21.05[4], at 21-13; Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Donative Transfers \u00a7 8.5 cmt. d (2003).

The court apparently reasoned that the sons had in fact violated the no-contest provision, but that the provision, as the court interpreted it, only applied to contests directed at the September 2012 amendment. In other words, the court held, \"There was no prohibition against challenging any prior agreement or\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   trust agreement as written in 1989 or August 27, 2012.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 125 (emphasis in original).

The provision also applied to attempts to interfere with the administration of \"this trust.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 299. There was, and still is, only one trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The trust agreement includes the August 2012 restatement and the September 2012 amendment.

The Trial Court's Belated \"Bad Faith\" Finding\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The no-contest provision withdraws the finality of the trustee's determination if the trustee was guilty of bad faith, fraud, or dishonesty. In this case, the trial court's letter opinion said nothing about bad faith and instead adopted the theory limiting the scope of the no-contest provision only to attacks on the September 2012 amendment. After the trustee's counsel filed and argued a motion to reconsider, the court announced for the first time that the trustee was guilty of \"bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   On appeal, the trustee argues that the trial court sua sponte injected the bad-faith issue into the case and that the sons did not plead bad faith in their complaint. This was the very point, the trustee insists, that she made at her unsuccessful demurrer hearing. The sons' response, at the time of the demurrer, was that their allegations raised \"the specter of bad faith\" but that they were not attempting to plead or prove bad faith (or dishonesty or fraud) because, to obtain a court order nullifying the trustee's determination, it was \"enough\" for them \"to simply establish that the Trustee 'got it wrong.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74. Consequently, the sons argued that \"they did not have to allege bad faith.\" Appellee's Br. at 14.
