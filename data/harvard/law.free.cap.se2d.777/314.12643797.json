Because we conclude that dismissal of federal claims pursuant to Federal Rule 12(b)(6) is not an adjudication on the merits for purposes of collaterally estopping a plaintiff from raising the same issues under state law in our State's courts, we affirm the trial court's order denying Defendants' motion to dismiss on the basis of collateral estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This appeal arises from claims and counterclaims of racial discrimination, misconduct, and conspiracies by various factions in the Greensboro Police Department (\"GPD\") and the government of the City of Greensboro (\"the City\"). In simplified form, some African American GPD officers alleged that a secret unit of Caucasian GPD officers was\n   targeting them for improper investigations based on their race, while some of the accused Caucasian officers denied those allegations and instead asserted that\n   <em>\n    they\n   </em>\n   were the victims of racially motivated false claims and criminal charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June 2005, GPD Officer James Hinson and other African American GPD officers accused then-GPD Chief David Wray of using certain Caucasian officers of the Special Investigation Section (\"SIS\"), a subdivision of the GPD, to surveil and target African American GPD officers. Officially, the SIS was tasked with duties such as protecting celebrities who visited Greensboro, investigating allegations of criminal activities by GPD officers, and handling other sensitive police matters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Hinson alleged that one tool the SIS used in its supposed racial misconduct against African American GPD officers was a binder containing photographs of African American GPD officers known as the \"black book.\" The SIS did in fact have a black binder which contained photo arrays of African American GPD officers, but SIS officers asserted that the photos were only those officers who had been on duty at the time of an alleged sexual assault by a uniformed African American GPD officer and that the binder was shown only to the victim of the alleged sexual assault as part of an SIS investigation into the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After learning of Hinson's claims, Defendant Mitchell Johnson, who was employed by the City first as Assistant City Manager and later as City Manager, and who also served on the City Council, met with attorneys representing some of the African American GPD officers who made the allegations against the SIS. After that meeting, Johnson instructed the City Attorney's Office to initiate an investigation of Plaintiffs William Thomas Fox and Scott Everett Sanders, two Caucasian GPD officers alleged to have been part of the SIS group racially targeting African American officers. Johnson and the City Council also contracted with Risk Management Associates, Inc., (\"RMA\") to conduct a private investigation of Plaintiffs and the SIS to supplement the official City investigation. Plaintiffs contend that the investigations were initiated by Johnson as part of a plan to pressure Wray into resigning as well as to tarnish Plaintiffs' own reputations and ultimately remove them from their positions with the SIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the midst of the official and private investigations, on 9 January 2006, Wray resigned as GPD Chief, and Defendant Timothy R. Bellamy was appointed as acting Chief and then Chief of the GPD. A few days later, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") began its own investigation into the actions of Wray and Plaintiffs. After learning that the FBI investigation revealed no evidence of civil rights violations by Wray, Fox, or Sanders, Bellamy directed Johnson to request an investigation by the State Bureau of Investigation (\"SBI\"). In the course of its investigation, the SBI interviewed numerous GPD officers, including defendants Gary R. Hastings and Martha T. Kelly. Plaintiffs contend that Bellamy and Johnson sought the SBI investigation despite knowing that the allegations of wrongdoing by Fox and Sanders were false. Plaintiffs further assert that Hastings and Kelly gave false information to the SBI and destroyed and/or refused to turn over to the SBI evidence and information that was favorable to Fox and Sanders. The SBI investigation concluded in the fall of 2007, and resulted in the indictment of Fox on one count each of felonious obstruction of justice and felonious conspiracy, while Sanders was indicted on one count of accessing a government computer without authorization, two counts of felonious obstruction of justice, and one count of felonious conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following a trial in February 2009, a jury found Sanders not guilty of improperly accessing a government computer. As a result of a post-trial\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   motion by Sanders, previously undisclosed statements came to light, leading to the dismissal of all the remaining charges against both Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs contend those exculpatory statements had been intentionally and maliciously suppressed by Hastings and Kelly, among others, as part of a conspiracy against Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a complaint on 23 March 2010 against Johnson, Bellamy, Hastings, and Kelly, as well as the City, RMA, and GPD officers John Slone and Ernest Cuthbertson (collectively, \"the federal defendants\") in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fox v.

On 11 July 2012, the trial court granted the motion to dismiss as to the City and dismissed all claims against it with prejudice, a ruling that also effectively eliminated Plaintiffs' claims against the individual state defendants in their official capacities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

In its opinion, this Court noted that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   collateral estoppel is an affirmative defense that must be pled. However, our Supreme Court has held that the denial of a motion to dismiss a claim for relief affects a substantial right when the motion to dismiss makes a colorable assertion that the claim is barred under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Thus, collateral estoppel is properly before the trial court if that defense is specifically argued in a motion to dismiss made before a defendant has answered the plaintiff's complaint....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Where an affirmative defense is raised for the first time in a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the motion must ordinarily refer expressly to the affirmative defense relied upon. However, where the non-movant has not been surprised and has full opportunity to argue and present evidence on the affirmative defense, the failure of the motion to expressly refer to the affirmative defense will not bar consideration of the defense by the trial court. Once it is determined that the affirmative defense is properly before the trial court, dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) on the grounds of the affirmative defense is proper if the complaint on its face reveals an insurmountable bar to recovery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3, 2013 N.C.App. LEXIS 1321, at *6-7 (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). This Court then held that Defendants\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   did not make any colorable claim of collateral estoppel in their motion to dismiss. In fact, Defendants' motion is devoid of any mention of collateral estoppel. There is no pleading in the record asserting collateral estoppel. Further, Defendants' motion does not reference the prior order of the District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina upon which they base their argument for collateral estoppel. Finally, ... the complaint in the present case makes no mention of the federal court judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   It is true that Defendants argued collateral estoppel at the hearing on their motion to dismiss, and that Plaintiffs, without objection, argued against collateral estoppel at that hearing. It also appears that Defendants submitted a brief in support of their motion to dismiss in which they argued collateral estoppel. However, that brief does not appear in the record. Assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo,\n   </em>\n   the collateral estoppel argument was properly before the trial court, we do not see how the trial court could have granted Defendants' motion to dismiss based upon that argument.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4, 2013 N.C.App. LEXIS 1321, at *8-11 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Following dismissal of the prior appeal, Defendants filed a timely answer to Plaintiffs' complaint on 14 November 2013, specifically pleading the factual basis for their collateral estoppel defense and attaching and incorporating by reference the relevant federal complaint and order upon which that defense is based.

No North Carolina case law or statute that we have discovered directly addresses the question of whether a dismissal under Federal Rule 12(b)(6) operates as an adjudication on the merits so as to collaterally estop a plaintiff from re-litigating a claim or issue in our State's courts. Of course, if the evaluation of a claim in light of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule 12(b)(6) were identical to the evaluation made in response to a motion under North Carolina Rule 12(b)(6), it would be clear that the federal court's dismissal had adjudicated and settled the same issue Plaintiffs raise in their state complaint. However, our review of the pertinent statutes and case law demonstrates that the standard under Federal Rule 12(b)(6), which the federal court here held Plaintiffs failed to meet, is a different,\n   <em>\n    higher\n   </em>\n   pleading standard than mandated under our own General Statutes.

However, the \"issue actually litigated in the prior suit ... and ... actually determined\" by the federal court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bluebird Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4156213\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/188/671/#p678\">\n    188 N.C.App. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12640548\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/657/55/#p61\">\n    657 S.E.2d at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), was whether Plaintiffs' pleadings met the plausibility standard applicable to motions to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule 12(b)(6). The federal court's opinion simply did not consider or address the issue of whether Plaintiffs' pleadings sufficiently stated a claim to survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to the notice pleading requirements of North Carolina Rule 12(b)(6). Accordingly, the trial court properly denied Defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(c) based upon their assertion of collateral estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We emphasize that our holding here is specific and limited to the sole issue raised by Defendants in\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   appeal: whether Plaintiffs are collaterally estopped from litigating their state malicious prosecution claims in North Carolina courts because the federal court dismissed their federal \"malicious prosecution\" claims for failing to meet the plausibility standard applicable to motions to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule 12(b)(6). We express no opinion about whether Plaintiffs' malicious prosecution claims were sufficiently pled under North Carolina Rule 12(b)(6). As noted by this Court in Defendants' previous appeal, that interlocutory issue is not before us at this point.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turner,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4150845\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/363/555/#p558\">\n    363 N.C. at 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=681%20S.E.2d%20770\">\n    681 S.E.2d at 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In sum, Plaintiffs are not collaterally estopped from bringing their malicious prosecution claims under state law.
