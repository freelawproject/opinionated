BERNARD GOODWYN.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this appeal, we consider whether a Virginia circuit court has jurisdiction to provide habeas corpus relief to a petitioner being detained by federal authorities because of immigration issues arising as a consequence of a state conviction after the sentence for the state conviction has expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Factual and Procedural Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Felipe Melendez Escamilla was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in 1999. He was arrested in 2003, after being caught removing radios from automobiles, and charged with one count of grand larceny and three counts of tampering with a vehicle. Escamilla pled guilty in the General District Court of Stafford County to petit larceny and to the three misdemeanor tampering charges. Before pleading guilty, Escamilla asked his attorney if his guilty plea would have adverse consequences on his immigration status as a lawful permanent resident. His attorney erroneously advised him that there would be no negative consequences because he would serve less than one year's imprisonment. The general district court sentenced him to twelve months' incarceration with all but one month suspended for the petit larceny charge, and 180 days' incarceration, all of which was suspended, for each of the tampering charges. All of the suspended sentences were suspended for three years, and all of Escamilla's sentences expired in 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 18, 2013, Escamilla was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities and taken to Rappahannock Regional Jail in preparation for removal proceedings. In a document styled \"Notice to Appear\" (designated ICE Form I-862), ICE charged that Escamilla was subject to removal because his 2003 petit larceny conviction triggered the applicability of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii), which provides that \"[a]ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after\n   admission is deportable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Notice to Appear further charged that Escamilla was subject to removal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(ii), because he had been convicted of two crimes of moral turpitude that did not arise from a single scheme of criminal conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 7, 2014, while in federal custody, Escamilla filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Circuit Court of Stafford County alleging he was denied effective assistance of counsel because the attorney representing him in the 2003 Stafford County petit larceny case incorrectly informed him that his guilty plea would not have any negative immigration\n   consequences. Escamilla alleged that had he known pleading guilty to the petit larceny charge could have resulted in his removal, he would have asked counsel to secure a sentence that would not qualify as a predicate under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A) or otherwise gone to trial on the grand larceny charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Superintendent of the Rappahannock Regional Jail moved to dismiss the petition on the grounds that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to consider Escamilla's petition because he was not in custody pursuant to the challenged conviction and because his petition was time-barred. The Superintendent also argued that he had failed to establish prejudice as required under\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), because he had not proven it would have been reasonable to proceed to trial instead of pleading guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The circuit court issued a letter opinion, granting the motion to dismiss. It held that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the petition because Escamilla was not in custody for the purposes of Code \u00a7 8.01-654 at the time he filed the petition. The circuit court further found that the petition was untimely, having been brought more than ten years after the challenged conviction became final. Escamilla objected to the court's ruling, arguing that immigration detention was sufficient to satisfy the custody requirement and that\n   the petition was timely because it was brought within one year of Escamilla's discovery of the alleged ineffective assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The circuit court entered an order dismissing the petition on June 23, 2014. Escamilla appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Escamilla assigns error as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1. The Circuit Court erred when it ruled that Escamilla was not detained without lawful authority so the court did not have jurisdiction to consider Mr. Escamilla's petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Circuit Court erred when it ruled Escamilla's petition was not timely and granted the Superintendent's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   3. The Circuit Court erred when it granted the Superintendent's motion to dismiss on procedural grounds and thus denied Escamilla's meritorious ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Escamilla asserts that the circuit court erred in ruling that he was not detained without lawful authority and that it did not have jurisdiction to consider his habeas corpus petition. \"Because\n   entitlement to habeas relief is a mixed question of law and fact, the habeas court's findings and conclusions are not binding upon this Court, but are subject to review to determine whether the court correctly applied the law to the facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Zemene v.

Escamilla seeks to attack his 2003 petit larceny conviction, but he completed his sentence for that crime in 2006, eight years prior to seeking habeas relief in 2014. Although he was physically detained at the time he filed the habeas petition, he was\n   not detained by the Commonwealth for a violation of Virginia law.

However, detention imposed by any other jurisdiction as a result of a Virginia conviction is a collateral consequence of that Virginia conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Black's Law Dictionary 369 (10th ed. 2014) (A collateral consequence is \"the indirect implication of a criminal conviction, esp. as it may affect the defendant's immigration status, property forfeitures, civil litigation posture, etc.\"). We agree with the Court of Appeals of Virginia that \"[d]eportation is a collateral consequence of [a] criminal conviction because it arises through the efforts of an arm of government over which the trial court has no control and which is not part of the underlying criminal proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Zigta v.

Federal immigration detention does not satisfy the detention requirement\n   of Code \u00a7 8.01-654 because such detention is pursuant to the laws and authority of another sovereign. Escamilla seeks habeas corpus relief concerning a 2003 conviction for petit larceny. Escamilla's sentence for that conviction expired in 2006, and his detention on that conviction ended with the expiration of his sentence. Therefore, Escamilla was not unlawfully detained because of his 2003 Virginia conviction for petit larceny at the time he filed his habeas petition challenging that conviction, and the judgment of the circuit court dismissing Escamilla's petition for want of jurisdiction must be affirmed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    \"Aggravated felony\" is defined in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(43)(G) to include any \"theft offense\" for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The multiple schemes of criminal conduct refer to the Stafford County incident and a 2007 Fairfax County conviction for petit larceny for which Escamilla received a sentence of 180 days' incarceration.
