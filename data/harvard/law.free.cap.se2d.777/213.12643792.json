He now argues that deficiencies in the police investigation-including the loss of potentially exculpatory evidence and the failure to ascertain the identity of a second shooter-deprived him of a fair trial, and delays occasioned by the State's faulty investigation deprived him of the right to a speedy trial. Reaves asks the indictment be dismissed. We disagree and therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Police responded to a call about a fight in progress in Marion. On their way to the scene, the officers were notified that shots had been fired. When they arrived, officers found Applewhite slumped inside the rear passenger seat of a white Crown Victoria with apparent gunshot wounds. Applewhite\n   was transported to the hospital, but later died as a result of his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   An autopsy revealed that Applewhite had been shot five times. Three of the bullets passed through his body. Another bullet entered and remained lodged in Applewhite's\n   shoulder. The fifth bullet, which was determined to be the fatal one, entered Applewhite's upper back, struck his lung, aorta, and liver, and ultimately stopped in his colon. A South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) analyst determined the fatal bullet was a .38 or .357 caliber likely fired from a revolver, and the shot lodged in his shoulder was a 9mm caliber likely fired from a semiautomatic pistol. Accordingly, the analyst concluded the two shots were fired from different guns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As the police investigation progressed, witnesses identified sixteen-year-old Reaves as one of the shooters. Police obtained a warrant for Reaves' arrest, and he was apprehended in Philadelphia in May of 2007, where he had fled after the shooting. Reaves was transported back to South Carolina and charged with murder and assault and battery with intent to kill. After more than three years had passed while incarcerated, Reaves made a speedy trial motion in August of 2010. Reaves' case was called for trial later that same month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the first day of Reaves' trial, an eyewitness to the shooting, Jackie McGill, and multiple police officers testified. After the jury was excused for the day, defense counsel had the opportunity to review a number of documents in the investigator's file which were previously unknown to either party. Among these documents was a signed statement from a hearsay witness saying that Jeremy Vereen, not Reaves, was the shooter who fired the fatal bullet. Also among the materials was a handwritten note from the lead investigator in the case indicating that Vereen may have been the second shooter. Reaves moved for a mistrial based on the possible exculpatory value the documents presented, and because he had not been provided them pursuant to his request for disclosure under Rule 5, SCRCrimP. The State agreed a mistrial was appropriate. The trial judge granted a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Prior to his second trial, Reaves moved for dismissal of the indictment on due process grounds. Reaves also made a\n   motion to dismiss the case because his right to a speedy trial had been violated. Both motions were denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the second trial, McGill again testified about the shooting. McGill stated he and Applewhite, along with Applewhite's cousin, Karen Graves, and McGill's friend, Travis Lane, drove together to see Applewhite's former girlfriend, Joemilla Wilson. Applewhite and Wilson had been living together in Atlanta as recently as a month before the shooting. However, Wilson was then at the house of her new boyfriend, Deshawn Bellamy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to McGill, Applewhite called Wilson out of the house to talk and the two started walking down the street, arguing. They soon started fist-fighting, and Applewhite threw Wilson to the ground. After McGill broke up the fight and put Applewhite back in the car, Wilson came over and spit on Applewhite through an open window. Applewhite then got back out of the car and chased after Wilson, who retreated to the porch of the house. Applewhite followed, but was intercepted by Reaves, who met him at the bottom of the porch steps. It was at this point that Reaves shot Applewhite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   McGill's testimony was corroborated by Wilson, who stated she saw Reaves fire a revolver at Applewhite. Additionally, the initial lead investigator in the case, Captain Jim Gray, testified to his investigation of the shooting and the second lead investigator, Lieutenant Farmer Blue, who took over after Captain Gray became ill, testified about his identification of Reaves as the shooter. This was Lt. Blue's first murder investigation, and he conceded \"there would have been a lot of other things I would have done different (sic) in the case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Over the course of the trial, it became clear there were serious problems with the investigation into Applewhite's death. The crime scene had not been properly sealed, and the crime scene log of people entering and exiting the area was not accurately maintained.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A number of pieces of physical evidence-including two hats, a credit card bearing the name of William A. Bellamy,\n   three cell phones, and a Bluetooth headset-were collected at the scene but not tested. Three\n   gold chains, which Wilson testified were snatched off Reaves' neck by Applewhite moments before the shooting, were collected at the scene but were missing at the time of trial. Further, Applewhite's clothing, which was collected by police from the hospital, was also lost or destroyed. Additionally, five witness statements, written by McGill, Lane, Graves, and two other people, were purportedly taken by police officers at the scene that night but were unaccounted for at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The problems with the investigation coincided with three main discrepancies in the facts of the case. First, although there was information Vereen was involved in Applewhite's death, the second shooter had not been definitively identified at the time of trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, both McGill and Lane were shown a photo lineup with Reaves in it, and despite testifying they had known Reaves for years, they both selected another person named \"BT\" as the shooter. Third, the inconsistency between expert testimony that the fatal shot was to Applewhite's upper back and witness testimony placing Applewhite in front of Reaves during the shooting was never explained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Reaves renewed his motions to dismiss regarding his right to a fair trial and right to a speedy trial after the State's case and again at the close of all the evidence. Although the trial court expressed concern over the investigation of the shooting, it denied both motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Reaves was ultimately convicted of voluntary manslaughter. He was sentenced to twenty-five years' imprisonment. Reaves appealed his conviction and sentence, claiming he was deprived of the right to a fair trial as a result of the lost evidence as well as his right to a speedy trial. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished opinion.\n   <em>\n    State v. Reaves,\n   </em>\n   Op.

Significantly, his case was called for trial later that same month; the additional three-month delay was due to the trial judge's granting of Reaves' motion for a mistrial. Therefore, while we refuse to hold Reaves waived his right to a fair trial by acquiescing in the lengthy delay, his failure to assert his right to a speedy trial weighs strongly against him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"515313\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/325/65/#p76\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"515313\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/325/65/#p76\">\n    at 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"515313\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/325/65/#p76\">\n    480 S.E.2d at 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding no speedy trial violation where\n   trial was set for two months after defendant first moved for a speedy trial).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, although we are cautious to not diminish the injurious effect of his lengthy incarceration prior to trial, we find Reaves has not shown the delay caused any particularized prejudice to his defense. He argues that the evidence missing in this case was lost by police during the delay, thus hampering the preparation of his defense. However, the record does not support this assertion. While it is not clear precisely when most of the evidence was lost, it is most likely that it happened shortly after Lt. Blue took over from Captain Gray as lead investigator, which was only two days after the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Further, there is no indication the lost evidence would have helped Reaves' case rather than hurt it; therefore, even assuming the evidence\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   lost during the delay, the record does not show how this would have been prejudicial to Reaves' defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, there is no question that Reaves was able to use the State's bungled investigation to his advantage by subjecting the police's actions to the crucible of cross-examination and by securing the spoliation of evidence charge at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   While this is an extremely close case, a trial court's decision as to whether to dismiss an indictment based on speedy trial grounds is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Langford,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3883496\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/400/421/#p442\">\n    400 S.C. at 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3883496\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/400/421/#p442\">\n    735 S.E.2d at 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Despite our disappointment in the manner in which the criminal justice system operated in this case, we cannot say the able trial judge abused his discretion in denying Reaves' request to dismiss the case based on the violation of his right to a speedy trial. Although there was a significant delay between Reaves' arrest and his convictions and the State puts forth no compelling reason for the delay, Reaves cannot show he timely asserted his right to a speedy trial-or that his assertion when made was ignored-and cannot show that he suffered particularized prejudice as the result of the delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Nonetheless, we express our deep concern with a system which kept a sixteen-year-old offender in pretrial incarceration for over three years.
