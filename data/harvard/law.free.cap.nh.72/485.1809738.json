Facts found, and case transferred without order or rulings from the May term, 1902, of the superior court, by <em>Pike, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-11\">The policy in question was issued in October, 1897, and was to continue in force for one year. Its material provisions are set forth in the opinion. Tbe plaintiff was injured on January 20, 1898, while in tbe employ of the Paper Company, and brought an action for negligence against that corporation in April, 1899. Tbe. case was tried at the November term, 1899, a verdict was returned for the plaintiff, and in May, 1900, judgment was rendered for him in tbe sum of $9,085.08 damages and $101.64 costs. The liability of tbe Paper Company for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries was one covered by the policy; and tbe Insurance Company undertook the investigation of the case and assumed the entire defence of the action, their counsel appearing in behalf of tbe defendants of record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The property of the Paper Company was attached upon the plaintiff\u2019s writ in the action at law, subject to prior mortgages, and the equity therein was sold to the plaintiff upon execution for the sum of one dollar. At the date of the judgment, the liabilities of the Paper Company greatly exceeded the mortgage indebtedness, and there was no unincumbered property of the corporation applicable to the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. At the time this bill was filed, the Paper Company had no property or assets upon which execution could be levied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-5\">The Insurance Company fixed the rate of premiums solely with reference to the class of business carried on by the insured.

He contends that the policy constituted an agreement on the part of the Insurance Company to bear the loss; and that under the circumstances of this case, the actual payment of the judgment by the Paper Company is not a condition precedent to the maintenance of this suit. The Insurance Company relies upon the terms of the express and unambiguous contract as contained in the operative words, and clause 8 of the policy by which it expressly contracted to insure only \u201c against loss from liability for damages actually sustained and paid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-10\">The Insurance Company did not receive any consideration for the risk of insuring an insolvent concern. The rates were fixed with reference solely to the class of business carried on by the insured, and not with reference to the extra hazard of insuring those who should become insolvent before payment of loss. When it was provided in express terms that the Insurance Company should <em>reimburse </em>the insured for \u201closs actually sustained and paid by him,\u201d the insurer exercised a legal right to limit its liability to cases of normal risks, where it should have between it and the injured employee an interested and live, and not an indifferent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>and defunct, insured; that is, to limit its liability to claims where the risk, like the premium, was fixed by and limited solely to that ordinarily arising in the class of business carried on by the insured, and in respect to which, until paid, the company had the moral support of a solvent insured. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>67 N. IT. 335, 339; <em>Findlay </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>74 Yt. 211; <em>Mclntire </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>102 Mass. 230; <em>Springfield etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>151 Mo. 90.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-5\">The reason for the insertion of clause 8 in the policy is apparent from the figures of the plaintiff\u2019s verdict: such risks are dangerous. i One of the first advantages in the proper defence of an action and in the keeping of a verdict within reasonable limits, is to have on the ground a defendant who will have the greatest possible actual interest in the result of the suit. A solvent (unlike an insolvent) insured has an interest in limiting losses as a basis for a low premium rate, and in defending himself against loss in excess of the insurance carried. A solvent insured (unlike an insolvent) has power to assist in the defence and in the limitation of losses, in that influence with employees which comes from personal contact, in a personal knowledge of the facts, in ability to marshal and control evidence and prevent its destruction or distortion, and in holding out inducements of future employment. With insolvency of the insured, and the consequent cessation of business and employment, follows not only a natural loss of interest and power, but danger of collusion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-6\">(2) In New Hampshire, in actions at law under facts similar to the case at bar, \u201cit is held by a preponderating weight of authority, that when the condition of a bond is simply to save the obligee harmless from a debt or liability, it is not broken until the obligee has been compelled to pay, or has been otherwise damnified.\u201d <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>43 N. H. 202, 206. See, also, <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Dull, </em>4 N. H. 495; <em>Haseltine </em>v. <em>Cuild, </em>11 N. H. 390; <em>Tufts </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>31 N. H. 138; <em>Osgood, </em>v. <em>Osgood, </em>39 N. H. 290. Our courts of equity, however, have administered relief when from all the circumstances they ought in equity and good conscience to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-7\">The explicit agreement in the case at bar repels any presumption of an implied promise by the Insurance Company to pay Sanders. Neither law nor equity will by implication raise a promise by the Insurance Company to Sanders, greater than the promise with express limitations which was made to the Paper Company. The policy cannot by any strained construction be deemed to give rise to a promise by implication that the insurer will pay a third party or stranger, w'hen it will not pay the Paper Company. There is no justice or equity in holding that the Insurance Company, under its policy, should pay a claim which the same policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>expressly provides it shall not be bound to pay \u2014 a claim for the payment of which it never received any consideration. The doctrine of subrogation is a benevolence, but it never goes to the extent of compelling an insurer, against his express contract, to carry extra-hazardous risks for normal premiums, simply because a third party is unfortunate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-3\">Let us read- into the contract interpreted in the leading case of <em>Heene Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Herrick, </em>62 N. H. 174, clause 8 of the policy in this case. A borrows money of B, procures C to sign with him as surety, gives C a mortgage on his house as indemnity against loss, and then sells the house to a <em>Iona fide </em>purchaser, subject to the mortgage. In case of failure to pay and insolvency of A and C, the law gives B a right by subrogation to have the security set over to him. But suppose it had been expressly provided in the condition of the mortgage, that in case of the mortgagee\u2019s insolvency, so that he suffered no actual loss, the mortgage was to be void; or, what is tantamount to the same thing, suppose it had been provided that \u201cno action shall lie to enforce the lien cinder this mortgage unless it shall be brought by the grantee <em>himself, </em>to reimburse him for loss actually sustained and paid by him in satisfaction of a judgment thereon.\u201d Equity would not annul this express contract of the parties, on the faith of which the pur-chaser of the land held it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-4\">Equity jurisdiction is a broad blanket to cover almost every lameness of the law to enforce rights growing out of contractual relations and the equitable situation of the parties; but in no instance in the multitude of decisions' has this benign jurisdiction been extended to modify the express contracts of parties, however unwise they may have been, if they are not so unreasonable as to be tainted with fraud. Much less have courts of equity shown a disposition to interfere with the right of any party to protect himself by express contract from dangerous contingencies. In the absence of fraud, the situation of the parties can never be such as to call for the exercise of equity jurisdiction to annul an express contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-5\">(8) The position of the plaintiff is, that \u201c the policy in question is a contract of indemnity and, in effect, a provision made by the insolvent employer for the ultimate discharge of the liability of the defendant Paper Company to the plaintiff.\u201d To sustain this proposition, counsel digest six cases, in each of which the language of the policy is so different as to clearly distinguish it from the case at bar. <em>Anoka Lumber Co.v. Company, </em>63 Minn. 286; <em>Hoven </em>\u2022v. <em>Company, </em>93 Wis. 201; <em>Fenton </em>v. <em>Company, </em>36 Or. 283; <em>American etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Fordyce, </em>62 Ark. 562; <em>Boss </em>v. <em>Company, </em>56 N. J. Eq. 41; <em>Pickett </em>v. <em>Company, </em>60 S. C. 477.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Counsel are evidently conscious that these cases are clearly distinguishable from the one at bar, both in the operative words of the policy and the presence of clause 8. They contend that \u201cindemnity against <em>loss </em>from liability \u201d means the same as \u201c indemnity against liability.\u201d The only argument which they make to sustain their assumption is that \u201c the purpose in all the cases is insurance; it is now a well known class of insurance; is called employers\u2019 liability insurance; and its object is indemnity against liability.\u201d This argument assumes that contracts in the case of accident insurance have taken a stereotyped form, which is no longer subject to modification to fit the express intention of the parties; and if the parties attempt to control their rights and liabilities by express stipulations, they are to be met by rules of construction which will reduce their contract to that stereotyped form and thus effectuate the purpose which, regardless of the actual and expressed intention, the parties should have had in mind,'namely, indemnity against <em>liability. </em>But the authorities are to the effect that contracts of insurance are to be construed under the same rules as other contracts. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>69 N. H. 438; <em>Merrills. Insurance Co., </em>91 Wis. 329; <em>Hasten </em>v. <em>Casualty Co., </em>99 Wis. 13.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-3\">It is contended that clause 8 is either inconsistent with the rest of the policy, and should therefore be disregarded, or that it should be construed only as securing to the Insurance Company a <em>bona fide </em>trial of the issue. Clause 8 does not in any sense purport to provide against a breach of that part of the contract relating to the defence of suits. There is nothing in the context of the policy to indicate such a purpose. On the other hand, whenever in the policy the word \u201closs \u201d is used, it clearly has the same signification, namely, loss from liabilities, while the expense of defending suits is in every instance referred to either as \u201cexpense \u201d <em>or </em>\u201ccost.\u201d The word \u201closs\u201d in the phrase of clause 8, \u201cas respects any loss under this policy,\u201d must logically have the same meaning and construction as when used a little earlier in the operative words of the policy, to wit: \u201c loss from common-law or statutory liability on account of damages for bodily injuries,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-4\">If the parties to the contract had in mind simply the securing of a <em>bona fide trial, </em>it is scarcely conceivable that they would have used the language in clause 8. It would have been very simple to have provided that \u201cno action shall lie against the company as respects any loss undei^ this policy unless it should be brought after a <em>bona fide </em>trial of the issue.\u201d If such was the intention, the further language which prohibits such an action, except to \u201c reimburse him for loss actually sustained and paid by him in satisfaction of the judgment,\u201d was wholly unnecessary and in direct conflict with the interpretation claimed for the plaintiff. We submit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>that the construction we place upon clause 8 in connection with the operative words of the policy is consistent with every other part of the contract, and constitutes a plain and simple provision to protect the insurer against the extra-hazardous risk of insuring a company which is insolvent, or may become so before payment of the loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-5\">(4) <em>Beacon Lamp Qo. </em>v. <em>Insurance </em>Qo., 61 N. J. Eq. 59, is a misapplication of the doctrine of an earlier case <em>(jKlapworth </em>v. <em>Dressier, </em>13 N. J. Eq. 62) to a state of facts which it did not fit. The operative words and clause 8 were almost indentical with those in the case at bar. In order to carry out what they deem to be the \u201c manifest right and justice \u201d of the case, the court ignore the express contract of the parties as of no sort of consequence (except so far as it establishes a relationship of debtor, creditor, and surety), and adopt counsel\u2019s argument as their own vie^w, as follows: \u201c The case appears from an equitable standpoint precisely as if there were no contractual relations between the Insurance Company and the Lamp Company, and the attitude of principal and surety between those parties arose, as well it might, and often does arise, out of the bare facts.\u201d Following this line of reasoning to its logical conclusion, the aid of a scrivener and the advice of a counselor in the drafting of legal papers is a hollow farce; a deed is a deed, a policy of insurance is a policy of insurance, and it is wholly immaterial with what care parties attempt to limit and define their rights and obligations by a written contract. The court held the insurer liable to the amount limited in the policy, without regard to the sum actually paid by the insured. It is not surprising that the decision was overruled in this regard by the court of last resort.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-7\"><em>Travellers Ins. Qo. </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>63 N. J. Eq. 260, is the only case to be found which is exactly parallel to the one at bar. There is no essential difference in the language of the policies. The property of the insured had been transferred to a trustee in bankruptcy, which was held to be actual payment to the extent of the creditors\u2019 percentage, and to that extent the trustee was entitled to enforce it against the Insurance Company. The court say: \u201c The obligation of the Insurance Company was with the Lamp Company only, and is explicitly defined by the contract which limits it to. such sum, not exceeding $5,000, as the Lamp Company may have actually paid in accordance with the policy. No person claiming under this contract can enforce any larger obligation; for it rested wholly within the power of the contracting parties, subject only to public law, to fix the bounds of liability. The claim of the trustee . . . must have the same bounds.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-8\"><em>Sunt </em>y. <em>Association, </em>68 N. H. 305, is claimed to be a complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>answer to the foregoing decision, upon the erroneous assumption that the premium paid by the insured in the case at bar was, equivalent to the loss sustained by the employee, whereas it was equivalent only to the loss which \u201c should be actually sustained and paid \u201d by the Paper Company. In <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Association, </em>insolvency was a \u201cmere accident,\u201d whereas in the case at bar it was a contingency against which the insurer expressly provided. The reasoning of <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Association </em>proceeds upon the basis of express language giving the insured an equitable interest in the policy; while the contract in the case at bar is one of indemnity in favor of the Paper Company alone, to which Sanders was in no way a party and in which he had no interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-5\">That the employee has no interest in the policy, legal or equitable, was expressly decided in <em>Travellers Ins. Go. </em>v. <em>Moses, supra; </em>and this view was indorsed in <em>Bain </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>181 Mass. 240, which was a proceeding in equity to compel the Insurance Company to pay the plaintiff $5,000, a certain sum having been paid to Atkins in settlement of his claim against the insurer. The plaintiff was employed by Atkins and recovered a judgment against him for personal injuries, which was uncollectable by reason of his bankruptcy. The court say: \u201c The only parties to the contract of insurance were Atkins and the company. The consideration for the company\u2019s promise came from Atkins alone, and the promise was only to him and his legal representatives. Not only was the plaintiff not a party to either the consideration or the contract, but the terms of the contract do not purport to promise an indemnity for the benefit of any person other than Atkins. The policy only purports to insure Atkins and his legal representatives against legal liability for damages respecting injuries from accidents to any person or persons at certain places and within the time and under the circumstances defined. It contains no agreement that the insurance shall inure to the benefit of the person accidentally injured, and no language from which such an understanding or intention can be implied. Atkins was under no obligation to procure insurance for the benefit of the plaintiff, nor did any relation exist between the plaintiff and Atkins which could give the latter the right to procure insurance for the benefit of the plaintiff. The only correct statement of the situation is simply that the insurance was a matter wholly between the company and Atkins, in which the plaintiff had no legal or equitable interest, any more than in other property belonging absolutely to Atkins.\u201d</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b519-6\">Parsons, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHy\">The plaintiff has recovered judgment against the defendant Paper Company for some $9,000. The Paper Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>pany have not paid the judgment and have no property upon which a levy can be made, but they hold a policy of insurance issued by the defendant Insurance Company covering their liability for the injury which constituted the plaintiff\u2019s cause of .action, to the extent of $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\">The obligations imposed upon the insurer by the policy contract are in dispute. The plaintiff claims it constitutes upon the facts a subsisting obligation upon the Insurance Company to pay \u25a0$5,000 to the Paper Company, and he contends that upon equitable grounds the money should be paid to him. The Paper Company, so far as appears, make no claim to the money, nor do they \u25a0object to a payment to the plaintiff. If the Insurance Company \u2022are under an existing obligation to pay $5,000, it is immaterial to -them whether they pay it to the Paper Company or to the plaintiff. The Paper Company cannot object to a decree for a payment of the money to the plaintiff in discharge <em>pro tanto </em>of his judgment against them, for thereby they are relieved from loss or discharged from liability to that amount, which is all they can claim under any construction of the policy. The Insurance Company \u2022concede the validity of the policy, that it covers the injury for which the Paper Company have been found liable, and that the amount of such liability has been judicially determined to be .\u25a0greater than the total claim under the policy. Their position is, that as the Paper Company have paid nothing they have lost nothing, and the contingency upon which the liability of the Insurance Company was made to depend by the terms of the policy has not yet occurred. They rely upon the grant or covenant of the policy by which they \u201c agree to indemnify . . . against loss from . . . liability for damages on account of bodily injuries, fatal or non-fatal, accidentally suffered by any person . . . and resulting from negligence of the assured,\u201d and the further agreement or condition hi clause 8: \u201c No action shall lie against the company as respects any loss under this policy unless it shall be brought by the assured himself to reimburse him for loss' actually sustained and paid by him in satisfaction of a judgment after trial of the issue.\u201d Under these provisions, the Insurance Company claim that the only legal obligation resting upon them is to pay to the Paper Company such sum as may have been paid by the insured upon a judgment recovered upon the liability covered by the policy. Two cases similar to the present \u25a0are cited in which this contention appears to have been adopted \u25a0upon a similar policy: <em>Frye </em>v. Company, 97 Me. 241, and <em>Travellers Ins. Co. </em>v. Moses, 63 N. J. Eq. 260. In the last case, in an \u25a0earlier decision in the court of chancery, it was held that equity would apply the whole indemnity to the satisfaction of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>tiff\u2019s judgment. <em>Beacon Lamp Co. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>61 N. J. Eq. 59. This view was not followed in the court of appeals, which limited the amount so applied to a sum which the court by a process of reasoning construed had been paid. <em>Travellers Ins. Co. </em>v. Moses, <em>supra. </em>In <em>Bain </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>181 Mass. 240, which has also been cited by the defendants, the obligation of the insurance company had been performed. The question of the plaintiff\u2019s equitable right to compel the application of a subsisting obligation to indemnify against his claim to its satisfaction was not in the case and was expressly excluded from consideration (y&gt;. 243).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Discussion has been had of the question whether the present contract was one of insurance against damage or of insurance against liability. In the following cases cited by the plaintiff the policies in question were held to be contracts of indemnity against, liability: <em>Fritchie </em>v. <em>Company, </em>197 Pa. St. 401; <em>Hoven </em>v. <em>Company, </em>93 Wis. 201; <em>Anoka Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Company, </em>63 Minn. 286; <em>American etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Fordyce, </em>62 Ark. 562; <em>Fidelity etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Fordyce, </em>64 Ark. 174; <em>Fenton </em>v. <em>Company, </em>36 Or. 283. The phraseology of the agreement or covenant in the policy before the court differs materially from that of the policies construed in those cases. The decisions, therefore, are not directly in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">If it be conceded that the contract is one of indemnity against damage merely, the question presented would not be whether an action at law is now maintainable by either the plaintiff or the Paper Company, but whether there is power in equity to grant the relief asked. But whether such power exists or not, the indemnitor has the right to perform his contract of indemnity by payment of the claim indemnified against. He may also, if he deems it necessary, stipulate for the right to perform the contract in this way, and may also agree that he will so perform it. If' there be any uncertainty as to the right of a creditor to claim payment in equity of one who has agreed to indemnify the debtor against his claim, there is no doubt of his right to do so against one who has assumed the debt or agreed to pay the claim. An agreement to assume a debt is a promise to pay it as the promisor\u2019s, own debt. <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Homer, </em>131 Mass. 98, 109. \u201cIf one person agrees with another to be primarily liable for a debt due from that other to a third person, so that as between the parties to the agreement the first is the principal and the second the surety, the creditor of such surety is entitled, in equity, to be substituted in his place for the purpose of compelling such principal to pay the debt.\u201d <em>Keller </em>v. <em>Ashford, </em>133 U. S. 610, 623. If the Insurance Company, by force of the policy and the plaintiff\u2019s loss, are now indebted to the Paper Company, it is plainly equitable that such indebtedness should be applied to the satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>claim. It is equally clear that equity has power to make such application. <em>Hunt </em>v. Association, 68 N. H. 305. See, also, <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Hunton, </em>70 N. H. 224; <em>Barton </em>v. Croydon, 63 N. H. 417; <em>Holt </em>v. Bank, 62 N. H. 551; <em>Gerrish </em>v. <em>Gerrish, </em>62 N. H. 397; <em>Keene etc. Bank v. </em>Herrick, 62 N. H. 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\">These propositions do not appear to be seriously controverted; but the contention is, as has already been suggested, (1) that the insurers have not agreed to discharge the liability, and hence have not assumed the claim, and (2) that they do not now owe the Paper Company anything. The question for investigation is, therefore, the meaning of the policy \u25a0 contract; and if the converse of either contention is sustained, the plaintiff is entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In addition to the provisions of the policy to which reference has been made and upon which the defendant Insurance Company rely, and which are similar to those upon which the decisions in Maine and New Jersey are founded, the policy contains the following \u201c general agreements, which are to be construed as co-ordinate \u201d with the general covenant of the policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">\u201c 2. If thereafter any suit is brought against the assured to enforce a claim for damages on account of an accident covered by this policy, immediate notice thereof shall be given to the company and the company will defend against such proceedings, in the name and on behalf of the assured, or settle the same at its own cost, unless it shall elect to pay to the assured the indemnity provided for in clause A [$5,000].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">\u201c 3. The assured shall not settle any claim, except at his own cost, nor incur any expense, nor interfere in any negotiation for settlement or in any legal proceeding without the consent of the company previously given in writing. . . . The assured when requested by the company shall aid in securing evidence and in effecting settlements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Whether the contracts considered in the Maine and New Jersey cases contained similar stipulations does not appear from the reports of the cases. It is probable that like provisions were contained in these policies, but in neither of these cases is there any discussion or reference to such stipulations as a part of the contract. They stand in the policy at the head of the \u201cgeneral agreements \u201d of which clause 8 is one, and are of course of equal force in modifying or explaining the covenant of which they \u201c are to be construed as co-ordinate, as conditions.\u201d In <em>Anoka Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Company, </em>63 Minn. 286,\u201430 L. R. A. 689, <em>Hoven </em>v. <em>Company, </em>93 Wis. 201,\u201432 L. R. A. 388, and <em>Fenton </em>v. <em>Company, </em>36 Or. 283,\u201448 L. R. A. 770, similar provisions are' considered as furnishing evidence that the contract was one of indemnity against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>liability. In the case first cited, the court sustain their conclusion, that the contract is one of indemnity against liability, in part as follows: \u201c The company takes upon itself the settlement of loss and the control of all legal proceedings, and the assured is forbidden to settle any claim or incur any expense without its consent in writing. ... If the plaintiff is forbidden to settle a claim for an accident of this kind, we fail to see how it is imperative upon him to pay a judgment rendered against him upon such a claim, as a condition precedent to his right of recovery. The Insurance Company, by the terms of its own policy, has taken into its own hands the whole machinery for settling such claim, and will not allow the employer to do it.\u201d In <em>Hoven </em>v. Company, the court say: \u201cAgain, by one of the conditions, the Insurance Company assumes entire charge and responsibility for the settlement of the loss and of any legal proceedings, and for the payment of the costs thereof. There is no way provided by which it can be relieved of its liability, except by actual payment to the employer of the full amount for which it could in any event become liable.\u201d It is further said in the same opinion that this provision with others is \u201c inconsistent with any reasonable theory other than that the contract of insurance is one of indemnity against liability.\u201d The provisions in the present policy are, if anything, more stringent and particular in prescribing the obligations assumed by the Insurance Company than the reports of the cases cited indicate that they were in those cases. While from the different language used in the general covenant these cases are not, as already stated, authority for the position that the policy in this suit is a policy of indemnity against liability generally, yet they are authority for the proposition that these provisions are consistent with an intention to assume the liability. By these stipulations, the insurers not only reserve the right to perform tlieir contract of indemnity in a particular way, but agree that they will so perform it.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">They agree that upon notice of a suit brought to enforce a claim for damages on account of an accident covered by the policy they will do one of two things: They will (1) defend against the proceedings in the name and on behalf of the assured, or (2) settle the same at their own cost, unless they elect to pay the full amount of the indemnity to the assured. This is an agreement, in performance of their contract of indemnity, (1) to defend, (2) to settle, or (3) to pay the assured. The last two plainly provide for the performance of the contract of indemnity before the assured has suffered loss, in the sense of having been compelled by legal proceedings to pay damages. So far as the agreement to defend involves the relief of the assured from the expense of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>litigation, that agreement also involves the performance of the contract of indemnity by the assumption of the liability indemnified against. The sole question, therefore, is whether by'the agreement to defend against the proceedings the insurers also agree to perform their contract by the assumption of the entire liability, within the limits of the contract, in cases where they have assumed the defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">If \u201cto defend\u201d means \u201cto protect, to secure against attack,\u201d\u2014 in short, to successfully defend, \u2014 it is perfectly clear that the Insurance Company agree to perform their covenant of indemnity against loss by assuming the liability. This is conceded. But it is claimed that the agreement to defend against the proceedings-means merely to contest the suit to final judgment. While in. a technical sense to defend a suit is to contest it, the word \u201c defend \u201d also includes the broader meanings above suggested. Web. Diet. If the meaning were, as is claimed, merely the conduct of the litigation until judgment should be rendered, no reason has been suggested why the purpose was not explicitly stated. Having entered upon the defence of the suit, no way is perceived by which (at least, before judgment) the Insurance Company could escape liability, except by settlement with the plaintiff or payment to the assured. The engagement is not merely to contest the suit to judgment, but to \u201cdefend against such proceedings,\u201d \u2014 meaning, necessarily, all .the proceedings in the suit-founded upon the claim for damages against the insured. The judgment is a proceeding in such a suit, as also is the execution. After final judgment, payment is ordinarily the only defence opeD which will defeat further progress in the proceedings \u2014 the issuance of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">In this case there has been execution upon which the Paper Company\u2019s property has been sold. That the amount of the sale-was nominal is immaterial. The fact discloses the abandonment-of defence by the Insurance Company, their failure to settle the claim, and hence their liability to pay the insured the amount of the indemnity provided, unless it be established that the rendition of the judgment excuses the Insurance Company from further defence of the proceedings. Further evidence to the contrary is-to be found in the provisions of the contract that the assured shall not settle any claim except at his own cost, nor interfere in any negotiation fo,r settlement or in any legal proceeding. The substance of these provisions is, that after notice of the suit to the insurer, unless the company pay him the indemnity, the assured\u2019s control over the matter ceases; he cannot settle the claim, nor can he conduct or direct the litigation. If the company settle or defeat the claim, the liability under which he labors is assumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>and discharged by the insurer. In every possible event except the defeat of their effort to prevent judgment against the insured, the company agree to perform their contract without the previous-payment of anything by the insured. If an exception were intended in this case, it seems probable that it would be plainly stated, or some good reason would be apparent for the different undertaking. None is perceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\">The Insurance Company alone are responsible for the conduct of the suit and for the failure to adjust the claim before judgment. If the intent was that the assured should assume the settlement of the claim when judgment was ordered, it is at least probable that the clause by which he was prohibited from settling any claim, or interfering in any legal proceeding would have been limited by the insertion of the words \u201c before final judgment.\u201d In the absence of such limitation of this prohibition, or of an express limitation of the agreement to defend, it is reasonable to infer that an express provision to that effect would have been inserted if the parties understood that after the Insurance Company had conducted the suit to judgment they should then stand aside and call in the assured and require him to advance money to pay the verdict, which they would instantly be required to repay to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">If a correct construction of clause 8 is that the only obligation of the company is to reimburse the insured for money paid to satisfy a judgment obtained against him, there would seem to be a contradiction in terms. The insured\u2019s loss from the liability insured against-, if lie defends the suit himself, would consist of the amount of the judgment and the expense of contesting the claim, <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Company, </em>56 N. J. Eq. 41. Having agreed upon an indemnity against all loss, and having especially agreed that the insured should be relieved of all expense of contesting legal proceedings, it is not probable that the parties understood that the performance of this part of the agreement should be dependent upon the caprice of the Insurance Company, without legal remedy to the insured for its non-performance. Neither is it probable that it would have been thought necessary to make the payment of indemnity dependent upon a trial of the issue, when the insurer had in fact tried the issue. Whether the provisions of a contract are reasonable or unreasonable, \u2014 whether the engagements into which the parties have entered are such as would probably be made in like circumstances, \u2014 is, as the defendants claim, immaterial when the agreement of the parties is one which they have power to make and is declared in plain unmistakable language. But when the evidence of the agreement furnished by the written contract is not plain and unmistakable, but is open to more than one interpretation, the reasonableness of one meaning as compared with the other, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>and the probability that men in the circumstances of the parties would enter into one agreement or the other, is competent for consideration on the question what the agreement was which the written contract establishes. <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Green, </em>67 N. H. 557. The substance of clauses 2 and 3 is, that upon notice of legal proceedings founded upon an accident covered by the policy the Insurance Company will take over the management of the suit, assume and discharge the risk, reserving the right at any time to terminate the liability by the payment of the indemnity or such part of it as they might agree upon with the assured, as was done in <em>Bain </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>181 Mass. 240. These clauses apply only upon a loss covered by the policy. If the company proceeded thereunder, they might be estopped to deny their liability. <em>Glen Falls etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>11 N. Y. App. Div. 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The purpose and meaning of clause 8 is apparent upon consideration of the situation .which the parties must have contemplated as a probable result of their engagements. It is not probable that the parties contemplated and attempted to provide for the contingency of a suit between themselves upon a claim as to which the liability of the Insurance Company was conceded. An inspection of the policy, which is made a part of the ease, discloses a \u201c special agreement\u201d B and \u201cgeneral agreements\u201d 4 and 5, to the effect that the policy does not cover certain accidental injuries for which the insured might become liable. Whether the policy covered a particular accident, was a question as to which it could be foreseen controversy might arise. It was therefore within the contemplation of the parties that a suit might be brought against the insured for accidental injuries not covered by the policy. No claim except for immediate surgical relief could accrue against the company without notice of a suit. Upon the receipt of such notice, the company was called upon to recognize or deny liability. If they denied their liability, and refused to perform their contract of indemnity in the manner specified in clause 2, such decision would not be binding upon the assured; and in a controversy between the parties, the assumption of the defence by the company might be considered to be an admission of liability under the policy. There was no reason why they should defend if not liable. The purpose of clause 8 was, therefore, to provide for the cases, if any should arise, where the company contended the claim arose from an accident not covered by, the policy. It was intended to limit the liability of the company to damages ascertained by due course of judicial procedure in cases where they could not conduct the defence without waiving their claim that they were not liable, and as to which, if not liable, they were under no obligation to incur any expense. Its purpose was to prevent collusion between the plaintiff and the assured.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>In this case the Insurance Company undertook the investigation of the case, and after suit was brought assumed the entire defence by their counsel and conducted the same to final judgment. The present action is not one respecting a loss by the insured under the policy. The defendants\u2019 contention that the assured have lost nothing because they have paid nothing may, so far as the case is concerned, be conceded. The proceeding is not even to enforce the agreement of the policy to assume the liability; but the plaintiff\u2019s case stands upon the legal result of the assumption of liability by the company. Because they assumed \u2014 in legal effect agreed to pay \u2014 the assured\u2019s liability to this plaintiff to the extent of $5,000, equity requires them to perform their agreement by payment to him. It may also be conceded, though it cannot be decided in this case, that if the insurers had denied liability for any claim arising out of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, or had refused to take charge of the suit, no action could have been maintained against them except by the assured upon payment of a judgment after a trial of the issue. The defendants\u2019 construction of the policy may to this extent be correct, but it has no application to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Counsel for the Insurance Company, in their brief, reach the conclusion that clause 8 does not prevent an action by the assured for breach of the agreement to defend. It is immaterial whether this conclusion is best founded upon a definition of the word \u201closs,\u201d \u2014 upon whether it means \u201cclaim for damages \u201d merely, or both that and the cost of litigation, \u2014 or upon the ground that the contract cannot be understood at the same time to give a right and prohibit its enforcement. It is sufficient that on one ground or the other clause 8 cannot be construed to prohibit an action for a breach of the contract to defend. If it does not, neither does it prohibit an action for breach of the engagements to settle or pay the indemnity to the assured contained in the same clause. If none of these engagements have been performed, the existence of a subsisting obligation on the part of the Insurance Company is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The defendants urge that there is a greater risk of unfavorable verdicts and of greater verdicts in suits like the plaintiff\u2019s against the Paper Company when the defendant is insolvent and not a going concern, and that the policy was intended to protect against this risk by providing that there should be no liability for any policy-holder who was unable to pay the judgment. The difficulty with this argument is that it is not the inability to make payment, but the non-payment, which the construction claimed would make material. If it was intended that insolvency at the time of the trial should avoid the policy, a provision to that effect could easily have been inserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>The insurers chose' to protect themselves from that class of business by declining it, instead \u2019 of providing for the contingency in the policy, or adjusting the premiums charged with reference thereto. The insolvency which prevents payment is insolvency after judgment, and not during the trial, and might, as was the case in <em>Bain </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>181 Mass. 240, be produced by the judgment itself. It does not necessarily follow that because an insured was insolvent he could not arrange for a payment of such a claim. The provision would be entirely ineffective to guard against the risks of insolvency, whatever they are. The Paper Company are not in bankruptcy. There is nothing to prevent their making-some payment to the plaintiff, if not more than the dollar which has already been paid by the sale of their property, and which at least, on the defendants\u2019 own contention, they are now legally liable to pay. Every dollar paid over by the Paper Company would establish a fresh obligation of the Insurance Company to pay, until the $5,000 limit was reached. Insolvency merely could not be a practical defence against the will of the assured. To effect the purpose for which it is claimed the provision was inserted, it would be necessary to limit the insurers\u2019 liability to the reimbursement of the insured for the value of his property sold under execution in a suit upon a claim covered by the policy. It is not probable the object of the provision was a purpose it is so ill-adapted to effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Great stress has been placed upon the two decisions upon like policies in New Jersey and Mame. <em>Frye </em>v. <em>Company, </em>97 Me. <em>241; Travellers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>63 N. J. Eq. 260. In neither of these eases, as has been stated, was any attention given to the stipulations as to the manner in which the contract of indemnity was to be performed, while in the Maine case the parties apparently abandoned these provisions of the contract, for the defence of the original suit was not conducted in accordance with the terms of the present contract, but by the assured and the insurers jointly, and the question of the effect of the assumption of the defence and sole control of the original suit was not and could not have been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The weight of the New Jersey case as an authority is diminished by the opinion in the court of chancery holding the contrary view, which is more in accord with the authorities on the question in this jurisdiction to which reference has been made. Notwithstanding the respect due to the opinions of these courts, the results reached in them cannot be followed in this jurisdiction. The proceeding is in equity and not at law. The facts that the plaintiff is in no way a party to the contract of indemnity, that he paid no part of the consideration, that the contract was one exclusively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>between the Paper Company and the Insurance Company for the protection of the former, upon which reliance is placed, are not decisive in equity. In <em>Holt </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>62 N. H. 55, Holt was not a party to the mortgage which lie sought to enforce. It was not made for his benefit, but to indemnify Gage from his liability as surety. Gage had never been and could not be damnified, because it had been judicially determined that he was not liable to the plaintiff; but Holt\u2019s right to the provision that had been made by his debtor for the ultimate discharge of his debt in case the surety paid was maintained. The ground upon which the plaintiff\u2019s equitable right to the provision made by his debtor for the ultimate discharge of a claim which might arise against him can, consistently with the authorities in this state, be denied, is not apparent. Neither is it clear that the Paper Company, while unable to maintain an action at law upon the policy without payment of the judgment against them, might not in equity obtain such a performance of the contract of indemnity as would protect them without such prior payment. There are authorities in this state and elsewhere tending to sustain power in equity to compel the specific performance of a contract to indemnify before there has been such a breach of the contract as would sustain an action at law. \u201c In equity,\u201d it is said, \u201c the plaintiff need not pay and perhaps ruin himself before seeking relief. He is entitled to be relieved from liability.\u201d <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Association, </em>L. R. 19 Q. B. Div. 458, 460. See, also, <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Association, </em>68 N. H. 305, and cases cited; <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Hunton, </em>70 N. H. 224; <em>Champion </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>6 Johns. Ch. 398; <em>Burroughs </em>v. <em>McNeill, </em>2 Dev. &amp; B. Eq. 297, 302; <em>Central Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Trust Co., </em>87 Fed. Rep. 23; <em>Ranlaugh </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>1 Vern. 190; <em>Lacey </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>L. R. 18 Eq. 182; <em>Wolmershausen </em>v. <em>Gullick, </em>[1893] 2 Ch. 514; <em>Cruse </em>v. <em>Paine, </em>L. R. 6 Eq. 641,\u20144 Ch. App. 441; Sto. Eq. Jur., s. 850; Bisp. Eq., <em>s. </em>331; Lind. Part. 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Except for the provision that the damages must be ascertained by a judgment after a trial of the issue (immaterial in this case, because such trial had been had), clause 8 is a mere statement of the law. The surety cannot sue the principal until he has paid the debt; but that does not prevent the interposition of equity to require the principal to pay and save the surety harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">But it appears sufficient to rest the decision upon an interpretation of the contract which gives effect to all its provisions, avoids any conflict between them, and is fairly and reasonably inferable from the evidence. The view that the contract means that the Insurance company, after taking control of the proceedings in a suit against the assured, cannot thereafter be discharged except by payment of the indemnity to the assured or securing his discharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>from the claim, is thought to best conform to the intent of the parties, and is adopted. Whether in a case where the company did not so proceed the assured could in any form of procedure obtain any benefit from the contract of indemnity, except upon proof of the payment of damages after a trial of the issue, is not now before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">\n<em>Decree for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b530-6\">Walker, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
