What is manufacturing? Dictionaries, encyclopaedias, and other technical authorities may furnish definitions that will materially aid in its solution, but are not of controlling weight. The \u25a0application of common sense, every-day experience, and knowledge of modern industrial conditions, which are understood to be a part of the judicial equipment of every court, is likely to afford the most satisfactory answer to this question; and it is in the opinions of the bench that we find the most luminous discussions and clearest definitions of this subject. For a collection of these authorities and a discriminating discussion of the same, we refer to 19 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law (2d 'ed.) 922 \u2014 926, and 12 <em>lb. </em>345-351. From these authorities, definitions, and discussions, together with the experience, common knowledge, and common sense which the court properly bring to the judicial consideration of the subject, the following are plainly deducible as the distinguishing and \u2022essential elements of manufacturing. First, human agency, involving superintendence, skill, and labor, one or more of them, in \u25a0every case. Second, the employment of certain processes or devices, mechanical, chemical, or otherwise, or the artificial manipulation or combination of natural forces, in a way to produce a commodity for commercial use, as distinguished from the free gifts \u2022of nature, or things in their natural state, such as sunshine, air, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>water, fruits, vegetables, animals, natural oils and gases, wood, timber, coal, minerals, metals, ice found on ponds, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-5\">The liberation of natural gas or oil from the earth and its transportation to market is held not to be manufacturing, but the collection and distribution of a natural product <em>(.Emerson </em>v. <em>Commorir </em>wealth, 108 Pa.

The product of an electric power and light plant is \u201c electrical energy,\u201d a commodity of commerce artificially made by a complicated mechanical process, which can be as accurately measured as a gallon of molasses, as readily distributed on wires as gas or oil is in pipes, and as easily stored and transported in jars as kerosene is in barrels.

The fact is, however, as universally attested by scientific authorities and the actual experience of all who have had the subject under careful observation and treatment, that there is no such thing used, distributed, or sold, as a commercial commodity, as electricity in its natural state. The wide distinction between electricity in nature and the commercial article is generally recognized by the courts also, as will appear in the cases cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>In <em>People </em>v. Wemple, 129 N. Y. 543, the court say: \u201cIf the question, whether a corporation engaged in the business of furnishing electricity for lighting public and private places or for power is a manufacturing company, was made to depend upon the meaning of these words as found in dictionaries, or upon the technical language of science in describing electricity as a power or as an agent hi nature, it would doubtless be difficult and perhaps impossible to show that the process which the relator calls manufacturing produces what in a certain sense and in some form did not exist before. . . . The true inquiry would seem to be whether a corporation organized as this is, and carrying on the business that this does and in the manner shown, would not be considered in common language as engaged in some manufacturing process, or carrying on some manufacturing business, though granting all that is said by experts and others about electricity as a natural element or force. To say that electricity exists in a state of nature, and that a corporation engaged in the business that the relator is collects or gathers it, does not fully or accurately express the process by means of which it is enabled to.sell and deliver something useful and valuable to its customers. The business in which the corporation is engaged renders it necessary, in the first place, to invest a large amount of capital in a plant, which may appropriately enough be called a factory. Then it must purchase and consume a vast amount of coal to produce steam and to furnish power for the operation of machinery. Then it supplies and operates a complicated system of machinery, such as boilers, engines, dynamos, shafting, belting, and such other things as are commonly used in manufacturing establishments; and then by means of wire, cables, and lamps it lights streets and private houses by electricity for a compensation. But the electricity or electric currents that produce these results cannot properly be said to be the free gift of nature, gathered from the air or the clouds. It is the product of capital and labor, and in this respect cannot be distinguished from ordinary manufacturing operations. . . . Passing by the refinements of scientific discussion as to the nature of electricity, it would seem to be common sense to hold that a corporation that does all this is, in every just sense of the term, a manufacturing corporation. ... If due weight is given to the fact that electricity, as now used and applied to the business of life, such as the lighting of streets and buildings, the propulsion of cars and machinery, and like operations, is essentially the product of the skill and labor of man, there is no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that a corporation engaged in the business of generating, storing, transmitting, and selling it is ... a manufacturing corporation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>See, also, <em>Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Power Co., </em>82 Me. 464; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Power Co., </em>145 Pa.

Tlie fostering care of particular infant industries, the solicitude for commercial growth, the success of agriculture, the accumulation of wealth and its retention among the people, the proficiency of our mechanics and artisans, and a home field for their activities, has been the public policy of our legislators from the eighteenth century down to the present time. This is demonstrated by the numerous exemption laws passed since 1786, the preambles to the same, and the legislative purpose of their enactment as expounded by the court from time to time. The legislature originally began by singling out for exemption particular kinds of manufacture, and continued to expand the list until, by the act of 1871 (Laws 1871, <em>c. </em>25, s. 1), towns were given power to exempt establishments for the manufacture of \u201cfabrics of cotton, wool, wood, iron, or any other material.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-6\">The court\u2019s interpretation of this statute excludes from tax exemption all establishments which manufacture commodities in a liquid or gaseous form, as well as electric light and power plants; in short, every kind of manufacturing establishment except those which produce goods in a solid form. We are aware of no decision by our court in which this restrictive view has ever been taken, and it is altogether out of harmony with the manifest, persistent, and uninterrupted trend of legislative intent from 1786 to the present time, to extend and enlarge, and not to contract, the list of industrial exemptions. The legislature for many years dealt with the exemption of manufactures in a specific manner, passing its judgment in each case upon the merits of exempting a particular kind of manufacture or manufacturing establishment, or certain classes of manufactures and establishments. Finally after long experience had^ demonstrated the advantages of the policy when applied on a limited scale, the legislative purpose to extend the system to every branch of lawful manufacture, dependent, of course, upon the vote of each town, was embodied in the revision of the statutes of 1891, and found unmistakable expression in the phrase \u201c any manufacturing establishment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-7\">It would be a strange anomaly to so interpret this statute that a town could exempt from taxation an establishment making wooden toothpicks, but would be debarred from exempting an electric light and power plant upon which its whole system of lighting and transportation and all its other manufacturing industries depended. The term, \u201c any manufacturing establishment \u201d was used in the largest generic sense. The industrial develop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>ment of more than a hundred years, with its multitudinous inventions, mechanical devices, and ever-increasing varieties of manufacture, had demonstrated the wisdom and convenience of the most comprehensive enactment upon the subject of industrial tax exemption.. The language in question was intended to be broad enough to cover not only every species of lawful manufacture that, existed in tlqe state, but any new ones that human invention and enterprise might introduce.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-5\">4. If the court adhere to the opinion that an electric light and power plant is not a manufacturing establishment, such finding\" does not invalidate the vote of the town so far as the sawmill and dressing mill are concerned. It is well settled that where lawful and unlawful exemptions are included in the same vote, and from their nature or situation are severable, the lawful part is sustained, and only the illegal part is held invalid. In such case a proper-apportionment of the taxes is made between the property that is exempt and that which is not. As this principle seems to be challenged in the opinion of the court, we call attention to the following cases: <em>Opinion of </em>Justices, 4 N. Ii. 565; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Burley, </em>9 N. H. 423; <em>Opinion of Justices, </em>45 N. Ii. 590; <em>Bast Kingston </em>v. <em>Towle, </em>48 N. PI. 57; <em>Bow </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>67 N. H. 1; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>69 N.

St. 276.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-6\">It is said in the opinion of the court: \u201c It is not possible to ascertain whether the vote would have been adopted if it had not provided that both kinds of business should be carried on at the establishment. Some of the voters may have 'been induced to favor the scheme by the provision of an electric light and power-plant, and would have voted against it in the absence of such promise,\u201d etc. We are unable to reconcile this language with the principles of construction promulgated by the foregoing authorities and sanctioned from time immemorial by the courts and textbook writers everywhere. This novel rule of interpretation abolishes all the salutary presumptions with which the courts have for hundreds of years fortressed the acts of legislative bodies and the-votes of municipal corporations. Applying it to such acts and votes, how could any of them stand which embraced an illegal feature, for how would it be possible to ascertain whether or not the \u201cvote would have been adopted,\u201d or the act passed, had it not. contained the illegal feature? Who could say that the single unconstitutional feature of a legislative act, otherwise valid, was-not the moving consideration in the minds of enough members to. secure its passage ?</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Chase, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3-G\">Tlie statute under which tlie town acted in making the .exemption to Park reads as follows: \u201cTowns may by vote exempt from taxation for a term not exceeding ten years any manufacturing establishment proposed to be erected or put in operation therein, and the capital to be used in operating the same, unless such establishment has been previously exempted from taxation by some town.\u201d P. S., <em>e. </em>55, s. 11. The establishment contemplated by the town\u2019s vote was to be equipped for furnishing steam and electric power and light and distributing the same,, as well as for manufacturing lumber and wood. It was a single establishment, designed for two independent purposes. While it is possible that a boundary line might be discovered separating the portions of the building and machinery used for one purpose from the portions used for the other, and that the capital might be appropriated in definite shares to the several purposes, it is not possible to ascertain whether the vote would have been adopted if it had not provided that both kinds of business should be carried on at the establishment. Some of the voters may have been induced to favor the scheme by the promise of an electric light and power plant, and would have voted against it in the absence of such promise. Others may have voted for it because they were particularly interested in having a lumber mill established in the town, and were willing to subsidize an electric plant in addition to the mill to secure their wish. See <em>Cox Needle Co. </em>v. <em>Gilford, </em>62 N. H. 503. The provision for having a light and power plant is a material part of the vote, and cannot be separated from the other provisions and treated as void, leaving the latter in force. The action of the town covered both subjects indiscriminately, and must stand or fall as a whole. It therefore is a fundamental question in tlie case whether an establishment designed for furnishing and distributing such power and lights is a \u201cmanufacturing establishment \u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In attempting to answer the question, it must be borne in mind that tlie policy of the state requires tlie taxation of property as a general rule. \u201c Every member of the community has a right to be protected by it in the enjoyment of his life, liberty, and property. He is, therefore, bound to contribute his share in the expense of such protection, and to yield his personal service when necessary, or an equivalent.\u201d Bill of Bights, <em>art. </em>12; Const., <em>art. </em>5. \u201c It will never be assumed that the government intended to release any part of the property entitled to its protection from tlie burden incident to such protection, and it is the duty of those who assert that claim to show it in language which can admit of no other conclusion; and where doubt arises as to the meaning of the lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>guage used which it is claimed confers the exemption, it will be construed most strongly against those who maintain the exemption.\u201d <em>Phillips Exeter Academy </em>v. <em>Exeter, </em>58 N.

The burden is upon Park to clearly show that the legislature intended by the statute to authorize the exemption from taxation of an establisment like his.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u201cAny manufacturing establishment \u201d is a phrase that may have a broad meaning; but was it used in the statute in its broadest sense ? The earliest statutes specified the manufactures that were to have the benefit of exemption. Mills, etc., used for the manufacture of linseed oil (Laws, <em>ed. </em>1792, <em>p. </em>341), for slitting, rolling, or plating iron <em>(1.b p. </em>343), for the manufacture of sail cloth or duck <em>(1.b p. </em>347), and for the manufacture of malt and malt liquors (Laws, <em>ed. </em>1797, <em>p. </em>400), were exempted in the first decade after the adoption of the present constitution. By the act of June 18, 1819, the buildings, machinery, and capital of the Souhegan Nail, Cotton &amp; Woolen Factory, not exceeding in value $30,000, were exempted for a term of ten years. 7 N. H. 310. The preamble of the first act states the reason of its adoption as follows: \u201c Whereas the manufacturing of oil from flaxseed, within this state, will furnish employment for poor persons, have a happy influence on the balance of trade, and greatly contribute to the wealth of the good subjects of this state: Therefore, to encourage the same, Be it enacted,\u201d etc. The prevention of a dram of money from the state .to foreign countries is given as the reason for the enactment of other statutes. The object of them all was to promote the increase, industry, and prosperity of the inhabitants of the state. A careful examination has not brought to notice any statute upon the subject passed between 1819 and 1860. In the latter year an act was passed \u201c to encourage manufactures,\u201d by which the machinery and capital used for the manufacture of \u201c fabrics of cotton or wo'ol, or of both cotton and wool,\u201d might, with the assent of the town, be exempted from taxation for the term of ten years after the passage of the act, \u2014 the town\u2019s assent to have \u201c the force of a contract, and be binding for the full term above specified.\u201d Laws 1860, <em>c. </em>2361, s. 1. By the General Statutes, enacted in 1867, the term of the exemption was made a period not exceeding ten years, to be fixed by the town granting the exemption. In other respects the statute continued the same in substance, although its form was changed. G. S., <em>c. </em>49, s. 9. It seems that prior to 1871 exemption was sought for other industries aside from cotton and woolen manufactures. In 1869, Littleton was specially authorized to exempt an establishment for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>manufacture of hoes, forks, shovels, or scythes. Laws 1869, <em>e. </em>124, <em>s. </em>1. Authority for the exemption of establishments generally engaged in such manufactures and the manufacture of fabrics from other materials was granted by the act of July 7, 1871. The subjects of exemption were described in this act as establishments for the manufacture of \u201cfabrics of cotton, wool, wood, iron, or any other material.\u201d Law's 1871, <em>c. </em>25, <em>s. </em>1. Upon the compilation and revision of the statutes in 1891, the phrase \u201c any manufacturing establishment \u201d was substituted for \u201c any establishment . . . for the manufacture of fabrics of cotton, wool, wood, iron, or any other material,\u201d but without an intention of changing the law. Comm\u2019rs\u2019 Hep. P. S., <em>e. </em>54, <em>h. </em>11. \u201c Manufacturing,\u201d then, in the present statute, is used in the sense of working materials into a fabric or structure for use, as, for example, cotton into cloth, iron into tools, wood into carriages, etc. This is the ordinary meaning of the word, and, independently of the light thrown upon it by the history of the statute, would be regarded as the meaning which the legislature attached to it. The question then resolves itsel f into this: Whether the collection and distribution of electricity, for purposes of power and light, are manufacturing within this sense of the word? Machinery and manual labor are required in the process, but this fact alone does not bring it within the meaning of the word. The product of the machinery and labor must be a fabric or structure made from materials of some kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">It has not yet been discovered what electricity is. Sir Oliver Lodge, an eminent English scientist, said in a lecture delivered in 1880 : \u201c We cannot assert that it is a form of matter, neither can we deny it; on the other hand, we certainly cannot assert that it is a form of energy, and I should be disposed to deny it. It may be that electricity is an entity <em>per He, </em>just as matter is an entity <em>per se.\u201d </em>In a lecture delivered the present year, he seems to give assent to the theory that it is matter in a fourth state, consisting of something very much smaller than atoms, \u2014 \u201c ultra-atomic corpuscles,\u201d \u2014 which revolve about each other within atoms at tremendous speed. The knowledge of electricity thus far acquired certainly does not warrant one to speak of it as a manufacture. In common speech, an electric light and power plant is not spoken of as a manufacturing establishment. In enumerating the manufacturing industries of a town, the electric plant would not ordinarily be included. It is true that the collection of electricity is sometimes spoken of as manufacturing it; but in such cases other words are usually added, as generating, producing, supplying,\u2014 showing a consciousness that- \u201c manufacturing \u201d does not correctly express the idea. Laws 1881, <em>re. </em>233, 237, 241; Laws 1887, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>cc. </em>237, 243, 247, 287, 292. The charter of the Franklin Gas and Electric Light Company probably describes the process more nearly correctly by the words \u201cproduce, collect, and store.\u201d Laws 1887, <em>c. </em>261, s. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">There is direct evidence that the legislature did not intend by this statute to authorize the exemption from taxation of electric light plants. By an act approved March 25, 1897, a vote of the town of Franconia, \u201c exempting from taxation an electric light plant, to be established in said town,\u201d was made legal and valid. Laws 1897, <em>c. </em>208. Of course, this vote would have been unnecessary if it had been understood that the general statute authorized the town to grant the exemption. If it be said that doubts existed whether the general statute authorized the vote, and the special statute was passed to remove them, the evidence in that view is scarcely less effective in establishing the proposition that the general statute does not authorize such exemption; for by the well established principle of law above mentioned, the doubts should be construed most strongly against the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">A similar question has arisen in other jurisdictions, but the decisions are conflicting. In a recent Maryland case it was held that an electric light company does not carry on a \u201c manufacturing industry,\u201d within the meaning of a city ordinance exempting* from municipal taxation \u201cthe machinery and manufacturing apparatus of all manufacturing industries \u201d located in the city. <em>Frederick etc. Co. </em>v. Frederick, 84 Md. 599. In New York it was held that such a company was a \u201c manufacturing corporation,\u201d within the meaning of a statute exempting manufacturing corporations from taxation. <em>People </em>v. <em>Wemple, </em>129 N. Y. 543. See, also, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Power Co., </em>145 Pa. St. 105; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Power Co., </em>170 Pa. St. 231; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Power Co., </em>193 Pa. St. 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The real question is: What was the intention expressed by the language of the legislature in this case ? In view of the ordinary meaning of the terms used in the statute, the policy of the state, and the evidence furnished by the history of the legislation on the subject and the action of the legislature in the Franconia case, it does not clearly appear, to say the least, that the legislature intended to authorize the exemption of property of this kind. As exemption of the electric plant is so connected with the exemption of the other property mentioned in the vote that it cannot be separated and treated independently, the entire vote must fail and be regarded as unauthorized and void.</p>\n<p id=\"AGz\">This conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider the question of the constitutional power of the legislature to authorize towns to exempt property from taxation, and the other questions argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>in the briefs. Tlie petition should be granted so far as it relates to property situated in Warren. <em>Boody </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>64 N. h. 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b343-6\">Parsons, C.
