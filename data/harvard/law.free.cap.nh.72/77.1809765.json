Hearing before <em>Young, </em>J., at the March term, 1902, of the superior court, \u201c to determine to what extent and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>what manner, as to preference or otherwise, water was actually and usually used at the box factory, October 26, 1872, and prior thereto,\u201d as required by the former opinion of the court in this case. <em>Horne </em>v. <em>Hutchins, </em>71 N. H. 128, 137.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-5\">The defendant excepted to the exclusion of certain deeds and leases of the box factory, offered for the purpose of showing what rights were actually attached to the box factory on the date in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-6\">The defendant requested the court to report the evidence tending to show that originally there were two five-foot, center-vent wheels in the Hutchins penstock; that one of them was changed in 1870 for a thirty-six-inch Cook wheel, which was rated to use thirty-three cubic feet of water per second, under, a fourteen-foot head; and that the five-foot, center-vent wheel used considerably less water than the Cook wheel. The court refused to report these facts, on the ground that they were merely evidentiary, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-7\"><em>Leslie P. Snow </em>and <em>Sewall W. Abbott, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-8\"><em>James A. Edgerly </em>and <em>Arthur L. Foote, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b106-9\">Remick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsL\">In <em>Horne </em>v. <em>Hutchins, </em>71 N. H. 128, it was settled that in the deed of Cate to Hodge &amp; Remick, Cate \u201c adopted the physical state of the property at the date of the Hersey, Thompson &amp; Co. deed [October 26,1872], and the extent and manner of the use made of the water at that time in connection with the box factory, as the standard for measuring the rights and privilege conveyed by him.\u201d By this construction, it became immaterial what rights Cate or his grantors had previously assumed to convey or lease, or what rights they might have conveyed or leased had they seen fit to do so. Having adopted the physical state of the property and the actual use made of the water as the standard for measuring the. rights conveyed by the deed, it only remained for the superior court to ascertain what the physical situation was. The deeds and leases offered by the defendant disclose nothing bearing upon that inquiry, and were properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">It does not appear that the evidence as to the water wheels, which the superior court refused to report at the request of the defendant, if reported, would have presented any question of law. The defendant\u2019s request was therefore properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b106-12\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
