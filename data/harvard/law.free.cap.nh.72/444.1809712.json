Trial by jury and verdict for the plaintiff. Transferred from the September term, 1902, of the superior court by <em>Stone, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-9\">The issue tried was whether John D. Bean in his lifetime gave-the plaintiff, who is his daughter, sixty-seven shares of the capital stock of the West End Street Railway Company standing in his name and unassigned at the time of his decease. Mrs. Bean, a witness for the plaintiff, testified that two or three years before Mr. Bean\u2019s death he handed to the plaintiff a certificate of stock in the West End Street Railway, accompanying it with the remark, \u201cI have got something for you \u2014 good paying stock \u2014 and I want you to keep it for your own \u201d; that she did not know the-number of shares the certificate represented; that she afterward at different times saw the certificate in the plaintiff\u2019s room; and that Mr. Bean paid the plaintiff the money received from dividends on the stock while he lived, and at one time when doing so-said, \u201cThis is your West End Railway dividend.\u201d Miss Gilman, who was present at the time of the delivery of the stock, testified that she saw Mr. Bean pass the certificate to the plaintiff and heard him say, \u201cHere is a certificate of the West End Street-Railway stock that I am going to give you for your own, to offset your mother\u2019s Concord Railroad stock \u201d; that the plaintiff took it, and that the witness afterward saw it in her possession; and that she saw Mr. Bean hand money to the plaintiff, describing it as-her West End dividends. Mrs. Bean was the widow of John D., Miss Gilman was their housekeeper, and the evidence tended to show that the delivery took place two or three years before Bean\u2019s death, while they were at the dining table at their home. Other witnesses testified to matters in corroboration of the facts above narrated. The defendants\u2019 motions for a nonsuit and a verdict in their favor were denied, subject to exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-10\">At the close of the argument for the plaintiff, the defendants\u2019 counsel handed to the court the following writing: \u201c Remarks of counsel excepted to: \u2018I do not believe this good lady is false to-you or to anybody else.\u2019 \u2018 I believe that the money was intended for the wife and daughter.\u2019\u201d This objection was not called to-the attention of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel at the time the remarks, were made, or at the time the writing was submitted to the court, and counsel had no knowledge that any objection had been made to the argument until after the case had been submitted to the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>jury and they had retired from the court room. He then requested that the jury might be recalled in order that the statements might be withdrawn, if incompetent, which the court declined to do. The exception to the charge is sufficiently stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b474-5\"><em>Joseph W. Fellows </em>and <em>Burnham, Brown Warren, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b474-6\"><em>Mitchell 8f Foster </em>and <em>Taggart, Tuttle Burroughs, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b474-7\">Bingham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALt\">The defendants contend that the verdict cannot be sustained for the following reasons: (1) That the evidence was insufficient to warrant the jury in finding a completed gift; (2) that there was error in the charge to the jury; and (3) that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel made improper statements in his closing .argument. We will consider the objections raised in the order named.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\"><bracketnum>1.</bracketnum> The court held in <em>Bean </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>71 N. H. 538, 541, that \u201c in the case of a gift <em>inter vivos </em>the evidence should be sufficient to render a finding of the fact of delivery reasonable, and should disclose the circumstances under which the delivery occurred; that it may appear that the gift was absolute, not conditional; that it was complete, not made in the donor\u2019s last sickness, or on his death-bed and in view of death.\u201d The evidence adduced in this case would seem to answer these requirements. There was positive testimony that the certificate of stock was delivered to the donee, accompanied by words declaring the donor\u2019s intention to make the gift, and at a time and under circumstances such that it could be found that the gift was absolute; and the jury have so found. The delivery of the stock with an intent to make a completed gift, and its acceptance by the donee, vested in her the equitable title to the property. The fact that the certificate was not indorsed did not render the gift incomplete as a matter of law. It was evidence bearing upon the intention with which the donor made the gift, to be considered by the jury with the other evidence in the case. <em>Blazo </em>v. <em>Cochrane, </em>71 N. H. 585, 587 ; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>50 Conn. 472; <em>Allerton </em>v. <em>Lang, </em>10 Bosw. 362; <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Sexton, </em>55 Barb. 251; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crompton, </em>137 Pa. St. 138; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>99 Va. 495; <em>Lawler </em>v. <em>Kell, </em>6 Ohio Dec. 311; <em>Leyson </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>17 Mont. 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> The request for instructions was given in substance. The defendants cannot complain because the exact language of their request was not followed. As was said in <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>71 N. H. 271, 273, \u201cthe substance of the requested charge having been given, it is no ground of exception that ... a particular form of expression was not used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\"><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> It is unnecessary to consider whether the statement of counsel in his closing argument was proper or improper, for in the view we take of the case no exception was saved entitling the defendants to question the legitimacy of the argument. It appears that counsel for the defendants did not undertake to procure an exception to the alleged improper statement until after opposing counsel had finished his argument, and did not bring his objection to the attention of opposing counsel until after the jury had retired to deliberate. In order to save an exception of this nature, an objection should be taken at the time the alleged improper statement is made, or within a reasonable time thereafter; and counsel taking the objection should see that it is brought to the attention of opposing counsel, as well as to that of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In <em>Story </em>v. Railroad, 70 N. H. 364, 379, the court said that an \u201c objection to incompetent evidence of counsel in argument should be taken as to other incompetent evidence \u2014 when it is offered \u201d ; that \u201cthe error ... is not in all cases incurable \u201d; that \u201c an immediate correction of the error may save the trial \u201d; that \u201c at no time can such correction be made with greater probability of removing the wrongful effect than at the time of utterance \u201d; and that \u201c for counsel, conscious of the error, to be permitted to sit by without making objection until there is less probability the wrong can be cured, would be to turn a rule of, justice and fairness into a mere trap.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Lumber Co., </em>68 N. H. 89, 91, the defendants sought to avail themselves of an exception by presenting to the court during the argument a writing stating theii objection; but as \u201cthis exception was not called to the attentiomof the plaintiff\u2019s\u2019 counsel, and he had no knowledge of it until after the trial,\u201d the court refused to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b475-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
