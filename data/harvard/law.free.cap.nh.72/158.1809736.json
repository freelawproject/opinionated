Mason gave to his brother, Francis L., a mortgage upon the three parcels of land described in the writ of entry, conditioned to secure his note of $1,000, payable to said Francis, or order, in one year from date with interest, the consideration for the note being borrowed money. October 24,1898, the plaintiff brought a suit against Mahlon, and in April, 1900, recovered judgment in the sum of $805.02. The land in question was attached upon this writ, and the execution issued in the suit was levied upon an undivided half of the three parcels, the levy being commenced within thirty days from the date of judgment' by the appointment of three' appraisers in the manner provided by law. The levy was completed July 3, 1900, and the plaintiff was put in possession of the land so set off, in full satisfaction of her judgment and the taxable costs thereon. The levy was made regardless of the real estate mortgage, and was duly recorded in the registry of deeds, July 6, 1900. At the time .the mortgage was given Mahlon was the owner of an undivided half of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-11\">Francis L. Mason died in 1899. His will was probated in February, 1900, and an administrator with the will annexed was appointed in August. The will contained two small bequests of less than $100, and gave and devised all the rest and residue of the estate to Catherine, the testator\u2019s wife, and to Nathaniel ,R. Mason, his nephew, in equal shares. July 24, 1900, Catherine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>sold to Nathaniel all the right, title, and interest which she had under the will. In December, 1901, the administrator charged Nathaniel with \u00a1Bl,265 (the amount o\u00ed the mortgage note at that time), and credited the estate with the same amount, and later transferred the mortgage to Nathaniel by a writing upon the bach, in terms as follows: \u201cNorth Conway, N. II., February 28, 1902. In consideration of the sum of twelve hundred and sixty-five dollars, 1 hereby sell and assign to Nathaniel li.

Mason, it is to be assumed that by the extent the plaintiff acquired whatever interest Mahlon had in the land, and as against him is entitled to the possession. <em>Coos Bank </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>2 N. H. 118; <em>Pritchard </em>v. <em>Brown, 4 </em>N. H. 397, 402, 404; <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>9 N. H. 20, 22; <em>Wendell </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>9 N. H. 404, 418; <em>Hovey </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>34 N. H. 278; <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>44 N. H. 288; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Barnard, </em>60 N. H. 550, 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">But is she entitled to the possession as against Nathaniel? The fair meaning of the case is that by the will of Francis, the purchase by N athaniel of Catherine\u2019s interest thereunder, and the settlement of the administrator\u2019s account, Nathaniel became the owner of the debt and mortgage upon which he bases his claim to the land. He was under no obligation to pay- his father\u2019s debt; and the entries made by the administrator, wherein he charged Nathaniel with the amount of the note and credited the estate with a like amount, tended to show that Nathaniel thereby became the owner of the mortgage debt. And such a finding is included in the court\u2019s order denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment against Nathaniel. Being the owner of the debt and mortgage, and in possession of the premises, this action cannot be maintained against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b187-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
