J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-11\">The plaintiffs\u2019 evidence tended to prove the following facts: In the spring of 1901, Peter S. Laducer was keeping a shoe store-in Claremont, and the plaintiffs sold him at that time the property in controversy, to be delivered in the early fall and to be paid for December 1. In June, Laducer sold his business to one Mineau. After Mineau became the owner, Laducer told him of the order he had given, and the understanding between them was that Mineau should have the goods when they arrived. About August 27, the plaintiffs sent a bill of the goods to Laducer and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>shipped the goods to him. When he received the bill he took it to \"Minean, and on August 28 wrote to the plaintiff's that he wished to be relieved and that Mineau would take the goods and pay for them. The plaintiffs accepted the proposition, charged the goods to Mineau, and on September 3 wrote Laducer to that effect. Mineau notified the defendant on August 28 that he was to have the goods and pay for them; and prior to receiving tire bill of the goods from Laducer, he wrote the plaintiff's that he would take them and heard from them to that effect. The defendant, on August 30, after he had been informed that Mineau was to have the goods and while they were on board a car at the railroad station in Claremont, attached them on a writ which he caused to issue against Laducer. After August 30 and prior to September 4, Mineau went to the station to procure the goods, found them attached on the defendant\u2019s writ against Laducer, was unable to obtain possession of the goods, and gave up getting them. September 4, the defendant induced Laducer to sign an order to release the goods from the custody of the sheriff. Laducer did not intend to sell the goods to the defendant, and the defendant paid nothing for them. Laducer never took possession of the goods. The defendant gave Laducer money to pay the freight charges, which he did, and the goods were taken by the defendant from the railroad and converted to his use. He gave Laducer credit for their value on a claim of $51,100 which he had against him. The defendant recovered judgment against Laducer, but never took out execution or made any levy upon the goods, and claims title by virtue of a sale from Laducer to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-9\">'The defendant\u2019s motion for a nonsuit was denied, subject to exception.
