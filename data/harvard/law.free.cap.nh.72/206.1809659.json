Trial by jury and verdict for the plaintiff. Transferred from the November term, 1902, of the superior court by <em>&gt;St,one, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b235-6\">The railroad curves toward the east as it approaches Winnisquam crossing from the north at a descending grade. From a point about 200 feet north of the crossing to a point about 750 feet north of it, there is a bank on the easterly side of the track, which varies in height above the rails from three and a quarter feet at the former point to twenty-five feet at the latter. The highway approaches the railroad from the east at a descending grade. A person standing in the middle of the traveled part of the highway, twenty-five feet east of the easterly rail, can see a locomotive at a point 500 feet north of the crossing. From a point in the highway twelve feet east of the easterly rail, a locomotive is visible when 579 feet north of the crossing. The accident occurred about an hour after sunset. The sky was somewhat cloudy. The ground was frozen. The train which struck Stone was the south-bound Montreal express, known as No. 184, and at the time of the accident was running a few minutes behind its schedule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to prove the following facts: Stone was thirty-four years old, in good health, and possessed all his faculties. For three weeks immediately preceding his death he had been employed as a farm laborer by Martha Bowers of Sanbornton, for whom he had worked on a former occasion. He frequently drove to Laconia, and on each trip passed over the Winnisquam crossing. At the time of the accident he was driving a safe horse attached to a hay-rack containing an empty barrel and a tin wash-boiler. As he drove upon the crossing from the east he was struck by the locomotive, and received injuries which caused his death. A witness for the plaintiff testified that he was listening for the whistle, and that it was not sounded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-8\">The defendants\u2019 evidence tended to prove the following facts: A traveling engineer of the defendants, who occupied the fireman\u2019s seat in the cab of the locomotive, first observed Stone when the team was about two rods from the crossing, and the. train was about 800 feet from it. Stone was apparently looking straight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>ahead, and did not turn or seem to pay any attention to the train. The horse was trotting at a rate of about five miles an hour. In response to the question whether Stone could have then stopped and avoided the collision, the witness replied that he did not know. It was admitted that no danger signal was given after Stone was first observed from the locomotive. The defendants\u2019 evidence also tended to prove that the crossing whistle was regularly sounded, that the headlight was burning, that the speed of the train was about forty miles an hour, and that all means were employed to stop the train after Stone was observed in dangerous proximity to the track.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-5\">The widow of the decedent was asked on direct examination if \u201c there had - been hard times in Laconia.\u201d An exception was claimed, but before it could be fully stated the witness answered in the affirmative. The court thereupon excluded the question and said to the jury: \u201c It will make no difference to you whether the times are easy or otherwise.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-6\">Subject to the defendants\u2019 exception, the decedent\u2019s widow was permitted to testify that she rode over the Winnisquam crossing with her husband in the autumn of 1901; that he then drove slowly, listened, and said that the crossing was dangerous; and that he made the same remark at the same place at other times. Martha Bowers was permitted to give similar testimony in corroboration, subject to exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-7\">Subject to exception, on the ground that the witness was not qualified to give an opinion, George Plummer, who was a passenger on the day of the accident and had traveled by the same train five or six times in three years, testified that the speed of the train \u201cmight have been sixty miles an hour.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-8\">Subject to exception, a watch alleged to have been carried by the decedent at the t\u00fane of the accident was produced and shown to the jury, for the purpose of showing the time at which it stopped.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-9\">Three witnesses who. were passengers on the train, and who were not listening, testified that they did not hear a crossing whistle, subject to exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-10\">Subject to the defendants\u2019 exception, Daniels, a witness called by the plaintiff, testified that many times before and since the death of Stone he had timed the speed of train No. 184 between stations a few miles south of Winnisquam crossing, and that a distance of three miles was frequently covered in three and a quarter or three 'and a third minutes. One witness testified, subject to exception, that a few days before the trial he made observations as to the speed of train No. T84, and computed it to be fifty and a half miles an hour. Another witness testified, subject to exception, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>that a few days before the trial he made observations of the reflections from the headlight of a train supposed to be No. 184, and that the light was not thrown upon the highway at a point thirty feet distant from the crossing, nor upon any objects visible from that point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-5\">The defendants seasonably moved for a nonsuit and that a verdict be directed in their favor. Both motions were denied, and they excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-6\"><em>Shannon Young </em>and <em>Beckford ft &gt; Hibbard, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-7\"><em>Jewett Plummer </em>and <em>Streeter Hollis, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b237-8\">Remtck, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqt\"><bracketnum>1.</bracketnum> The question and answer regarding the condition of the \u201ctimes\u201d in Laconia were not \u201cso inconsistent with legal fairness of trial as to make it a matter of law' that there should be a new trial,\u201d especially in view of the immediate action of the court excluding the evidence and instructing the jury not. to heed it. <em>Aldrich </em>v.

H. 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> Bearing upon the probability whether the decedent exercised care at the crossing upon the occasion in question, it was competent to show by the decedent\u2019s widow and Martha Bowers that in passing over the crossing upon previous occasions he had remarked upon its dangerous character and taken precautions against collision.

H. 416 ; <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Freezer Co., </em>70 N. H. 3; <em>Whitcher </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>70 N. H. 242, 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\"><bracketnum>7.</bracketnum> The motions for nonsuit and verdict were properly denied. There was evidence that the defendants did not give the eighty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>rod whistle required by statute for the protection of travelers at railroad crossings, and it was admitted that no warning whistle was given by the defendants when they discovered the decedent about two rods from the crossing, approaching the crossing and apparently paying no attention to the approach of the train. Upon the case presented by the record, we think reasonable men might find that the decedent\u2019s injury was caused by the defendants\u2019 negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">But it is urged that the decedent was guilty of contributory negligence. In view of the evidence of the decedent\u2019s frequent recognition of the dangerous character of the crossing and of his previous care in passing over it, \u2014 that on the occasion in question he was traveling in a' hay-rack containing an empty barrel and tin wash-boiler, over frozen ground, upon a night more or less dark,\u2014 that the statutory whistle was not given, \u2014 that the schedule time for the crossing of the train had passed, \u2014 that the track was &lt;obscured by the lay of the land in the vicinity of the crossing so that the decedent could not see the train 300 feet away until he was within about two.rods of the crossing, \u2014 that his horse, attached to the rigging mentioned, was trotting at the rate of about five miles an hour when the two-rod point was reached, \u2014 we think it cannot be said as matter of law that the decedent was guilty of contributory negligence, upon the mere evidence of the traveling engineer (the weight and credibilhy of which might be materially affected in the minds of the jury by the other evidence and circumstances bearing upon its probability), that he saw the decedent about two rods from the crossing, when the train was about 300 feet away, looking straight ahead and apparently paying no attention to the approaching train, especially in view of the statement &lt;of the witness that he did not know whether the decedent would then have had time to stop and avoid the injury. The case is distinguishable from <em>Waldron </em>v. Railroad, 71 N. H. 362, and is more like <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>70 N. H. 53, <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>68 N. H. 247, 248, <em>Folsom </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>68 N. H. 454, <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>66 N. H. 194, <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>66 N. H. 200, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>52 N. H. 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b238-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
