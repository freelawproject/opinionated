Ferrin, </em>71 N. H. 33, 36), nor whether the law will or will not presume from the delivery of money that the transaction was a loan, rather than a gift or the payment of a debt <em>(Coburn </em>v. <em>Storer, </em>67 N. H. 86, 87), but is whether there was any evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that it was a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">There was evidence that in 1898 the plaintiff received from her sister\u2019s estate $525, which under our statute she was entitled to hold to her separate use, free from the interference or control of the defendant (P. 8., <em>e. </em>176, <em>s. </em>1; <em>Clough </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>55 N. H. 279; <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>50 N. H. 479, 482); that the defendant had previously purchased a farm for a home, which was subject to a mortgage; that at the time in question there was due on the mortgage debt about $1,300; that at the defendant\u2019s request the plaintiff let him have the $525 received from the sister\u2019s estate, for the purpose of making a payment on this debt; that she understood it was a loan, expected the money would be repaid, and did not know how the defendant could understand it in any other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-14\">From this evidence the jury could find that there was a mutual understanding between the husband and wife that the transaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>was a loan. <em>Bickford </em>v. <em>Dane, </em>58 N.
