Facts agreed, and case transferred from the November term, 1902, of the superior court by Young, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-13\">The defendant was employed by the city of Berlin as a laborer in the street department. He was hired by and worked under John B. Noyes, highway commissioner of the city. May 17,1902, the defendant, for a valuable consideration, assigned to Joseph Lambert all wages to be earned while in the employ of the city. The assignment was presented to Noyes, who wrote upon its face, \u201cAccepted, John B. Noyes, street commissioner.\u201d The assignment and alleged acceptance were duly recorded with the city clerk. Subsequently this action was begun, and the plaintiff attached the goods, effects, and credits of the defendant in the hands of the city. The city disclosed 128.88 due on account of the defendant\u2019s labor, set up the assignment, and denied its liability. The city council never authorized the highway commissioner or any other person to ' accept assignments drawn upon it. For several years the highway commissioner had been accustomed to accept assignments of wages made by men working under him, and the wages afterward earned by the assignors had been paid to the assignees by the city treasurer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The court ordered judgment for the claimant, and the plaintiff' excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-5\"><em>John E.

It is further agreed that \u201cfor several years the highway commissioner had been accustomed to accept assignments of wages made by men working under him, and the wages afterward earned by the assignors had been paid to the assignees by the city treasurer.\u201d From this course of dealing, the superior court was warranted in finding that the city had constituted the highway commissioner its agent to make acceptances of assignments of future earnings by those employed in his department. 1 Dill.

In this view it is unnecessary to consider whether acceptance by the highway commissioner, by virtue of his office alone, would have-answered the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The objection to the form of the acceptance is without merit. <em>Janvrin </em>v. <em>Exeter, </em>48 N.
