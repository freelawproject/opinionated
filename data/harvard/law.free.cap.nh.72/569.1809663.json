Lee and the guardian of his only child, to avoid a fraudulent conveyance. Transferred from the April term, 1903, of the superior court by <em>Peaslee, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-14\">John J. Lee had a son by Sarah Stewart and had promised to marry her; but having made up his mind to prevent her and his son from taking any part of his property, made a voluntary conveyance of his real estate to his sister Kate, the defendant, with the purpose of defeating Sarah\u2019s rights as his wife and his son\u2019s rights as his heir if he concluded to marry Sarah, or to defeat her rights as a creditor if lie concluded not to marry her. After he made the conveyance he refused to marry Sarah, and she sued for a breach of his promise of marriage, recovered judgment, begun a levy, and brought a bill in equity in aid of it to uncover the property conveyed by him. The bill was marked for a hearing at the April term, 1899. Before the case was reached, John, in pursuance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>his original fraudulent purpose, concluded to marry Sarah, if by so doing he could induce her to discontinue the equity proceeding and release her judgment; and in order to accomplish this purpose, he promised that he would marry her and procure a reconveyance of his property, so that her rights as his wife and her son\u2019s rights as his heir would attach. Relying on this promise, Sarah released her judgment, discontinued the bill in equity, and married him. John did not intend to keep his promise, and made it as part of a conspiracy with the defendant and others to prevent Sarah and his son from receiving any benefit from his property. Sarah did not know of the conspiracy until after John\u2019s death. Kate was not present when the deed to her was made. John executed it and had it recorded, and it was delivered to her in his lifetime, but he retained possession of the property until he died. His estate is insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-5\">There was a decree for the widow and the administrator, and the bill was dismissed as to the guardian, and the defendant and the guardian excepted. After the ease had been heard Sarah moved to be reinstated as a judgment creditor, and the guardian moved that the damages caused to her ward\u2019s estate by John\u2019s failure to perform the agreement with Sarah for the child\u2019s benefit be allowed and assessed in this proceeding. Both motions were denied, subject to exception. An exception was also taken to the finding that the deed to Kate was delivered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b598-6\"><em>Matthews Sawyer </em>and <em>Martin </em>cf Howe, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b598-7\"><em>Mitchell </em>cf <em>Foster </em>and <em>Sargent, Niles </em>cf <em>Morrill, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b598-8\">Young, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALZ\">The statute of 13 Elizabeth <em>(c. </em>5) provides in substance that a fraudulent conveyance is voidable by those who are injured by it; so the only persons who can avoid a fraudulent conveyance are those who might take the property from the grantor or from his heirs if no conveyance had been made. <em>Esty </em>v. <em>Long, </em>41 N. H. 103; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>47 N. H. 532; <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Inglehart, </em>7 G. &amp; J. 132,\u201428 Am. Dec. 202; Bump Fr. Con., <em>ss. </em>432, 433, 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">A conveyance tainted with actual fraud as to any persons may be avoided not only by those whose claims were in existence at the time the conveyance was made, but also by those whose claims accrued thereafter. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>6 N. H. 67; <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Crooker, </em>8 N. H. 288, 290; <em>McConihe </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>12 N. H. 396; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>39 N. H. 557; <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>Melvin, </em>42 N. H. 510; <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>49 N. H. 69; <em>Plaisted </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>58 N. H. 619; <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Cutter, </em>64 N. H. 461; Bump Fr. Con., <em>s. </em>32.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>If a conveyance is made to defeat the rights of the grantor\u2019s wife, or of his creditors, it will not lose its fraudulent character as to any of them unless they confirm it or are in some other way estopped to attack it. Bump Fr. Con., s. 456. If it is fraudulent-as to the creditors of a deceased person, the administrator may maintain a bill in equity to avoid it as their representative if it is necessary to do so to pay the debts of the deceased. <em>Kingsbury </em>v. <em>Wild, </em>3 N. H. 30; <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Read, </em>3 N. H. 55 ; <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Tenney, </em>18 N. H. 109 ; <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>47 N. H. 329, 333 ; <em>Janvrin </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>63 N. H. 312; <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Cutter, </em>64 N. H. 461; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Clough, </em>65 N. H. 43, 80. When it is fraudulent as to all the creditors, and the estate is insolvent, the administrator after a decree in his favor may treat the property as though no conveyance had been made, and sell so much of it as is necessary to pay the debts of the deceased and the expenses of administration, including the expense of the proceeding to avoid the fraudulent conveyance. <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Tenney, </em>18 N. H. 109, 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In this case John made the conveyance in controversy to prevent Sarah from satisfying any judgment she might recover if he decided not to marry her; and since the creditors could take the property from John\u2019s heirs if no conveyance had been made, it is void so far as their claims are - concerned. As to them, the property stands as though no conveyance had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">A widow may avoid a conveyance made to defeat her marital rights. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>66 N. H. 390. It follows that Sarah may maintain this proceeding as John\u2019s widow, for the conveyance was made to defeat her rights as his wife if he decided to marry her, and it is found that she has not confirmed the conveyance and is not estopped to attack it. Although the fact that she had known of the conveyance for some time before her marriage to John is evidence tending to prove that she confirmed it and is estopped to attack it, still this fact does not, as a matter of law, establish either proposition. <em>Derry Bank </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>44 N. H. 548, 550; <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>65 N. Y. 73, 79; Bump Fr. Con., s. 456. The fault with the defendant\u2019s contention that the validity of the conveyance, so far as Sarah is concerned, is <em>res judicata, </em>lies in the fact that the proceedings she brought in aid of her levy were dismissed on her motion. There must be a final judgment on the merits in order that the judgment may create an estoppel. <em>Hearn </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>67 N. H. 320; <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Company, </em>69 N. H. 247; <em>Pittsfield </em>v. <em>Exeter, </em>69 N. H. 336; <em>Ordway </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>69 N. H. 429; <em>Bank Commissioners </em>v. <em>Association, </em>70 N. H. 557; <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>71 N. H. 448; <em>Boston </em>&amp; <em>Maine R. R. </em>v. Sargent, <em>ante, p. </em>455.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">An heir takes through \u2014 not from \u2014 his ancestor; so the guar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>dian cannot maintain this proceeding on the strength of her ward\u2019s right as John\u2019s heir. <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>8 N. H. 391; <em>Esty </em>v. Long, 41 N. H. 103; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>47 N. H. 532. If the guardian has any right in. behalf of her ward as a creditor, such interest is protected by the decree in favor of the administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">There was no error of law in overruling Sarah\u2019s motion for reinstatement as a judgment creditor and the guardian\u2019s motion for the assessment of her ward\u2019s damages. Whether or not justice required that these motions should be granted were questions of fact. Whether or not the deed was delivered was also a question of fact, so there was no legal error in the finding that it was delivered if there was evidence to support it. If a person intends to give his property to another and makes a deed in pursuance of that intention, the deed is delivered whenever it comes into the'possession of the donee and is accepted by him. <em>Canning </em>v. <em>Pinkham, </em>1 N. H. 353; <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Swett, </em>31 N. H. 332, 340<em>; Cook </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>34 N. H. 460. There was evidence that John made the deed intending to put his property into Kate\u2019s hands to defraud Sarah and her son, and that the deed came into Kate\u2019s possession and was accepted by her before John died.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The exceptions as to the admission of evidence were not argued and have not been considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b600-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
