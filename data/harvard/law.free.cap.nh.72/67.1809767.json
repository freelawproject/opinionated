Upon this petition a hearing was had, and July 31,1902, the selectmen made a return of the lay-out. Under a sufficient warrant, a town-meeting was held August 23, 1902, when it was \u201c voted to rescind all action taken by the selectmen relating to a proposed new road or highway in Canaan, so called.\u201d Since this 'time the selectmen have refused to build the road. September 30, taxpayers and citizens of Tuftonborough filed an appeal from the lay-out, which is still pending. The court dismissed the petition, and the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b96-3\"><em>Small W. Abbott </em>and <em>J.

H. 588; <em>Currier </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>68 N. H. 596); whether, if it is, it is not prematurely brought pending an appeal from the laying out; whether the plaintiffs are proper parties; and whether the highway in question is one the selectmen had power to lay out <em>(Griffin\u2019s Petition, </em>27 N. H. 343), are questions which it is unnecessary to decide, since it appears that the highway in question has been discontinued. The vote of the town of August 23, \u201c to rescind all action taken by the selectmen relating \u201d to the proposed new road or highway, sufficiently states the purpose to discontinue the same. The \u201c action taken by the selectmen \u201d was the laying out of the highway in question, and the evident purpose of the vote was to nullify the action of the selectmen so far as the town had power to do so. <em>As </em>the power of the town to discontinue the highway is not denied (P. S., <em>c. </em>72, <em>s. </em>1), and as the exercise of that power was the apparent purpose of the voters, shown by competent evidence, the highway, if legally laid out, was legally discontinued.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"A86\">Chase, J., was absent: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
