When the tomatoes arrived at Scranton, defendant rejected them as not of the quality and condition purchased. Th\u00e9 defense was two-fold: (1) that the defendant bought of Stanley as principal, and not of plaintiff through Stanley\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>agency; (2) that in any event the sale memorandum signed by Stanley was insufficient to charge defendant under section <em>4 </em>of the Sales Act of 1915 P. L. 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\">The trial judge directed a verdict for defendant on the ground that section 4 barred recovery. That action, and the exclusion of an item of evidence on damages, are assigned error. The pertinent part of section 4 is as follows: \u201cA contract to sell or a sale of goods......of the value of $500 or upwards shall not be enforceable by action unless.......some note or memorandum in writing of the contract or sale be signed by the party to be charged or his agent in that behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">There was oral evidence, sufficient, if believed by the jury, to support a finding that an authorized officer of defendant corporation instructed Stanley at Pittsburgh to purchase for defendant a oar of tomatoes then in Pittsburgh on specified terms and conditions for shipment to defendant in Scranton; that Stanley, as defendant\u2019s agent bought the car which had been the subject of the instructions given to him over the telephone and signed a sales memorandum. While defendant offered evidence denying the position taken in plaintiff\u2019s case, it was the duty of the jury to whom the evidence should have been submitted, to find the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The sales memorandum is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">\u201cArthur F. McGowan,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\">21st &amp; Pike Sts., Pittsburgh, Pa.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-11\">May 20, 1924.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-12\">P F E 20920. 1008 ct. Tomatoes, at $2.40 crate, Pitts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-13\">Inspected and accepted for Lustig-Burgerhoff Co., Scranton, Pa.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-14\">To be shipped to same with all vents closed and plugs in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-15\">Stanley Brokerage Co., J. J. Stanley.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Though not signed by the defendant the \u201cparty-to be charged,\u201d the evidence would support a finding that it is signed by defendant\u2019s \u201cagent in that behalf.\u201d It is true that the authority of the agent to sign for the defendant was not in writing. While the Act of March 21, 1722, 1 Sm. L. 389, relating to sale, etc. of land requires the authority of the agent in writing, section 4 of the Sales- Act does not expressly require it in the sale of goods. We are of opinion that although the decisions in other states are not in accord on the subject, written authority in the agent is not essential: this conclusion was assumed without discussion in Rasche v. Campbell, 276 Pa. 268, at 271, and in Hill v. Marcus et al., 81 Pa. Superior Ct. 314; see generally 25 R. C. L. Sec. 324 p. 685; 27 C. J. Sec. 372, p. 295; Bay State Milling Co. v. Saginaw Baking Co., 225 Mich. 557; Dusenberry, Inc. v. Import Drug Co., 253 Mass. 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">It is argued however, that if the evidence of the agency be sufficient to go to the jury the writing is nevertheless insufficient. The decisions are against that view. No particular form of words is necessary. \u201cAny note or memorandum in writing indicative of the intent of the parties, and being sufficiently precise to enable one to ascertain the term's of the contract, and signed by the party to be charged is sufficient\u201d: Mason-Heflin Coal Co. v. Currie, 270 Pa. 221; see too Mfrs. Light &amp; Heat Co. v. Lamp, 269 Pa. 517; Hill v. Marcus, 81 Pa. Superior Ct. 314; Franklin Sugar Ref. Co. v. Howell, 274 Pa. 190; Paturzo v. Ferguson, 280 Pa. 379, 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The writing is signed on behalf of the buyer who is sought to be charged; it is addressed to the seller, the plaintiff; the subject of the sale and the quantity and the price plainly appear as \u201c1008 ct. tomatoes at $2.40 crate, Pitts.\u201d If any merchant in the business had any doubt (this, court considers it' free from doubt) that \u201cPFE 20920\u201d were the initials and rum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>ber of a freight car that contained the tomatoes, the abbreviation may be explained by oral evidence (Williston on Sales, 2d Ed. Yol. 1, Sec. 102) without contravening the rule that omitted terms essential to a contract may not be so supplied. The same is true of the abbreviation \u201cPitts.\u201d Customary commercial understanding declares that in a transaction recorded as this was, the price is payable f. o. b. Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\">If the jury accept plaintiff\u2019s view that Stanley was authorized to. act for defendant, it will be noted that the writing states that the car was \u201cinspected and accepted for Lustig-Burgerhoff Co., Scranton, Pa.,\u201d the defendant, by Stanley for shipment to Scranton. There was no delay in transportation. Complaint is made that in shipping to Scranton, plaintiff consigned the ear to himself on an order-notify bill of lading. Defendant received the shipping documents promptly but declined to accept the sight draft because of the condition of the tomatoes. As no' terms of credit are stated in the writing, the transportation was for cash, and the method of collection pursued is well recognized: section 20, Sales Act, 1915 P. L. 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">We must also sustain the assignment complaining in substance that the court refused to permit plaintiff to put in evidence an undenied paragraph of the statement of claim averring a sale in the open market at a stated loss. The denial in the affidavit of defense was insufficient, merely a statement that defendant had neither knowledge nor means of learning anything about the truth of the averment; Buchler v. Fashion Plate Co., 269 Pa. 428; Franklin Sugar Ref. Co. v. Hanscom, 273 Pa. 98; Johns et al v. Johns, 88 Pa. Superior Ct. 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Judgment reversed and new trial awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
