The defendant contracted in writing to buy from the plaintiff the land referred to. The title of the latter was acquired by deed of Anna B. Davidson, executrix of the will of C. P. Davidson, dated December 12, 1925, and recorded in Lackawanna County. The question presented for consideration in the case stated is whether the said executrix had authority to convey the land discharged of the debts of the decedent. The latter left to survive him a widow and ten children. Conveyance by the executrix to the plaintiff was under the authority said to be granted in the will of the testator. The defendant refused to accept the conveyance tendered by the plaintiff on the ground that a large indebtedness existed against the estate, and that the executrix was without specific direction to sell land.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>The same will was under consideration in a ease arising out of a prior sale of a part of the decedent\u2019s land; Davidson\u2019s Executrix v. Bright, 267 Pa. 580. The opinion filed in that case contains an extended discussion of the power of an executor to convey free from the encumbrance of debts of a decedent and sustains the validity of the title granted by the executrix of C. P. Davidson\u2019s will. We regard it as a controlling authority in the case before us. The opinion of the court below was in accord \"with the decision referred to and the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
