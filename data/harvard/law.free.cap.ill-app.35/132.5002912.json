An actual change, as distinguished from that which by the mere intendment of the law follows the transfer of the title, is an open, visible, public change, manifested by such outward signs as render it evident that the possession of the owner has entirely ceased.\u201d Bump on Fr. Con., 112.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Acv\" pgmap=\"129\">\u201c The delivery must be actual, and such as the nature of the property and the circumstances of the sale will reasonably admit, and such as the vendor is capable of making. A mere symbolical or constructive delivery when a real one is reasonably practicable is of no avail.\u201d Id. 133.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AkG\" pgmap=\"129\">\u201c There must be some open, notorious or visible act clearly and unequivocally indicative of delivery and possession, such as putting up a new sign, or any other reasonable means which would impart notice to a prudent man that a change had taken place. The act must be so open and manifest as to make the change of possession apparent and visible. The change of possession must be such as is observable without inquiry.\u201d Id. 139; see Garman v. Cooper, 72 Pa. St. 32.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aox\" pgmap=\"129\">These principles are sustained by the Illinois cases. See Ticknor v. McClelland, 84 Ill. 474; Allen v.

Green, 14 Ill. 386.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-6\" pgmap=\"130\">\u201c Where a vendee employs his vendor as a clerk to sell goods, although the fact may excite suspicion, it is not per se fraudulent, and may be explained.\u201d Warner v. Carlton, 22 Ill. 415.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-7\" pgmap=\"130\">In each of the foregoing Illinois cases, the vendee retained the vendor himself as his clerk, or agent, and the court say it was not fraudulent per se, but could be explained.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-8\" pgmap=\"130\">To the same effect we cite Godchaux v. Mulford, 26 Cal. 324; Billingsby v. White, 59 Penn. St. 466.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-9\" pgmap=\"130\">\u201cIt is well settled that the employment of the vendor in a subordinate capacity is only colorable and not conclusive evidence of fraud. Certainly, no stronger rule ought to be adopted against the employment of the mere servant of the vendor.\u201d Gray et al. v. Sullivan et al., 10 Nev. 416.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-10\" pgmap=\"130\">\u201c The essential fact to be proved, under the circumstances of this case, was, whether or not there was an actual and continued change of possession. If this was sufficiently shown, then the mere fact of the re-employment of the clerk of the vendor by the vendees would not render the sale invalid.\u201d Ivancovich v. Stern, 14 Nev. 341.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-11\" pgmap=\"130\">As to the hiring of the clerk of the vendor by the vendee, and as to the failure to take down the sign of the vendor, we further quote from the following authorities:</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-3\" pgmap=\"131\">\u201cWhere one made an honest purchase of a store of goods, and received the actual and exclusive possession of it, but continued it in the same place, and allowed the signs and other outward appearances to remain unchanged, and put in to conduct it his own son, who had some time before been clerk in the same store, suffering the vendor, who lived in part of the house, to be about the store assisting in its business, these circumstances did not make the sale voidable by the creditors of the vendor or require its condemnation as a matter of law.\u201d Hugue v. Robinson, 24 Penn. 9.</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-4\" pgmap=\"131\">\u201c If one who has purchased a stock of goods in a shop occupied by the vendor, permit the signs of the vendor to remain over the door, that fact is evidence that the vendor remained in possession after the sale, and is so far evidence of fraud; but it admits of explanation.\u201d Scary v. Dearborn, 19 N. H. 351.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-5\" pgmap=\"131\">To the same effect is Hall v. Parsons, 15 Vt. 358.</p> <opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b131-6\" pgmap=\"131\">Per Curiam.</author> <p id=\"Aeh\" pgmap=\"131\">Appellee took from one Hall a bill of sale of certain articles, and left Hall in possession of them. After a time Hall left the city and the evidence tended to show, and the court below found, that appellee took possession of the articles under the bill of the sale before the writ of attachment under which appellants claim the goods was levied, and that at the time of said levy appellee was in possession of said goods by his custodian.</p> <p id=\"b131-7\" pgmap=\"131\">This finding of the court is controverted by appellants, but after an examination of the record and consideration of appellants\u2019' points and authorities, we are unable to concur in their contention. Ho fraud in fact is imputed to appellee, and whether he had taken legal possession of the goods before the attachment became a lien is a question which was, under the facts as shown in the record, conclusively settled in favor of appellee by the finding of the trial court. Judgment will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b131-8\" pgmap=\"131\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
