In appellant\u2019s brief counsel have stated the law most favorably for themselves, but, as we understand the law, if French, after having made the agreement and settlement with Kinneard which Laird, Williams and Kinneard positively swear he did make, and then afterward, with the design to deceive and defraud Kinneard, knowingly made false representations to induce him to sign a cunningly drawn writing, by which Kinneard was injured, then they are guilty of fraud and appellee should recover.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-4\" pgmap=\"103\">This and more than this was found to be true by the verdict of the jury, and is shown by the great preponderance of the evidence.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-5\" pgmap=\"103\">\u201cA fraud in. obtaining a note may consist of any artifice practiced upon a person to induce him to execute it when he did not intend to do such an act. Circumvention seems to be nearly, if not quite synonymous with fraud; it is not any fraud whereby a person is induced by deceit to make a deed or other instrument. The fraud or covin must relate to the procurement of the instrument.\u201d Woods v. Hynes, 1 Scam. 103; Latham v. Smith, 45 Ill. 25; Wilson v. Miller, 72 Ill. 616; Auten v.

D. 1883, the defendant issued its policy of insurance to Kinneard and Laird, which said policy was afterward, with defendant\u2019s consent, duly assigned to plaintiff, and which covered property owned by the plaintiff in the sum of $5,000; and if from all the evidence you further believe that on or about the 12ih day of July 18S5, the property insured under said policy was destroyed by fire, and that defendant sent its adjuster to the scene of. the fire, and if from all the evidence you further believe that said adjuster on or about the 22d day of July, 1885, agreed with the plaintiff as to the amount of said loss, and if the jury also believe from the evidence that there was a compromise settlement, and that it was agreed by the said compromise settlement said defendant would pay to said plaintiff the sum of $3,872.19 within sixty days from that date, in full settlement, compromise and satisfaction of all claims and demands which plaintiff then had or might have had against defendant, under said policy, and that plaintiff agreed to accept the same; and if you further believe from all the evidence that such settlement and compromise was made, and that defendant\u2019s adjuster agreed with plaintiff that defendant would pay to plaintiff within sixty days from July 22, 1885, the sum of $3,872.19 in full of all demands under said policy, and that plaintiff then and there agreed to accept the said sum $3,872.19, to be paid as aforesaid, in full of all his demands against defendant, under said policy, then the jury are instructed that such settlement so made (if from the evidence you believe such settlement was made) is good and valid, and plaintiff would thereby be entitled to recover in this action the said sum of $3,872.19, with interest thereon at the rate of six per cent per annum, from the 10th day of November, 1885, to the present time, unless you further believe from all the evidence that such adjuster had no authority to make such settlement.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b106-5\" pgmap=\"106\">In answer to special questions the jury have said that the \u201c Adjuster\u2019s Agreement\u201d was not read to the apjrellee, and that he was induced to sign it by fraud upon the part of the adjuster, but no such issue is presented by the instruction upon which the appellee obtained his verdict, nor does the record give any information as to what circumstances would, in the opinion of the.jury, constitute, or be evidence of fraud on the part of the agents of the company, in dealings between an insurance company and the assured. It is quite probable that the jury were favorably inclined to the appellee.</p> <p id=\"b107-3\" pgmap=\"107\">The apxiellant insists the \u201cAdjuster\u2019s Agreement \u201d is the exclusive evidence of all agreements between French and the appellee, and the appellee seems to acquiesce in that proposition, unless he can avoid the paper by evidence that he was tricked into signing it. Substantially it is that issue of fraud which is fought out by the briefs here. This \u201cAdjuster\u2019s Agreement \u201d covered a single point, the amount of loss and insurance. The appellant\u2019s share of that loss is not stated in it. It is express that \u201cit is without reference to any other questions or matter of difference within the terms and conditions of policy number 1716 of said insurance company, covering thereon other than that of determining the amount of loss or damage as before stated.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b107-4\" pgmap=\"107\">In legal effect it left the liability of the company to be determined by the provisions of the policy the company had issued. Nothing in it superseded those provisions. But they might be superseded by a parol agreement to pay an amount less than the sum named in the policy. F. &amp; M. Ins. Co. v. Chesnut, 50 Ill. 111.</p> <p id=\"b107-5\" pgmap=\"107\">How, then, can a parol agreement which only takes the place of, or avoids the provisions of the policy, left untouched by the \u201c Adjuster\u2019s Agreement \u201d be said to vary that agreement ? The rule that \u201c parol testimony can not be received to contradict, vary, add to, or subtract from, the terms of a valid written instrument\u201d (2 Tayl. Ev. 963), \u201cis not infringed by proof of any collateral parol agreement which does not interfere with the terms of the written contract, though it may relate to the same subject-matter.\u201d Ibid., 977. Bradshaw v. Combs, 102 Ill. 428.</p> <p id=\"b107-6\" pgmap=\"107\">The \u201c Adjuster\u2019s Agreement \u201d fixed the amount of loss of each class of insured and destroyed property, as well as the total loss, and also the insurance upon each class, as well as the total insurance; but the appellant\u2019s share of that loss, and whether they would ever pay it, were subjects left untouched. The parol agreement, as the jury have found it, fixed the amount to be paid by the appellant, and when it was to pay it.</p> <p id=\"b107-7\" pgmap=\"107(20) 108(95)\">With all the other policies in hand one could probably\u2014not certainly, figure out from the \u201c Adjuster\u2019s Agreement \u201d the appellant\u2019s share of the loss, but even that calculation might be questioned and disputed and become the subject of judicial investigation. It is not necessary to speculate upon the motive French had in putting into the \u201c Adjuster\u2019s Agreement \u201d the saving clause quoted. If he made the parol agreement, as the jury have found, it would be difficult to imagine an honest motive, and therefore the fact that he did put that clausein is an argument against the conclusion that he made such a parol agreement, which in contemplation of law, the jury considered.</p> <p id=\"b108-5\" pgmap=\"108\">The last clause of the instruction copied here is supposed to be justified by Home Ins. Co. v. Myer, 93 Ill. 271, and cases there cited; whether it is or not, it did no harm. If the jury had been required to find that French had authority, the letters of July 14th and 17tn are conclusive.</p> <p id=\"b108-6\" pgmap=\"108\">\u201c The matter \u201d could not be closed so long as anything was left in dispute. In the shape the case takes, if these views are correct, the minor questions are immaterial.</p> <p id=\"b108-7\" pgmap=\"108\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b108-8\" pgmap=\"108\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b108-9\" pgmap=\"108\">Judge Moran does not concur in this opinion.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
