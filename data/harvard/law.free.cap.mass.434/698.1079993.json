(Heublein),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is a Connecticut corporation engaged in the business of manufacturing, producing, and distributing a number of nationally known wines and spirits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Benziger Family Ranch Associates (Benziger) was a smaller, partner-owned, and largely family-operated wine business based in California, which, in just over one decade, had managed to build several successful wine brands, including Glen Ellen and M.G. Vallejo (Vallejo). By 1993, the Glen Ellen and Vallejo wines had outgrown Benziger\u2019s facilities, and Heublein offered to purchase the two wines in order to fill a gap in their table wine offerings and to achieve cost savings from combining crushing facilities and grape supply contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Heublein paid $135 million to Benziger in an arm\u2019s-length transaction to acquire all its assets and operations related to the production and sale of the Glen Ellen and Vallejo wines, including all the physical equipment, inventory, bulk wine and grape supply contracts, trademarks, accounts receivable, and certain other contracts and leases necessary to produce the products. Following the sale of the products, Benziger retained no further interest in the Glen Ellen and Vallejo wines, but continued to produce other wines.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Massachusetts law requires that alcohol products sold in this State by manufacturers or suppliers be sold initially to licensed Massachusetts wholesalers. Those wholesalers in turn sell to retailers who sell to consumers. G. L. c. 138, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 15, 18, 18B, 19. Prior to Heublein\u2019s purchase of Glen Ellen and Vallejo, Benziger had distributed these products in Massachusetts through Capital Distributing Company, Inc. (Capital), a licensed Massachusetts wholesaler of alcoholic beverages, and four other licensed Massachusetts wholesalers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Those distribution relationships were governed by G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25E, which makes it an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>unfair trade practice for a manufacturer (or other supplier), absent good cause, to refuse to sell a brand of alcohol to a wholesaler if the manufacturer has made regular sales of such brand to the wholesaler during the preceding six-month period.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When Heublein purchased the wines from Benziger, it agreed to assume some of Benziger\u2019s distributor agreements (with wholesalers) for the wines, but not those in Massachusetts and nine other States.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Heublein notified Benziger\u2019s Massachusetts wholesalers that it had acquired the Glen Ellen and Vallejo wines and, while it had not assumed Benziger\u2019s local wholesaler relationships, it would review those relationships over a three-month period, and would make wholesaler announcements in early 1994. The wholesalers objected to this intended review, claiming that because they had purchased Glen Ellen and Vallejo wines from Benziger for more than six months, \u00a7 25E required Heublein (the successor owner of those products) to continue to sell the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>wines to them unless and until there was \u201cgood cause\u201d (as narrowly defined in the statute) to terminate them. The wholesalers each applied to the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (commission) for an order requiring Heublein to continue to sell the wines to them.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">1. <em>Procedural background. </em>In January, 1996, the commission issued its decision interpreting \u00a7 25E to mean that, if a product and its distribution rights are transferred from one supplier (in this case a manufacturer) to another, any wholesaler with existing \u00a7 25E rights is entitled to purchase the product from the new supplier, and ordered Heublein to sell the products to the wholesalers.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Heublein appealed from the commission\u2019s order to the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, where it was reversed following a review of the administrative record. The Superior Court judge ruled that the commission had committed an error of law and that when a product is transferred from one supplier to another, the previous supplier\u2019s obligations to its wholesalers (protected by \u00a7 25E) do not automatically travel with the product to the successor supplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Only Capital appealed to the Appeals Court. <em>Heublein, Inc. </em>v. <em>Capital Distrib. Co., </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 340 n.2 (2000). The commission initially filed an appeal, but withdrew it, and has not offered an appellate argument in support of its 1996 decision. In fact, the commission\u2019s subsequent decisions appear to take the opposite position. See discussion, <em>infra. </em>The Appeals Court reversed the judgment of the Superior Court. <em>Id. </em>at 340. We granted Heublein\u2019s application for further appellate review.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude that a former supplier\u2019s obligations under \u00a7 25E <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>to continue to sell a product to its wholesalers is not imputed to a successor supplier who obtains ownership of the product through an arm\u2019s-length asset acquisition. The judgment of the Superior Court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">2. <em>Administrative action. </em>In its decision requiring Heublein to sell Glen Ellen and Vallejo wines to Capital and others, the commission pointed out that since 1985 it had \u201cconsistently held that where distribution rights to a product are transferred from one supplier to another, the transfer is subject to existing [\u00a7] 25E rights: i.e., unless otherwise agreed by the wholesaler, the wholesaler has a right to purchase [the] product from the new supplier.\u201d The commission acknowledged that this interpretation departed from its earlier construction of the statute, which did not automatically impose such an obligation on the new supplier. In <em>Pastene Wine &amp; Spirits Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 612, 618-619 (1988) <em>(Pastene), </em>we upheld a 1983 commission decision that was based on that earlier construction, and rejected a wholesaler\u2019s argument that a liquidated supplier\u2019s \u00a7 25E obligations to wholesalers should as a matter of policy be imputed to a successor supplier. We concluded that such an argument \u201coverstates the intended scope of \u00a7 25E.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618. The commission\u2019s revised view of the statute apparently resulted from an \u2018\u2018evolution of [its] interpretation\u201d of \u00a7 25E, and its related \u201cfinding\u201d that our <em>Pastene </em>decision should be limited to its facts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Based on this reasoning, the commission found, concerning the Glen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Ellen and Vallejo products, that \u201cthe [\u00a7 25E] obligations traveled with the [product distribution] rights, which were transferred despite Heublein\u2019s efforts to avoid them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, the commission ordered Heublein to sell the products to Capital and Benziger\u2019s other former Massachusetts wholesalers.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">3. <em>Superior Court ruling. </em>In reviewing the commission\u2019s order pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the judge noted that the agreement between Heublein and Benziger \u201cwas an arm\u2019s length asset purchase,\u201d and that the question raised by the case was whether, in the context of such a purchase, Benziger\u2019s \u00a7 25E obligations could be properly imputed to Heublein. Relying on our <em>Pastene </em>opinion, the judge answered in the negative, reasoning that this was not a case such as <em>Heublein, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 611, 614-616 (1991), where the court upheld the imputation of \u00a7 25E obligations to a new supplier, noting that the previous supplier and the new supplier were linked financially by a joint venture. To the contrary, the judge found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>\u201c[T]here was no evidence and, thus, no finding that Heublein acquired Benziger for the purpose of circumventing \u00a7 25E. . . . [F]urther[more], none of Benziger\u2019s owners or partners were affiliated in any way with Heublein or the [products after the acquisition. Seeking to avoid obligations under \u00a7 25E, if any exist, is quite different [from] acquiring distribution rights for the specific purpose of circumventing \u00a7 25E.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In effect, the judge recognized that there are legitimate business reasons for a new supplier, who is not an agent of or affiliated with the previous supplier, to want to evaluate its prospective wholesalers for the six-month trial period provided by the Legislature in \u00a7 25E,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that structuring the execution of an arm\u2019s-length acquisition to ensure that possibility did not convert the purpose of the transaction to one intended to circumvent \u00a7 25E.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">4. <em>Discussion. </em>Like the courts below, we review the commission\u2019s decision pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), to determine whether, as Heublein claims, it was based on an error of law, and whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence, that is, \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the agency\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Seagram Distill</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number><em>ers Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 713, 721 (1988), citing <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>University Hosp., Inc., </em>359 Mass. 516, 520-521 (1971) (defining \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d). In our review of administrative agency decisions, we generally defer to the experience, technical competence, specialized knowledge, and discretionary authority of the agency. <em>Seagram Distillers Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>citing G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). See <em>Somerset Importers, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 381, 385 (1990) (\u201cAn interpretation of \u00a7 25E made by the administrative agency charged with administering the statute is one to which we accord weight\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">It was inappropriate, however, for the commission in its decision to \u201cfind,\u201d based on its then current interpretation of \u00a7 25E, that our <em>Past enc </em>decision should be limited to its facts. See <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Cecil, </em>431 Mass. 410, 413 (2000), quoting <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cardullo\u2019s, Inc., </em>347 Mass. 337, 344 (1964) (\u201cduty of statutory interpretation is for the courts\u201d); <em>M.H. Gordon &amp; Son </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>371 Mass. 584, 589 (1976) (ultimate responsibility for interpreting provisions of G. L. c. 138 rests with court, not commission); <em>Arnone </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 33, 34 (1997) (approach of reviewing court to agency determinations is one of deference and restraint, not abdication). When we intend to limit one of our decisions to its particular facts, we say so explicitly. See, e.g., <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Spadafora, </em>388 Mass. 764, 768 (1983); <em>Duby </em>v. <em>Baron, </em>369 Mass. 614, 625 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The commission\u2019s decision to limit our <em>Pastene </em>decision strictly to its facts was apparently prompted by its 1985 \u201cdepart[ure]\u201d from its earlier construction of \u00a7 25E, a construction that did not automatically impute to the successor supplier an obligation to retain wholesalers chosen by the previous supplier after a six-month period of regular sales. A reading of two of the commission\u2019s recent decisions that followed the Superior Court judge\u2019s ruling in this case<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> indicates that this \u201cdeparture\u201d has now come to an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>In <em>United Liquors, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Brown-Forman Corp., </em>ABCC decision, June 16, 1998, the commission found that termination of the United States distributor of a vodka product by its Finland manufacturer, who then assigned the distribution rights of the product to a new United States distributor, did not impute the \u00a7 25E wholesaler obligations to the new distributor. There was no imputation of such obligations because the commission found no agency relationship between the prior United States distributor and the Finland manufacturer, that is, the foreign manufacturer had not exerted any control over the national distributor\u2019s choice of wholesalers to distribute the vodka product in the various States. Nor was there any connection (such as ownership interest) between the prior national distributor and its successor. In the absence of such control or connection, there was no reason to assume that the termination and subsequent assignment of the national distribution rights of the product to a new national distributor had been done in order to circumvent the \u00a7 25E obligations owed by the prior national distributor to Massachusetts wholesalers. The commission also found \u201cthat [\u00a7] 25E obligations do not run with the product . . . but only with the manufacturer, winegrower, farmer-brewer, importer or wholesaler. <em>If the legislature intended the obligation to run with the product, it would have said it. </em>See <em>Pastene, [supra] </em>at 618-619 . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; citation omitted.) <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">In <em>Charles E. Gilman &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Bacardi-Martini USA, Inc., </em>ABCC decision, December 29, 1999 <em>(Gilman), </em>the commission attempted to reconcile its \u00a7 25E decisions from 1986 onward in light of its current understanding of our <em>Pastene </em>ruling. In reviewing all the decisions in which it had imputed \u00a7 25E obligations to successor suppliers, the commission noted that their one common factor was the presence of a continuing affiliation or agency relationship between the new supplier and the former supplier:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">\u201cThe matter[s] in which the [c]ommission and the courts affirmed imputing [\u00a7] 25E obligations to a new supplier under a theory of assignment of distribution[] rights involved product that [was still] being manufactured and/or [remained] under the control of the former supplier, its parent company or a combination of the parent and/or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>former supplier and the new supplier. The manufacturing and distributing of the product was not sold to a new supplier.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-5\"><em>Id. </em>The commission concluded in <em>Gilman </em>that an arm\u2019s-length sale of product lines between suppliers, that is, one in which the right to control the product <em>had </em>been sold to a new supplier, did not result in a transfer of \u00a7 25E obligations between those suppliers. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">While we give deference to \u201clong consistent administrative interpretations of an agency\u2019s governing statute,\u201d <em>Saccone </em>v. <em>State Ethics Comm\u2019n, </em>395 Mass. 326, 335 n.12 (1985), in the absence of such consistency, as here, such deference is not required. We note, however, that the commission\u2019s recent <em>Gil-man </em>decision is in accord with our own cases interpreting \u00a7 25E.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the <em>Pastene </em>case, we noted that \u201c[w]hile \u00a7 25E apparently was adopted to counteract a tendency toward vertical integration in the liquor distribution industry . . . and to redress economic imbalances in the relationship of wholesalers and their suppliers, <em>we do not believe the statute was intended to \u2018generate inequities against suppliers\u2019 </em>\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Pastene, supra </em>at 618-619, quoting <em>Amoco Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Dickson, </em>378 Mass. 44, 50 (1979). The commission\u2019s <em>Gilman </em>decision does not produce such inequities, but rather provides principles \u201cby which the commission may reconcile the competing equities between suppliers and wholesalers of liquor in the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Seagram Distillers Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Applying the principles of our <em>Pastene </em>decision, we conclude that Heublein cannot be ordered to sell the products to Benziger\u2019s former wholesalers, and Benziger\u2019s \u00a7 25E obligations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>cannot be imputed to Heublein, where the acquisition of the product assets and their distribution rights were made at arm\u2019s length and there was no evidence before the commission of any agency relationship or continuing affiliation between Heublein and Benziger following the completion of the sale. As the commission explicitly found, at the conclusion of the sale Heublein had \u201csole control\u201d over the products, and Benziger had none.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">This result is in conformance with the literal wording of the statute, which imposes termination restrictions on manufacturers who have made continuous sales to wholesalers for six months. Heublein never sold Glen Ellen and Vallejo wines to Benziger\u2019s Massachusetts wholesalers, and therefore the statutory limitations with regard to terminating them do not apply to Heublein unless some other principle of law imputes Benziger\u2019s obligations to it. No such principle is present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Heublein, Inc., is now known as IDV North America, Inc., and is a unit of London-based Grand Metropolitan PLC\u2019s International Distillers and Vintners Limited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Heublein\u2019s portfolio at the time relevant here included major wine brands such as Almad\u00e9n, Inglenook, Blossom Hill, and Beaulieu Vineyard, as well as Smirnoff Vodka, Black Velvet Canadian Whisky, Jose Cuervo Tequila, and Christian Brothers Brandy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Branded Liquors, Inc.; Martignetti Grocery Company, Inc.; M.S.

Since that time the [c]ommission\u2019s interpretation of the statute has evolved on the basis of substantial experience . . . includfing] observation of large scale merger and acquisition activity in the alcoholic beverages industry. The industry is increasingly characterized by a small number of multinational corporations, each controlling many brands and large market shares. Major transfers of product rights in complex multi-party transactions have become commonplace. Many smaller wholesalers have been forced out, and those that remain operate at a considerable disadvantage in dealing with the major distributors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\">\u201cThe purpose of [\u00a7] 25E is to prevent unreasonable interruption of supply to wholesalers in good standing. If producers and suppliers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>could exempt themselves from the requirements of the statute by use of intermediaries or by assigning their distribution rights to another entity, the intent of the statute would be easily defeated.

See, e.g., <em>Martignetti Grocery Co. </em>v. <em>Vintners Int\u2019l Co., </em>ABCC decision, April 22, 1991. Such cases have always involved a surviving affiliation or agency relationship between the former holder of the product rights and the successor holder. See <em>Charles E. Gilman &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Bacardi-Martini USA, Inc., </em>ABCC decision, December 29, 1999, and ABCC decisions cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">In the present case, the commission specifically found that Heublein purchased the wine products \u201cto help consolidate its position in the wine industry, increase its market share and strengthen its position with distributors,\u201d and, implicitly, not for the purpose of circumventing \u00a7 25E.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b722-9\">\u201cPersons in a highly sensitive, closely scrutinized business (such as the liquor business) have need to know about and appraise the persons behind [the] corporations with whom they are doing business.\u201d <em>Seagram Distillers Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 713, 717 (1988), quoting <em>Union Liquors Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 936, 938 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\">As noted above, the commission ultimately chose not to pursue an appeal of the ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b725-8\">In the present case, the Appeals Court refused to consider the commission\u2019s <em>Gilman </em>decision as a \u201cnew interpretation\u201d of \u00a7 25E by the commission, because while the decision contained language concerning the Superior Court\u2019s decision in the present case, \u201c[t]he paragraph devoted to that subject does not reveal whether the [commission] has altered its position in response to the Superior Court decision or is simply acquiescing in that decision until this appeal is decided.\u201d <em>Heublein, Inc. </em>v. <em>Capital Distrib. Co., </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 342 n.4 (2000). The relevance of the <em>Gilman </em>decision is that it provided an interpretation of \u00a7 25E that is in accord with our interpretation of the statute as set forth in <em>Pastene, supra </em>at 618-619.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
