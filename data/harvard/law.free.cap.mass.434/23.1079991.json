A judge in the Probate and Family Court concluded that the father could seek relief from the paternity judgment under Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60 (b) (5) (West 2001), which provides relief where \u201cit is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\u201d Rule 60 (b) also provides that any request for relief must be made \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d The judge\u2019s order was stayed pending appeal. The mother appealed, and we granted her application for direct appellate review. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>We conclude that in this case the father did not request relief within a reasonable time: he declined an offer by the child support enforcement division of the Department of Revenue (department) to undergo genetic testing before he acknowledged paternity, and he waited several years before first challenging the paternity judgment, during which time, by his own admission, he had reason to believe he was not the child\u2019s father. Like other courts that have considered the question, we decline to hold that, whenever a father establishes that he is not the child\u2019s biological parent, relief from the obligations of paternity is automatically available. Because of the decision we reach, we need not decide whether the 1998 statute enacted by our Legislature that limits any permissible challenge to paternity to one year from the date of the paternity judgment should be applied retroactively to this case. See G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 11, as amended through St. 1998, c. 64, \u00a7 227 (approved March 31, 1998).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judgment of the Probate and Family Court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>vacated, and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The mother gave birth to the child (Cheryl) on August 29, 1993. In November, 1993, the department filed a complaint in the Probate and Family Court against the father on behalf of the mother and the Department of Public Welfare (now the Department of Transitional Assistance), seeking to establish his paternity. G. L. c. 209C; G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The department also sought to require the father, who was not married to the mother, to pay child support and maintain health insurance for Cheryl and to reimburse the department for past support it had provided to Cheryl. In December, 1993, the department moved for a temporary order of support and for an order that the father, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the mother, and Cheryl submit to genetic marker testing and blood grouping. The latter motion was served on the father, made specific reference to particular tests to be conducted by a named biomedical laboratory, and sought reimbursement from the father for the costs of administering the tests, but only in the event that the tests identified the defendant as the father of Cheryl. The department did not require the father to pay for the tests in advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">On December 16, 1993, the mother and the father executed an acknowledgment of parentage in which the father acknowledged that he was the father of Cheryl, that he understood his acknowledgment would have the effect of a judgment against him, and that the acknowledgment would obligate him to support Cheryl. He acknowledged that his execution of the agreement was his free act and deed. The father also executed a support agreement whereby he agreed to pay child support in the amount of $56.50 each week for Cheryl\u2019s benefit. The mother, in turn, acknowledged and affirmed that he was the father of Cheryl. That same day, a judge in the Probate and Family Court entered a judgment of paternity. The father, who was not represented by counsel at the time, did not submit to genetic marker testing prior to the entry of the paternity judgment. Nothing in the record explains why.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The mother and the father apparently were never married.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the years following the entry of the paternity judgment, the father behaved as though he were Cheryl\u2019s father. He and his family visited and bonded with Cheryl. In 1995 and again in 1996, the father, acting pro se, sought successfully to expand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>and enforce his visitation rights with his daughter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to the mother, Cheryl, now seven years old, has always called the father \u201cDaddy\u201d and \u201cis bonded to and loves [him] as her father.\u201d Cheryl also has a relationship with the father\u2019s parents and siblings, whom she knows as her grandparents, aunt, and uncles. The judge also noted that the father has fostered \u201ca substantial relationship\u201d with Cheryl.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> From December, 1993, the father has regularly paid child support to the mother on Cheryl\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In April, 1999, the department filed a complaint seeking to increase the father\u2019s child support obligation, and on May 27, 1999, a Probate Court judge ordered the father to pay $90 per week, an increase of $33.50 each week. Five days later, on June 1, 1999, the father filed for the first time a motion requesting an order for genetic marker testing, and an amendment to the 1993 paternity judgment should the test results warrant it. The motion contained a number of unsworn statements, tending to suggest that he believed he was not Cheryl\u2019s biological father. More particularly, and of relevance to this appeal, the father\u2019s motion suggested that, as early as Cheryl\u2019s birth, he may have had reason to suspect that he might not be Cheryl\u2019s biological father.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By no later than 1995, when Cheryl was two years old, he had information confirming that fact: He said that, in 1995, two friends of the mother informed him on separate occasions that he was not the father of the child, and that subsequently the mother had said \u201cunequivocally,\u201d and in circumstances \u201cindicating sincerity,\u201d that he was not Cheryl\u2019s father. The motion stated that Cheryl does not resemble the father \u201cin features or skin color,\u201d because she is \u201cvery light skinned,\u201d while he, his parents, Cheryl\u2019s mother, and her parents are not light skinned. With his 1999 motion, the father submitted a doctor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>letter stating that laboratory testing of the father\u2019s semen conducted in June, 1996, had revealed that he has a low sperm count, with his physician noting that \u201c[t]his finding may explain your problem with infertility . . . .\u201d The motion also stated that, in 1993, the father had acknowledged his paternity \u201cbased on misleading information and without the benefit of a paternity test of any kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">On July 21, 1999, a judge, \u201cafter careful review,\u201d denied the father\u2019s motion for genetic marker testing. Three days later, the father filed a complaint seeking reduction of the increased child support judgment, which was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">On November 12, 1999, following these unsuccessful attempts to obtain genetic marker testing and a reduction of child support, the father took Cheryl for genetic testing, without the knowledge of the mother. The test report, contained in the record, concluded that he was not the biological father of Cheryl. Relying on the report, on January 27, 2000, the father moved for a second time to amend or to vacate the paternity judgment. He also requested reimbursement for all of the child support that he had paid since the 1993 judgment of paternity. The department and the mother opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">On May 30, 2000, following a nonevidentiary hearing, a judge in the Probate &amp; Family Court filed a memorandum and order in which he ordered the mother, the father, and Cheryl to participate forthwith in blood or genetic marker testing,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> with a status conference to be scheduled after the results were obtained. Relying on <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>W.Z., </em>412 Mass. 718 (1992), the judge said that if the tests established that the father was not the biological parent of Cheryl, he would be entitled to relief from the prospective application of the 1993 paternity judgment, pursuant to Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60 (b) (5),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but that he was not entitled to retroactive relief.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The judge explained that the father\u2019s \u201cinterests in no longer being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>obligated to support a child not his own\u201d outweighed Cheryl\u2019s interests \u201cin maintaining a relationship with someone she believed to be her biological father.\u201d He said that a contrary conclusion would prolong \u201can apparent fraud and falsehood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The mother argues that the father\u2019s generalized attack on the paternity judgment is actually a claim based on fraud, mistake, or newly discovered evidence and, properly construed, should be seen as a claim under Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60 (b) (l)-(3), and not as a claim under Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60 (b) (5). See note 10, <em>supra. </em>As such, she argues, the claim is time-barred because the father did not make his motion within one year of the entry of the paternity judgment as required by the rule.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> She also maintains that, even if relief under rule 60 (b) (5) is available, the father\u2019s motions were not timely filed because he did not seek relief \u201cwithin a reasonable time,\u201d as required by rule 60 (b), or within one year of the execution of the paternity agreement as now required by G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 11. See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The father responds that relief was properly granted under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>either rule 60 (b) (5) (\u201cit is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application\u201d), or under the catchall provision, rule 60 (b) (6), which authorizes a judge to set aside a judgment \u201cfor any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d He argues that, because he now knows with \u201cscientific certainty\u201d that he is not Cheryl\u2019s biological father, the prospective application of the 1993 paternity judgment is no longer equitable. His motion is timely, he says, because he did not discover the mother\u2019s \u201cdeceit\u201d until he received the results of the genetic marker tests in late 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">We consider first the judge\u2019s grant of relief pursuant to Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60 (b) (5). We review the judge\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. See <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>C.M.J., </em>432 Mass. 69, 75 (2000); <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>385 Mass. 30, 33-34 (1982). The father\u2019s two motions to vacate the paternity judgment, filed in June, 1999, and January, 2000, were filed, respectively, approximately five and one-half and six years after the paternity judgment was entered. To determine what constitutes a \u201creasonable time\u201d within which to seek relief under rule 60 (b) (5), we look to the individual circumstances of each case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See 11 C.A. Wright, A.R. Miller, &amp; M.K. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2866, at 382 (2d ed. 1995). As a general matter we agree that challenges to paternity under rule 60 (b) should not be permitted beyond \u201ca relatively brief passage of time.\u201d <em>Nancy Darlene M. </em>v. <em>James Lee M., </em>195 W. Va. 153, 157 (1995), quoting <em>Michael K.T. </em>v. <em>Tina L.T., </em>182 W. Va. 399, 405 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">There is a compelling public interest in the finality of paternity judgments. See G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 11, as amended (limiting circumstances in which, and time within which, father may challenge paternity judgment). See also <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>W.Z., </em>412 Mass. 718, 721 (1992); <em>Anderson </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number><em>Anderson, </em>407 Mass. 251, 255-256 (1990).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Where a father challenges a paternity judgment, courts have pointed to the special needs of children that must be protected, noting that consideration of what is in a child\u2019s best interests will often weigh more heavily than the genetic link between parent and child. See, e.g., <em>Ex parte State ex rel. J.Z., </em>668 So. 2d 566, 569 (Ala. 1995) (\u201cpolicy in favor of finality [of paternity judgments] means that a prior adjudication should not be subject to relitigation in the absence of truly compelling circumstances\u201d); <em>Richard B. </em>v. <em>Sandra B.B., </em>209 A.D.2d, 139, 141 (N.Y. 1995), quoting <em>Ettore I. </em>v. <em>Angela D., </em>127 A.D.2d 6, 13 (N.Y. 1987) (\u201cunequivocal trend\u201d has been to \u201czealously safeguard the welfare, stability, and best interests of the child by rejecting untimely challenges affecting his or her legitimacy\u201d); <em>Godin </em>v. <em>Godin, </em>168 Vt. 514, 523 (1998), and cases cited (noting that many courts have rejected attempts to reopen paternity judgments based on postjudgment blood tests \u201cabsent clear and convincing evidence that it serves the best interests of the child\u201d). Like those courts, we have recognized that stability and continuity of support, both emotional and financial, are essential to a child\u2019s welfare. See, e.g., <em>Adoption of Willow, </em>433 Mass. 636, 647 (2001), and cases cited; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>422 Mass. 666, 675 (1996), quoting <em>Duranceau </em>v. <em>Wallace </em>743 F.2d 709, 711 (9th Cir. 1984) (\u201c[i]t is hard to imagine a more compelling state interest than the support of its children\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Where a father and child have a substantial parent-child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>relationship, as the father and Cheryl apparently have, and the father has provided the child with consistent emotional and financial support, an attempt to undo a determination of paternity \u201cis potentially devastating to a child who ha[s] considered the man to be the father.\u201d <em>Hackley </em>v. <em>Hackley, </em>426 Mich. 582, 598 n.11 (1986). See <em>N.A.H. </em>v. <em>S.L.S., 9 </em>P.3d 354, 364 (Colo. 2000), quoting <em>McDaniels </em>v. <em>Carlson, </em>108 Wash. 2d 299, 311 (1987) (\u201cThe outcome of a paternity action irrevocably alters a child\u2019s current family situation and her future. . . . [I]t is the child who has the most at stake in a paternity proceeding\u201d). It was in part for these reasons that we concluded that a man who has comported himself as a child\u2019s father \u201cmay be obliged to continue to support the child when he, for the first time, renounces his apparent paternity in an attempt to avoid court-imposed support obligations.\u201d <em>A.R. </em>v. <em>C.R., </em>411 Mass. 570, 575 (1992) (addressing whether husband is equitably estopped from denying paternity of child bom to his wife). See <em>C.C. </em>v. <em>A.B., </em>406 Mass. 679, 690 (1990) (\u201csubstantial relationship\u201d between putative father and child is relevant to father\u2019s rights in paternity action).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">We assess the reasonableness of the five and one-half year interval between the entry of the paternity judgment in 1993, and the father\u2019s first motion for relief filed in 1999, in light of this jurisprudence. In 1993, the father had an opportunity to, but did not seek, genetic testing, and it avails him little to attempt to obviate that fact. He never claimed, and the record, such as it is, does not establish that his decision to acknowledge paternity voluntarily at that time was conditioned solely on his understanding that he was Cheryl\u2019s biological father. A man may acknowledge paternity for a variety of reasons, and we cannot assume that biology is the sole impetus in every case. See, e.g., <em>Godin </em>v. <em>Godin, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Moreover, the father failed to challenge the paternity judgment at the earliest reasonable opportunity, in the face of what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>he acknowledges was mounting evidence that he might not be Cheryl\u2019s biological father. He took no action in 1995 after he was informed, he says, by friends of the mother that he was not Cheryl\u2019s biological father. He took no action after the mother \u201cunequivocally\u201d confirmed, he says, that he was not Cheryl\u2019s biological father. He took no action after he observed that Cheryl did not share his, his parents\u2019, the mother\u2019s, or the mothers\u2019 parents\u2019 physical attributes. He took no action in 1996 when he discovered that his low sperm count could explain his and his wife\u2019s fertility problems. During all those years, Cheryl knew and relied on him as her father, and he enjoyed her love and companionship. See <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>536 So. 2d 1158, 1160 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1988) (declining to vacate paternity judgment because father \u201cenjoyed the benefits of his representation as the child\u2019s father, including the child\u2019s love and affection, his status as father in the place of the natural father, and the community\u2019s recognition of him as the father\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">It is illuminating that the judge in the Probate and Family Court reached the same decision as do we when first asked to rule oh the father\u2019s challenge. In 1999, the judge initially denied the father\u2019s request for genetic testing, even though the father\u2019s motion made clear his belief that he was not Cheryl\u2019s biological father. The judge did not (nor was he required to) issue a memorandum explaining his decision, but we may infer that he had in mind the weight of authority enforcing the finality of paternity judgments. The judge granted the father relief only when confronted with the results of genetic testing the father had obtained privately. He did so relying on <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>W.Z., supra </em>at 721, where we said we \u201cassume[d]\u201d that a father could obtain prospective relief from a paternity judgment pursuant to rule 60 (b) (5).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">We differ with the judge because we conclude that, as a consequence of the father\u2019s long delay before he challenged the paternity judgment, Cheryl\u2019s interests now outweigh any inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>est of his. See <em>Godin </em>v. <em>Godin, supra. </em>Our conclusion is consistent with our prior jurisprudence, and the decisions of numerous other courts, that a father\u2019s challenge to a paternity judgment may be untimely even though he may establish conclusively that he is not a child\u2019s genetic parent. <em>Set Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 257-258 n.6 (collecting cases denying relief to former husbands). See also <em>Ex parte State ex rel. J.Z., </em>668 So. 2d 566, 569 (Ala. 1995); <em>Nancy Darlene M. </em>v. <em>James Lee M., </em>195 W. Va. 153, 157 (1995) (collecting cases). But see <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Pouncy, </em>979 P.2d 520, 526 (Alaska 1999) (relief under rule 60 [b] [5] available where genetic test confirms father not biological parent; claim brought two and one-half years after divorce not unreasonable as matter of law).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">We next consider the father\u2019s motion for relief under Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60 (b) (6), the catchall provision of that rule. See note 10, <em>supra. </em>The judge acted well within his discretion in denying the father relief pursuant to that subsection. A motion under subsection (6) must, like subsection (5), be brought within a reasonable time: for all the reasons just discussed, the father\u2019s motion was not. Moreover, in order to prevail under subsection (6), the father was required to demonstrate that relief was not available to him under subsections (1) through (5).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>W.Z., supra </em>at 720-721 n.4, citing <em>Bromfield </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>400 Mass. 254, 256 (1987); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 257; <em>Chavoor </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>383 Mass. 801, 805-806 (1981). The father\u2019s proffered reasons for relief clearly fall within subsections (1), (2), (3), or (5) of the rule. He has said (or implied) that he acknowledged paternity based on his \u201cmistaken\u201d belief that he was Cheryl\u2019s biological father, Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60 (b) (1); that the evidence that he is not Cheryl\u2019s biological father is \u201cnew,\u201d Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60 (b) (2); that the mother committed fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation against him, Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60 (b) (3); and that the prospective application of the paternity judgment is \u201cno longer equitable,\u201d Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60 (b) (5). Because his arguments are not requests for relief independent of subsections (l)-(5), he may not seek relief under rule 60 (b) (6). See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 256 (challenge to paternity judgment based on genetic marker tests encompassed within rule 60 [b] [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The father argues that his claim is not subject to any time limit under rule 60 (b) because it also provides that \u201c[t]his rule does not limit the power of a court... to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.\u201d The mother committed \u201cfraud on the court,\u201d he says, by failing to disclose that he was not the father of Cheryl. We disagree. Even if the mother knew in December, 1993, that the father was not Cheryl\u2019s biological father (a proposition not established by this record), her failure to disclose that information to the court would not amount to \u201cfraud on the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">A \u201cfraud on the court\u201d occurs where \u201cit can be demonstrated, clearly and convincingly, that a party has sentiently set in motion some unconscionable scheme calculated to interfere with the judicial system\u2019s ability impartially to adjudicate a matter by improperly influencing the trier or unfairly hampering the presentation of the opposing party\u2019s claim or defense.\u201d <em>Rockdale Mgt. Co. </em>v. <em>Shawmut Bank, N.A., </em>418 Mass. 596, 598 (1994), quoting <em>Aoude </em>v. <em>Mobil Oil Corp., </em>892 F.2d 1115, 1118 (1st Cir. 1989). The doctrine embraces \u201conly that species of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>fraud which does, or attempts to, defile the court itself, or is a fraud perpetrated by officers of the court so that the judicial machinery can not perform in the usual manner its impartial task of adjudging cases that are presented for adjudication.\u201d <em>Pina </em>v. <em>McGill Dev. Corp., </em>388 Mass. 159, 165 (1983), quoting <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Bowles, </em>46 F.R.D. 625, 631 (D.D.C. 1969). A party seeking to demonstrate fraud on the court must prove \u201cthe most egregious conduct involving a corruption of the judicial process itself. Examples are bribery of judges, employment of counsel to \u2018influence\u2019 the court, bribery of the jury, and the involvement of an attorney (an officer of the court) in the perpetration of fraud.\u201d <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>407 Mass. 196, 202 (1990), quoting <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Bowles, supra </em>at 631-632. A party\u2019s nondisclosure to an adverse party (assuming that occurred in this case) or to the court (there is no suggestion that occurred here) of facts pertinent to a controversy before the court, without more, does not amount to \u201cfraud on the court\u201d for purposes of vacating a judgment under rule 60 (b). See <em>Winthrop Corp. </em>v. <em>Lowenthal, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 180, 187 (1990) (nondisclosure of contingent fee agreement did not amount to fraud on court where disclosure required by contract). Cf. <em>Matter of Neitlich, </em>413 Mass. 416, 423 (1992) (finding fraud on court where attorney made false statement \u201cwith intent to deceive a court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">We harbor no illusion that our decision will protect Cheryl from the consequences of her father\u2019s decision to seek genetic testing and to challenge his paternity. We cannot protect Cheryl from learning about her genetic parentage: If Cheryl does not yet know of her father\u2019s challenge, he (or others) may disclose it to her. No judgment can force him to continue to nurture his relationship with Cheryl, or to protect her from whatever assumptions she may have about her father.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But we can protect her financial security and other legal rights. It appears that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>father first challenged his paternity because of the increase of child support ordered in 1999. Relieving him of child support obligations might itself unravel the parental ties, as the payment of child support \u201cis a strand tightly interwoven with other forms of connection between father and child,\u201d and often forms a critical bond between them. <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Gilliard, </em>483 U.S. 587, 617 (1986) (Brennan, J., dissenting). We can ensure that Cheryl, who may be deprived of her father\u2019s affection and long-held assumptions about her paternity, is not also deprived of the legal rights and financial benefits of a parental relationship. See <em>Godin </em>v. <em>Godin, supra </em>at 525; <em>Michael K.T. </em>v. <em>Tina L.T., </em>182 W. Va. 399, 405 (1989) (\u201cWhile the law cannot prohibit the putative father from informing the child of their true relationship, it can prohibit him from employing the sanctions of the law to avoid the obligations which their assumed relationship would otherwise impose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The law places on men the burden to consider carefully the permanent consequences that flow from an acknowledgment of paternity. The judge in this case properly noted that the father has significant interests at stake in the outcome of this litigation, financial and otherwise.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We also recognize the anomaly of enforcing the parental obligations of a man who was identified as a parent only (it seems) because the State insisted that the mother name Cheryl\u2019s biological father, where he has now established that he is not that man. The State intervened when the mother, in her efforts to obtain public assistance for her child, was required to name her child\u2019s biological father. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>So far as we can discern from this sparse record, there was not, and has not been since, any ongoing intimate relationship between the mother and the father. Cf. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 257 n.6, and cases cited (denying relief to former husbands). A different result might be mandated if a man named by a mother in these circumstances had no opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>to undergo genetic testing before he acknowledged paternity.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> A different result might be mandated if a man named by a mother in these circumstances promptly challenged the paternity judgment on obtaining information that he might not be the child\u2019s biological father. Cf. <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>W.Z., supra </em>at 720-721. In this case, even if the father\u2019s acknowledgment of paternity were triggered by State intervention (withholding public assistance unless the mother named the father of her child) or misleading information from the mother (assuming she did not name the father in good faith),<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> he had the opportunity to undergo genetic testing, and he waited too long to challenge his paternity.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Our rejection of the father\u2019s claim for relief under Mass.

To do otherwise places at risk the well-being of children bom out of wedlock whose fathers subsequently learn, as modem scientific methods now make possible, that they have no genetic link to their children. This is consistent with, and gives meaning to, the department\u2019s authority to require genetic testing in any case requiring the establishment of paternity based on a mother\u2019s or putative father\u2019s affidavit that sexual intercourse occurred during the probable period of the child\u2019s conception. See G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 3A. It is also consistent with the stated purpose of G. L. c. 209C, the statute governing judgments and acknowledgments of paternity, to ensure that children bom out of wedlock receive the same rights and protections as those bom to a marriage. See G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b56-6\">In his memorandum and order, the judge stated that, if it is established that the father is not the biological parent of Cheryl, the mother \u201cwas aware, at the time of filing, of the likelihood that a different person was the biological father of [Cheryl].\u201d There is nothing in the record to support that statement. The mother submitted an affidavit stating that she \u201csigned the acknowledgment of paternity and the agreements for judgment in good faith.\u201d The father has not challenged her statement, and we see nothing to contradict her assertion. On the basis of mere speculation, we cannot presume as a matter of law that the mother knew that another man had fathered Cheryl, or that she purposefully misled the father in that respect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Because we conclude that relief is not available under Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60 (b), we need not address the mother\u2019s claims that the father\u2019s motions for relief are precluded by the doctrine of equitable estoppel and that relief should be denied because the father has brought his motions with \u201cunclean hands.\u201d The father apparently obtained the genetic tests on the advice of counsel in 1999. It is, therefore, unlikely that he could be denied relief on the basis of unclean hands. We nevertheless note that the father should have obtained the mother\u2019s approval before subjecting Cheryl to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>genetic tests, particularly where, as here, a judge had denied him that relief. The father points out that no judge explicitly prohibited him from obtaining the test, that he took Cheryl for testing during a legal visitation period, and that the test posed virtually no risk of physical pain or trauma for Cheryl. See <em>A.R. </em>v. <em>C.R., </em>411 Mass. 570, 576 (1992), citing <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 771 (1966). Even if the father is correct on each point, absent emergency circumstances, a noncustodial parent must consult with the parent with legal custody of a child before subjecting a child to a medical procedure that may have a significant effect on the child\u2019s emotional development. See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31 (parent with sole legal custody \u201cshall have the right and responsibility to make major decisions regarding the child\u2019s welfare including matters of education, medical care and emotional, moral and religious development\u201d). Because the results of a paternity test may, as in this case, lead to protracted paternity litigation, serious conflict between the parents, identity confusion for a child, and an incentive for a parent to withdraw emotional or financial support, the agreement of the child\u2019s legal custodian or an order of the court would in most circumstances be required before the noncustodial parent may submit the child to genetic marker and blood group testing years after a paternity judgment has entered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Because we conclude that relief under rule 60 (b) is not available to the father, we need not reach the mother\u2019s claim that relief is precluded by G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 11, as amended, which explicitly limits the circumstances in which a challenge to a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity can be brought. Nor need we consider the father\u2019s claim that his motions for relief do not constitute \u201cchallenges\u201d for the purpose of G.
