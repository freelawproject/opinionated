Lipchitz brought this civil action in 1995 against her employer, Raytheon Company, alleging that she was denied a promotion to the position of corporate medical director (CMD) because of her gender in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 <em>4.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff and awarded her $500,000 in compensatory damages, including $30,000 in back pay, $150,000 in front pay, and $320,000 for emotional distress. Raytheon filed several posttrial motions, all of which were denied, except for Raytheon\u2019s motion for remittitur.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff moved for attorney\u2019s fees and costs and received an award of $225,000 and $20,681, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">Raytheon appealed, and we granted its application for direct appellate review. Raytheon claims that the jury were improperly instructed that the plaintiff was only required to prove \u201cpretext\u201d rather than \u201cpretext for discrimination,\u201d and that it was entitled to an instruction that gender was \u201cthe determinative factor\u201d in the promotion decision. We do not adopt Raytheon\u2019s argument as to how a jury should be instructed on the question of pretext. We conclude, however, that Raytheon was entitled to an instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>tian that the plaintiff had the burden of proving the elements of discriminatory animus, and that discrimination was \u201cthe determinative cause\u201d of the adverse employment decision as we later define that term. We vacate the judgment and remand the case to the Superior Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">We further recommend that in discrimination cases based on indirect evidence, judges abandon the use of jury instructions that rely on the terms \u201cpretext\u201d and \u201cpretext for discrimination,\u201d and that are framed in terms of shifting burdens.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">1. <em>Background Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">In 1975, Lipchitz began working as a physician in the medical department of Raytheon\u2019s largest manufacturing plant located in Andover. The department was responsible for performing physical examinations and providing on-site general and emergency medical services for the plant\u2019s 5,000 to 7,000 employees. In 1980, Lipchitz was promoted to manager of the Andover plant\u2019s medical services department, in which capacity she supervised the plant\u2019s medical department and staff. In addition to her regular administrative duties (including, for example, coordinating and monitoring the medical care of individuals receiving workers\u2019 compensation, attending meetings, and writing reports), she also took the initiative to study health and safety issues affecting Raytheon\u2019s employees, such as substance abuse, and developed teaching modules for plant supervisors on those subjects. At the time of trial in 1997, Lipchitz continued to be employed by Raytheon in this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">From 1980 until 1993, Lipchitz reported directly to Andover plant managers, and had a \u201cdotted-line\u201d supervisory relationship with the CMD, Stephen Alphas.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Throughout those years, Lipchitz received highly favorable written performance reviews, the vehicle by which recommendations for merit increases generally were made. Lipchitz\u2019s favorable evaluations resulted in a salary that was at the upper end of the salary grade for her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>position, as well as frequent bonuses and, eventually, stock options.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In addition to the performance evaluations, Lipchitz wrote annual or biennial self-evaluations in which she catalogued her contributions and accomplishments, and noted her strong desire to advance into a corporate position. The only corporate position available to a practicing medical doctor was the CMD position, and as the years went by Lipchitz made known her desire to fill that position when Alphas retired. Her performance evaluations noted both her desire for advancement and her capacity for a management position.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In 1988, after he underwent bypass surgery, Alphas continued in the CMD position but his superiors raised with him the question of who would succeed him. In 1989, Alphas hired Harry Azadian as a full-time plant physician. Azadian was a long-time acquaintance and colleague of Alphas and had been working one day a week at Raytheon since 1977. Lipchitz presented evidence to suggest that both the decision to offer Azadian the full-time position and the manner in which he was hired reflected Alphas\u2019s expectation that Azadian would be his successor. There was additional evidence to suggest that this view was shared by Azadian.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">A job descriptionf for the position was written in 1990 and required that the CMD be \u201c[bjoard [c]ertif[ied] in an appropriate area of specialization.\u201d Azadian was board certified as a general surgeon; Lipchitz was not board certified. Alphas, the outgoing CMD, had not been board certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Raytheon argued that its reason for passing over Lipchitz in favor of Azadian was primarily difficulties over the years between Lipchitz and Alphas, the CMD, as well as between her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>and various managers within the Andover plant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Lipchitz had pushed hard for certain opportunities she deemed necessary for her professional advancement, but the response she received from Andover plant managers was negative and, on occasion, patronizing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At the same time, she tended to rebuff requests from Alphas and other managers to take on additional responsibilities, requests that might have been viewed by them as ways to earn opportunities for advancement. Her superiors perceived her as unwilling to take on extra work without asking for additional compensation, and unwilling to be a \u201cteam player.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These perceptions were reflected in notations made on documents relevant to, and contemporaneous with, the promotion decision. Testimony regarding the difficulties with her superiors was corroborated by Lipchitz\u2019s desk diary in which she had recorded her disagreements with various managers and supervisors over the years. These difficulties were not mentioned in Lipchitz\u2019s annual reviews or in her self-evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Alphas retired in January, 1994, and Azadian was promoted shortly after. Rather than receive a full promotion to CMD and a salary increase to that position\u2019s salary grade, Azadian was appointed the acting CMD and his salary remained unchanged. The vice-president of human resources testified that Azadian was appointed to this provisional position because Alphas\u2019s retirement was the opportunity he had been awaiting to consider reorganizing the medical department or outsourcing medical services. It was possible that such a change would eliminate the the CMD position. Testimony revealed, however, that as acting CMD, Azadian had all the authority of the CMD, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>expressed his belief that his title and salary had been on hold because of the litigation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">2. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence on Liability.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">After the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, Raytheon moved for a directed verdict. On appeal, it argues that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of pretext at the third stage of the now-familiar order of proof originally set out in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>411 U.S. 792 (1973), and adopted by us in <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 130 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The plaintiff presented sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that at least one of Raytheon\u2019s reasons was false and from this it properly could have inferred that she was not promoted because of unlawful discrimination. See <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>432 Mass. 107, 118 (2000). The reasons Raytheon presented for its decision were Lipchitz\u2019s lack of board certification, and the personal and workstyle difficulties she had with members of management. However, where Lipchitz\u2019s performance evaluations included comments suggesting that she was qualified to hold a management position, the jury could have found that the question of board certification was not the reason Lipchitz had not been promoted, and in other circumstances, the lack of board certification might have been accommodated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, the jury could have credited Lipchitz\u2019s contention that the difficulties she had with Alphas, the CMD, and her Andover managers were not the result of her personality and workstyle and therefore, were the result of gender bias. If the jury found Lipchitz to be a credible witness, and discredited the testimony of Raytheon\u2019s witnesses, the jury could reasonably have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>believed that, had she been a man, her strict adherence to her principles and the official lines of command and her determination about advancing her career, might have been viewed with admiration rather than resentment.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u201cThe ultimate issue of discrimination, raised by the [parties\u2019] conflicting evidence as to the defendants] motive, is not for a court to decide on the basis of [briefs and transcripts], but is for the fact finder after weighing the circumstantial evidence and assessing the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 437, 445 (1995). See <em>Dartt </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. (Mass.), </em>427 Mass. 1, 16 (1998). Viewing the evidence in its light most favorable to the plaintiff, the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that at least one of the reasons advanced by Raytheon was false, from which the jury could have inferred that the plaintiff was denied a promotion because of her gender. See <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, supra </em>at 118. The motion for a directed verdict was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">We do not address Raytheon\u2019s argument that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence because we are remanding for a new trial due to errors in the jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">3. <em>Jury Instructions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">(a) <em>Pretext. </em>Raytheon submitted a written request for an instruction that Lipchitz had the burden of proving that Raytheon\u2019s reasons for not promoting her were a \u201cpretext for discrimination.\u201d It renewed the request after the judge charged the jury and before the jury retired to deliberate. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 51 (b), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). The issue was preserved for appellate review. <em>Torre </em>v. <em>Harris-Seybold Co., </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 660, 678-679 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Raytheon argues that the judge\u2019s failure to give its requested instruction (\u201cpretext for discrimination\u201d) and to use instead the term \u201cpretext,\u201d without more, lowered Lipchitz\u2019s burden in the third stage.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Raytheon additionally argues that the jury\u2019s inability to reach a consensus on question 4, one of the special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>questions that the judge asked the jury to answer, is evidence of this flaw in the instructions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Lipchitz counters that because Massachusetts is a \u201cpretext only\u201d jurisdiction, <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., supra </em>at 443, Raytheon was not entitled to an instruction that she prove \u201cpretext for discrimination\u201d because it would have been an incorrect statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The phrase \u201cpretext for discrimination\u201d implies that the plaintiff must prove not only that a reason given by the employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>for the adverse decision was false, but that the reason was given to cover a discriminatory animus. Our decisions do not require this. See <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, supra </em>at 118. Cf. <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc., </em>426 Mass. 122, 128 (1997). If the employee were able to prove by direct evidence that discriminatory animus motivated the decision, she would not have to rely on the indirect method of proving animus by disproving at least one of the employer\u2019s articulated, nondiscriminatory reasons. Compare <em>Wynn &amp; Wynn, P.C. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>431 Mass. 655 (2000), with <em>Buckley Nursing Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 172 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">In an indirect evidence case, if the fact finder is persuaded that one or more of the employer\u2019s reasons is false, it may (but need not) infer that the employer is covering up a discriminatory intent, motive or state of mind. See <em>Riffelmacher </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019rs of Springfield, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 159, 165 (1989). Permitting, but not requiring the fact finder to draw the inference strikes the proper balance by holding the plaintiff to her ultimate burden without requiring her to produce direct evidence of discriminatory animus, a form of evidence that, we recognize, rarely exists. See <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra </em>at 137. Cf. <em>Sarni Original Dry Cleaners, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cooke, </em>388 Mass. 611, 615-616 (1983). That inference, combined with the evidence adduced to meet the employee\u2019s burden of proof under the first stage of <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>permits the fact finder to conclude that the employee has satisfied her ultimate burden of proving that the decision was made \u201cbecause of\u201d the unlawful discrimination as G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(1), requires.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, supra </em>at 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">(b) <em>Discriminatory animus. </em>Although a \u201cpretext for discrimination\u201d instruction was not required, we agree that the instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>tians on the issue of pretext, given without the benefit of any instructions on discriminatory animus, were, for the reasons that follow, erroneous. (The special verdict form the jury were asked to complete also reflected the error.)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The statute sets out four elements: membership in a protected class, harm, discriminatory animus, and causation. See note 13, <em>supra. </em>See also <em>Dahill </em>v. <em>Police Dep\u2019t of Boston, ante </em>233, 243 (2001) (membership in protected class and causation); <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, supra </em>at 117 (animus); <em>MacCormack </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>423 Mass. 652, 662-663 (1996) (harm). It was undisputed that Lipchitz was a member of a protected class because she was a woman, and was harmed by an employment decision when Raytheon bypassed her for promotion. We therefore turn our attention to the element of discriminatory animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">As we have said, in an indirect evidence case, we permit the fact finder to infer discriminatory animus (and causation) from proof that the employer offered a false reason for the adverse employment decision. Permitting the fact finder to infer discriminatory animus from proof that the employer has advanced a false reason does not, however, eliminate the plaintiff\u2019s burden to prove this essential element. See <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 327, 334 (1996). Stated differently, the \u201cindirect evidence\u201d moniker derives from the type of evidence (pretext) that may establish one or both statutory elements (discriminatory animus and causation).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Johansen </em>v. <em>NCR Comten, Inc., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 294, 299-300 (1991). Pretext does not thereby become the element.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Here, the entire import of the instruction on Lipchitz\u2019s burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>to establish liability was whether she had proved \u201cpretext,\u201d not whether she had proved that Raytheon had refused to promote her \u201cbecause of . . . [her] sex.\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1). See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Area II Homecare for Senior Citizens, Inc., </em>397 Mass. 761, 767 (1986). Cf. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Comm\u2019r of Correction, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 212, 226 (1997). The instruction transformed \u201cpretext\u201d into an essential element of the plaintiff\u2019s case. The error was compounded by the additional instruction that if Lipchitz established that the reasons given by Raytheon were not its \u201creal reason,\u201d she had established Raytheon\u2019s liability and the jury were to move on to the question of assessing damages.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, supra </em>at 117-118. The only \u201cinstruction\u201d the jury received on discriminatory animus was given in connection with special question 4, an advisory question, which the judge described to the jury as having \u201cno effect\u201d on the verdict.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>The judge should have instructed that Lipchitz was required to prove that Raytheon acted with a discriminatory intent, motive or state of mind. As we said in <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, supra, </em>decided two years after the trial in this case, juries should be instructed that this element of proof may be satisfied by circumstantial evidence, such as the inference of discriminatory animus that may be drawn from proof that one or more of the reasons advanced by the employer is false.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">(c) <em>Causation. </em>Raytheon also requested an instruction that Lipchitz had to persuade the jury that her gender was <em>\u201cthe determining factor </em>in the decision not to promote her to Acting CMD,\u201d and that <em>\u201cbut for\u201d </em>a motive to discriminate . . . she would have been promoted\u201d (emphasis added). Raytheon argues that without this instruction, the jury were ill-equipped to weigh the factors involved in the promotion decision if they were persuaded that some of its reasons were legitimate and some were discriminatory. Lipchitz contends that Raytheon was not entitled to this instruction because it is only applicable in cases in which plaintiffs present strong, direct evidence of discrimination and further, that if the instruction was necessary, that Raytheon should bear the burden of proof. See <em>Wynn &amp; Wynn, P.C. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra </em>at 670. This issue was preserved for review. See <em>Flood </em>v. <em>Southland Corp., </em>416 Mass. 62, 66 (1993). We agree with Raytheon that in indirect evidence cases the plaintiff must prove that the defendant\u2019s discriminatory animus was the determinative cause, which we describe below, in bringing about the adverse decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Under the plain language of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, liability attaches when an adverse employment decision is made \u201cbecause of\u201d discrimination.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We have never had occasion to decide whether jurors must be instructed on the statute\u2019s causal link. Such a requirement is, however, implicit in our decisions. See, e.g., <em>Dahill </em>v. <em>Police Dep\u2019t of Boston, supra </em>(plaintiff must prove causation); <em>Melnychenko </em>v. <em>84 Lumber Co., </em>424 Mass. 285, 294 (1997) (ruling for defendant was proper where judge found that retaliation was not \u201ca determinative factor\u201d in discharge); <em>MacCormack </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., supra </em>at 662 n.11 (evidence would not have been sufficient to meet \u201cbut for\u201d burden of causation); <em>Brunner </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster Eng\u2019g Corp., </em>413 Mass. 698, 705 (1992) (\u201cbut for\u201d causation is \u201cessential element of [plaintiff\u2019s] case\u201d); <em>DiBenedetto </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>398 Mass. 395, 400 (1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1092 (1987) (discrimination was \u201cnot a causative factor\u201d in hiring decision); <em>Trustees of Forbes Library </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>384 Mass. 559, 562-563 (1981) (retaliation must have been \u201cbut for cause\u201d)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>; <em>Smith College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>376 Mass. 221, 226-227 (1978) (sex must have been \u201ca determinative cause\u201d). See also <em>Buckley Nursing Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra </em>at 179. Cf. <em>Drinkwater </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>406 Mass. 756, 762 (1990) (upholding race-conscious hiring plan against charge of reverse discrimination in part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>because \u201crace was only <em>a factor\u201d </em>officials were to consider [emphasis added]). In addition, we have approved jury instructions that have included language describing this causal link. See <em>Dartt </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. (Mass.), supra </em>at 12 n.18 (\u201cplaintiff has the burden to prove . . . that but for plaintiff\u2019s handicap, the defendant would not have terminated the plaintiff\u201d); <em>DiBenedetto </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 401 (jury instructed that they must be convinced that \u201cbut for\u201d discrimination, plaintiff would have been hired).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The failure to alert the jury to the requirement that Lipchitz prove a causal link between Raytheon\u2019s alleged discriminatory animus and its decision to not promote her, was error.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It was prejudicial because here, the evidence suggested several reasons for Raytheon\u2019s decision to pass over Lipchitz, some of which the jury could have found credible, some of which the jury might have found not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">We note, however, that to meet her burden of proof that discrimination was the determinative cause of the promotion decision, Lipchitz was not required to disprove every reason articulated by the defendant or suggested in the evidence. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number><em>Dartt </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. (Mass.), supra </em>at 9. She could meet her burden by persuading the fact finder that it was more likely than not that at least one reason was false. But see <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra </em>at 137 (remanding for rehearing because commissioner had only addressed three of the four reasons offered by defendant). From such proof the fact finder could infer that Raytheon\u2019s discriminatory animus was the determinative cause of the adverse employment decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The plaintiff is correct that reversible error will not be found merely by \u201cconsideration of [a] fragment [of an instruction] which may be open to criticism.\u201d See <em>Haven </em>v. <em>Brimfield, </em>345 Mass. 529, 533 (1963). Reversible error may lie, however, where the error of a \u201cfragment\u201d reflects the error of the instructions read as a whole. We are presented here with a jury charge that failed to instruct the jury adequately on two necessary elements under the statute. The error was compounded by the judge\u2019s incorrect instruction that, if Lipchitz proved that Raytheon had lied, she had prevailed in the litigation. See <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, supra </em>at 117-118. Considered as a whole, <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>200 Mass. 537, 544 (1909), the charge failed to \u201cclearly, adequately, and correctly explainf] to the jury the principles that ought to guide and control their action.\u201d <em>Torre </em>v. <em>Harris-Seybold Co., 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 660, 678-679 (1980), and cases cited. The failure to instruct on these elements was prejudicial and the case must be retried.

Decided in the context of the Federal antidiscrimination law, <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>represented an enormous step forward in employment discrimination law by providing plaintiffs who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>lacked \u201csmoking gun\u201d evidence a method to present \u2014 and prove \u2014 their cases, and we have used its order of proof in analyzing cases brought under our own anti-discrimination statute since 1976. See <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against </em>Discrimination, 371 Mass. 130, 138 (1976). However, this \u201canalytical framework\u201d was established in the context of summary judgment \u201cto give judges a method of organizing evidence and assigning the burdens of production and persuasion in a discrimination case.\u201d <em>Loeb </em>v. <em>Textron, Inc., </em>600 F.2d 1003, 1016 (1st Cir. 1979). It \u201cwas not written as a prospective jury charge,\u201d <em>id., </em>and is ill-suited to the task: By the time of trial, a plaintiff will have discovered the employer\u2019s reasons for the adverse action, and may present them in his or her case-in-chief, together with evidence that one or more of the reasons is false.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">We see no reason to burden the jury with terms like \u201cmixed-motive\u201d and \u201cpretext\u201d or with rules regarding shifting burdens, all of which \u201chave taken on lives of their own, independent of their connection to the underlying theories of liability that gave them birth.\u201d See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Cigna Corp., </em>47 F.3d 586, 599 (3d Cir. 1995) (Greenberg, I., concurring in part). See also Model Civil Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the Ninth Circuit \u00a7 11.5.1 (1997 ed.); Model Civil Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the Eighth Circuit \u00a7 5.01 (1999 ed.). The burden shifting rules involve questions of law more appropriately left to the trial judge to decide. See, e.g., <em>Greenway </em>v. <em>Buffalo Hilton Hotel, </em>143 F.3d 47, 52-53 (2d Cir. 1998). We encourage trial judges to craft instructions that will focus the jury\u2019s attention on the ultimate issues of harm, discriminatory animus and causation in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">(b) <em>Admissibility of \u201cstatistical\u201d evidence in claims of individual disparate treatment. </em>Raytheon argues that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence regarding the gender composition at its highest ranks was statistical evidence that was both inadmissible and irrelevant. It argues that the evidence lacked the necessary foundation of labor market statistics reflecting the gender composition of those seeking such positions, and that it was irrelevant because the evidence related to non-medical positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The evidence indicated that until 1993, there were no women <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>in the corporate ranks of the company. Such numbers are relevant, and may be properly introduced in a disparate treatment case, see <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Area II Homecare for Senior Citizens, Inc., </em>397 Mass. 761, 769-770 (1986), because to the extent they suggest that the highest ranks of an employer\u2019s organization are closed to members of a protected class, they may support an inference that the particular decision was tainted by an unlawful bias. See <em>Buckley Nursing Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 172, 179 (1985) (aberrant hiring practice \u201csupplemented by the statistical proof\u201d supported conclusion that explanation for failing to hire plaintiff \u201cwas only a pretext for unlawful discrimination\u201d). A defendant is free to rebut the evidence, as Raytheon did here, by introducing its own labor market statistics.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The judgment is reversed, the verdict set aside, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b512-13\">Lipchitz\u2019s discrimination claim encompassed both the allegation that she was passed over for promotion in favor of a male colleague, and that she was perceived negatively because she was a woman.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b512-14\">The judge reduced the award for front pay to $70,000 and reduced the\" award for emotional distress to $225,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b513-9\">In 1993, a reorganization of the medical department brought Lipchitz and the other full-time plant physicians directly under the supervision of the CMD.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Job positions were assigned a salary grade from one to eighteen. Lipchitz was at grade fourteen, as was Harry Azadian both while he was a plant physician and after his promotion to acting CMD. Stephen Alphas began in 1977 at grade fourteen but reached grade seventeen some twelve years later. The CMD job description written in 1990 described the job as being grade seventeen. The range of salaries in each grade was so broad that there was considerable overlap between the salaries in grades fourteen and seventeen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Alphas had, on at least one occasion, referred to Lipchitz as \u201cbig-breasted Martha\u201d and a \u201cbitch.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Lipchitz testified that one manager asked, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just stay where you are and polish your pearl and if you\u2019re lucky maybe some day somebody will notice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b515-8\">For example, Alphas testified that on one occasion, Lipchitz balked at a clear directive of his regarding a temporary deployment of her staff to help out at another plant. Lipchitz contended that the dotted-line supervisory relationship did not give Alphas the authority to give such an order. On another occasion, she refused to sign a medical department petition he had initiated as CMD recommending that the plants be smoke-free working environments. At the time Lipchitz did not explain her refusal to sign, but at trial stated simply that she did not sign petitions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Lipchitz filed her administrative claim with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination a few weeks after Azadian was promoted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b516-9\">In its closing, Raytheon argued to the jury that the question of qualifications went only to the matter of whether Lipchitz had satisfied her burden of proof in the first stage.-Raytheon does not appeal from the jury\u2019s finding that the plaintiff satisfied that burden of proof, but folds the matter of qualifications into its argument that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of liability. The issue of qualifications was sufficiently pervasive at trial to have led the judge to describe Raytheon\u2019s articulated reason as \u201clegitimate factors involving qualifications.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b517-10\">The judge did incorporate some of Raytheon\u2019s requested language into his instructions. However, viewed as a whole, the import \u00f3f the instructions was that the plaintiff had met her burden with proof of \u201cpretext,\u201d and \u201cpretext\u201d alone, as the plaintiff seems to concede. The judge instructed the jury, \u201cIn this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>[the third] stage, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the reasons given by the defendant were not the real reasons for failing to promote her . . . but were a pretext for gender discrimination. Under the laws of the Commonwealth, the plaintiff may satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s burden by proving that the employer\u2019s articulated reason or reasons was not the real reason or reasons for the hiring decision.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The four questions of the special jury verdict form that went to the issue of liability, Mass.

This is an advisory question which does not effect [sic] the ultimate verdict and is presented for administrative purposes only.

[Answer: handwritten on slip, \u2018Could not reach a 10/2 decision.\u2019]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b519-7\">General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1), provides that, \u201cIt shall be an unlawful practice . . . [fjor an employer . . . because of the . . . sex ... of any individual to refuse to hire or employ or to bar or to discharge from employment such individual, or to discriminate against such individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Proof that one or more of the employer\u2019s stated reasons is false may be accomplished by offering some direct evidence of discriminatory animus. See <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., supra </em>at 445. While this evidence may be insufficient to satisfy the evidentiary threshold for so-called \u201cdirect evidence\u201d cases we recently set out in <em>Wynn &amp; Wynn, P.C. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>431 Mass. 655, 669-670 (2000), it may be sufficient to permit the fact finder to conclude that at least one of the employer\u2019s reasons is false, and therefore to support an inference that the adverse employment action was made because of discrimination. The ultimate issue of discrimination does not differ depending on the type of proof available to the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b521-5\">This case was tried more than two years before our decision in <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>432 Mass. 107 (2000), in which we clarified (1) that pretext alone was sufficient to support a finding of liability and that the plaintiff was not required, in addition, to furnish evidence of actual discrimin\u00e1tion once the employer advanced its nondiscriminatory reasons, and (2) that a showing of pretext permitted, but did not compel, the inference that the adverse employment action was because of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 118. We do not criticize the judge for having to deal with the uncertainty generated by our decision in <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 437 (1995), on these matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The judge instructed: \u201cI have asked the jury an advisory question, and please understand that the answer to this question in no way affects the outcome of this trial, [and is] for administrative purposes only. I am asking you to consider whether or not the plaintiff has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had a discriminatory motive in making its hiring decision? Here the jury may consider indirect and circumstantial evidence in determining whether the plaintiff has proven that the hiring decision was motivated by gender discrimination. . . . Did the plaintiff prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant\u2019s actual motivation when filling the position, was gender discrimination?\u201d Jurors were unable to agree on an answer to special question 4, which illustrates the problem at hand. See note 12, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">In response to a question from the jury with respect to this question, the judge further instructed the jury that an actual motive to discriminate required a \u201cconscious motive toward gender bias.\u201d Although special question 4 was advisory, this instruction was error. Despite heightened awareness about workplace diversity and discrimination, an employer will not necessarily be aware of his or her bias. Stereotypical thinking, for example, involves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>categorizing people on the basis of broad generalizations, not necessarily accompanied by deliberate reflection or conscious thought. Employment decisions that are made <em>because of </em>stereotypical thinking about a protected characteristic or members of a protected class, whether conscious or unconscious, are actionable under G. L. c. 151B. See <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Eastman Kodak Co., </em>183 F.3d 38, 42 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1161 (2000) (\u201cTitle VIPs prohibition against \u2018disparate treatment because of race\u2019 extends both to employer acts based on conscious racial animus and to employer decisions that are based on stereotyped thinking or other forms of less conscious bias\u201d). See also <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Biggins, </em>507 U.S. 604, 610 (1993) (unlawful employment practice under Federal age discrimination law to make decisions on \u201cbasis of inaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\u201cBecause of\u201d under c. 151B triggers liability at the same level of causation for all claims of employment discrimination, whether the evidence presented by the plaintiff is \u201cindirect\u201d (in so-called \u201cpretext\u201d cases) or \u201cdirect\u201d (in so-called \u201cmixed motive\u201d cases). Cf. <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Ludwig, </em>292 Mass. 251, 254-255 (1935). With respect to the element of causation, the distinction between \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cindirect\u201d evidence cases is not the degree of causation, but who bears the burden of proving it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b523-6\">In <em>Wynn &amp; Wynn, P.C. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra, </em>we held that, where a plaintiff presents strong, direct proof that an unlawful consideration was a factor in the employment decision, the defendant, to escape liability, must prove that it would have made the same decision without the unlawful consideration. <em>Id. </em>at 669-670. We recognized that this holding overruled that portion of <em>Trustees of Forbes Library </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>384 Mass. 559, 565-566 (1981), that held that the burden of proof in a \u201cdirect evidence\u201d case remained with the plaintiff. Our <em>Wynn &amp; Wynn </em>decision did not, however, reject our earlier analysis regarding the degree of causation mandated by the statutory phrase \u201cbecause of.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Our decisions have described the causal element in various ways, which essentially have been the proximate or determinative cause standard used in negligence cases. A cause is the determinative cause if it was the active efficient cause in bringing about the adverse employment action. See <em>Jussim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Ins. Co., </em>415 Mass. 24, 27 (1993), citing <em>Lynn Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Meriden Fire Ins. Co., </em>158 Mass. 570, 575 (1893) (proximate cause). In other words, the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the credible evidence that the defendant\u2019s discriminatory animus contributed significantly to that action, that it was a material and important ingredient in causing it to happen. Cf. <em>Nass </em>v. <em>Duxbury, </em>327 Mass. 396, 400 (1951). That a defendant\u2019s discriminatory intent, motive or state of mind is \u201cthe determinative cause\u201d does not imply the discriminatory animus was the only cause of that action. See <em>Dartt </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. (Mass.), supra </em>at 7-9 (\u201cbecause of\u201d does not mean \u201csolely because of\u201d). See also D.B. Dobbs, Torts \u00a7 168, at 410 (2001) (\u201cNothing is the result of a single cause in fact.
