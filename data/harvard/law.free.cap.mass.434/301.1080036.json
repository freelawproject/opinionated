Rule 3:05 (5) (e), (f), as appearing in 382 Mass. 762 (1981). <em>Id. </em>at 871. We permitted them, however, to treat the assignment as \u201csecurity for Carroll\u2019s payment of his debt\u201d to them: a $71,000 judgment with interest and costs on count I of their complaint, \u201cand reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and expenses incurred in pursuing Carroll\u2019s claim against Linnane\u201d in count IV. <em>Id. </em>at 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">On remand, Berman and Marcus filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs of $348,252 and $12,968, respectively. After hearing, a judge in the Superior Court awarded $95,000 in fees and $553.12 in costs. The judge, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 15, 365 Mass. 761 (1974), and Mass. R. Civ. P. 17 (a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 365 Mass. 763 (1974), also permitted Carroll, over Linnane\u2019s objection, to be joined as a party plaintiff on count IV and to recover the balance of the $686,570 judgment against Linnane on that count. Berman and Marcus have appealed, arguing that the award of fees and costs is inadequate. Linnane also appealed. He contends that the award is excessive, and that the judge abused his discretion by permitting Carroll to be joined as a party plaintiff on count IV. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">1. Berman and Marcus argue that the reduction in the amount of attorney\u2019s fees sought, unsupported by detailed findings, was an abuse of discretion. Linnane contends that the award of attorney\u2019s fees was an abuse of discretion because it was disproportionate to the amount of the underlying claim for $71,000 in count I.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">What constitutes a reasonable fee is a question that is com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>mitted to the sound discretion of the judge. See <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Mishara, </em>386 Mass. 74, 87 (1982). When determining a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, the focus is not the bill submitted, as Berman and Marcus suggest, or the amount in controversy, as Linnane suggests, but several factors, including \u201cthe nature of the case and the issues presented, the time and labor required, the amount of damages involved, the result obtained, the experience, reputation and ability of the attorney, the usual price charged for similar services by other attorneys in the same area, and the amount of awards in similar cases.\u201d <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 388-389 (1979). No one factor is determinative, and a factor-by-factor analysis, although helpful, is not required. See <em>Margolies </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>401 Mass. 88, 93 (1987). Here, the judge considered those factors on which evidence was presented, as well as his experience from the trial. He was not required to review and allow or disallow each individual item in the bill, but could consider the bill as a whole. He concluded that the legal issues were relatively straightforward, and that much of the work performed was repetitive and unnecessary. These findings are not clearly erroneous. See <em>Cargill, Inc. </em>v. <em>Beaver Coal &amp; Oil Co., </em>424 Mass. 356, 363 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The judge also determined that reasonable attorneys would have spent no more than a total of 475 hours at an average rate of $200 an hour for both the trial and the appeal. He thus determined that a reasonable fee would be $95,000. This method of calculating a fee, known as a \u201clodestar\u201d award, is one that we have previously approved. See <em>id.; Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. 309, 324-325 (1993). We are satisfied that the judge was mindful of the appropriate factors, and that his use of this method to calculate the fee was not an abuse of discretion. <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Mishara, supra </em>at 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">A judge\u2019s award of costs is also discretionary, see G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 13, and there has been no showing that the refusal to allow nonstatutory costs was an abuse of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>2. By statute, a judge has discretion to permit amendment of a complaint at any time to add a real party in interest, and the amendment may relate back to the original pleading. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 51. See also <em>Strout </em>v. <em>United Shoe Mach. Co., </em>215 Mass. 116 (1913) (amendment after rescript substituting plaintiff as real party in interest). Such authority is also conferred by rules 15 and 17 (a). See <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>D\u2019Annolfo, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 413, 428 (1983). See also <em>Crown Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>830 F. Supp. 1097, 1099-1101 (N.D. Ill. 1993), aff\u2019d, 35 F.3d 296 (7th Cir. 1994); <em>Arabian Am. Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Scarfone, </em>713 F. Supp. 1420, 1424 (M.D. Fla. 1989).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Various factors inform a decision to permit amendment and joinder under rules 15 and 17 (a). Such factors include (1) whether an honest mistake had been made in selecting the proper party; (2) whether joinder of the real party in interest had been requested within a reasonable time after the mistake was discovered; (3) whether joinder is necessary to avoid an injustice; and (4) whether joinder would prejudice the nonmoving party. See 6A C.A. Wright, A.R. Miller &amp; M.K. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1555, at 413-414 (2d ed. 1990 &amp; Supp. 2000). We turn to those factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Carroll tried unsuccessfully to intervene shortly after the original trial, after the judge, on Linnane\u2019s posttrial motion, determined that Carroll\u2019s assignment was void as champertous. We subsequently held that the assignment was not champertous, but determined that Berman and Marcus were acting as Carroll\u2019s attorneys under count IV, not as his assignees. See <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Linnane, supra </em>at 870. The parties were mistaken as to the real party in interest. See <em>id. </em>at 872 n.7. Carroll moved for joinder promptly after our decision in <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Linnane, supra, </em>when it became clear that he was the real party in interest under count IV. Carroll was reasonably vigilant of his interests. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>CMA, Inc., </em>890 F.2d 1070, 1074 (9th Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Failure to permit Carroll to be added as a party plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>under count IV would deprive him of damages to which the jury found he is entitled, and result in a windfall to Linnane. One purpose of rule 17 (a) is to prevent forfeiture of an action. See <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>D\u2019Annolfo, supra; United States </em>v. <em>CMA, Inc., supra. </em>Carroll\u2019s joinder prevents the injustice that would result if he were required to incur additional legal expenses to relitigate a claim that had been fully tried. It also conserves valuable judicial resources. See generally <em>U-Haul Int\u2019l, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jartran, Inc., </em>793 F.2d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">There has been no showing of prejudice to Linnane. There is no element of unfair surprise, as Carroll\u2019s claim against Linnane was fully litigated at the prior trial. See <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>373 Mass. 290, 297 (1977); <em>Cronan </em>v. <em>Woburn, </em>185 Mass. 91, 95 (1904); <em>Lancaster </em>v. <em>General Acc. Ins. Co., </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 925, 927, <em>S.C., </em>413 Mass. 1007 (1992). Linnane argues that he is entitled at least to a new trial on damages because we never resolved the damages issue he raised in the original appeal. We conclude that he is not entitled to a new trial. Although we did not need to decide the issue of damages that Linnane raised in <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Linnane, supra, </em>we noted that his brief was \u201cwithout a record reference or specific argument\u201d on the issue. <em>Id. </em>at 874. On remand, his opposition to Carroll\u2019s motion for joinder and his motion for reconsideration renewed these issues, but were similarly scant and unsupported. Linnane has failed to present any reasoned appellate argument supporting this contention, and we do not consider it. See <em>Bjorkman </em>v. <em>Suffolk Constr. Co., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 591, 595 (1997). There was no abuse of discretion in permitting Carroll\u2019s joinder, and permitting him to recover the balance of the judgment obtained on count IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Linnane next argues that Carroll\u2019s failure to appeal the denial of his motion to intervene acts as a bar to his post rescript motion for joinder. Carroll\u2019s interest in count IV was the validity of the assignment, under which he would have shared the proceeds of any judgment. Berman and Marcus appealed from the' order invalidating the entire assignment. Carroll\u2019s rights were contingent on the outcome of that appeal. His willingness to abide by the terms of the assignment, under which he sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>rendered the right to prosecute his claim, did not prevent him from asserting his rights once we determined that the assignment was invalid, though for reasons very different from those of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Linnane\u2019s related contentions that Carroll waived his right to participate in the prosecution of his claim under count IV when he assigned his rights to Berman and Marcus, and that we restricted the amount of the judgment on count IV to the amount Berman and Marcus properly could recover, are similarly without merit. The assignment expressly contemplated Carroll\u2019s participation by providing that he would receive a portion of any judgment recovered. Moreover, the effect of <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Linnane, supra, </em>was to limit the amount Berman and Marcus properly could recover under Carroll\u2019s assignment. We did not limit Carroll\u2019s right to recover against Linnane or preclude Carroll\u2019s joinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Finally, there is no basis to Linnane\u2019s argument that he was denied timely notice of Carroll\u2019s motion for joinder. His affidavit indicates that he learned of the hearing date only after he opened his mail; it does not say that the notice was not delivered timely. Regardless, in his motion for reconsideration, Linnane was heard on the question of joinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Rule 17 (a) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, 365 Mass. 763 (1974), states in relevant part: \u201c[E]very action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest ....

See <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Linnane, </em>424 Mass. 867, 870-871 (1997). Attorney\u2019s fees were not awarded for work done on count I, but, as we directed, for work done in pursuit of Carroll\u2019s claim against Linnane under count IV.
