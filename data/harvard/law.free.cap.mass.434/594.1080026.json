L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, for secretly tape recording statements made by police officers during a routine traffic stop. A jury in the District Court convicted the defendant on four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>counts of a complaint charging him with unlawfully intercepting the oral communications of another, in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 F. The defendant appealed, and we granted his application for direct appellate review. We conclude that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, strictly prohibits the secret electronic recording by a private individual of any oral communication, and makes no exception for a motorist who, having been stopped by police officers, surreptitiously tape records the encounter. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. On October 26, 1998, just after 10:30 p.m., an Abington police officer stopped the defendant\u2019s white Porsche, because the automobile had an excessively loud exhaust system and an unlit rear registration plate light. Three other Abington police officers arrived shortly thereafter and the stop quickly became confrontational.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the course of the stop, which lasted approximately fifteen to twenty minutes, the defendant and his passenger, Daniel Hartesty, were ordered out of the automobile, and Hartesty was pat frisked. One officer reached into the automobile, picked up a plastic shopping bag that lay on the floor by the passenger seat, and looked inside. (The bag contained compact discs.) At one point, the defendant stated that the stop was \u201ca bunch of bullshit,\u201d and that he had been stopped because of his long hair. One officer responded, \u201cDon\u2019t lay that shit on me.\u201d Later, another officer called the defendant \u201can asshole.\u201d The defendant was asked whether he had any \u201cblow\u201d (cocaine) in the car. At the conclusion of the stop, the defendant and Hartesty were allowed to leave. No traffic citation was issued to the defendant, and the defendant was not charged with any crime. According to the testimony of one police officer, the defendant was \u201calmost out of control\u201d and the stop \u201chad gone so sour,\u201d that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>deemed in everyone\u2019s interest simply to give the defendant a verbal warning. Unbeknownst to the officers, however, the defendant had activated a hand-held tape recorder at the inception of the stop and had recorded the entire encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Six days later, the defendant went to the Abington police station to file a formal complaint based on his unfair treatment during the stop. To substantiate his allegations, he produced the tape recording he had made. A subsequent internal investigation conducted by the Abington police department, which concluded on February 1, 1999, exonerated the officers of any misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In the meantime, the Abington police sought a criminal complaint in the Brockton Division of the District Court Department against the defendant for four counts of wiretapping in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99. A clerk-magistrate refused to issue the complaint, and the Commonwealth appealed. After a show cause hearing, a judge in the District Court ordered that the complaint issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. He claimed that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, was intended to protect the privacy rights of individuals, and, because the police officers were performing official police duties during the stop of his car, they had no privacy expectations in their words, and, as a result, their conversation should not be considered \u201coral communication\u201d within the statute. Because, in the defendant\u2019s view, there was no interception of any \u201coral communication,\u201d there could be no violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99. In support of his position, the defendant relied on Federal cases interpreting the term \u201coral communications\u201d as defined in the Federal electronic surveillance statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510 (2000), to require the speaker to have a justifiable expectation of privacy. The defendant asserted that Massachusetts courts have looked to Federal decisions interpreting the Federal statute for guidance in interpreting other portions of our electronic surveillance statute, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Look, </em>379 Mass. 893 (1980), and so we should also look to Federal precedent for the proper interpretation of the term \u201coral communication\u201d in our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">The judge (the same judge who had ordered that the complaint issue) rejected the defendant\u2019s argument and denied the motion to dismiss. The judge reasoned that the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>\u201coral communication\u201d under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 2 (\u201cspeech, except such speech as is transmitted over public air waves by radio or other similar device\u201d), was clear, and, unlike the definition in the Federal electronic surveillance statute,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did not require an expectation of privacy by the speaker in order to make the statute applicable. He concluded that the Massachusetts. statute prohibited the secret tape recording of the police officers\u2019 speech. The defendant was tried before a jury and convicted of four counts of violating G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The defendant once again claims, as his principal argument, that the judge improperly denied his motion to dismiss, because the police officers did not possess any privacy interest in the words they spoke in the course of the stop, and, therefore, his tape recording of the encounter did not violate G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99. The Commonwealth asserts that the plain language of the statute unambiguously expresses the Legislature\u2019s intent to prohibit the secret recording of the speech of anyone, except in specifically delineated circumstances. We agree with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 99 C 1, set forth below,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> prohibits, unless otherwise specified in the statute, the intentional interception of any oral communication. The statute provides that \u201c[t]he term \u2018interception\u2019 means to secretly hear, secretly record, or aid another to secretly hear or secretly record the contents of any wire or oral communication through the use of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>intercepting device[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] by any person other than a person given prior authority by all parties to such communication . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 4. An \u201coral communication\u201d is defined as \u201cspeech, except such speech as is transmitted over the public air waves by radio or other similar device.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 2. Exceptions to the general prohibition are clearly specified within the statute and include recordings by (1) a communication common carrier in the ordinary course of its business, see G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 D 1 a (commonly referred to as \u201cservice observing\u201d); (2) persons using an \"office intercommunication system in the ordinary course of their business, see G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 D 1 b; (3) an investigative or law enforcement officer, if the officer is a party to such communication or has been given prior authority by such a party, and if the recording is made in the course of investigating certain designated offenses in connection with organized crime, see G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 4 and 7; and (4) persons duly authorized to make specific interceptions by a warrant issued pursuant to the statute, see G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 D 1 d. The statute is carefully worded and unambiguous, and lists no exception for a private individual who secretly records the oral communications of public officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">We have no doubt that the plain language of the statute accurately states the Legislature\u2019s intent. The Report of the Special Commission on Electronic Eavesdropping, 1968 Senate Doc. No. 1132, at 6, confirms that the statute\u2019s strict prohibition of all secret recording by members of the public grew out of concern over the commercial availability of electronic devices capable of intercepting wire or oral communications, and the recognition that there was no way effectively to prohibit the sale or manufacture of these devices. These concerns led the commission to revise the prior version of the statute, which had allowed secret recording on private premises, see G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 272, \u00a7 101 (\u201cnothing contained [herein] shall render it unlawful for any person to install and use such a device on premises under his exclusive control\u201d), repealed by St. 1968, c. 738, \u00a7 5, to \u201cstrictly prohibit [the public from] electronic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>eavesdropping and wiretapping of other persons\u2019 conversations without permission.\u201d 1968 Senate Doc. No. 1132, at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In addition, until the 1968 amendments, the law had permitted the recording of one\u2019s own conversations, or conversations with the prior permission of one party (traditionally known as \u201cone-party consent\u201d). See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, as appearing in St. 1959, c. 449, \u00a7 1 (\u201cWhoever . . . secretly or without the consent of either a sender or receiver . . .\u201d). The commission revised the statute generally to disallow recordings made with one-party consent, thus rejecting the prevalent approach taken by other States, and by the comparable Federal electronic surveillance statute, that generally permitted wiretapping and eavesdropping in cases of one-party consent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, </em>384 Mass. 271, 280 n.7 (1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1147 (1982) (examining Legislature\u2019s decision in 1968 amendments to allow some warrantless surveillance by law enforcement officers, but limiting the reach of one-party consent to interception of offenses in connection with organized crime). The commission clearly designed the 1968 amendments to create a more restrictive electronic surveillance statute than comparable statutes in other States.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>370 Mass. 502, 506 &amp; n.6 (1976). We conclude that the Legislature intended G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, strictly to prohibit all secret recordings by members of the public, including recordings of police officers or other public officials interacting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>with members of the public, when made without their permission or knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">We reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the statute is not applicable because the police officers were performing their public duties, and, therefore, had no reasonable expectation of privacy in their words. The statute\u2019s preamble expresses the Legislature\u2019s general concern that \u201cthe uncontrolled development and unrestricted use of modern electronic surveillance devices pose[d] grave dangers to the privacy of all citizens of the commonwealth\u201d and this concern was relied on to justify the ban on the public\u2019s clandestine use of such devices. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>422 Mass. 816, 833 (1996). While we recognize that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, was designed to prohibit the use of electronic surveillance devices by private individuals because of the serious threat they pose to the \u201cprivacy of all citizens,\u201d the plain language of the statute, which is the best indication of the Legislature\u2019s ultimate intent, contains nothing that would protect, on the basis of privacy rights, the recording that occurred here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra </em>at 506, this court rejected the argument that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>because a kidnapper has no legitimate privacy interest in telephone calls made for ransom purposes, the secret electronic recording of that conversation by the victim\u2019s brother would not be prohibited under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99: \u201c[W]e would render meaningless the Legislature\u2019s careful choice of words if we were to interpret \u2018secretly\u2019 as encompassing only those situations where an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The defendant concedes the restrictive nature of the statute\u2019s language, but urges us, nevertheless, to recognize an exception to the statute\u2019s prohibition. In support of his request, the defendant cites <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra </em>at 832-833, where this court held that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 P, which allows a criminal defendant to move to suppress evidence obtained in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, does not prohibit a judge from allowing in evidence routine administrative recordings of a defendant\u2019s booking procedure following an arrest. That decision, however, dealt primarily with the admissibility of a secret recording as evidence, and not with whether a violation of the statute had occurred. Moreover, the defendant cannot claim that his recording was made as a routine, administrative procedure, when the record indicates that he recorded the officers\u2019 words fully intending to use the recording as proof in his subsequent complaint of police misconduct.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The defendant argues that his prosecution was tantamount to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>holding him criminally liable for exercising his constitutional rights to \u201cpetition [the government] for redress of his grievances and to hold police officers accountable for their behavior.\u201d This argument has no merit. The defendant freely exercised his right to petition by filing his complaint of police misconduct with the Abington police department. An internal investigation was conducted pursuant to his complaint, which included, according to the trial testimony of the officer in charge of the investigation, a review of the defendant\u2019s tape of the encounter. The defendant was not prosecuted for making the recording; he was prosecuted for doing so secretly.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The dissent reaches its conclusion by ignoring the unambiguous language and definitions of the statute and by relying on purported (and dubious) legislative history. The dissent suggests that the defendant\u2019s secret recording of the words of the police officers should be lawful, because such recording may tend to hold police officers accountable for improper behavior. Implicit in the dissent\u2019s position is the even broader suggestion that police officers routinely act illegally or abusively, to the degree that public policy strongly requires documentation of details of contacts between the police and members of the public to protect important rights. We doubt the validity of the dissent\u2019s major premise, and we are not convinced that the widespread clandestine recording of encounters between individuals and police officers would be desirable or even efficacious.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nor do we think, as the dissent does, that police officers should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>singled out for particular approbation to safeguard the integrity of the \u201cRepublic.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 612-613. Followed to its logical conclusion, the dissent would encourage drug manufacturers to mount hidden video cameras in their facilities so they can capture the moment of truth when the police execute a search warrant and would authorize drug dealers secretly to tape record conversations with suspected undercover officers or with informants in order to protect the dealers\u2019 rights against hypothetical police abuse. Numerous other examples exist. The point is an obvious one. Every police encounter would be available for secret recording; even meter maids would not be spared. The value of obtaining probative evidence of occasional official misconduct does not justify a failure to enforce the clear terms of the statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>400 Mass. 61, 74 (1987), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Further, if the tape recording here is deemed proper on the ground that public officials are involved, then the door is opened even wider to electronic \u201cbugging\u201d or secret audio tape recording (both are prohibited by the statute and both are indistinguishable in the injury they inflict) of virtually every encounter or meeting between a person and a public official, whether the meeting or encounter is one that is stressful (like the one in this case or, perhaps, a session with a tax auditor) or nonstressful (like a routine meeting between a parent and a teacher in a public school to discuss a good student\u2019s progress). The door once opened would be hard to close, and the result would contravene the statute\u2019s broad purpose and the Legislature\u2019s clear prohibition of <em>all </em>secret interceptions and recordings by private citizens. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra </em>at 279 (\u201cthe Legislature proceeded on the premise that electronic surveillance is anathema except within certain narrowly prescribed boundaries\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>426 Mass. 313, 315 (1997); <em>O\u2019Sullivan </em>v. <em>NYNEX Corp., </em>426 Mass. 261, 263 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, supra </em>at 66. Despite efforts to circumscribe its holding, the dissent, by logi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>cal extension, would permit the untrammeled interception of communications by legislators, executive officers and agents, judicial officials, municipal officers, among others, on the erroneous supposition that public accountability requires the practice. It is not our function to craft unwarranted judicial exceptions to a statute that is unambiguous on its face, and, particularly, not to attempt to do so by subjecting police and public officials to sinister accusations or by evoking unwarranted fears that legitimate interests of the media may be harmed by the statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra </em>at 279-280.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Finally, some comment is in order on the dissent\u2019s appeal to the now-famous Rodney King videotape, recorded in Los Angeles, California, by George Holliday on March 3, 1991, <em>post </em>at 606-607. The appeal interjects emotional rhetoric into what should be a straightforward matter of statutory interpretation. The California electronic surveillance statute prohibits only the recording of \u201cconfidential communication,\u201d and excludes \u201ccommunication made in a public gathering . . . or in any other circumstance in which the parties to the communication may reasonably expect that the communication may be overheard or recorded,\u201d Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 632 (a) and (c) (West 1999), and, therefore, would have no application to Holliday\u2019s videotape. As discussed above, however, our Legislature chose not to follow those States whose statutes prohibit wiretapping or secret electronic recording based on privacy rights. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>notes 5 and 6, <em>supra. </em>\u201cIf the Legislature had intended to [prohibit only secret recording where an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy], the statute would have been written in terms similar to those used in the California eavesdropping statute .... Rather, it is apparent from the Report of the Special Commission on Electronic Eavesdropping, 1968 Senate Doc. No. 1132, that the legislative intent was to impose more stringent restrictions on the use of electronic surveillance devices by private individuals than is done in other States.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Jackson, 370 Mass. 502, 506 (1976). There is no basis to ignore the plain language and legislative history of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, or our case law interpreting it, in favor of speculation as to how an imaginary scenario might have played out, had the Rodney King episode occurred in Massachusetts and not in California.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The problem here could have been avoided if, at the outset of the traffic stop, the defendant had simply informed the police of his intention to tape record the encounter, or even held the tape recorder in plain sight.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Had he done so, his recording would not have been secret, and so would not have violated G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra </em>at 507 (no \u201cinterception\u201d when defendant was aware his voice was being recorded). Secret tape recording by private individuals has been unequivocally banned, and, unless and until the Legislature changes the statute, what was done here cannot be done lawfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-6\">According to the testimony of the officers who made the stop, the defendant was loud, argumentative, and uncooperative. Although the police officers and Daniel Hartesty, a passenger in the defendant\u2019s car, attempted to calm the defendant, he became more and more unruly as the stop progressed. Hartesty, on the other hand, testifying for the defendant, stated that the defendant was not combative, but that the defendant and the officers \u201cwere bickering.\u201d Hartesty also testified that he was illegally searched and that one officer threatened to give the defendant a road sobriety test, which the officer \u201cpromised\u201d the defendant would fail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The definition of \u201coral communication\u201d in the Federal electronic surveillance statute is \u201cany oral communication uttered by a person exhibiting an expectation that such communication is not subject to interception under circumstances justifying such expectation, but such term does not include any electronic communication.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(2) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The relevant text of G.

The majority contain language that, to some degree, prohibits only the surreptitious recording of another\u2019s words when spoken with a reasonable expectation of privacy. See, e.g., Ala. Code \u00a7 42.20. 300 (Michie 1996) (Alabama: \u201cprivate communication\u201d); Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 16-11-60 (Michie 1996) (Georgia: \u201cin private place\u201d); Mich. Comp.

In addition, as recognized by the judge in his memorandum denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the Federal electronic surveillance statute, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>similarly limits \u201coral communication\u201d to the speech of a person who holds a justifiable expectation that it will not be subject to interception.

App. 802, 806 (1992), in which the Court of Appeals of Washington held, on nearly identical facts, that an arrestee\u2019s attempt to use a tape recorder to record his arrest did not violate Washington\u2019s electronic surveillance statute, because the police officers had no reasonable expectation of privacy in their words. This case is inapposite, however, because the Washington electronic surveillance statute prohibits only the secret recording of <em>private conversations, </em>see Wash. Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 9.73.030(1)(b) (2000). Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henlen, </em>522 Pa. 514, 517 (1989) (secret recording of interrogation by prison guard suspected of theft did not violate Pennsylvania\u2019s electronic surveillance statute, because interrogating officer had no justifiable expectation of privacy). See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 5702 (2000) (defining \u201coral communications\u201d as \u201cany oral communication uttered by a person possessing an expectation that such communication is not subject to interception under circumstances justifying such expectation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Because our own statute broadly prohibits the interception of <em>speech </em>(except that which is transmitted over public air waves), see G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 2, whether the police officers possessed privacy interests in their words spoken in the course of performing their public duties, or whether the encounter constituted a routine traffic stop or a custodial interrogation, as argued by the defendant, are issues that we need not address. Consideration of such issues would only be warranted in a civil suit for damages under G.

The Supreme Court of Illinois reversed the def\u00e9ndant\u2019s conviction, holding that, although the plain language of the Illinois eavesdropping statute prohibited the recording of \u201call or any part of any conversation\u201d without consent, Ill.

In the early morning hours of Sunday, March 3, 1991, George Holliday was awakened by a commotion outside his apartment. From his window he saw an African-American man being beaten by uniformed police officers. Holliday did more than watch. He recorded on videotape (with sound) the officers\u2019 clubbing the man with fifty-six baton strokes, and kicking him viciously about the head and body.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The graphic videotape of the arrest of Rodney King was subsequently viewed on television by millions of Americans, causing a public outcry and leading to a comprehensive investigation of the use of excessive force by the Los Angeles police department. The videotape also served as the catalyst for the formation of The Christopher Commission, established to investigate the incident. The commission concluded that police misconduct was a serious problem within the department, and that major reform efforts were needed. The commission wrote of the importance of the Holliday videotape:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">\u201cOur Commission owes its existence to the George Holliday videotape of the Rodney King incident. Whether there even would have been a Los Angeles Police Department investigation without the video is doubtful, since the efforts of King\u2019s brother ... to file a complaint were frustrated, and the report of the involved officers was falsified.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The videotaped events occurred in Los Angeles. Had they occurred in Massachusetts, under today\u2019s ruling Holliday would have been exposed to criminal indictment rather than lauded for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>exposing an injustice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That can be the result only if the Legislature intended the criminal statute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, to apply in these circumstances. It did not. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">There is nothing in the legislative history of the wiretapping statute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, in the preamble to the legislation, or in the language of the statute that compels the result reached by the court today. The legislative history makes clear that the intent of the statute, as amended in 1968,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is twofold. First, the amendments were designed to authorize and to regulate the government\u2019s use of wiretaps and other surveillance devices. See Interim Report of the Special Commission on Electronic Eavesdropping, 1968 Senate Doc. No. 1132, at 1-2 (1968 Report) (commission \u201cdesires close judicial supervision over all aspects of the process of eavesdropping and wiretapping as it is performed by law enforcement officers\u201d). Supervision of governmental surveillance and eavesdropping was viewed as necessary to \u201celiminate the possibility of abuse and add to the public\u2019s confidence in the manner in which this statute is employed by law enforcement officials.\u201d 1968 Report at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Second, the amendments were intended to protect the privacy of citizens by regulating nongovernmental \u201csurveillance,\u201d particularly in two circumstances identified by the Special Commission as posing serious risks to that privacy: (i) the Legislature was concerned about the newly discovered practice of private telephone companies\u2019 eavesdropping on the conversa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>tians of its private customers<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; and (ii) the commission heard evidence that new technology had made \u201ceavesdropping devices\u201d or \u201cbugs,\u201d such as subminiature transmitters, \u201creadily available\u201d to \u201cprivate investigators\u201d and \u201cprivate parties.\u201d Even if detected, the commission cautioned, \u201cone can never learn the identity of the eavesdropper.\u201d Interim Report of the Special Commission on Electronic Eavesdropping, 1967 Senate Doc. No. 1198 at 3 (1967 Report). The commission recommended that, to protect the privacy of citizens, individuals be prohibited from using these \u201cwiretapping and eavesdropping devices\u201d to record their private conversations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is no hint in the legislative history that the Legislature contemplated the circumstances at issue in this criminal case: the tape recording of an encounter on a public way between a citizen and a police officer engaged in his official duties.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The 1968 amendments to the wiretapping statute, St. 1968, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>c. 738, \u00a7 1, at issue here, were enacted shortly after the special commission\u2019s report, and reflect these same two purposes. First, the statute authorized the police to engage in secret electronic surveillance of citizens suspected of organized crime: The statutory preamble notes that \u201c[n]ormal investigative procedures are not effective\u201d in combating the \u201cincreasing activities of organized crime\u201d and that \u201claw enforcement officials must be permitted to use modem methods of electronic surveillance . . . when investigating these organized criminal activities.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Second, the Legislature noted that the \u201cuncontrolled development and unrestricted use of modem electronic devices\u201d posed grave dangers to the \u201cprivacy of all citizens of the commonwealth.\u201d With these twin objectives in mind, the Legislature placed substantial restrictions on \u201csurveillance\u201d and \u201ceavesdropping\u201d by government officials. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>422 Mass. 816, 833 (1996) (\u201cIt is apparent from the preamble that the legislative focus was on the protection of privacy rights and the deterrence of interference therewith by law enforcement officers\u2019 surreptitious eavesdropping as an investigative tool\u201d). The Legislature also restricted \u201csurveillance\u201d and \u201ceavesdropping\u201d by private individuals to protect those same privacy interests. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>370 Mass. 502, 507 (1976) (statutory language and legislative policy of \u201cprotecting the privacy of our citizens\u201d). To that end the Legislature both prohibited \u201cinterceptions,\u201d and provided a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>civil remedy for any person \u201caggrieved\u201d by such \u201cinterceptions,\u201d described by the Legislature as one who \u201cha[s] standing to complain that his . . . privacy was invaded in the course of an interception.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 6 and Q. The legislative intent as reflected in the statutory language is explicit: to protect the privacy interests of citizens. While the statutory language enacted to accomplish these purposes can be broadly read, there is no suggestion that the Legislature had in mind outlawing the secret tape recording of a public exchange between a police officer and a citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The criminal conviction of Michael Hyde is (apparently) the first time that a citizen of Massachusetts has been convicted because he tape recorded an exchange with a police officer performing an official function in a public place in the presence of a third party, potentially within the sight and hearing of any passerby.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Now to hold, as the court does, that a police officer possesses a privacy interest in statements he makes as a public officer effectuating a traffic stop sets the jurisprudence of this Commonwealth apart from all others.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Many States have wiretapping statutes similar to the one enacted in 1968 in Massachusetts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In only one reported decision has a State attempted to indict a citizen in circumstances similar to those in this case. The attempt was summarily rejected. In <em>State </em>v. Flora, 68 Wash. App. 802 (1992), the court overturned a conviction obtained in circumstances nearly identical to these and under a wiretapping statute similar to the one at issue here. The <em>Flora </em>court rejected as \u201cwholly without merit\u201d the view now adopted by this court. <em>Id. </em>at 806. The court \u201cdecline[d] the State\u2019s invitation\u201d to transform its wiretapping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>statute \u201cinto a sword available for use against individuals by public officers acting in their official capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 808.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">This court\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>State </em>v. Flora, <em>supra </em>at 610, as \u201cinapposite\u201d because the \u201cWashington electronic surveillance statute prohibits only the secret recording of private conversations\u201d is not persuasive. <em>Ante </em>at 600-601 n.6.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Like its Washington counterpart, the Massachusetts statute protects, as it was intended to, the privacy of citizens. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 6 (\u201caggrieved person\u201d is one whose \u201cprivacy was invaded in the course of an interception\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Both the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>statute and its legislative history make clear that the Legislature was concerned only with protecting the secret recording of conversations in which there was a legitimate expectation of privacy. None exists here.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The purpose of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, is not to shield public officials from exposure of their wrongdoings. I have too great a respect for the Legislature to read any such meaning into a statute whose purpose is plain, and points in another direction entirely. Where the legislative intent is explicit, it violates a fundamental rule of statutory construction to reach a result that is plainly contrary to that objective. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra </em>at 832-833 (court declined to read wiretapping statute \u201cliterally\u201d in \u201cabsence of more specific statutory language\u201d that broad definition of interception outlawed unconsented audiotaping of booking procedures, noting that \u201cin light of the preamble, we are unwilling to attribute that intention to the Legislature\u201d). See <em>Commissioner of Pub. Works </em>v. <em>Cities Serv. Oil Co., </em>308 Mass. 349, 360 (1941) (statutes are to be interpreted \u201cin the light of the Constitution and of the common law, to the end that they be held to cover the subjects presumably within the vision of the Legislature\u201d and \u201cbe not stretched\u201d to \u201ccomprehend matters not within the principle and purview on which they were founded\u201d). \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Collector of Lynn, </em>377 Mass. 151, 158 (1979). To hold that the Legislature intended to allow police officers to conceal possible misconduct behind a cloak of privacy requires a more affirmative showing than this statute allows.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">In our Republic the actions of public officials taken in their public capacities are not protected from exposure. Citizens have a particularly important role to play when the official conduct at issue is that of the police. See <em>Rotkiewicz </em>v. <em>Sadowsky, </em>431 Mass. 748, 754 (2000) (recognizing importance of \u201cpublic discussion and public criticism directed toward the performance\u201d of police officers). Their role cannot be performed if citizens must fear criminal reprisals when they seek to hold government officials responsible by recording \u2014 secretly recording on occasion \u2014 an interaction between a citizen and a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The court suggests, <em>ante </em>at 602-603, that a different reading would permit \u201cuntrammeled interception of communications\u201d of government officials by everyone and anyone. That concern is misplaced. There is a difference in kind, well recognized in our jurisprudence, between police officers, who have the authority to command citizens, take them into custody, and to use physical force against them, and other public officials who do not possess such awesome powers.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We hold police officers to a higher standard of conduct than other public employees, and their privacy interests are concomitantly reduced. See, e.g., <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>408 Mass. 324, 328-329 (1990) (\u201cpublic confidence in the police is a social necessity and is enhanced by procedures that deter [unlawful police conduct]\u201d); <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>368 Mass. 33, 42 (1975), quoting <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Broderick, </em>392 U.S. 273, 277-278 (1968) (police officer \u201cis a trustee of the public interest, bearing the burden of great and total responsibility to his public employer\u201d). We hold officers to this higher standard of conduct, fully confident that, in most cases, they will meet that standard, and there is no \u201cimplicit\u201d suggestion to the contrary. <em>Ante </em>at 602. It is the recognition of the potential for abuse of power that has caused our society, and law enforcement leadership, to insist that citizens have the right to demand the most of those who hold such awesome powers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The court\u2019s ruling today also threatens the ability of the press \u2014 print and electronic \u2014 to perform its constitutional role of watchdog. As the court construes the Massachusetts wiretapping statute, there is no principled distinction to explain why members of the media would not be held to the same standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>as all other citizens. See, e.g., <em>Associated Press </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>301 U.S. 103, 122-133 (1937) (\u201cThe publisher of a newspaper has no special immunity from the application of general laws. He has no special privilege to invade the rights and liberties of others\u201d). See also <em>Branzburg </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665, 682 (1972) (\u201cIt is clear that the First Amendment [to the United States Constitution] does not invalidate every incidental burdening of the press that may result from the enforcement of civil or criminal statutes of general applicability\u201d). The statute, on its face, makes no exception for members of the media or anyone else. Had Michael Hyde, the defendant in this case, been a news reporter he could have faced the same criminal consequences that the court now sanctions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> If the statute reaches actions by police officials acting in their public capacities in the plain view of the public, the legitimate news gathering of the media is most assuredly implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">I would reverse the conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\">See Witnesses Depict Relentless Beating by Police, Los Angeles Times, Mar. 7, 1991, at B1.

The Legislature of Illinois had amended its wiretapping statute to prohibit the recording of any conversation unless all parties consented, as the Massachusetts statute requires. Although the police in that case had not consented to the recording, the Illinois court held that the amendment \u201cdoes not alter the basic concept of the conduct at which the statute is aimed ... a surreptitious interception of a private conversation . . . listening in secret to what is said in private.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58. As the court notes, <em>ante </em>at 604 n.10, eight years later, the Illinois Legislature amended its wiretapping statute to prohibit the secret recording of conversations \u201cregardless of whether one or more of the parties intended their communication to be of a private nature.\u201d 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. \u00a7 5/14-1(d) (West 1996). See <em>In re Marriage of Deborah Almquist, </em>299 Ill. App. 3d 732, 736 (1998) (Illinois General Assembly added definition of \u201cconversation\u201d to the eavesdropping statute by Pub. Act 88-677, effective December 15, 1994). The Massachusetts wiretapping statute contains no such provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The court also attempts to distinguish <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henlen, </em>522 Pa. 514, 517 (1989). <em>Ante </em>at 604 n.6. In that case a prison guard suspected of theft recorded his interrogation by police. The court held that the parties did not have a protected privacy interest, and there was no violation of the Pennsylvania statute. <em>Id. </em>That case is akin to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gordon, 422 Mass. 816, 833 (1996), in which we also held that the secret videotaping of the defendants\u2019 booking at the police station was not a violation of the wiretapping statute, because the Legislature did not \u201cappear to have had in mind the recording of . . . booking steps following an individual\u2019s arrest.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Contrary to the court\u2019s suggestion, <em>ante </em>at 601 n.7, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Voight, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 769, 771-773 (1990), did not establish that police officers, acting in their official capacity, are \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to statutory protection. The court in <em>Voight </em>correctly expressed that public officials acting in their official capacity are not generally considered \u201cpersons\u201d unless expressly designated. <em>Id. </em>at 771, citing G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 Twenty-third.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The court\u2019s suggestion, <em>ante </em>at 603, that undercover police officers engage in the type of conduct to which Michael Hyde was subjected lacks any support. Undercover officers inhabit a unique position in the world of law enforcement, and daily face perilous situations while concealing their identity as police officers. Because of the covert and hazardous nature of their important work, such conduct can hardly be contemplated because it would place them in even greater jeopardy than they already are.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Boston Police Commissioner Paul F. Evans has said that holding officers under his command to the highest ethical standards is a priority: \u201cThe integrity of the department is the most important concern I have [and] when the department\u2019s trust and integrity is questioned I am going to respond.\u201d See An Outside Review for Hub Police, Boston Globe, Sept. 17, 1997, at A1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The scope of the court\u2019s ruling encompasses any citizen stopped by the police, not just those who may have violated some law.
