L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, commonly known as the anti-SLAPP statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He argues that his complaint is not subject to a special motion to dismiss because it was not based solely on the defendants\u2019 petitioning activities, and, in the alternative, that he met his burden under the statute to show that the defendants\u2019 activities were devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law. The parties disagree on the standard to be used to determine whether this burden has been met. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We conclude that to defeat a special motion to dismiss made pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, the nonmoving party (the plaintiff here) must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the moving party\u2019s petitioning activities were devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law. Because this standard was not met in the present case, we affirm the decision allowing the defendants\u2019 special motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">1. <em>Background. </em>Between 1979 and 1991, John W. Baker (Baker) purchased various parcels of land on the northern end of Clark\u2019s Island in Plymouth. In 1987, he placed a portion of his acreage in a forestry trust on which he has since operated a tree farm. The defendants, Manomet Bird Observatory<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Dr. Katherine C. Parsons, now a senior staff scientist for Manomet, studied bird populations on the island from 1975 to 1989. Manomet had once owned land on the island that was ultimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>purchased by Baker. Baker allowed Parsons and Manomet to continue using his property for research purposes until he learned that they were seeking to have the island classified as an \u201carea of critical environmental concern,\u201d which Baker believed would severely restrict his use of his land. He alleges that his decision to deny access to his property to the defendants \u201cresulted in a smear campaign\u201d by them against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In 1991, Baker applied for a license from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, and for a Federal permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (Army corps), to construct a pier on the northern end of his property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In response to his application, the Army corps solicited comment from various agencies including the natural heritage and endangered species program (natural heritage program), a division of the Massachusetts division of fisheries and wildlife, which has as one of its purposes the review of Army corps permit applications. In reviewing the application, Jay Copeland, an environmental reviewer for the natural heritage program, solicited comments from Parsons.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The parties disagree about the type of information Parsons was asked to provide. According to Baker, Parsons was asked only to furnish information about the \u201chabitat value\u201d of the north end of Clark\u2019s Island; she was not asked to comment on his tree farming operations or on the effect that the proposed pier might have on the habitat. Parsons counters that she was asked to provide information about the island habitat generally so that the natural heritage program would have some context in which to evaluate the pier permit application.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">On October 23, 1991, Parsons wrote a letter to Copeland that included the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">\u201cIn sum, the Clark\u2019s Island site provided unique and rare nesting habitat to several species of colonial birds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>until 1986 when the site changed hands and no longer benefited from protective ownership. The present owner\u2019s activities in the heronry clearly have diminished and perhaps decimated a once robust and viable heronry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">\u201cThe significance of the site and its value to the state\u2019s avifauna cannot be overestimated. Located within a sheltered harbor within easy commute of extensive marshes to the north and south, Clark\u2019s Island provides a predator-free habitat not easily replaced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">\u201cHabitat loss is the primary cause of loss in biodiversity at virtually any scale examined. <em>It is my fervent hope that the state and federal agencies charged with protecting the region\u2019s natural resources will act to halt the continued degradation of this important site and restore Clark\u2019s Island to the prominence it held only recently in providing nesting habitat to aquatic birds. </em>Thank you for this opportunity to comment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Baker characterizes this letter as containing \u201cdefamatory allegations . . . known by Parsons to be false and devoid of any reasonable factual support,\u201d and alleges that these statements caused ten citizens to petition the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs to require an environmental impact review of the proposed pier construction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Last, Baker asserts that Parsons, when contacted in 1991 by Christopher Dowd, an officer with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, falsely accused Baker of destroying heron nests on Memorial Day in 1989,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> by cutting his grass with a \u201cbrush hog,\u201d so that Baker would be criminally prosecuted for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA), see 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 703-712 (2000), and so that his pier permit application would be denied. Parsons responds that State officials, believing that Federal laws might have been violated, initially reported the matter to Dowd, thus prompting his contact with Parsons.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">2. <em>Procedural history. </em>In June, 1993, Baker brought various claims against the defendants, including a claim for tortious interference with his pier permit application.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendants unsuccessfully sought summary judgment, asserting that the protection provided by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to their petitioning activities immunized them from civil liability for injuries alleged by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">While the case was pending, the anti-SLAPP suit statute was enacted by the Legislature and made applicable to pending cases.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendants then filed a special motion to dismiss, asserting that Baker could not establish that Parsons\u2019s actions in providing information to governmental agencies in connection with Baker\u2019s pier permit application \u201cwere without any basis in fact or law,\u201d or that Baker had suffered any actual damages resulting from the defendants\u2019 petitioning activity. A judge in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the Superior Court allowed the motion, concluding that Parsons\u2019s statements constituted petitioning activity under the statute, and that Baker \u201cfailed to show that Parsons\u2019s alleged petitioning activity was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law.\u201d In addition, the judge concluded that Baker failed to show that the defendants\u2019 actions caused him real injury. After the defendants\u2019 counterclaims were voluntarily dismissed, final judgment entered, dismissing Baker\u2019s complaint. Baker took an appeal from the allowance of the special motion to dismiss. We transferred the case here on our own initiative.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">3. <em>The amenability of this action to the statute. </em>Because the special motion to dismiss was granted in January, 1996, the judge did not have the benefit of our recent decisions addressing various challenges to the anti-SLAPP statute. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. Baker argues that a review of these decisions, <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, </em>431 Mass. 343 (2000) (McLarnon), and <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 160 (1998) (Duracraft), makes it clear that the Superior Court erred in allowing the defendants\u2019 special motion to dismiss, because his claims against the defendants contain none of the indicia of a \u201ctypical\u201d SLAPP suit. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In essence Baker maintains that because he is not a \u201cdeveloper,\u201d but just \u201can individual operating an environmentally friendly tree farm,\u201d while the defendant Manomet is a \u201cwealthy and politically well-connected environmental organization,\u201d his lawsuit is not one to which the anti-SLAPP suit procedures of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, apply. Even if we were to accept these characterizations of the parties as true, this would not, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>more, foreclose a special motion to dismiss pursuant to the statute. In <em>Duracraft </em>we noted that the \u201ctypical mischief that the legislation intended to remedy was lawsuits directed at individual citizens of modest means for speaking publicly against development projects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 161. But our review of the legislative history of the statute also led us to conclude that the Legislature intended to go beyond the \u201ctypical\u201d case by enacting \u201cvery broad protection for petitioning activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In addition to its legislative history, the plain language of the statute, which is not limited in the manner suggested by Baker, squarely encompasses the facts of this case. Parsons, a biologist, responded to inquiries from State and Federal environmental officials, in connection with government agency reviews of Baker\u2019s application to develop property by constructing a pier on an island that has historically been a home for many aquatic birds. As a result of her responses, Baker eventually sued Parsons and the nonprofit organization for which she works,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> thus, according to the defendants, \u201cchilling\u201d any further participation by the defendants in assisting State and Federal agencies gathering information on the merits of Baker\u2019s application.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Baker\u2019s claim that the judge should have denied the special motion to dismiss because allowing the motion interfered with his \u201clittoral right to place a pier on his property and/or operate a tree farm ... a right secured\u201d under the State and Federal Constitutions, is without merit. That Baker had to comply with certain environmental regulations and review processes in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>to develop his property does not deprive him of any constitutionally protected property rights. See <em>Fragopoulos </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Cambridge, </em>408 Mass. 302, 307 (1990), citing <em>Moskow </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Envtl. Mgt., </em>384 Mass. 530, 532 (1981) (\u201cConsistent with the Constitution, the Commonwealth and its subdivisions may regulate private property in the public interest\u201d); <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass. 844, 851 (1977), citing <em>Durgin </em>v. <em>Minot, </em>203 Mass. 26, 28 (1909) (\u201cthe enjoyment of private property may be subordinated to reasonable regulations that are essential to the peace, safety, and welfare of the community\u201d). General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 59H, was properly applied to Baker\u2019s claims against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">4. <em>The special motion to dismiss. </em>We review the judge\u2019s decision granting the special motion to dismiss to determine whether there was an abuse of discretion or other error of law. <em>McLarnon, supra </em>at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In our first review of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, we noted: \u201cBy protecting one party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition ... the statute impinges on the adverse party\u2019s exercise of its right to petition . . . .\u201d <em>Duracraft, supra </em>at 166. In order to safeguard the rights of all parties, we required the special movant seeking the protection of the anti-SLAPP statute \u201cto make a threshold showing through the pleadings and affidavits that the claims against it are \u2018based on\u2019 the petitioning activities alone and have no substantial basis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167-168.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Although she ruled before our decision in <em>Duracraft, </em>the motion judge evaluated the motion in a manner that demonstrates it met the threshold requirement set forth in that case. The judge writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">\u201cIt is clear that the defendants have been sued for petitioning activity within the scope of the statute. The majority of the statements about which Baker complains are contained in a letter Parsons wrote to Copeland after he telephoned her and asked if she would provide him with some information concerning the \u2018habitat value of the north end of Clark\u2019s Island to aquatic bird species nesting there.\u2019 Parsons also talked to [Dowd], an officer of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>United States Fish and Wildlife Service who asked to talk to her about the destruction of gull nests on Clark\u2019s Island. Dowd contacted Parsons after Copeland had informed him about Parsons\u2019 discovery of destroyed nests. <em>Parsons\u2019 communications with Copeland and Dowd fall squarely within the definition of petitioning activity as defined by the statute because they pertained to consideration by governmental agencies of Baker\u2019s application to construct a pier\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">This initial showing by the defendants that the claims against them were based on their petitioning activities alone is not defeated by the plaintiff\u2019s conclusory assertion that \u201ccertain statements made by the [defendants [in petitions to government officials] constitute defamation.\u201d See Barker, Common-law and Statutory Solutions to the Problem of SLAPPS, 26 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 395, 402 (1993) (defamation most popular SLAPP cause of action). Baker argues that the \u201clibellous\u201d statements of Parsons in her letter to Copeland were all directed at his tree farming activities on Clark\u2019s Island, and his tree farming activities were never under review by the natural heritage program. But, according to Copeland, Parsons was not asked to comment simply on the habitat value of the island, but to give \u201cher impressions . . . about the effect of the activities on the site.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Once the defendants established through pleadings and affidavits that the claims against them were based on petitioning activities and had no substantial basis other than or in addition to those activities, the burden shifted to the nonmoving party to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>show (also by pleadings and affidavits) that \u201c(1) the moving party\u2019s exercise of its right to petition was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law and (2) the moving party\u2019s acts caused actual injury to the responding party.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. See <em>McLarnon, supra </em>at 348-349. The judge found that Baker failed to meet this burden, reasoning that Parsons, a biologist who had studied bird populations on Clark\u2019s Island for many years, and had observed a decline in bird populations following Baker\u2019s activities, was not without a factual basis in projecting that an escalation of activities associated with the construction and use of a pier on the north end of the island would adversely affect the bird population.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Neither the Legislature nor this court in our cases interpreting the anti-SLAPP statute has indicated what evidentiary standard is to be applied by a judge in weighing conflicting factual allegations in order to determine whether a party has met its burden of showing that an opposing \u201cparty\u2019s exercise of its right to petition was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. The statute provides only that in making this determination, \u201cthe court shall consider the pleadings and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Baker asserts that a summary judgment standard should be employed in this context to decide competing factual allegations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>He relies on <em>Duracraft, </em>in which we stated that the standard for summary judgment adopted in <em>Protect Our Mountain Env\u2019t, Inc. </em>v. <em>District Court, 677 </em>P.2d 1361, 1369 (Colo. 1984) <em>(POME), </em>would be \u201ca likely source\u201d of the standard for evaluating special motions to dismiss in the Massachusetts anti-SLAPP statute. <em>Duracraft, supra </em>at 165 n.16. As even our brief discussion in <em>Duracraft </em>of the <em>POME </em>decision makes clear, however, the Supreme Court of Colorado was discussing a \u201cheightened\u201d summary judgment standard, one requiring multiple considerations. See <em>POME, supra. </em>In contrast, the summary judgment standard that Baker offers would, if applied, essentially nullify the anti-SLAPP statute; it would be a rare case in which a plaintiff was unable to attest that something said by the petitioner was untrue or misleading. If Baker\u2019s reasoning is correct, the Legislature would have had no need to devise a \u201cspecial\u201d procedural mechanism in the first place.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The defendants urge the adoption of a different standard: \u201c[I]f despite the [opposition] party\u2019s submission, the court can find <em>any </em>factual or legal support for the petitioning activity, the motion \u2018shall be\u2019 allowed. [G. L. c.] 231, \u00a7 59H. The presumption is for dismissal, in contrast to a [rule] 12 (b) (6) motion where the presumption is for denial of the motion to dismiss.\u201d (Emphasis in defendants\u2019 brief.) The problem with setting forth a presumption for dismissal is the conundrum we addressed in <em>Duracraft, supra </em>at 166: by protecting one party\u2019s exercise of its right to petition, the statute impinges on the adverse party\u2019s exercise of its own right to petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">In seeking, as we did in our <em>Duracraft </em>decision, to balance these competing interests, we conclude that the party opposing a special motion to dismiss is required to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the moving party lacked any reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>able factual support or any arguable basis in law for its petitioning activity. This standard places the burden on the non-moving party, as the Legislature intended, but without creating an insurmountable barrier to relief.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In the interests of judicial economy, and to prevent the defendants from being unnecessarily subjected to further litigation, we apply this standard to the case at bar, and conclude, for reasons already discussed above, that the plaintiff could not have shown by a preponder<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>anee of evidence that the defendants lacked any reasonable factual support for their petitioning activity.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">We conclude that there was no abuse of discretion or other error of law in the judge\u2019s decision to grant the defendants\u2019 special motion to dismiss pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\">\u201cThe acronym \u2018SLAPP\u2019 (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) was coined by George W.

The Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs did so, and the form was submitted by Baker in June, 1993. In August, 1993, after collecting public comments, the executive office required the filing of an environmental impact report. Baker challenged the executive office\u2019s decision pursuant to G. L. c. 30. In December, 1994, a Superior Court judge ruled that the report required by the executive office was overbroad, and must be narrowed to the subject matter of the pier permit.

Baker, however, sought a pier permit admittedly in connection with his tree farming activities, and Copeland, as explained above, solicited information from Parsons concerning Baker\u2019s activities on the island as they related to the decline of the birds, and then passed that information on to Dowd, who then contacted Parsons.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Also, the judge correctly concluded that even if Parsons had made statements or taken actions to cause ten citizens to write to a State agency to petition for environmental review of Baker\u2019s pier proposal, as Baker alleges, such statements or actions would have constituted legitimate petitioning activity. Parsons\u2019s allegedly \u201cfalse statements\u201d to the citizens would have constituted \u201cstatement[s] reasonably likely to enlist public participation in an effort to effect such consideration.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Because we conclude below that the motion judge did not err as a matter of law in finding that the plaintiff failed to meet his burden on the first element, we need not reach the second, \u201cactual injury\u201d element.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The judge further noted that neither Baker\u2019s allegations that other factors contributed to changes in the bird population, nor his contentions that Parsons wrongfully accused him of harming the bird habitat, would establish that Parsons\u2019s statements were without any factual basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b570-9\">In <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, </em>431 Mass. 343, 349 (2000) <em>(McLarnon), </em>we held, without making reference to a specific evidentiary standard, that \u201cdespite conflicting affidavits, the judge could conclude that ... the plaintiff failed to meet his burden of proving no reasonable factual support or basis in law for the defendants\u2019 petitioning activities.\u201d The judge\u2019s conclusion in that case, however, relied not just on conflicting affidavits, but on \u201cseveral judges granting] or extending] protective orders against the plaintiff over a period of more than three years.\u201d <em>Id. McLarnon </em>is not the typical case anticipated by the statute. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The Governor, in a message accompanying his veto of 1994 House Doc. No. 1520, which when enacted became G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, had a very different understanding of the burden being placed on nonmovants: \u201cThe bill . . . sets up a special rule of law and a special procedure different than that in effect for any other type of litigation . . . [and] would not only shift the normal burden of proof, but erect a nearly insurmountable barrier to a suit.\u201d 1994 House Doc. No. 5604. In spite of the strong concerns expressed by the Governor, the Legislature overrode his veto and the anti-SLAPP statute became law. 1994 Senate J. 1491-1492; 1994 House J. 1306. See Duracraft, <em>supra </em>at 162.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The Attorney General in the amicus brief suggests the use of a clear and . convincing evidence standard here. We note that in the absence of a statutory provision to the contrary, the preponderance of evidence standard is the standard generally applied in civil cases. See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 972 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>428 Mass. 90, 101 (1998), and cases cited. This is due in part to a concern that the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard is too often applied like the more familiar, and more stringent, \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard. See <em>Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Ass\u2019n of Mass. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>395 Mass. 43, 47 (1985), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The fourteen States (besides Massachusetts) that have enacted anti-SLAPP legislation vary greatly in the burden they place on nonmovants (plaintiffs in the litigation) who challenge a motion to dismiss a SLAPP suit. Those States include: California (plaintiff must establish probability of prevailing on claim; see Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 425.16 [West 1995 &amp; Supp. 2001]); Delaware (award of damages to plaintiff requires clear and convincing evidence; see Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, \u00a7\u00a7 8136-8138 [1999]); Florida (summary judgment standard; see Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 768.295 [Supp. 2001]); Georgia (plaintiff\u2019s opposition must be well grounded in fact and warranted by law; see Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 9-11-11.1 [Supp. 2000]); Indiana (preponderance of evidence standard, with burden on movant; see Ind. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 34-7-7-1 \u2014 34-7-7-10 [1998]); Louisiana (plaintiff must establish probability of success on claim; see La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 971 [West Supp. 2001]); Minnesota (clear and convincing evidence standard; see Minn. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 554.01-554.05 [West 1994]); Nebraska (award of damages to plaintiff requires clear and convincing evidence; see Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 25-21,241-21,246 [1995]); Nevada (motion for summary judgment standard; see Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 41.637, 41.650, 41. 660, 41.670 [2000]); New York (must show petition without substantial basis in fact and law; see N.Y. Civ. Rights Law \u00a7\u00a7 70-a, 76-a [McKinney Supp. 2001]; N.Y. Civ. Prac. L. &amp; R. \u00a7 3211[g], 3212[h] [McKinney Supp. 2001]); Oklahoma (no clear standard; see Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, \u00a7 1443.1 [1993]); Rhode Island (petition immune from suit unless subjectively and objectively baseless; see R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7\u00a7 9-33-1 \u2014 9-33-4 [1997]); Tennessee (immunity from SLAPP suits unless petition knowingly or recklessly false; see Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 4-21-1001 \u20144-21-1004 [1998]); Washington (interpreted by State Court of Appeals as clear and convincing evidence standard; see Wash. Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 4.24.500 to 4.24.520 [Supp. 2001]; <em>Gilman </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>74 Wash. App. 733, 738-739 [1994]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\">In affirming the judge\u2019s decision, we note with approval her conclusion regarding the burden necessary to show that the petitioning activities lacked any arguable basis in law: \u201cIt is not enough for Baker to show that Parsons\u2019 alleged petitioning activity, requesting broad environmental review, was based on an error of law; he must show that no reasonable person could conclude that there was [a basis in law] for requesting that review. Baker has not made this showing.\u201d This is a correct statement of the law. See <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 595, 600 (2000) (fact that legal challenges resolved in plaintiffs\u2019 favor does not mean no colorable basis existed for defendants\u2019 petitions).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
