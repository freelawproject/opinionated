The board of appeals of Belmont (board) said yes, but its decision was annulled by a judge in the Superior Court. The church appealed, and we granted its application for direct appellate review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">The church\u2019s planned temple in Belmont complied with all zoning bylaws but for the height of its proposed steeple: the steeple would rise eighty-three feet above the roof of the temple, while under the applicable Belmont bylaw the church had a permitted right to build a steeple (projection) of eleven feet, two inches. On the church\u2019s application for zoning relief, the board concluded that the bylaw\u2019s projection height restriction, if applied to the steeple, would be an unreasonable regulation of a religious structure prohibited by the Dover Amendment, G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 3, second par.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree. We vacate the judgment of the Superior Court because it is inconsistent with that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>i</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Since 1979, the church has owned a nine-acre wooded lot in Belmont. Bounded on the north by a major highway, Route 2, the lot is surrounded on the east, south, and west by single-family residences. In 1995, the president of the church, Gordon B. HincMey, announced plans to construct a temple on the lot. The construction of a temple, which is used to perform three sacred ceremonies, is a matter of deep religious significance to the church and its members, who believe that the location and design of temples are revealed by God to the presidency of the church.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The Belmont temple site is located in the single residence-A (SR-A) zoning district. Section 3.3 of the Belmont zoning bylaw allows religious uses by right in an SR-A zone.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because of the large size of its lot, the church had the right to construct a temple of up to \u201c60 feet or 4 stories in height\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; its temple plan met that and all other zoning requirements. The permissible height of the steeple is governed, in turn, by \u00a7 4.2.2 n.l of the Belmont bylaw concerning uninhabited \u201cprojections.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the church\u2019s eighty-three foot proposed steeple, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>included at the top a ten-foot statue of the Angel Moroni,* *<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> did not comply with that bylaw, the church applied for a special permit to exceed the height limit and, alternatively, a determination that application of the bylaw\u2019s height restriction to the steeple would violate the Dover Amendment, G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 3, second par.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Beginning in May, 1996, and continuing over many months, the board held numerous public hearings on the church\u2019s application. On April 28, 1997, the board granted the requested relief. The board noted that the Dover Amendment requires a degree of accommodation between protected uses and matters of critical municipal concern. It found that there is \u201cno grave municipal concern in controlling steeple height on churches,\u201d and that it was \u201chardly accommodating to a protected use to limit the Church to a 12 foot projection.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The board concluded that the steeple height requested by the church was reasonable \u201cas a Dover type regulation of height.\u201d The board also concluded that the \u201cbenefits\u201d provided by the church outweigh the burdens that could result from the steeple height, and that the height of the steeple requested by the church was reasonable \u201cas a special permit matter.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The plaintiffs brought an action in the Superior Court challenging the board\u2019s decision pursuant to the Zoning Act, G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In response the board and the church challenged the standing of each of the plaintiffs to seek relief from the board\u2019s ruling. A judge in the Superior Court rejected that argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ment and concluded that at least one of the plaintiffs had standing. The judge then ruled that the Dover Amendment did not apply to the church\u2019s application for zoning relief because \u201cneither the presence nor the height\u201d of the steeple represents a \u201cnecessary element of the Mormon<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> religion.\u201d She also concluded that the board had abused its discretion by issuing a special permit allowing the steeple.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The plaintiffs Arleen Martin, Jenny Altschuler, and Margaret Boyajian are owners of residential properties that abut the temple site. The plaintiff Joyce Jones is the owner of residential property that \u201cabuts a way which abuts an abutter to the church property,\u201d and resides within 300 feet of the temple. The church first challenges the judge\u2019s decision affirming the standing of all four plaintiffs to bring this action. We agree with the judge that Martin has standing, albeit on grounds somewhat different from those on which the judge relied. We therefore need not address the standing of the remaining three plaintiffs. See <em>Save the Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>366 Mass. 667, 674-675 (1975); <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 476 n.7 (1986).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">As an abutter to the temple site, Martin enjoys a rebuttable presumption that she is a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d under G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>c. 40A, \u00a7 11. See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>429 Mass. 551, 553-554 (1999), quoting <em>Marashlian </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. Of Appeals of Newburyport, </em>421 Mass. 719, 721 (1996). Martin claimed that she would be adversely affected by the shadow of the steeple, as well as the steeple\u2019s visual impact. The judge found that Martin \u201cwould have a view of most, if not all, of the steeple from her back door and part of her patio, as well as a clear view from areas in her yard where she regularly gardens and landscapes\u201d; she \u201calso would see the spire from the front of her house.\u201d The judge pointed to the fact that the proposed steeple was 139 feet,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and would be built at the top of a hill in Martin\u2019s backyard. She concluded that Martin had standing because of the \u201cextreme and unique\u201d visual impact caused by the \u201cpresence of such an enormous structure looming over\u201d Martin\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Generally, concerns about the visual impact of a structure do not suffice to confer standing, and we are not persuaded by the judge\u2019s reasoning on this point. See <em>Harvard Square Defense Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Cambridge, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 491, 493 (1989). But Belmont\u2019s zoning bylaw itself provides that the board should take into consideration the \u201c[vjisual [cjonsequences\u201d of any proposed structure. Subsection (1) of \u00a7 7.4.2 (c) of the bylaw provides that \u201c[vjiews from public ways and developed properties should be considerately treated in the site arrangement and building design.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A defined protected interest may impart standing to a person whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>impaired interest falls within that definition. See <em>Monks </em>v. Zoning <em>Bd. of Appeals of Plymouth, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 685, 688-689 (1994), citing <em>Circle Lounge &amp; Grille, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>324 Mass. 427, 431 (1949). In <em>Monks </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Plymouth, supra, </em>homeowners appealed from the grant of a special permit to build a communications tower. The Appeals Court held that a bylaw similar to the one at issue here<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> did not confer automatic standing on abutters, but the abutters could establish that they were within the legal scope of the protection created by it. <em>Id. </em>at 688. In that case the abutters did so by dfemonstrating that the tower \u201cwould be \u2018clearly visible from almost every window\u2019 of their home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687. Here the judge found that the towering steeple would be visible to Martin from most, if not all, of her property, both during the day and when lit at night.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We conclude that Martin has demonstrated that she came within the scope of Belmont\u2019s bylaw protection sufficiently to confer standing on her.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The Dover Amendment precludes the adoption of zoning ordinances or bylaws restricting the use of land for religious (and other exempt) purposes, G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 3, second par., but authorizes \u201creasonable regulation[]\u201d of bulk, height, yard size, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>lot area, setbacks, open space, and parking requirements. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>The amendment \u201cseeks to strike a balance between preventing local discrimination against [a religious] use . . . and honoring legitimate municipal concerns that typically find expression in local zoning laws\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Trustees of Tufts College </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>415 Mass. 753, 757 (1993). Local zoning requirements are meant to be applied uniformly. Consequently, \u201clocal officials may not grant blanket exemptions from the requirements to protected uses.\u201d <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>City Council of Lynn, </em>415 Mass. 772, 778 (1993). But they may decide that zoning requirements concerning height and dimension should not be applied to a proposed religious use where it would unreasonably impede the protected use without appreciably advancing critical municipal goals. See <em>Trustees of Tufts College </em>v. <em>Medford, supra </em>at 757-761.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The board made a careful examination of the case law interpreting the Dover Amendment. It concluded that the first issue to be considered was \u201cwhether the . . . structure is being used for a religious purpose.\u201d The board found that it \u201cis clearly part of Mormon theology to reflect, in their buildings, the belief of an ascension towards heaven.\u201d The board found that members of the church believe that steeples, by pointing toward heaven, \u201cserve the purpose of lifting Mormons\u2019 eyes and thoughts towards heaven.\u201d It concluded that the steeple served a religious purpose, and that application of the Belmont bylaw regulating the height of uninhabited projections would be an unreasonable regulation of a religious use.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Rejecting that analysis, the judge found that, \u201c[wjhile a steeple may have inspirational value and may embody the Mormon value of ascendency towards heaven, that is not a matter of religious doctrine and is not in any way related to the religious use of the [tjemple.\u201d She then determined that, because \u201cneither the presence nor the height of the steeple atop the [tjemple represents a necessary element of the Mormon religion,\u201d it does not \u201caid in the Mormons\u2019 system of faith\u201d so as to be entitled to be analyzed pursuant to the Dover Amendment. In the alternative, the judge concluded that, even if the Dover Amendment were applicable, the church \u201cfailed to carry its burden of proof\u201d that limiting the height of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>proposed steeple to eleven feet, two inches, is \u201cunreasonable.\u201d She reached this conclusion because the church had not shown that \u201climiting the spire [height] would prevent or significantly impede the religious use\u201d of the temple. The judge erred on both grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">First, in deciding that the Dover Amendment was not applicable, the judge erroneously framed the question as \u201cwhether the construction of the spire atop the already existing [t]emple[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>] constitutes the \u2018use of land or structures for religious purposes\u2019 so as to trigger a Dover Amendment analysis.\u201d The statute directs the inquiry to the use of \u201cland\u201d or a \u201cstructure,\u201d not the use of an element or part of a structure. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 3, second par. (\u201cNo zoning ordinance or by-law shall. . . prohibit, regulate or restrict the use of land or structures for religious purposes\u201d). See <em>Worcester County Christian Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Spencer, 22 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 83, 87 (1986) (\u201cfocus must be placed on the use of the structure\u201d). To view each element, each section of a \u201cstructure,\u201d as requiring an independent \u201creligious\u201d use leads to impossible results: Is a church kitchen or a church parking lot a \u201creligious\u201d use? We have not formulated the test so narrowly. In <em>Trustees of Tufts College </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>415 Mass. 753, 754-755 (1993), for example, we considered the applicability of the Dover Amendment to several construction projects proposed by an educational institution, including a multi-level parking garage. <em>Id. </em>We recognized that the proposed parking garage was for an educational purpose, because it \u201cwill be located in the core . . . area of Tufts\u2019 campus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 755. While the judge\u2019s inquiry may have focused on the steeple because the temple complied in all other respects with Belmont\u2019s zoning bylaws, the question under the statute is whether the structure as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>whole is to be used for religious purposes.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It clearly is, and just as clearly the Dover Amendment applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The judge also used an erroneous legal test to determine whether a \u201cstructure\u201d serves a religious purpose, thereby entering an area of inquiry that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits. She correctly noted that \u201c \u2018[r]eligious purpose\u2019 means something in aid of a system of faith and worship,\u201d citing <em>Needham Pastoral Counseling Ctr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Needham, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 31, 33 (1990). She then impermissibly concluded that a steeple is not \u201ca necessary element of the Mormon religion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">It is not for judges to determine whether the inclusion of a particular architectural feature is \u201cnecessary\u201d for a particular religion. A rose window at Notre Dame Cathedral, a balcony at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica \u2014 are judges to decide whether these architectural elements are \u201cnecessary\u201d to the faith served by those buildings? The judge found, as she was compelled to do in the face of overwhelming and uncontradicted testimony, that temples \u201care the places where Mormons conduct their sacred ceremonies.\u201d No further inquiry as to the applicability of the Dover Amendment was warranted. See <em>Parish of the Advent </em>v. <em>Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Mass., </em>426 Mass. 268, 284-285 (1997) (civil tribunals must avoid resolving matters of purely ecclesiastical nature). See also <em>Employment Div., Dep\u2019t of Human Resources of Or. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>494 U.S. 872, 887 (1990), and cases cited (\u201c[rjepeatedly and in many different contexts, we have warned that courts must not presume to determine the place of a particular belief in a religion or the plausibility of a religious claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">As an alternative ground for denying relief, the judge determined that, even if the Dover Amendment applied, the church failed to prove that application of the Belmont bylaw to its temple was unreasonable. We described in <em>Trustees of Tufts College </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>415 Mass. 753 (1993), and <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>City Council of Lynn, </em>415 Mass. 772 (1993), the standards by which to analyze application of the Dover Amendment to exempt institutions. While the reasonableness of a local zoning requirement will depend on the particular facts of each case, we said that a judge should consider whether the requirement sought to be applied takes into account \u201cthe special characteristics of [the exempt] use,\u201d adding that a zoning requirement that results \u201cin something less than nullification of a proposed [exempt] use may be unreasonable within the meaning of the Dover Amendment.\u201d <em>Trustees of Tufts College </em>v. <em>Medford, supra </em>at 758-759 &amp; n.6. See <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>City Council of Lynn, supra </em>at 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The judge found that the church had not met its burden of proving that the height restriction was unreasonable because it had not shown \u201cthat hmiting the spire to 12 [feet] would prevent or significantly impede the religious use of the [t]emple or substantially diminish or detract from its usefulness.\u201d By considering only whether the height restriction prevented or diminished the temple\u2019s religious \u201cusefulness,\u201d the judge\u2019s focus was again too narrow. There are several ways in which an applicant may demonstrate \u201cunreasonableness.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Trustees of Tufts College </em>v. <em>Medford, supra </em>at 759-760 (zoning requirement unreasonable if it detracts from usefulness of structure, imposes excessive costs on applicant, or impairs character of proposed structure). See also <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Norfolk, </em>432 Mass. 374, 385 (2000) (\u201cproof of cost of compliance is only one way\u201d to show unreasonableness, and court must consider other aspects such as use or character of property); <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>City Council of Lynn, supra </em>at 778 (same). The judge should have considered whether compliance with Belmont\u2019s height restrictions would have impaired the character of the temple, while taking into account the special characteristics of its exempt use.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>The judge dismissed the church\u2019s desire to build a steeple as a \u201cpurely\u201d aesthetic issue. But matters of aesthetic and architectural beauty are among the factors to be considered in deciding whether a zoning requirement \u201cimpairs the character\u201d of a proposed exempt use. <em>Trustees of Tufts College </em>v. <em>Medford, supra </em>at 757, 759 &amp; n.6. The \u201ccharacter\u201d of the temple with its steeple surely encompasses both its architectural beauty, as well as its religious symbolism. See <em>Petrucci </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Westwood, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 818, 826-827 (1998) (Dover Amendment precluded application of zoning ordinance that would \u201cdisturb the sense of the building\u2019s continuity\u201d and ruin its \u201carchitectural integrity\u201d). The record is replete with evidence that the steeple is integral to the specific character of the contemplated use. The church\u2019s architect based his design on an approved church prototype. There was uncontradicted testimony that the church values an ascendency of space for the religious ceremonies performed in temples. The architect designed the temple to have a steeple topped by a religious symbol, a statue of the Angel Moroni, because he considered the design of a well-proportioned steeple to be part of his assignment.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> There was evidence that all but three of the church\u2019s numerous temples located in countries around the world have steeples.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Mormon religion is hardly unique in this regard: churches have long built steeples to \u201cexpress elevation toward the infinite, [their] spires soaring into the heavens.\u201d J. Sallis, Stone 63 (Ind. Univ. Press 1994), and a steeple is the precise architectural feature that most often makes the public identify the building as a religious structure. The judge found that, \u201c[w]hile a spire may have inspirational value and may embody the Mormon value of ascendancy towards heaven, that is not a matter of religious doctrine . . . .\u201d It is not permissible for a judge to determine what is or is not a matter of religious doctrine. See <em>Fortin </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>Roman Catholic Bishop of Worcester, </em>416 Mass. 781, 785 (1994). See also <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Rhode Island, </em>345 U.S. 67, 70 (1953) (\u201cno business of courts to say . . . what is a religious practice or activity\u201d). In any event, religious \u201cdoctrine\u201d is not the defining test whether imposition of a zoning requirement will impair the character of a religious building.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The board found, and there was no evidence to the contrary, that no municipal concern was served by controlling the steeple height of churches. It concluded that the height exemption requested by the church was reasonable in light of the function of a steeple, and the importance of proportionality of steeple height to building height. Once it determined that the Dover Amendment was implicated, it was permissible for the board to consider whether something less than the original design of the steeple height was reasonable. It did so, and the church voluntar-, ily amended its design to reduce the height of the steeple.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We agree with the board that a rigid application of Belmont\u2019s height restrictions for uninhabited \u201cprojections\u201d would impair the character of the temple without advancing any municipal concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Because we conclude that the height restriction imposed on uninhabited \u201cprojections\u201d under \u00a7 4.2.2 of the Belmont bylaws may not reasonably be imposed on the church because of the Dover Amendment, we need not address whether the judge impermissibly exceeded her authority in annulling the decision of the board to issue a special permit.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We also need not consider whether the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc (2000), prohibits the application of the Belmont height limitation to the church\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>proposed steeple. The judgment of the Superior Court is vacated. The case is remanded to the Superior Court.
