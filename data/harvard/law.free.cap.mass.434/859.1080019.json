Prior to trial, the defendant filed three motions to dismiss, all of which were denied by a motion judge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the close of the prosecution\u2019s case, the defendant filed a motion for a required finding of not guilty, which the trial judge granted to the extent that the rape charges alleged the use of force. The jury found the defendant not guilty on both charges of rape and one of the charges of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>indecent assault and battery. The defendant, however, was adjudicated a youthful offender by reason of the remaining charge of indecent assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">On appeal from that adjudication, the defendant claims error in the following: (1) the motion judge\u2019s failure to dismiss the youthful offender indictment under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 54; (2) the admission in evidence of a videotape depicting the complainant\u2019s \u201cfresh complaint\u201d; (3) the trial judge\u2019s ruling that the complainant was competent to testify; (4) allowing the prosecution to refresh the complainant\u2019s memory outside the jury\u2019s presence; (5) permitting expert testimony from a physician who had examined the complainant; (6) the admission of various aspects of the testimony of the complainant\u2019s father; and (7) the trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury on reasonable doubt. We conclude that the motion judge erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the youthful offender indictment charging indecent assault and battery. We also conclude that the admission of the videotape as evidence of fresh complaint constitutes reversible error. Because of our conclusions with respect to the motion to dismiss and the admission of the videotape, we need not decide whether the defendant\u2019s other claims of error, either alone or taken together, would require a new trial; however, we address those claims of error that may arise during a new trial of a delinquency complaint for indecent assault and battery or that raise significant questions that we believe require comment. Accordingly, we reverse the adjudication of the defendant as a youthful offender and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>All the offenses occurred between October 1, 1996, and March 5, 1998, and involved the same complainant, a very young girl. The incidents took place between the time the complainant was three and five years of age; the defendant was fifteen and sixteen years old. There was evidence that, while assisting at his mother\u2019s home day care center, the defendant touched the complainant\u2019s vagina on approximately ten different occasions. The defendant also had the complainant touch his penis, and told her never to tell anyone. The abuse was revealed in early March, 1998, when the complainant remarked to her father that \u201cshe had a big butt crack.\u201d A few days later, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>complainant\u2019s parents asked their daughter about the unusual comment and, during the course of their questioning, she revealed the defendant\u2019s misconduct. The next morning, the complainant and her parents met with the defendant\u2019s mother to discuss the matter. The parents videotaped the conversation, and the complainant again described the instances of abuse. At trial, the complainant and her parents, among others, testified and the jury viewed an edited version of the videotape. The jury convicted the defendant of indecent assault and battery of a child under the age of fourteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">2. <em>Youthful Offender Statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">a. <em>Indictment. </em>Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the youthful offender indictment for indecent assault and battery, which was denied. He claimed then, as he does now, that the grand jury lacked sufficient evidence to indict him as a youthful offender under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 54, because no evidence had been presented of \u201cthe infliction or threat of serious bodily harm,\u201d one of the statutory prerequisites of a youthful offender indictment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For this reason, the defendant contends that the motion judge erred in denying his motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">In 1996, the Legislature enacted the youthful offender statute, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 54, as amended through St. 1996, c. 200, \u00a7 2, permitting prosecutors to proceed by indictment if the following statutory requirements are present: (1) the alleged offense was committed while the individual was between the ages of fourteen and seventeen years; (2) if he were an adult, the offense would be punishable by imprisonment in the State prison (i.e., a felony); and (3) the individual was previously committed to the department of youth services, <em>or </em>the alleged offense involved certain enumerated firearms violations, <em>or </em>it involved \u201cthe infliction or threat of serious bodily harm.\u201d G. L. c. 119, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>\u00a7 54. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clint C., </em>430 Mass. 219, 225 (1999). When the prosecution fails to present to the grand jury sufficient evidence to satisfy these requirements, a judge may dismiss the indictment. See <em>id. </em>at 224. (Legislature provided prosecutor with discretion to seek youthful offender indictment \u201cas long as the statutory prerequisites are met\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">The label \u201c \u2018[yjouthful offender\u2019 refers not to a status necessary before an indictment may be brought by a prosecutor, but to a status that is an outcome of indictment and adjudication.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clint </em>C., <em>supra </em>at 222 n.4. There is no requirement that the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm be an element of the crime itself. See <em>id. </em>at 225. However, where a prosecutor seeks a youthful offender indictment relying on \u201cthe infliction or threat of serious bodily harm\u201d component of the statute, the conduct constituting the offense must involve the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">There was no evidence presented to the grand jury in this case that the conduct constituting the alleged indecent assault and battery involved the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm. The evidence presented was that the defendant touched the complainant\u2019s vagina and buttocks and made her touch his penis, but, as the motion judge noted, there was \u201cno evidence that the defendant overtly threatened [the complainant] or that serious bodily injuries were actually inflicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Moreover, the touching involved in this case is not sufficiently invasive in nature (as compared to penetration) to create the threat of serious bodily harm. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clint C., supra </em>at 226. While the defendant was alleged to have penetrated the complainant, that conduct supported his indictment for rape (with respect to which he was subsequently acquitted), not indecent assault and battery. It is the touching of the complainant\u2019s vagina and buttocks that supports a charge for indecent assault and battery.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">We said in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clint C., supra, </em>that \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>juvenile\u2019s position of authority, the age difference between the juvenile and the victim, and the vulnerability of the victim are sufficient to support a youthful offender indictment.\u201d However, that statement was made in the context of an indictment charging statutory rape of a very young child. Those factors, combined with the act of penetration, justified the indictment in that case. Although such factors are also present in this case, they were here combined with a touching that did not involve the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm. Accordingly, the motion judge erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss insofar as it related to the sufficiency of the evidence to indict the defendant as a youthful offender for indecent assault and battery. On remand, the prosecutor must proceed by complaint, rather than by indictment. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Funches, </em>379 Mass. 283, 296-297 (1979) (no new trial where Commonwealth had \u201cfair opportunity to offer whatever proof it could assemble\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">b. <em>Adjudication. </em>Although we have concluded that the indictment in this case should have been dismissed, because uncertainty may exist, we provide some guidance on the procedures and proof necessary to adjudicate an individual a youthful offender.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Where, as here, \u201cthere is a public interest in obtaining a prompt answer to the question, and when the answer to be given is reasonably clear,\u201d we need not withhold our views. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clint C., supra </em>at 226. See <em>Gurry </em>v. <em>Board of Pub. Accountancy, </em>394 Mass. 118, 126 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Recently, in <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466 (2000), the Supreme Court of the United States held that a State hate crime statute, which authorized an increase in the maximum prison sentence based on a judge\u2019s finding that the defendant acted with the purpose to intimidate because of, inter aha, race, violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court concluded that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Similar to the New Jersey hate crime statute, the youthful of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>fender statute authorizes judges to increase the punishment for juveniles convicted of certain offenses beyond the statutory maximum otherwise permitted for juveniles, if the requirements set forth in G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 54, have been satisfied. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dale D., </em>431 Mass. 757, 759 (2000) (\u201cA juvenile indicted as a youthful offender faces substantially greater penalties than a juvenile proceeded against by complaint as a delinquent\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We recognize that a juvenile court system, in which juveniles are given preferential treatment, is not constitutionally required. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wayne W., </em>414 Mass. 218, 223 (1993) (\u201cA State that elects to commit to its judiciary the responsibility of determining whether [an individual] will be tried as a juvenile or an adult . . . must observe only the constitutional due process right of essential fairness\u201d). However, once the Legislature enacted a law providing that the maximum punishment for delinquent juveniles is commitment to the Department of Youth Services (department) for a defined time period, see G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58, any facts, including the requirements for youthful offender status, that would increase the penalty for such juveniles must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra. </em>Accordingly, if the Commonwealth determines to proceed against a juvenile by indictment, it must present at the grand jury stage sufficient evidence of the underlying offense to warrant a finding of probable cause that the underlying crime has been committed, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160, 163 (1982), as well as sufficient evidence that the requirements set forth in G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 54, have been met.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">The Commonwealth may seek to join related offenses, including those properly brought by indictment and those brought by complaint, in one proceeding for purposes of trial under G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>c. 119, \u00a7 54, and Mass. R. Crim. P. 9 (a), 378 Mass. 859 (1979). Joinder is especially appropriate in cases such as the present one. A child complained of as a delinquent or indicted as a youthful offender has a right to a jury trial pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 55A.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">At trial of offenses brought by indictment, the Commonwealth, of course, must prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of the underlying offense. It also must prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt those requirements set forth in G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 54 (i.e., that the child was between the ages of fourteen and seventeen years when the alleged offense was committed; the offense is punishable by imprisonment in State prison; and the child was previously committed to the department, the alleged offense involves certain enumerated firearms violations, or the alleged offense involves the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">The judge must instruct the jury that, in order to adjudicate the defendant a youthful offender, they must determine first whether the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of the underlying offense, and, if they so conclude, they must also determine whether the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt the requirements of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 54. Certain components of the statute will be met as a matter of law by conviction of the underlying charge (i.e., its status as a felony, and, in some cases, as one of the enumerated firearms violations). (The judge should not instruct the jury regarding such components). In many cases, the facts establishing the remaining requirements may not be in dispute. The parties, for example, may stipulate to the defendant\u2019s age. (Again, no instruction is necessary regarding any such established fact. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Triplett, </em>398 Mass. 561, 570 [1986].) Any fact not so established must be resolved by the jury. As a practical matter, it would appear that usually only the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm will be contested.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">If the jury conclude that the defendant is guilty of the offense charged and that the requirements under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 54, have been met, the defendant is adjudicated a youthful offender and is to be sentenced accordingly. If, however, the jury find that the defendant is guilty of the underlying offense but that the requirements of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 54, have not been satisfied, the defendant is adjudicated a delinquent child and shall be sentenced as such.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">3. <em>Videotape as fresh complaint. </em>The prosecution offered as evidence of the complainant\u2019s fresh complaint a videotape recorded by the complainant\u2019s parents depicting their child answering questions posed by them and the defendant\u2019s mother. Both the defendant and the judge raised concerns about the videotape, but ultimately, over the defendant\u2019s objection, an edited version of the videotape was played to the jury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant challenges the admission of this videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Under the fresh complaint doctrine, an out-of-court statement seasonably made by the complainant after a sexual assault is admissible as part of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 657 (1992). Evidence of the complaint is admissible only to corroborate the complainant\u2019s testimony. It is not admissible to establish the truth of the complaint itself. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Peters, 429 Mass. 22, 27 (1999), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">We made clear in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, supra </em>at 30, that a \u201ccomplainant in a sexual assault case may testify <em>only </em>to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>fact that a fresh complaint was made and to whom it was made\u201d and \u201cshould not be allowed to testify about the details of the complaint\u201d (emphasis in original). \u201c[Tjestimony as to the details of the complaint should be left to the fresh complaint witness who <em>heard </em>the complaint\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>Admitting the videotape in this case is directly contrary to the substance of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters. </em>The videotape was offered as evidence of the complainant\u2019s fresh complaint, yet it shows the complainant herself, <em>not </em>\u201csomeone other than the complainant,\u201d describing the details of the sexual assault. <em>Id. </em>at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the videotape did not show the complainant \u201ctestifying,\u201d but showed the fresh complaint itself. However, when the videotape was played to the jury, they heard testimony out of the mouth of the complainant, not a fresh complaint witness. Whether the complainant describes the details of the complaint in court on the witness stand or in a videotape, the result is the same: the complainant herself provides the details of the complaint directly to the jury, a result that we expressly stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, supra </em>at 30, \u201cshould not be allowed.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">We continue to permit the admission of fresh complaint \u201con the ground that a victim\u2019s failure to make prompt complaint might be viewed by the jury as inconsistent with the charge of sexual assault . . . and in the absence of evidence of complaint the jury might assume that none was made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, supra </em>at 658, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>370 Mass. 388, 392 (1976). The purpose of allowing a fresh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>complaint witness (i.e., someone other than the complainant) to testify regarding the details of the complaint (as described to the witness by the complainant) \u201cis to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony, namely, as it relates to the credibility of the victim\u2019s testimony at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, supra </em>at 660. Admitting the videotape permitted the complainant to corroborate her own testimony and bolster her own credibility. \u201cWe can find no decision, or other authority, which permits a complainant to engage in self-corroboration.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, supra </em>at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Nonetheless, the admission of inadmissible hearsay will not constitute prejudicial error if it is merely cumulative of other properly admitted evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Esteves, </em>429 Mass. 636, 640 (1999). Here, however, the statements recorded on the videotape cannot be characterized as \u201cmerely cumulative\u201d of the testimony of the fresh complaint witnesses. The videotape recorded not only statements from the complainant (which could be repeated in court by the fresh complaint witnesses), but also the complainant\u2019s manner and speech at that time as well as responses from other persons present that day, including the complainant\u2019s mother and father and the defendant\u2019s mother. Indeed, the defendant\u2019s mother is shown encouraging and supporting the complainant, telling her, \u201cYou\u2019re doing wonderful,\u201d and \u201cI promise, honey, you\u2019re still my girl. ... I love you to pieces. . . . That\u2019s important to know.\u201d Such statements would not be admissible as part of fresh complaint. The entire tone of the videotape is supportive of the complainant and could serve only to enforce her credibility. As a result, we cannot fairly say that \u201cin considering the [credibility of the complainant], the jurors primarily relied on properly admitted evidence to make their decision.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id.., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cyr, </em>425 Mass. 89, 95 (1997). On remand, the videotape may not be admitted as evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>complainant\u2019s fresh complaint<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>; however, the complainant may testify as to the fact that a complaint was made and to whom it was made, and the witnesses who heard the complaint may testify as to what the complainant said.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, supra </em>at 658-660.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">4. <em>Refreshing the complainant\u2019s recollection. </em>Although we reverse the adjudication of the defendant as a youthful offender because of the errors regarding the indictment and the admission of the videotape, we address those remaining issues that may arise at retrial or that are sufficiently significant to warrant discussion. Midway through the child\u2019s direct examination, the child appeared to have difficulty answering the prosecutor\u2019s questions. The prosecutor requested a \u201cbrief break\u201d so that the witness could compose herself and drink some water. The judge ordered the recess and permitted the prosecutor to \u201crefresh this witness\u2019s recollection with prior statements\u201d before returning. However, concerned because the jury would not view this refreshing recollection \u201cprocess,\u201d the judge directed the prosecutor to inform the jury of her interactions with the child during the recess. The prosecutor agreed to preface her questions to the complainant after the recess by asking, \u201cDo you remember talking about [this matter] upstairs?\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Before resuming the trial, the judge explained to the jury that witnesses\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>recollections are traditionally refreshed by permitting them to read to themselves while on the stand prior statements they have made. But because this witness could not yet read, he stated that he was deviating from the usual practice by permitting the prosecutor \u201cto go through a similar process outside of [the jury\u2019s] hearing.\u201d The defendant did not object and ultimately acquiesced to this arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Notwithstanding the difficult circumstances, it was error to allow the prosecutor to refresh the complainant\u2019s recollection outside the jury\u2019s presence. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. 55, 65 n.11 (1984). The possibility that the prosecutor, inadvertently or not, suggested to the child the desired substance of her testimony during the break and that the complainant tried to accommodate the prosecutor when she returned to the stand is too great for us to sanction such a process. When the prosecutor reviewed the complainant\u2019s prior statements with her during the recess, the child may not have understood that counsel was merely attempting to refresh her recollection, rather than \u201cgain [the child\u2019s] admission that [her earlier statements were] true\u201d or have her recite the contents of these earlier statements. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 14, 19, <em>S.C., </em>426 Mass. 301 (1997). The prosecutor instead could have refreshed the complainant\u2019s recollection in the jury\u2019s presence by asking her whether she remembered making a certain statement previously. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melchionno, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 939, 941 (1990) (permissible to refresh child witness\u2019s recollection by prior testimony while child was on witness stand). Such a procedure would have permitted the jury an opportunity to assess whether the witness actually remembered the statement or was being prompted to give a particular answer.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">5. <em>The expert witness. </em>At trial, Dr. Andrea Van Deven, a pediatrician at Children\u2019s Hospital who examined the complainant, testified that the complainant\u2019s examination was \u201ccorn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>pletely normal.\u201d She also stated that, in general, the majority of girls examined for possible sexual abuse have \u201cnormal\u201d findings (i.e., no recognizable traces of physical contact). The defendant argues that Dr. Van Deven\u2019s testimony compared the physical findings of the complainant\u2019s examination to the physical findings in most of the cases of children alleged to have been sexually abused. As a result, the defendant claims that this testimony vouched for the complainant\u2019s credibility and was improperly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">\u201cThe line between permissible and impermissible opinion testimony in child sexual abuse cases is not easily drawn.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>423 Mass. 180, 186 (1996). Expert witnesses may offer an opinion regarding the general symptoms or behavioral characteristics of sexually abused children. See <em>id. </em>However, \u201c[wjhere the witness explicitly links the opinion to the experience of the witness child, the opinion is clearly impermissible vouching.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The danger of vouching \u201cis greater where the witness is testifying as both a direct witness and an expert, particularly where the witness offers fresh complaint testimony.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Here, Dr. Van Deven did not provide fresh complaint testimony. Although she examined the complainant, she specifically stated that she did not interview the complainant about the sexual abuse allegation. Further, Dr. Van Deven did not explicitly connect the complainant to the general experience of sexually abused children. She described the findings from her examination of the complainant and testified as to the general findings associated with sexual abuse. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 458, 465 (1996) (affirming admission of substantially similar testimony from same physician). She never directly opined on whether the complainant in fact had been subjected to abuse. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federico, </em>425 Mass. 844, 849-850 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Finally, the doctor\u2019s testimony did not comment on the complainant\u2019s truthfulness. Her testimony \u201cdid no more than give the jury information concerning the medical interpretation of an absence of any physical evidence of penetration; namely, such a finding does not exclude that sexual abuse occurred.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 289, 293 (2000). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>Given a concern that a jury may associate sexual abuse with some evidence of physical injury, it is well within the province of a medical expert witness to explain that an absence of physical findings does not necessarily indicate an absence of abuse.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Federico, <em>supra </em>at 851 n.13 (\u201cThe jury may be under the mistaken understanding that certain types of sexual abuse always or nearly always cause physical injury or scarring in the victim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">6. <em>The father\u2019s testimony. </em>The defendant challenges several aspects of fresh complaint testimony by the complainant\u2019s father. We agree with the defendant, and hold that such testimony should not be admitted at any retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">a. The complainant\u2019s father was asked to describe the reason the defendant\u2019s mother came to his house the day the videotape was recorded. The father answered that the defendant\u2019s mother had questioned her son\u2019s involvement in the assault and that the father had assured her: \u201cYou\u2019ve known [the complainant] since she could talk. If you come over to the house, and you talk to her, she\u2019ll tell you the truth. ...

We permit fresh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>complaint witnesses to corroborate the testimony of the complainant, but we do not permit them, or any witness, to comment directly or indirectly on the credibility of the complainant or any other witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. 500, 504 (1991), and cases cited. \u201cEvaluations of credibility are, of course, within the exclusive province of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ianello, </em>401 Mass. 197, 202 (1987), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>376 Mass. 90, 94 (1978). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lorette, </em>37 Mass.

However, the statement regarding the complainant\u2019s truthfulness did not explain the reasons for making the videotape; it only described why the defendant\u2019s mother came to the house. The testimony was no more than an imprimatur of the credibility of the complainant. In a case such as this where the complainant\u2019s credibility is a key issue, such vouching may be especially prejudicial. On remand, such a statement may not be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">b. The complainant\u2019s father also testified regarding a conversation with his daughter about the alleged misconduct. He stated that she \u201cjust clammed up. You could see in her eye \u2014 that she was \u2014 she had said something at that point that she didn\u2019t really want to talk about.\u201d These statements were improperly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">A fresh complaint witness may testify both to the fact of the complaint and the details of the complaint as expressed by the complainant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>429 Mass. 22, 27 (1999). By the \u201cdetails,\u201d we mean that the witness may testify to the complainant\u2019s statements of the facts of the assault. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number><em>id. </em>at 30; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 658-659 (1992). The witness, however, may not interpret the complainant\u2019s words. Allowing the witness to testify beyond what was said would be inconsistent with the reason for permitting fresh complaint evidence, namely, to corroborate the complainant\u2019s testimony at trial.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morais, </em>431 Mass. 380, 385 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The father\u2019s comments here exceeded the permissible scope of-fresh complaint evidence. Instead of recounting what his daughter said, he provided his own interpretation of her words and emotions as opposed to a factual description. Such comments crossed the line from permissible corroboration to impermissible vouching.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">c. Later in his testimony, the complainant\u2019s father recalled telling a coworker, who \u201ccould see that something was wrong,\u201d that, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can work. I\u2019m too upset.\u201d These statements should not have been admitted. The father\u2019s out-of-court statements to his coworker constituted inadmissible hearsay because the statements were offered for the truth of the fact that something indeed was wrong and that the father in fact was upset. The comment that the coworker could see that something was wrong was outside the father\u2019s knowledge; he could not know his coworker\u2019s thoughts. Finally, the father\u2019s emotional response or state of mind after his daughter\u2019s revelations lack relevance; they have no \u201crational tendency to prove an issue in the case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fayerweather, </em>406 Mass. 78, 83 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chretien, </em>383 Mass. 123, 136 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">7. <em>Conclusion. </em>The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the youthful offender indictment for indecent assault and battery should have been allowed. In addition, the admission of the videotape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>as fresh complaint constitutes reversible error. We therefore reverse the defendant\u2019s adjudication as a youthful offender and remand the matter for a new trial consistent with this opinion. On remand, because the offense does not involve the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm, the Commonwealth must proceed against the defendant by complaint rather than by indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-13\">The first motion to dismiss challenged the sufficiency of the evidence submitted to the grand jury on the rape charges; the second contested the defendant\u2019s indictment as a \u201cyouthful offender\u201d; and the third claimed that the charges were duplicative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b880-8\">The defendant does not argue on appeal that there was insufficient evidence regarding the other statutory requirements under G.

We did not hold as a general matter that such videotapes would be admissible as fresh complaint evidence. Rather, we stated in <em>Lavalley </em>that the statements on the videotape did not differ from the testimony of the five fresh complaint witnesses or the victim\u2019s in-court testimony. See <em>id. </em>at 645. We thus concluded that the fact that \u201cthe fresh complaint evidence was presented to the jury through the use of a videotape in which the victim can be seen telling a police officer about the incident in a relatively composed manner, did not by itself make the evidence other than cumulative in nature and did not, therefore, make it prejudicial to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The clear implication of the <em>Lavalley </em>decision is that the videotape was not admissible; however, on the record before the court, the videotape was not so prejudicial as to require a reversal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b887-6\">By comparison, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavalley, supra </em>at 645, the videotape recorded the victim \u201ctelling a police officer about the incident in a relatively composed manner.\u201d The videotape also recorded the questions and responses of the police officer, but the officer was an objective outsider, with no personal interest in the matter, a person whose comments were unlikely to bolster the victim\u2019s credibility or prejudice the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b888-6\">We therefore need not address the defendant\u2019s claims that the videotape violated his right of confrontation or that the admission of the videotape in addition to testimony from three fresh complaint witnesses constituted impermissible \u201cpiling on\u201d of evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b888-7\">We disagree with the defendant\u2019s contention that the complaint was not \u201cfresh\u201d because approximately ten weeks elapsed between the alleged offense and the complaint. Whether a complaint is sufficiently \u201cfresh\u201d lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge, and the test is whether the complainant\u2019s actions were reasonable given the particular circumstances of the case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221, 228-229 (1989), and cases cited (\u201cCourts have not insisted on great promptness for fresh complaints in prosecutions involving child sexual abuse\u201d). During the period of abuse, the complainant was between three and five years old. The defendant told her not to tell anyone. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comtois, </em>399 Mass. 668, 673 (1987). As a babysitter and participant in her day care, the defendant occupied a supervisory role in the complainant\u2019s life. See <em>id. </em>at 674. Although this was not the child\u2019s first complaint \u2014 that being made to her parents the previous night \u2014 the delay was not prolonged enough to compromise its freshness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b888-8\">There was some indication before the recess that the prosecutor was planning to show the complainant the videotape made by her parents in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>refresh her recollection. After the recess, however, the prosecutor explained that she only talked with the complainant about whether she remembered making certain statements previously; the prosecutor stated that she did not play the videotape during the recess.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b889-8\">The procedure is similar to that utilized with any witness who cannot read or cannot read English.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b891-8\">The judge also instructed the jury that \u201cmerely because an expert has expressed an opinion . . . doesn\u2019t mean that you have to accept it.\u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Defense counsel objected to this statement after it was made and requested a bench conference.

Although the better practice would have been to move to strike the father\u2019s statement, counsel\u2019s objection and the discussion during the bench conference made it clear that he wanted the answer struck and the jury instructed to ignore the father\u2019s statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b893-8\">The dissent states that a fresh complaint witness properly may testify to \u201cthe [complainant\u2019s] appearance and similar physical observations\u201d at the time the complainant made the complaint, <em>post </em>at 879, and cites <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 620, 627 (1989), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moreschi, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 562, 565-567 (1995), as support for this proposition.

While I concur with the court\u2019s interpretation of the youthful offender statute, I write separately with regard to two evidentiary matters. In my opinion, neither the admission of the fresh complaint videotape nor the father\u2019s allegedly \u201cvouching\u201d testimony constituted an abuse of the trial judge\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">1. <em>The \u201cFresh Complaint\u201d Videotape.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">As the court explains, <em>ante </em>at 867, the prosecution sought to introduce a videotape for the limited purpose of corroborating the complainant\u2019s claims. Recorded by the complainant\u2019s parents, the videotape depicts the child answering questions posed by her father and the mother of the defendant. After considerable discussion regarding the proffered evidence, the jury viewed an edited version of the videotape over the defendant\u2019s objection.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavalley, </em>410 Mass. 641, 642-646 (1991), we recognized videotapes as an acceptable medium to convey a complainant\u2019s fresh complaint to the jury. In reaching that conclusion, we acknowledged that \u201cvideotapes are \u2018on balance, a reliable evidentiary resource.\u2019 Consequently, videotapes should be admissible as evidence if they are relevant [and] they provide a fair representation of that which they purport to depict . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 645, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>400 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>Mass. 524, 527 (1987). Almost eight years later, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>429 Mass. 22, 30 (1999), we held that, \u201c[t]he complainant in a sexual assault case may testify <em>only </em>to the fact that a fresh complaint was made and to whom it was made. The complainant should not be allowed to testify about the details of the complaint.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Given its understanding of this principle, the court views this videotape as inadmissible self-corroboration. Weighing heavily our holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavalley, supra </em>at 645, however, I respectfully disagree. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jerome, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 59, 62-63 (1994) (audiotape of victim\u2019s fresh complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">In my view, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, supra, </em>which prohibits the complainant from testifying about the contents of her complaint, does not control this case. Where a videotape such as this one is offered, it constitutes the fresh complaint <em>itself. </em>It is the equivalent of the testimony of a third party; it is not self-corroboration. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavalley, supra. </em>Thus, through the videotape, the judge allowed the jury to see an accurate representation of the fresh complaint. He also eliminated the need for each of the other fresh complaint witnesses to testify regarding the contents of the complaint. In so doing, the judge spared the jurors both repetitive testimony and the possibility of erroneous or conflicting recollections. Thus, by showing the edited videotape, and prefacing it with a limiting instruction, the judge permitted the Commonwealth to introduce the contents of the fresh complaint in the most accurate and efficient way possible, mitigated any prejudicial impact on the defendant, and resolved a thorny matter consistent with our case law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">That being said, I do not encourage the use of videotape in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>lieu of fresh complaint witnesses. Rather, my dissent hinges largely on a viewing <em>of </em>the videotape and the nature of the trial. In particular, I note that private individuals \u2014 not law enforcement \u2014 recorded this videotape less than twenty-four hours after a child of tender years first divulged the alleged abuse; that, through editing, a vast majority of the irrelevant dialogue and side conversations between the parties was eliminated; that the information was conveyed through the complainant\u2019s \u201cunrehearsed\u201d answers to questions posed by the defendant\u2019s mother; that the videotape did not record any emotional responses, crying, or the like that might improperly influence the jury; and that all the parties were subject to cross-examination at trial. Given these factors I would not characterize the judge\u2019s admission of the videotape as an abuse of discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavalley, supra </em>at 645 &amp; n.5 (upholding admission of videotape of victim recounting incident in \u201crelatively composed manner\u201d given content of tape and judge\u2019s limiting instructions).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">2. <em>The Father\u2019s Testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">In relating his discussions with the defendant\u2019s mother, the witness stated, \u201cYou\u2019ve known [the complainant] since she could talk. If you come over to the house, and you talk to her, <em>she\u2019ll tell you the truth. </em>... If you can leave the house and not believe her, I\u2019ll rethink what I\u2019m thinking.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court holds that this response constituted an impermissible evaluation of the complainant\u2019s credibility. <em>Ante </em>at 873-874. In my opinion, the contested testimony did not constitute \u201cvouching\u201d; rather, it was an accurate report of the conversation leading up to the videotaped fresh complaint. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number><em>ette, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 736, 740 (1994), <em>S.C., </em>422 Mass. 1014 (1996) (mother\u2019s statement that daughter\u2019s testimony \u201cwasn\u2019t fabricated\u201d improperly affirmed that testimony was \u201centirely truthful\u201d). Unlike an unbiased or expert witness, a father\u2019s tacit assessment of his daughter\u2019s credibility is unlikely to carry weight with the jury. The contents of the statement also indicate a willingness to reconsider the child\u2019s trustworthiness pending the outcome of the conversation. Because the father\u2019s comment did not refer to anything that happened in either the videotaped interview or the child\u2019s in-court testimony, there was, in my opinion, no improper endorsement of the witness\u2019s truthfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Last, I disagree with the court\u2019s judgment regarding the father\u2019s testimony that, on being asked about the alleged misconduct, his daughter \u201cjust clammed up. You could see in her eye .... [and] she had said something at that point that she didn\u2019t really want to talk about it.\u201d Notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s objection, I believe the judge properly admitted this statement. Unlike other jurisdictions, where only the fact of the complaint is admitted, under Massachusetts practice the entire statement, including the attendant details, is admissible. P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 6.19.2, at 349 (7th ed. 1999). Although the witness may testify only to \u201cthose details to which the [complainant] has testified generally,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 659 n.8 (1992), comments regarding the complainant\u2019s appearance and similar physical observations are admissible. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 620, 627 (1989) (given limiting instruction, fresh complaint testimony properly admitted, including fact that victim\u2019s \u201ceyes popped open\u201d during disclosure of misconduct); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moreschi, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 562, 565-567 (1995) (upholding admission of fresh complaint testimony that victim appeared \u201cashamed\u201d and hesitant while talking about sexual affronts). On that front, I also respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-10\"> Although most of the nonpertinent dialogue was removed, certain gratuitous comments such as, \u201cYou\u2019re doing great. ... I promise, honey, you\u2019re still my girl. Okay? I love you to pieces,\u201d remained on the videotape. Notwithstanding the parties\u2019 claim that further editing was \u201cimpossible . . . without digitizing and computerizing and having an awful lot of time to attempt to do that,\u201d these statements should not have been before the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Mindful of other difficulties that often arise in the context of fresh complaint testimony, I briefly note the following. First, this case does not present a \u201cpiling on\u201d problem, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 659 (1992) (repetitive testimony from several witnesses regarding details of fresh complaint may lend undue credibility to complainant\u2019s testimony), because the fresh complaint witnesses did not rehash the contents of the videotape. Rather, their testimony focused mainly on the events prior to the videotaping and other wholly unrelated matters. In an attempt to mitigate any potential duplicative testimony, the judge cautioned \u201cmost strongly\u201d that such statements are to be used for corroborative \u2014 as opposed to substantive \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>purposes only. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamontagne, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 213, 220 (1997) (five fresh complaint witnesses acceptable where \u201ctrial judge clearly, emphatically, and repeatedly instructs\u201d jury not to use evidence substantively).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Next, the admission of the videotape as corroborative evidence did not infringe on the defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Lavalley, 410 Mass. 641, 645 n.5 (1991). In this case, all of the participants depicted in the videotape testified at trial, and thus the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine them concerning the nature and context of the child\u2019s fresh complaint. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whelton, </em>428 Mass. 24, 27 (1998). That the defendant chose not to inquire about the circumstances surrounding the videotape constituted a strategic decision on his part.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
