Davis, in his personal injury action against the defendant, Robert Allard. The judgment for Davis embodied the actual damages that had been awarded by the jury together with prejudgment interest on those damages, and it exceeded the limits of coverage available to Allstate\u2019s insured. We conclude that Allstate was liable for postjudgment interest until it unconditionally offered to pay the plaintiff the limits of its policy. We also conclude that there must be further proceedings in the Superior Court to decide whether Allstate committed any violations of G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The undisputed material facts and procedural background may be summarized as follows. On March 11, 1982, the plaintiff sustained injuries when a van driven by Allard struck him as he crossed Route 1A in Revere, outside Wonderland Greyhound Park. The van that Allard was operating at the time was owned by Edward Poulin and was insured by Allstate pursuant to the standard Massachusetts automobile insurance policy issued in that year. The policy provided indemnity in the amount of $25,000 for injuries to one person as a result of one accident. The policy contained provisions setting forth Allstate\u2019s duty to defend and right to settle, and its obligation to pay supplemental costs (in addition to the policy limits). We shall set forth those provisions in full later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In 1984, the plaintiff commenced an action in the Superior Court against Allard and others<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to recover for his injuries, and Allstate defended Allard and its insured in the lawsuit. At some time during, or prior to, a pretrial conference on March 8, 1990, Allstate communicated to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney an oral offer of the $25,000 policy Emits in exchange for the plaintiff\u2019s agreement to release Allard from all liability relating to the accident.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff rejected the offer, and the case went to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>On October 4, 1990, a jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff against Allard and one codefendant, Westwood Group (doing business as Wonderland Greyhound Park) (Westwood), in the amount of $224,952.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Judgment entered on October 18, 1990, in an amount slightly in excess of $400,000 (the jury\u2019s award of damages plus prejudgment interest). On October 20, 1994, the Appeals Court affirmed the judgment against Allard, <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Allard, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 508 (1994), and Allstate did not seek further appellate review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">On July 31, 1995 (shortly after this court had decided the appeal of Westwood), the plaintiff made a written demand on Allstate for payment of the $25,000 policy limits plus $228,236.29 in postjudgment interest that had accumulated from the date of entry of judgment. Allstate informed the plaintiff that the matter had been forwarded to its New Hampshire office. On February 26, 1996, the plaintiff sent Allstate a written demand, pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, for payment of the \u201camount of the underlying judgment of $224,952 [szc], plus accrued interest since October 18, 1990.\u201d In response, Allstate informed the plaintiff that it was not obligated to pay interest that accrued after the initial offer to settle made by Allstate and rejected by the plaintiff, but that it would pay the plaintiff, as \u201cour final offer,\u201d $25,000, plus $18,000 in interest that, according to Allstate\u2019s calculations, had accrued up until the pretrial offer of March, 1990. Despite this offer, on April 26, 1996, Allstate sent the plaintiff a check for $25,000 (with no interest included), marked \u201cfinal settlement of any and all claims arising from bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>injury caused by [the accident].\u201d The plaintiff did not indorse or negotiate this check. It was not until July 1, 1996, approximately two weeks after the plaintiff filed this action against Allstate, that Allstate issued an unconditional draft in the amount of $25,000 to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s multi-count complaint sought, insofar as relevant here, a declaratory judgment under G. L. c. 231A that Allstate was liable for the postjudgment interest under the terms of its policy and by reason of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113A,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and a determination that Allstate had violated G. L. c. 93A by its insistence on conditioning payment of the policy limits on a release of the plaintiff\u2019s claims. The judge entered summary judgment for Allstate. The judge concluded that (1) under the express terms of the policy, Allstate had no duty to pay post-judgment interest that accrued after its conditional pretrial settlement offer of the policy limits; (2) G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113A, requires written notice only when an insurer eliminates or reduces coverage provided by a policy, and does not apply to settlement offers; and, (3) under <em>Lazaris </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>428 Mass. 502, 504 (1998), an insurer does not violate G. L. c. 93A when it conditions payment of policy limits on a release by the claimant, even when, as in this case, liability is undisputed and damages clearly exceed the available insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">1. The plaintiff\u2019s argument, in substance, is that Allstate is fiable for postjudgment interest on the judgment, computed from the time of entry of judgment in October, 1990, until the time that Allstate tendered the unconditional payment of the policy limits of $25,000, in July, 1996. He asserts that an offer to pay must be in writing and must be made after a judgment is entered to toll the accrual of the postjudgment interest that Allstate was obligated to pay. Allstate argues (and the judge agreed) that Allstate offered, and paid, the plaintiff all that was due him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>because, under the terms of its policy, Allstate was not required to pay postjudgment interest after its initial prejudgment offer of the policy limits, notwithstanding the fact that Allstate\u2019s offer was expressly made conditional on a release by the plaintiff of his claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Neither the plaintiff nor Allstate has furnished the correct analysis. The judge correctly determined, and the plaintiff does not now persuasively argue otherwise, that there is nothing in G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113A, that required Allstat\u00e9\u2019s settlement offer to be in writing. Section 113A does require that reductions or eliminations in coverage to a motor vehicle liability policy be memorialized in a printed notice attached to each policy. There is a clear difference, however, between a reduction of the coverage provided by a policy and an offer to settle a claim that is covered by the policy. As the judge correctly noted, \u201cThe former alters the insurance contract; the latter operates within it.\u201d In addition, nothing in the terms of the policy require that an offer to settle be in writing. The plaintiff points to the policy provision entitled \u201cOur Agreement,\u201d which specifies that \u201c[ojral promises or statements made by you or our agent are not part of this policy.\u201d This provision, however, is comparable in substance and intent to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113A, and cannot fairly be interpreted to require that every offer to settle be made in writing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Allstate\u2019s reasoning, on the other hand, is also inaccurate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Allstate asserts that our decision in <em>Lazaris </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., supra, </em>controls this case. In <em>Lazaris, </em>we held that, in settlement discussions, an insurer may condition payment of the policy limits on the plaintiff\u2019s execution of a release, even when liability is reasonably clear and damages exceed the limits of the policy.* *<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 505-506. Allstate reasons that its pretrial offer to pay the plaintiff the policy limits, conditioned on the plaintiff\u2019s release of all claims, against its insured and Allard, constituted a valid offer under <em>Lazaris, </em>which, when rejected by the plaintiff, extinguished Allstate\u2019s liability for postjudgment interest. The <em>Lazaris </em>decision, however, dealt solely with a pretrial settlement offer, specifically, whether an insurance company violates G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9) (f), and G. L. c. 93A by insisting that a claimant release all claims against its insured before it pays a claim. See <em>id. </em>at 502-503. <em>Lazaris </em>is not dispositive of the issue whether a pretrial offer to settle terminates an insurer\u2019s contractual obligation to pay post-judgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The correct analysis is based in the terms of Allstate\u2019s policy with its insured. We interpret these terms according to the \u201cfair meaning of the language used, as applied to the subject matter.\u201d <em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>392 Mass. 537, 541 (1984), quoting <em>Sav-Mor Supermarkets, Inc. </em>v. <em>Skelly Detective Serv., Inc., </em>359 Mass. 221, 226 (1971). The relevant policy terms are provisions 2 and 3 of the general provisions, set forth at note 7, <em>supra. </em>Fairly interpreted, these provisions together authorized and obligated Allstate, in this case, to:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">(1) defend any lawsuit brought against its insured within the policy\u2019s coverage \u201ceven if [the lawsuit] is without merit\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>(2) settle any claim or lawsuit as it saw fit;</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">(3) terminate its duty to settle or defend by paying the claimant the maximum limits of coverage; and</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">(4) pay postjudgment interest until it offers to pay the limits of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The policy allowed Allstate, before trial, to attempt to settle the plaintiff\u2019s claim for the policy limits in exchange for a release by him of its insured and Allard. See <em>Lazaris </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 506. The plaintiff\u2019s refusal of Allstate\u2019s settlement offer required Allstate to defend its insured and Allard at trial. See <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 154, 158 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">When the plaintiff prevailed and judgment entered, Allstate\u2019s obligations changed. It no longer was required to \u201cdefend\u201d the action, namely, pursue an appeal, \u201ceven if [the action] [was] without merit.\u201d The action now had merit based on the jury\u2019s verdict establishing substantial fault on Allard\u2019s part and liquidating a large amount of damages that were incorporated, together with prejudgment interest, in a judgment. The plaintiff then became a judgment creditor, and he was entitled to have the \u201cinsurance money [in Allstate\u2019s policy] applied to the satisfaction of the judgment.\u201d G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Allstate\u2019s decision whether to appeal the judgment was governed by the established rule that an insurer\u2019s duty to defend generally encompasses an obligation to appeal from an adverse judgment against its insured, but only if reasonable grounds exist to believe that the insured\u2019s interest might be served by the appeal. <em>See Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra </em>at 157 n.3; <em>Chrestman </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>511 F.2d 129, 130 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>Truck Ins. Exch. of Farmers Ins. Group </em>v. <em>Century Indem. Co., </em>76 Wash. App. 527, 533 (1995); <em>Aetna Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Borrell-Bigby Elec. Co., </em>541 So. 2d 139, 141 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1989); 7C J.A. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 4688, at 200-201 (rev. 1979) (insurer \u201cowes a duty to appeal in all instances where it appears the substantial interests of the insured may be served\u201d); 14 G. Couch, Insurance \u00a7 200.48, at 220-118 (3d ed. 1999) (\u201cinsurer\u2019s covenant to defend embraces <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>the duty to prosecute an appeal from a judgment against an insured where there are reasonable grounds for appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">At this point, Allstate, under the express provisions of the policy, could either terminate all its responsibility to its insured and Allard by paying the plaintiff the policy limits, or it could pursue an appeal, knowing that it would be required to pay postjudgment interest until such time as it had, under the supplemental payments provision of the policy, \u201coffered to pay [the plaintiff] up to the limits of coverage.\u201d If Allstate chose to appeal, as it did, it could still, in order to fulfil its continuing duty to its insured, have attempted to settle, conditioning payment of the $25,000 on the plaintiff\u2019s release of Allard or on the execution of some other suitable document acknowledging that Allard could no longer be pursued on any execution issued on the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Allstate did not make an unconditional offer to pay, and, consequently, by not doing so, and by continuing to control the litigation by pursuing an appeal, Allstate was responsible for the payment of postjudgment interest until such time as the terms of its policy were satisfied. The clear majority of courts, interpreting a standard interest clause in a motor vehicle liability insurance policy, have held insurers liable for postjudgment interest on the entire amount of the judgment, notwithstanding the fact that the policy limits may cover only a portion of the judgment. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in <em>Fratus </em>v. <em>Republic W. Ins. Co., </em>147 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir. 1998), stated the majority view as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">\u201cIt may, at first, seem shocking to impose this immense obligation on [the insurer] for a failure to deliver a relatively small sum to the plaintiffs. Yet, the clear majority of modem courts that have interpreted a standard interest clause under similar circumstances have concluded that the policies mean what they say. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">\u201c[Other] opinions not only apply the straightforward terms of the contracts, but produce sound policy. Compelling the insurer to pay all of the interest which accmes pending appeal protects the insureds, who may wish to pay the portion of the judgment in excess of policy limits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>and stop the tolling of interest, but whose lack of control over the litigation prevents them from doing so. . . . The rule also serves to protect plaintiffs from unreasonable delay on the part of insurers, or, as in this case, compensate them for such delays. The rule does not impose an unfair burden on insurers because they remain in control of both the tolling of interest and the litigation, and can fairly be expected to understand how the majority of jurisdictions interpret standard interest clauses.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">See <em>Safeway Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Amerisure Ins. Co., </em>707 So. 2d 218, 222-223 (Ala. 1997), and cases cited; <em>Security Ins.

Appleman &amp; J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 4894.25, at 78-79 (rev. 1981) (that insurer should bear burden of all postjudgment interest is \u201cthe only fair result, inasmuch as the insurer has control of the litigation, and can make its election to appeal irrespective of the insured\u2019s desires in the matter\u201d); 12 G. Couch, Insurance \u00a7 170-43, at 170-59 \u2014 170-60 (3d ed. 1998) (\u201ccourts . . . reason that where the insurer is in control of all litigation determining the liability of the insured and may stop the running of any interest against it by tendering, upon an adverse judgment, merely the amount for which it is liable under the policy, the insurer has in effect agreed, if it fails to make a timely tender, to pay all interest on the entire judgment in return for the surrender by the insured of his or her rights to effect a settlement\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>The obligation described continued until such a time as Allstate, according to the policy\u2019s express language, \u201coffered to pay\u201d the policy limits to the plaintiff. Allstate\u2019s original conditional pretrial settlement offer did not constitute such an \u201coffer to pay.\u201d In that proposal, Allstate did not offer to pay the plaintiff its policy limits, but instead offered him something substantially less, namely, payment of the policy limits in exchange for the plaintiff\u2019s release of claims that appeared to have merit both in terms of liability and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Because the relevant policy language refers to an \u201coffer to pay\u201d rather than an \u201coffer to settle,\u201d and makes no provision for the imposition of conditions on the offer to pay, Allstate was required to make an unconditional offer to pay the policy limits in order to terminate its express obligation to pay postjudgment interest. See <em>Safeway Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Amerisure Ins. Co., supra </em>at 222-223 (prejudgment and postjudgment conditional offers did not terminate insurer\u2019s liability for postjudgment interest); <em>Southern Gen. Ins.

Cf. <em>Insurance Co. of Pa. </em>v. <em>Giles, </em>196 Ga. App. 271, 273-274 (1990) (plaintiffs waived postjudgment interest obligation when insurer unconditionally offered to pay policy limits and delay in payment was due solely to plaintiffs\u2019 desire to ascertain amounts of respective judgments against multiple defendants).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In this case, compliance occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>on July 1, 1996, when Allstate finally tendered unconditional payment of the $25,000 to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Comment on the dissent is now in order. The dissent confuses the term \u201coffer to settle\u201d with the term \u201coffer to pay.\u201d These are fundamentally different concepts in insurance law; the former contemplates payment in exchange for a release, the latter encompasses actual payment without a release. The majority rule, stated in both cases and commentary such as Appleman and Couch, set forth above, supports this view, as does the decision in <em>Lazaris </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>428 Mass. 502, 505 (1998) (\u201cThere is a difference between mating payment on a claim and settling that claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>It is true that the interpretation of an insurance contract is dependent on the particular language used in the policy. We are bound, however, to interpret policy language in accordance with the common meaning of the words used, from the viewpoint of a reasonable insured, in order to \u201cbest effectuate[] the main manifested design of the [insurer and insured].\u201d <em>Worcester Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Marnell, </em>398 Mass. 240, 245 (1986); <em>James J. Mawn Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Liquor Liab. Joint Underwriting Ass\u2019n, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 417, 420 (1997). The dissent fails to follow this general principle. Although a valid \u201ctender,\u201d when used in the legal sense, may imply more than a mere offer to pay, see <em>Mondello </em>v. <em>Hanover Trust Co., </em>252 Mass. 563, 567 (1925) (offer to pay is \u201cstatement that the party has the money and is ready and willing to pay it\u201d; tender requires \u201cactual production of money\u201d), for our purposes the terms are virtually synonymous. See <em>Ryder &amp; Brown Co. </em>v. <em>E. Lissberger Co., </em>300 Mass. 438, 445 (1938); <em>Skillings </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>224 Mass. 275, 277 (1916); <em>Cumnock </em>v. <em>Institution for Sav., </em>142 Mass. 342, 347 (1886) (\u201cThe distinction between an unconditional offer to pay a debt, accompanied with a present ability and intention to pay, and a formal tender, is certainly technical, and the tendency of the law undoubtedly is to ignore technicalities which serve no useful purpose\u201d); <em>New England Power Co. </em>v. <em>Riley Stoker Corp., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 28 (1985), quoting comment 1 to \u00a7 2-503 of the Uniform Commercial Code, 1 U.L.A. (Master ed. 1976) (tender is offer coupled with present ability to fulfil conditions resting on tendering party, followed by actual performance if other party shows himself ready to proceed). Both share the essential characteristic that they be without stipulations or conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">More to the point, the dissent\u2019s reasoning that an \u201coffer to pay\u201d means only an \u201coffer to settle\u201d does an injustice to the ordinary meaning of those terms. While in insurance parlance, an \u201coffer to pay\u201d may imply an \u201coffer to settle,\u201d there is no question that the terms are commonly understood to have distinct meanings. Thus, where Allstate\u2019s policy sets forth its obligations to make payments to the insured (e.g., \u201c[w]e will pay three kinds of benefits\u201d; \u201cwe will pay reasonable expenses\u201d; or \u201c[additional costs we will pay\u201d), the term \u201cpay\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>describes an unconditional tender of money owed. On the other hand, where Allstate\u2019s policy refers to a settlement of a claim (e.g., \u201cright to settle\u201d and \u201cduty to settle\u201d) the term \u201csettle\u201d implies an offer of payment to the claimant that is expressly conditioned on some type of release for the insured. See <em>Lazaris </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., supra. </em>Indeed, the use in Allstate\u2019s policy of both terms in tandem, as in \u201c[o]ur duty to settle or defend ends when we have paid the maximum limits of coverage under this policy,\u201d illustrates that settlement and payment contemplate separate actions taken by the insurer, each triggering distinct consequences under the policy to the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">In keeping with this distinction, a reasonable insured would understand Allstate\u2019s promise to pay postjudgment interest (for the benefit of the insured, who is otherwise obligated to pay postjudgment interest) to terminate only after Allstate had offered to pay, with no conditions attached, the limits of the policy. Allstate\u2019s liability to the insured for the payment of post-judgment interest, according to the dissent, would end the first time Allstate offered to settle the case for the policy limits. This interpretation, however, renders Allstate\u2019s promise to the insured an empty promise, because, in every case where liability is both reasonably clear and in excess of the policy limits, an insurer like Allstate merely would extend an offer to the claimant to settle a case for the policy limits, thereby automatically shifting the burden of payment of postjudgment interest to the insured. This result would run directly counter to the purpose of the supplemental payments provision, \u201cto protect the insured when the insurer decides to contest liability and a judgment in excess of the policy limits is returned against the insured.\u201d 12 G. Couch, Insurance, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 170:43, at 170-58. The insured, who, by clear language elsewhere in the policy, has relinquished control over the litigation to the insurer, and who may not wish to appeal, would be obligated to pay the interest that accrues on the judgment while the insurer pursues an appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">There is no evidence that the plaintiff acted unfairly or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>unreasonably to prolong litigation (and increase postjudgment interest due him by Allstate); if anything, the record reflects that Allstate pursued an appeal in the hope (a longshot at best) that Westwood might ultimately bear the responsibility to pay. Allstate could have avoided its contractual liability for the interest had Allstate paid the plaintiff the money it owed. The over-all effect of the dissent\u2019s interpretation of the supplemental payments provision adds language that is not in the supplemental payments provision of the policy to deny the benefits of Allstate\u2019s promise to its insured (which became a promise to the plaintiff by virtue of Allard\u2019s assignment of rights to the plaintiff).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">2.

L. c. 93A demand letter, the plaintiff asserted that Allstate\u2019s delay in responding to his July 31, 1995, demand for the policy limits plus interest, a demand made nine months after the judgment against Allstate\u2019s insured had become final, constituted a violation of various provisions of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9), and, therefore, a violation of G. L. c. 93A. While there may be some adequate explanation for Allstate\u2019s delay, a fact finder must decide whether that delay constituted, in all the circumstances, an unfair or deceptive act or practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The other item identified by the plaintiff in his opposition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Allstate\u2019s summary judgment was that, after Allstate\u2019s offer of a proposed compromise, Allstate issued him a check for $25,000, on April 26, 1996, with a restrictive legend indicating that it was a \u201cfinal settlement of any and all claims arising from\u201d the underlying accident. This event occurred two months after the original letter, and, consequently, cannot be considered a separate item for purposes of G. L. c. 93A liability. See <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>424 Mass. 413, 423 &amp; n.12 (1997); <em>Bressel </em>v. <em>Jolicoeur, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 205, 211 (1993). See also <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Geriatric Auth. of Holyoke, </em>394 Mass. 274, 287-289 (1985). Based on what has been said, there is to be a trial on the plaintiff\u2019s claim that Allstate violated G. L. c. 93A by unreasonably delaying payment of its policy limits with interest after the judgment became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">3. Summary judgment is vacated. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for such proceedings on the complaint as may remain in dispute, including determination of the final amount of postjudgment interest owed by Allstate and determination of the G.

Two of these decisions, cited by the dissent to support the proposition that an \u201coffer to pay\u201d need only be conditional, involve factual circumstances not present here, and do not discuss the significance of the \u201coffer to pay\u201d language. See <em>Overbeek </em>v. <em>Heimbecker, </em>101 F.3d 1225, 1228 (7th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 809 (1997) (when plaintiff appealed from judgment, and \u201cdecade of protracted and needless litigation\u201d was due solely to \u201cintransigence of plaintiff\u2019s counsel,\u201d conditional offers to pay sufficed to toll insurer\u2019s liability for postjudgment interest); <em>Farmers Alliance Mut.

We are unpersuaded by the reasoning of another decision, also cited by the dissent, that differentiates between supplemental payments provisions that require \u201ctender\u201d or \u201cpayment\u201d and those that require only \u201coffer to pay\u201d to terminate an insurer\u2019s liability for postjudgment interest.

The requirement that an insurer pay postjudgment interest if an appeal is pursued will require insurers to reevaluate the case in the face of judicial finding of liability. If an appeal lacks merit or is otherwise weak, an insurer will have strong incentive to pay. There is nothing wrong with this. After all, the whole purpose of the postjudgment interest rule and G. L. c. 176D is to require insurers to pay when liability becomes clear and to penalize them when they stonewall and unnecessarily prolong the litigation. An insurer has no obligation to pursue an appeal that has no reasonable likelihood of success in an effort to grind down a successful claimant until a settlement is accepted. If the insurer seeks to pursue an appeal that has merit, it may be able to control its postjudgment interest obligations by paying the policy limits (with accrued interest) into court. We leave the availability of this procedure for another day because it is not involved in this case. We mention it only to suggest that insurers are not in the hapless situation hypothesized by the dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b206-7\">Sosman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4I\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part). The court imposes on Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate) an obligation to pay postjudgment interest that is contrary to the express provisions of Allstate\u2019s standard automobile insurance policy. In my view, the judge below correctly granted Allstate\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of its liability for postjudgment interest. The court\u2019s opinion also allows the plaintiff to pursue a G. L. c. 93A claim against Allstate based on its refusal to pay that disputed postjudgment interest. While I agree that the plaintiff should be allowed to proceed on a claim that Allstate\u2019s delay in paying the $25,000 policy limit violated G. L. c. 93A, Allstate did not violate G. L. c. 93A merely by litigating the issue of its liability for postjudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">1. <em>Interpretation of insurance policy\u2019s interest provisions. </em>Under the terms of its policy, Allstate agreed to pay postjudg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>ment interest in any suit it defended, but that contractual obligation to ,pay interest would terminate once Allstate \u201coffered to pay up to the limits\u201d of the policy. At issue in this appeal is the meaning of the term \u201coffered\u201d as used in this policy, specifically, whether Allstate\u2019s offer to pay the policy limit in exchange for a release of its insured was sufficient to cut off its liability for postjudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Courts interpreting policies with language identical to the Allstate policy have concluded that a conditional offer of the policy limit, such as that extended by Allstate, satisfies the policy requirement of an \u201coffer to pay\u201d the policy limit and terminates the insurer\u2019s liability for interest. See <em>Overbeek </em>v. <em>Heimbecker, </em>101 F.3d 1225, 1227-1228 (7th Cir. 1996) (where interest obligation \u201cends once the insurance company offers to pay the policy limits,\u201d repeated offers to settle for policy limits precluded award of postjudgment interest); <em>Farmers Alliance Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bethel, </em>812 F.2d 412 (8th Cir. 1987) (pretrial offers to pay $30,000 in exchange for release of insured satisfied policy requirement of \u201coffer to pay\u201d); <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>744 So. 2d 1261 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1999) (offer of $10,000 policy limit in exchange for release was \u201coffer to pay\u201d that avoided liability for interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">A contrary result has been reached in two cases. See <em>Safeway Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Amerisure Ins. Co., </em>707 So. 2d 218 (Ala. 1997); <em>Sours </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>25 Kan. App. 2d 620, 629-630 (1998).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both relied on case law interpreting policy language requiring that the policy limit be \u201cpaid or tendered or deposited in court\u201d in order to avoid interest. <em>Safeway Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Amerisure Ins. Co., supra </em>at 220. <em>Sours </em>v. <em>Russell, supra </em>at 629-630. When the policy language requires the policy limit to be \u201cpaid or tendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>or deposited into court\u201d in order to terminate the insurer\u2019s liability for interest, a mere settlement offer of the policy limits does not qualify as \u201ctender\u201d or \u201cpayment.\u201d See <em>Calder Race Course, Inc. </em>v. <em>Illinois Union Ins. Co., </em>714 F. Supp. 1183, 1188-1189 (S.D. Fla. 1989); <em>Southern Gen. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>227 Ga. App. 191, 193 (1997); <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Auto Club Ins.

But see <em>Weimer </em>v. <em>Country Mut. Ins. Co., </em>216 Wis. 2d 705, 722-725 (1998) (using common meaning of term \u201ctender,\u201d as opposed to legal definition, offer of policy limit in full settlement of claim qualified as \u201ctender\u201d that terminated-insurer\u2019s obligation to pay interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">However, no such language appears in the present Allstate policy. Here, the obligation to pay interest ended once Allstate \u201coffered to pay up to the limits\u201d of the policy. Allstate did not have to \u201ctender,\u201d \u201cpay,\u201d or \u201cdeposit\u201d the policy limit in order to stop interest from accruing. The contract term \u201coffer to pay\u201d should not be interpreted as the equivalent of \u201ctender,\u201d or \u201cpayment,\u201d or \u201cdeposit into court.\u201d The term \u201ctender\u201d and the term \u201cpay\u201d have always meant something more than a mere \u201coffer.\u201d See <em>Metropolitan Credit Union </em>v. <em>Matthes, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 326, 333 (1999), quoting <em>Mondello </em>v. <em>Hanover Trust Co., </em>252 Mass. 563, 567 (1925). Cases holding that an offer to pay the policy limit conditioned upon release of the insured qualifies as an \u201coffer\u201d have appropriately distinguished those policies that require an actual tender, payment, or deposit. See <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Turner, supra </em>at 1262-1263, citing <em>Calder Race Course, Inc. </em>v. <em>Illinois Union Ins. Co., supra </em>(adhering \u201cto the distinction between \u2018offer\u2019 and \u2018tender\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">When interpreting contract language, we should construe terms in their \u201cusual and ordinary sense.\u201d <em>Citation Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>426 Mass. 379, 381 (1998), quoting <em>Hakim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers\u2019 Insolvency Fund, </em>424 Mass. 142, 146 (1982). Here, the term \u201coffer to pay\u201d the policy limit should be interpreted with reference to what was typically meant by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>\u201coffer\u201d in the context of dealings with insurance companies in personal injury litigation. By standard custom and usage, an \u201coffer\u201d from an insurer defending its insured under a liability policy was an offer to pay in exchange for a release of its insured \u2014 i.e., an offer to pay in full settlement of the underlying claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, our decision in <em>Lazaris </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>428 Mass. 502 (1998), was premised in part on the fact that an insurer could not make an unconditional offer of the policy limit without risking a claim that it had violated its duty to its own insured. <em>Id. </em>at 506. It would be anomalous in the extreme to interpret the term \u201coffer to pay\u201d in a fashion that would, if made, expose an insurer to a claim that it had violated its duty to its insured.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The court\u2019s conclusion that \u201coffer\u201d means \u201cunconditional offer\u201d would transform the term \u201coffer\u201d into a requirement of actual payment. See <em>ante </em>at 183. An \u201coffer\u201d that has no conditions whatsoever will always be accepted, as there is no reason to reject an offer that demands no concessions in return. In the context of personal injury litigation, an \u201cunconditional offer\u201d will inevitably result in payment, as no plaintiff would ever turn down an offer of money that still left the plaintiff free to pursue all claims against all defendants. Ironically, it is those cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>interpreting policies that terminate interest only when the policy limit has been \u201cpaid or tendered or deposited into court\u201d that hold that an unconditional offer is required, reasoning (correctly) that only an unconditional offer is the equivalent of payment, tender, or deposit. See <em>Calder Race Course </em>v. <em>Illinois Union Ins. Co., supra; Southern Gen. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ross, supra; Cochran </em>v. <em>Auto Club Ins. Ass\u2019n, supra; Balder </em>v. <em>Haley, supra; Baughn </em>v. <em>Busick, supra. </em>Here, the court\u2019s insistence that Allstate make an \u201cunconditional offer\u201d incorrectly elevates the policy requirement of a mere \u201coffer to pay\u201d into the equivalent of actual payment. The term \u201coffer to pay\u201d the policy limit, as used in this policy, should be given the ordinary, sensible construction that the term had in the insurance field at the time in question, namely, an offer to pay conditioned on settlement of the claim against the insured. The policy requires only an \u201coffer,\u201d and nothing in the policy language or in the industry\u2019s ordinary practices suggests that this court should insert the word \u201cunconditional\u201d to modify that contract term.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The court reasons that, because the policy terminated interest only on an offer to \u201cpay,\u201d as opposed to an offer to \u201csettle,\u201d we must conclude that only an unconditional offer will suffice. This analysis overlooks the fact that, under an insurance policy, the only thing that an insurer does for a claimant is to \u201cpay\u201d money, be it in satisfaction of a judgment, partial satisfaction of a judgment, or in settlement of the claim. An \u201coffer to pay\u201d can, and routinely does, occur in the context of settlement, as a settlement with an insurance company can only result in \u201cpayment.\u201d Nothing about the use of the term \u201cpay\u201d suggests that the \u201cpayment\u201d anticipated by the offer can not be a payment in settlement. While quibbling over the ostensible distinction between \u201coffer to pay\u201d and \u201coffer to settle,\u201d the majority ignores the fact that what is required is only an \u201coffer,\u201d not an actual payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Beyond its erroneous interpretation of these contract terms, the court\u2019s analysis has some disturbing ramifications. The court acknowledges that, where an insured has a potentially meritorious appeal, the insurer\u2019s duty to defend obligates the insurer to pursue that appeal. And, pending the outcome of such an appeal, an insurer cannot abandon its insured simply by paying the policy limits without obtaining a release of the insured. See <em>Lazaris </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 506. Under the court\u2019s interpretation, the insurer is penalized (by the obligation to pay interest on the entire judgment) for having honored its duty to defend.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Put another way, the court\u2019s interpretation provides a strong incentive for an insurer not to pursue an appeal, even if the appeal has a reasonable chance of success and should be undertaken pursuant to the duty to defend the insured. Where, as is often the case, the jury\u2019s verdict is vastly in excess of the policy limit, the interest that mounts on the judgment during an appeal will soon eclipse the policy limit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Even with excellent prospects on appeal, it would be better for the insurance company to pay its paltry policy limit, leaving the insured to contend with the remaining massive liability for both interest and principal, rather than take an appeal and risk having to pay all postjudgment interest (as well as the policy limit).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Allowing an insurer to terminate its liability for interest upon an offer to settle (which would, if accepted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>eliminate the insured\u2019s liability for both interest and principal) does no injustice to insureds. By definition, if the insurer is willing to pay its policy limit and forgo any appeal as long as its own insured is released, an appeal that is taken following the plaintiff\u2019s rejection of such an offer is an appeal taken in order to protect the insured, not to protect the insurer. There is nothing unjust or unreasonable about requiring an insured to pay the interest that mounts during a good faith appeal that has been taken solely to protect the insured\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In terminating an insurer\u2019s liability for interest on an \u201coffer to pay,\u201d the Massachusetts standard automobile insurance policy deviated from the interest provision most commonly used, which terminates liability for interest only when the policy limit is \u201cpaid or tendered or deposited in court.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Today, the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>assumes that Massachusetts adopted such different language for no reason, holding that the two distinct versions mean exactly the same thing. Normally, we would attach significance to the parties\u2019 choice of words that so pointedly differed from an extant standard model. The wording is markedly different \u2014 an \u201coffer\u201d obviously means something other than actual payment \u2014 and there is a discernible reason for choosing one version over the other. I believe that we should ascribe meaning to the different language chosen for this insurance policy, and that we should interpret that language in a way that does not encourage insurers, who are willing to part with the policy limit, to abandon their insureds after the jury return a verdict substantially in excess of that policy limit. Today\u2019s opinion will certainly reduce defense appeals in personal injury cases, but that reduction comes at the expense of insureds who may have had legitimate, good faith, and meritorious appeals. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">2. <em>G. L. c. 93A. </em>I concur that further proceedings on the plaintiff\u2019s claim under G. L. c. 93A are required, as Allstate\u2019s delay in responding to the July 31, 1995, demand for the policy limit is potentially a violation of G. L. c. 93A. Once the $224,952 judgment against Allstate\u2019s insured became final, Allstate\u2019s obligation to pay its policy limit of $25,000 became absolute under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113. While Allstate\u2019s attention may have been focused on the much larger sum of interest then being demanded by the plaintiff, at least $25,000 was undisputably owed by that time. Delay in paying the undisputed portion of its obligation can give rise to liability under G. L. c. 93A, and that aspect of the plaintiff\u2019s G. L. c. 93A claim needs to be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">However, as I disagree with the court\u2019s determination that Allstate is liable for postjudgment interest, I obviously disagree with the proposition that Allstate\u2019s failure to pay postjudgment interest could be a violation of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9), and thereby a violation of G. L. c. 93A. Beyond the simple disagreement on the merits of the postjudgment interest issue, I do not see how Allstate\u2019s decision to litigate an unsettled question of law, a question on which other courts have reached differing results, could violate G. L. c. 93A. A respected trial judge agreed with Allstate\u2019s interpretation of its insurance policy, as do I, and as have several other courts. See <em>Overbeek </em>v. <em>Heimbecker, </em>101 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>F. 3d 1225 (7th Cir. 1996); <em>Farmers Alliance Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bethel, </em>812 F.2d 412 (8th Cir. 1987); <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>744 So. 2d 1261 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1999). See also <em>Weimer </em>v. <em>Country Mut. Ins. Co., </em>216 Wis. 2d 705 (1998).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Faced with a demand of $228,236 in postjudgment interest, and armed with significant precedent from other jurisdictions supporting its assertion that it owed no interest at all, Allstate did not violate G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9), or G. L. c. 93A, in litigating what was until today an unsettled question of law in Massachusetts. I see no need for any trial on that aspect of the plaintiffs G. L. c. 93A claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\">There are cases where the policy language required an \u201coffer to pay,\u201d but the fact pattern at issue involved an actual payment or deposit being made by the insurer. See <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Peerless Ins. Co., 774 </em>F. Supp. 83, 87 (D. Conn. 1991); <em>Boston Old Colony Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fontenot, </em>544 So. 2d 739, 741 (La. Ct. App. 1989); <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>526 So. 2d 266, 279-281 (La. Ct. App. 1988); <em>White </em>v. <em>Auto Club Inter-Ins. Exch., </em>984 S.W.2d 156, 159 (Mo. Ct. App. 1998); <em>Sproles </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>329 N.C. 603, 612-615 (1991). A holding that an actual payment was sufficient to terminate liability for interest does not mean that actual payment was required in order to terminate that liability. Such cases shed no light on whether an offer of the policy limits conditioned on release or full settlement qualifies as an \u201coffer to pay\u201d the policy limits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The policy at issue in this case, and the offer to pay the policy limit in Ml settlement, long predated <em>Thaler </em>v. <em>American Ins. Co., </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 639 (1993), which was subsequently overruled by <em>Lazaris </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>428 Mass. 502 (1998), and an offer of the policy limit in exchange for a release of the insured has once again become the normal form of \u201coffer\u201d in this context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b209-7\">On the facts of this case, it may well be that Allstate could have made an unconditional offer postjudgment without violating any duty to its insured. I agree with the court that the appeal of the underlying verdict was \u201ca longshot at best,\" and the duty to defend does not require insurers to take \u201clongshot\u201d appeals. <em>Ante </em>at 187. However, the issue is not whether, at some point in the history of this case, Allstate could have made an unconditional offer to pay without violating its duty to its insured. Rather, the issue is whether, at any point during the history of the case, it did make an \u201coffer to pay up to the limits\u201d of the policy. Nothing in the policy language suggests that the term \u201coffer to pay up to the limits\u201d changes its meaning at different stages of the underlying litigation, and we must therefore give the term a meaning that would include the kind of \u201coffer\u201d that is ordinarily made prior to trial and that, for some cases, will be the only kind of \u201coffer\u201d that an insurer can properly make even after a verdict has been returned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b210-6\">In practice, an insurance company never makes an \u201cunconditional offer\u201d to pay the policy limit. Plaintiffs make demands for the policy limit, and insurers who do not intend to obtain anything in return simply pay on that demand. There is no \u201coffer\u201d that precedes such a payment, and no purpose would be served by prefacing payment with an \u201cunconditional offer.\u201d Interpreting the interest provision as hinging on an \u201cunconditional offer\u201d makes the termination of interest contingent on an event that simply never occurs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The duty to defend encompasses a duty to pursue an appeal, and hence the duty to insist on a release of the insured as a condition of payment during the appeal, \u201cif reasonable grounds exist to believe that the insured\u2019s interest might be served by the appeal.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 180. Where there are such \u201creasonable grounds\u201d for an appeal, an insurer who pursues an appeal is not \u201cstonewall[ing]\u201d or \u201cunnecessarily prolong[ing] the litigation.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 187 n.13. There is no justification for penalizing good faith appeals that are taken to protect insureds. The taking of \u201can appeal that has no reasonable likelihood of success in an effort to grind down a successful claimant,\u201d <em>id,., </em>is a violation of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9), and, by way of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (3) and (4), makes the insurer liable for two to three times the underlying judgment plus attorney\u2019s fees. There is no need to impose interest as a penalty on insurers for taking good faith (but ultimately unsuccessful) appeals simply to have that penalty available for those who take bad faith appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Here, for example, the interest that accrued during the appeals came to almost ten times the policy limit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The court suggests, in an oblique fashion, that an insurer \u201cmay be able to control its postjudgment interest obligations by paying the policy limits (with accrued interest) into court,\u201d but then \u201cleave[s] the availability of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>procedure for another day.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 187 n.13. The contract terminates interest only on an \u201coffer to pay\u201d the policy limit, which the court now construes as an \u201cunconditional offer\u201d to pay. A deposit into court (which would only be paid to the plaintiff if the insurer\u2019s appeal were unsuccessful) is not an \u201coffer to pay\u201d and is certainly not an \u201cunconditional offer.\u201d The contract here does not suggest that a deposit of the policy limit into court relieves the insurer of the obligation to pay interest on the entire judgment if the appeal is unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Nor is there any authority for permitting such a deposit into court. Deposits into court may be made pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 67, 365 Mass. 835 (1974), but only with leave of court. Such a deposit is normally not allowed if the depositor is still contesting liability. See <em>Tarpey </em>v. <em>Crescent Ridge Dairy, Inc., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 380, 393 (1999), citing J.W. Smith &amp; H.B. Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 67.2 (1981). Even assuming an insurer were allowed to make a deposit pending an appeal on the issue of liability, that deposit would probably not toll the accrual of interest on the judgment. See <em>O\u2019Malley </em>v. <em>O\u2019Malley, </em>419 Mass. 377, 381 n.5 (1995) (\u201c[w]e need not decide whether rule 67 may be used to stop interest from running on a judgment while the losing party takes an essentially no-risk appeal . . .\u201d); <em>Augustine </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902-903 &amp; n.2 (1999) (declining to address the issue, but noting that rule 67 itself \u201cmakes no provision for interest\u201d). While I wish that there were some procedural mechanism by which to prevent the adverse consequences of today\u2019s misinterpretation of the standard automobile insurance policy (a policy that governs an enormous number of claims before our courts), there does not appear to be any such mechanism.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The treatises cited by the court refer to the \u201cpaid or tendered or deposited in court\u201d version as the \u201cstandard\u201d interest clause. See 8A J.A. Appleman &amp; J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 4894.25, at 82 (rev. 1981 &amp; Supp. 2000); 12 G. Couch, Insurance \u00a7 170.32, at 170-51 (3d ed. 1998). The \u201coffer to pay\u201d version that we address today is sufficiently rare that it is not even mentioned in either treatise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Albeit in an unpublished opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has also ruled that this version of an interest provision is satisfied by an offer to pay the policy limit in settlement of the claim. Dicus vs. Laipply, No. 92-3074 (6th Cir. 1992) (where policy terminated interest if insurer made \u201coffer to pay,\u201d offer to pay $100,000 policy limit \u201cin full satisfaction\u201d of $250,000 judgment sufficed to avoid liability for interest). While an unpublished opinion lacks value as precedent, its existence at least confirms Allstate\u2019s view that such an interpretation of the contract is reasonable and plausible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
