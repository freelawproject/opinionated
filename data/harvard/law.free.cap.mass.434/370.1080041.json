Days later, one of the men confessed to Lowell police his involvement in the armed home invasion and robbery, implicated the defendant, Victor Marquez, and provided the police with the defendant\u2019s address. The police made a warrantless arrest of the defendant after one of the victims positively identified him from a photographic array. The arrest was made after the defendant opened the door of his apartment in response to a knock by a police officer, who recognized the defendant as the person being sought; saw, in plain view inside the defendant\u2019s apartment through its open doorway, what appeared to be the stolen mountain bike; and heard the defendant say, \u201cThe bike\u2019s not mine.\u201d After his arrest and booking, the defendant was interviewed by the police and made incriminatory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Citing the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, a judge in the Superior Court allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the mountain bike and two tires seized by the police from his apartment after his arrest, and \u201cany statements made by the defendant at his home and at the Lowell [pjolice [sjtation.\u201d The judge concluded that, because the defendant was arrested \u201cinside his apartment\u201d without a warrant, and exigent circumstances were not present, the arrest was unlawful under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, </em>367 Mass. 798 (1975), and required suppression of the items seized and the defendant\u2019s incriminatory statements subsequently made at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">A single justice of this court allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s application under Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996), to pursue an interlocutory appeal from the judge\u2019s order, and we transferred the appeal from the Appeals Court on our own motion. We conclude, as did the judge, that the arrest was unlawful and requires suppression of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>mountain bike and the tires seized in the defendant\u2019s apartment. We do not suppress the evidence obtained prior to the defendant\u2019s arrest, namely, the defendant\u2019s identification, the observation of the bike, and the defendant\u2019s admission that the bike was not his. Finally, we adopt the principles enunciated in <em>New York </em>v. Harris, 495 U.S. 14, 19-21 (1990),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, based on an application of those principles, reverse suppression of the defendant\u2019s postarrest statements made at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">We now describe, in more detail, the facts as found by the judge (which are supported by the evidence), and the procedural background of the case. On November 6, 1998, Sergeant Joseph Murray of the Lowell police department responded to a reported home invasion of an apartment. Four assailants had tied up, beaten, and robbed the four occupants of the apartment. They stole various items, including a mountain bike, and then left.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">A victim had recognized one of the assailants, whom he knew by the name \u201cChinobi.\u201d Sergeant Murray knew a male named Vidalis Medina (Medina) who also was known as \u201cChinobi.\u201d He showed the four victims a photographic array containing a photograph of Medina. At least one of the victims positively identified Medina as one of the men who participated in the home invasion. An arrest warrant issued for Medina\u2019s arrest, and on November 11, 1998, Lowell police arrested Medina.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">During the evening of November 11, 1998, Sergeant Murray learned of Medina\u2019s arrest and interviewed him. Medina confessed to his participation in the home invasion, implicated an individual, with the street name of \u201cDoom,\u201d who had also participated in the home invasion, and provided Doom\u2019s address, the third floor of 282 Salem Street, to Murray. Murray was aware that the defendant was also known as Doom. Murray had previously seen the defendant on October 25, 1998, when he had been arrested on an unrelated offense and had told police that he resided at 282 Salem Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Murray compiled a photographic array containing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>defendant\u2019s photograph from his October 25, 1998, booking. He showed the array to one of the victims, who . positively identified the defendant as one of the men who had participated in the home invasion and robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">That same evening, November 11, 1998, at approximately 11:45 p.m., Murray, accompanied by two detectives (all in plain clothes) went into the apartment building at 282 Salem Street.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> From the common hallway, Murray knocked on the door of a third-floor apartment, and the defendant opened the door and remained standing inside his apartment. Although he recognized the defendant, Murray asked, \u201cAre you Victor Marquez?\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cYes.\u201d Behind the defendant, Murray observed in the apartment a mountain bike, tipped upside down without its tires. Murray said to one of the detectives, \u201cThere\u2019s the . . . mountain bike.\u201d The defendant stated, \u201cThe bike\u2019s not mine.\u201d Murray then told the defendant that he was being placed under arrest for the home invasion and robbery. The arrest took place inside the apartment, after which the police seized the mountain bike and its two tires. The defendant was brought to the police station where, after booking, he was interrogated by the police and made incriminatory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">A grand jury returned indictments charging armed robbery, armed assault within a dwelling, home invasion, and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. Prior to trial, the defendant filed two motions to suppress; the first sought to suppress all evidence seized, and all statements obtained, as a result of his warrantless arrest, and the second motion sought to suppress postarrest statements he made to police during his interrogation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After an evidentiary hearing, the judge entered an order only with respect to the first motion. She concluded, based on Federal and State constitutional law, that there were no exigent circumstances and that the police had made an unlawful warrantless arrest of the defendant while he was inside his apartment. To remedy the constitutional violation, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>ordered the suppression of the mountain bike and tires (and the officer\u2019s observations of these items), as well as any statements made by the defendant at his home. She also ordered that the defendant\u2019s later statements at the police station be suppressed because they constituted \u201cthe fruit of an unlawful arrest,\u201d and the Commonwealth had failed to \u201cdemonstrate that the connection between the improper conduct and the statements had become ... so attenuated as to dissipate the taint.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fredette, </em>396 Mass. 455, 460 (1985). Noting that this court has not had occasion to decide whether to adopt the holding articulated in <em>New York </em>v. <em>Harris, supra </em>(see note 1, <em>supra) </em>the judge declined to admit the defendant\u2019s postarrest statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">1. We agree with the judge that the police made an unlawful warrantless arrest. \u201cThe right of police officers to enter into a home, for whatever purpose, represents a serious governmental intrusion into one\u2019s privacy. It was just this sort of intrusion that the Fourth Amendment [and art. 14 were] designed to circumscribe by the general requirement of a judicial determination of probable cause.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, </em>367 Mass. 798, 805 (1975). Significantly, \u201cthe Fourth Amendment [and art. 14 have] drawn a firm line at the entrance to [a] house. Absent exigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant.\u201d <em>Payton </em>v. <em>New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 590 (1980). Thus, Federal and State constitutional law prohibit \u201ca warrantless entry into a dwelling to arrest in the absence of sufficient justification for the failure to obtain a warrant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, supra </em>at 806. See <em>Payton </em>v. <em>New York, supra </em>at 576; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass. 92, 96 (1997). If the police do not have a warrant to enter a dwelling to execute an arrest, \u201ctwo conditions must be met for the entry to be valid: [t]hey must have probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the crime and there must exist exigent circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pietrass, </em>392 Mass. 892, 897 (1984). In this case, probable cause to arrest the defendant existed. The Commonwealth, however, does not argue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>error in the judge\u2019s findings of fact and legal conclusions pertaining to the absence of exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless arrest. We therefore accept this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Our review does not end here. The Commonwealth, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Santana, 427 </em>U.S. 38, 42-43 (1976) <em>(Santana), </em>maintains that the defendant\u2019s arrest was lawful, and no warrant was required, because the police arrested the defendant in a public place and not in a home. We reject this argument. First, the Commonwealth argues (somewhat inconsistently) that the defendant\u2019s arrest \u201cwas initiated in the public hallway [of the apartment building],\u201d and that \u201cthe judge\u2019s findings show that the defendant was standing in the threshold of his apartment door\u201d at the time of his arrest. These contentions ignore the motion judge\u2019s finding of fact that the police arrested the defendant <em>inside </em>his apartment. The record supports this finding. At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Sergeant Murray testified that he arrested the defendant \u201cin the doorway of [the] apartment,\u201d while he (the officer) was \u201c[i]n the doorway leading [to the defendant\u2019s] apartment.\u201d The judge\u2019s finding that the police entered the defendant\u2019s apartment to arrest him was a permissible inference from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Further, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Santana, supra, </em>does not aid the Commonwealth. There the Court upheld the warrantless arrest of a defendant who \u201cwas in a \u2018public\u2019 place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42. The defendant, whom one of the officers recognized and had probable cause to arrest, was standing in the doorway of her house; \u201cone step forward would have put her outside, one step backward would have put her in the vestibule of her residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40 &amp; n.1, 42. The Court explained its conclusion that the defendant, when arrested, was in a public place by saying: \u201cShe was not in an area where she had any expectation of privacy. . . . She was not merely visible to the public but was as exposed to public view, speech, hearing, and touch as if she had been standing completely outside her house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42. The Court went on to uphold the officers\u2019 actual entry in the defendant\u2019s home when she fled inside to avoid the police under the doctrine of \u201chot pursuit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">In contrast, in this case, the defendant was not seen by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>police until they knocked on his apartment door and he answered. The defendant had not been musing about his apartment with the door open for everyone in the hallway to see him; he had not, in any way, exposed himself to public view. The police, who were in plain clothes and did not identify themselves as police officers, entered the defendant\u2019s apartment and arrested him before he had an opportunity to object or to consent. See <em>Payton </em>v. <em>New York, supra </em>at 576, 578, 583 (noting that although defendant\u2019s son answered door exposing view of defendant, defendant did not have opportunity to object or to consent to entry by police). We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the defendant was in a public place at the time of arrest, and conclude that the warrantless arrest of the defendant violated art. 14.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Because the defendant\u2019s warrantless arrest was invalid, the judge properly suppressed the police\u2019s seizure of the mountain bike and tires under the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>430 Mass. 545, 550-551 (2000). Contrary to the judge\u2019s conclusions, however, suppression of the statements that the defendant made at his apartment before his unlawful arrest (namely his admission that he was Victor Marquez and his statement that the bike was not his), and Officer Murray\u2019s observation of the mountain bike, is not required because those statements and the observation <em>preceded </em>the il<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>legal police conduct. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>412 Mass. 745, 749 &amp; n.6 (1992) (explaining that observation, as opposed to seizure, of item in plain view. does not intrude into area where defendant has reasonable expectation of privacy).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">2. We agree with the Commonwealth that this is an appropriate case to adopt, under art. 14, the principles stated in <em>New York </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>495 U.S. 14 (1990),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, after applying these principles, to deny suppression of the defendant\u2019s incriminating statements at the police station. In <em>New York </em>v. <em>Harris, supra </em>at 21, the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cwhere the police have probable cause to arrest a suspect, the [Fourth Amendment\u2019s] exclusionary rule does not bar [the admission] of a statement made by the defendant outside of his home, even though the statement is taken after an arrest made in the home in violation of [his rights].\u201d The police had probable cause to arrest the defendant for murder. <em>Id. </em>at 15. They unlawfully arrested him in his home without a warrant in violation of the <em>Payton </em>rule that \u201cprohibits the police from making a warrant-less and nonconsensual entry into a suspect\u2019s home in order to make a routine felony arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16, citing <em>Payton </em>v. <em>New York, supra. </em>Following his arrest, the defendant was taken to the police station, was informed of his Miranda rights, and signed a written inculpatory statement that he later moved to suppress on the ground that it was the product of an unlawful warrantless arrest. <em>New York </em>v. <em>Harris, supra </em>at 16. The trial judge denied that portion of the defendant\u2019s motion and, following trial, he was convicted of murder. <em>Id. </em>The New York Court of Appeals reversed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In concluding that the defendant\u2019s statement at the police station was admissible, the United States Supreme Court noted that the purpose of the warrant requirement for an arrest in the home is \u201cto protect the home, and anything incriminating the police gather[] from arresting [a defendant] in his home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. The Court explained that \u201c[n]othing in the reasoning of <em>[Payton </em>v. <em>New York, supra,] </em>suggests that an arrest in a home without a warrant but with probable cause somehow renders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>unlawful continued custody of the suspect once he is removed from the house. . . . Because the officers had probable cause to arrest [the defendant] for a crime, [he] was not unlawfully in custody when he was removed to the station house, given <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and allowed to talk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18. Thus, the Court expressed doubts \u201cthat the desire to secure a statement from a criminal suspect would motivate the police to violate Payton[,] [and] [a]s a result, suppressing a station house statement obtained after a <em>Payton </em>violation will have little effect on the officers\u2019 actions, one way or another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In addition, the Court rejected the \u201cattenuation\u201d analysis that courts (and the judge in this case) have applied, reasoning that such an analysis is inappropriate because the defendant\u2019s post-arrest statement \u201cwas not the product of being in unlawful custody [and] [n]either was it the fruit of having been arrested in the home rather than someplace else.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. Because \u201cthe police had a justification to question [the defendant] prior to his arrest ... his subsequent statement was not an exploitation of the illegal entry into [his] home.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The facts in this case are similar to those in <em>New York </em>v. <em>Harris, supra. </em>The defendant concedes, as he must, that the police had probable cause to arrest him, and his postarrest statements were made at the police station, not at his home. We adopt the holding in <em>New York </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>and conclude that, despite the defendant\u2019s unlawful warrantless arrest, his postarrest statements at the police station were admissible. We agree with the comments in <em>New York </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>stated above, that, upholding otherwise valid statements given by defendants at the police station after such an invalid arrest, will not cause the police to ignore the <em>Payton </em>rule. The penalty for an unlawful arrest in a defendant\u2019s dwelling is the suppression of anything seized at the time of the arrest, either from the defendant or in the dwelling, and any statements made at the time of the arrest. It is at this point, i.e., the time of the arrest, that some of the most incriminatory evidence is commonly obtained. The police are unlikely to risk the loss of the admission of that evidence in the hope that the defendant will confess to the crime later at the police station. Where the later statement was itself the product of illegal seizure of evidence or statements made at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>the arrest, the later statement could still be suppressed under a \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d or \u201ccat out of the bag\u201d analysis. Our adoption of <em>New York </em>v. <em>Harris </em>does not preclude suppression where there is a connection between unlawfully seized evidence or unlawfully obtained statements and a defendant\u2019s later statement. On the facts of this case, there is no such connection. We conclude that the unlawful arrest here tainted only the physical evidence seized in the defendant\u2019s home after the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">3. So much of the order allowing suppression of the mountain bike and the tires seized from the defendant\u2019s apartment after his warrantless arrest is affirmed. The remainder of the order suppressing the evidence obtained before the defendant\u2019s arrest (namely his statements to the police while he stood at the doorway and their observations of the mountain bike inside), and his postarrest statements made at the police station is vacated. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings, including proceedings on the defendant\u2019s second motion to suppress on the ground that his statements at the police station were obtained in violation of his Miranda rights and were involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-9\">In <em>New York </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>495 U.S. 14, 21 (1990), the United States Supreme Court held that, \u201cwhere the police have probable cause to arrest a suspect, the exclusionary rule [of the Fourth Amendment] does not bar [the admission] of a statement made by the defendant outside of his home, even though the statement is taken after an arrest made in the home in violation of [his rights].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Two uniformed police officers waited outside the apartment building in a patrol car.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b391-8\">In this motion, the defendant argued that the Commonwealth failed to sustain its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the waiver of his Miranda rights was knowing and voluntary and that his postarrest statements were made voluntarily.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The judge\u2019s conclusion obviated the need for her to rule on the defendant\u2019s second suppression motion that challenged the lawfulness of his postarrest statements on other grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Even if there had been a finding of fact by the judge that the defendant had been \u201cat,\u201d or \u201con,\u201d the threshold of his apartment when he answered the door, we would not apply <em>United States </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>427 U.S. 38 (1976), to justify the warrantless arrest. The requirement that, in the absence of exigent circumstances, the police need a warrant to arrest someone in his or her home, is designed both to protect the arrestee\u2019s privacy by prohibiting an unauthorized entry into a constitutionally protected area, and to avoid possibly violent confrontations between the arrestee and the police, particularly when, as here, the police officers are in plain clothes. Making the analysis turn on precisely where the arrestee is standing when he or she opens the door to the home will cause unnecessary litigation and substitute a measure of uncertainty for a settled black letter rule of constitutional law. Further, the <em>Santana </em>rule may lead police to forgo obtaining arrest warrants in the belief that they can make valid doorway arrests, and, if they err in so doing, may cause the suppression of important evidence seized inside the home after the invalid arrest. Arrest warrants can be obtained expeditiously, and, in view of that fact, no persuasive reason has been shown to create an exception to our bright-line rule that, to make a lawful felony arrest in a dwelling, the police need either a warrant or probable cause and exigent circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The question, whether we would, in an appropriate case, accept the principles stated in <em>New York </em>v. <em>Harris, supra </em>at 21, was last reserved in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass. 92, 96 n.8 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b397-7\">Cowin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2z\">(dissenting, with whom Marshall, C.J., joins). In <em>New York </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>495 U.S. 14, 21 (1990), the Supreme Court of the United States held that \u201cwhere the police have probable cause to arrest a suspect, the exclusionary rule [of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution] does not bar [the admission] of a statement made by the defendant outside of his home, even though the statement is taken after an [unlawful] arrest made in the home.\u201d The facts presented in this case closely resemble those in <em>New York </em>v. <em>Harris, supra. </em>The question then is whether art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights offers more substantive protection than does the Fourth Amendment in excluding statements obtained outside the home follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>ing an unlawful arrest made in the home.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court answers no. I would answer yes. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">There is no question that arresting the defendant in his home without a warrant and in the absence of exigent circumstances violated the Fourth Amendment and art. 14. See <em>Payton </em>v. <em>New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 576 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass. 92, 96 (1997). In order to deter police from future violations of these constitutional rights, we have held that the remedy is to exclude evidence obtained as fruit of the illegal conduct. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>419 Mass. 269, 275 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fredette, </em>396 Mass. 455, 458-459 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 258 (1982). That includes evidence obtained at the time of the illegality as well as \u201cderivative evidence, both tangible and testimonial, that is the product of the primary evidence, or that is otherwise acquired as an indirect result of the unlawful [conduct].\u201d <em>Murray </em>v. <em>United States, </em>487 U.S. 533, 536-537 (1988). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pietrass, </em>392 Mass. 892, 902 (1984) (\u201cevidence indirectly obtained as a result of illegal police conduct\u201d may be subject to exclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">We do not exclude evidence, however, if the causal connection between the illegal conduct and the evidence later obtained \u201chas become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fredette, supra </em>at 459. In determining whether the connection is sufficiently attenuated, we consider several factors, including \u201c(1) Miranda warnings, (2) the temporal proximity of the arrest and the confession, (3) the presence of intervening circumstances, and (4) the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, supra </em>at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The court today departs from this precedent and, instead of applying an attenuation analysis, adopts a per se rule that, if the police have probable cause to arrest a suspect, but illegally arrest him or her at home, the causal connection is broken once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>the police take the suspect outside the home. This creates the anomalous result that evidence seized or statements made inside the house at the time of the unlawful arrest will be excluded, but evidence seized or statements made as soon as the suspect crosses over the threshold of the house will not be excluded. Our Constitution was not designed to split hairs that finely. One of the most fundamental rights under art. 14 is the right of an individual to be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion inside his or her home. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eason, 427 </em>Mass. 595, 599 (1998) (\u201cConstitutional provisions against unreasonable searches and seizures were adopted in large measure as a protection against warrantless intrusions into homes\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Panetti, </em>406 Mass. 230, 234 &amp; n.5 (1989). The taint that occurs when police illegally intrude on the sanctity of an individual\u2019s home does not automatically evaporate simply because the individual is thereafter taken outside the home. The very reason we apply the attenuation factors is to determine when the effects from the illegal conduct have \u201csufficiently dissipated that deterrence [under the exclusionary rule] is not meaningfully advanced by suppression.\u201d <em>New York </em>v. <em>Harris, supra </em>at 28 (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The court supports its decision by reasoning that the statements the defendant made were otherwise \u201cvalid\u201d (the police had probable cause to arrest the defendant and therefore he was in lawful custody when he made the statements at the police station), and that admitting such statements \u201cwill not cause the police to ignore the <em>Payton </em>rule.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 378. I find neither argument persuasive. That the statements were otherwise \u201cvalid\u201d assumes the conclusion at issue. Any theoretical \u201cvalidity\u201d is extremely dubious given the fundamental illegality that preceded the statements. Furthermore, it is irrelevant to the analysis whether the police had probable cause to arrest the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The critical question is whether the taint from the unlawful arrest continued to affect the circumstances under which the statements in question were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Our Constitution requires an independent evaluation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>existence of probable cause. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldassini, </em>357 Mass. 670, 675-676 (1970). If such an evaluation occurs after the arrest rather than before, while resulting statements may be suppressed, the suspect still has been deprived of his liberty in a fundamental manner. The effects of the invasion on the individual suspect\u2019s sense of security \u201cextend far beyond the moment the physical occupation of the home ends.\u201d <em>New York </em>v. <em>Harris, supra </em>(Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Further, the court\u2019s decision may encourage police to violate the law and intrude on individuals\u2019 constitutional rights. If police believe there is a benefit to making an immediate arrest in a suspect\u2019s home in order to save time, resources, or to secure a confession, for example, then they may prefer to violate the Fourth Amendment and art. 14 and make an arrest inside the home without first obtaining an arrest warrant. The only thing police will lose is evidence seized or statements made at the time of the arrest. Under the court\u2019s decision, any evidence seized or statements made after the suspect is removed from the home would be admissible despite the illegal conduct. This evidence may be even more damaging than evidence police might have observed inside the house. The only effective way \u201cto compel respect for the constitutional guaranty\u201d is \u201cby removing the incentive to disregard it.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 599-600 (1975), quoting <em>Elkins </em>v. <em>United States, </em>364 U.S. 206, 217 (1960).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-8\">\u201cIt is by now firmly established that, in some circumstances, art. 14 affords greater protection against arbitrary government action than do the cognate provisions of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. 782, 787 n.10 (1996), quoting <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Chief Justice of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>416 Mass. 221, 229 n.16 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b399-7\">ObviousIy, if the police lacked probable cause in this case, custody of the defendant would be unlawful, and the statements could be suppressed for that reason.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
