Rule 1:03, as appearing in 382 Mass. 700 (1981). The question certified, which concerns the definition of the term \u201chandicap\u201d in the Massachusetts antidiscrimination statute, G. L. c. 151B, is as follows: \u201cWhether Massachusetts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>General Laws c. 151B requires consideration of mitigating or corrective devices in determining whether a person has a handicap.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The relevant background is contained in the memorandum and order of the District Court judge in which he denied in part and granted in part a motion for summary judgment of the police department of Boston. See S.J.C. Rule 1:03, \u00a7 3 (2). We summarize only those facts that illuminate our resolution of the certified question.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Richard Dahill was bom with a severe hearing impairment. At the age of three he began receiving medical care for his hearing loss and wearing hearing aids. He continued to receive medical care until the age of thirteen, when his hearing stabilized. Without the use of hearing aids, Dahill\u2019s hearing remains significantly impaired. With the use of hearing aids, his hearing is corrected to within normal limits. It is his use of hearing aids that raises the question we must answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Despite his severe hearing impairment, Dahill has achieved a wide range of academic and vocational success. His childhood medical records, which document extensive audiological evaluations and assessments, report above-average performance in school. He is a certified high school English teacher, and has worked as a lifeguard and health club worker. Dahill attende'd and has graduated from college and law school.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">In 1996, he applied for a position as a Boston police officer. In February, 1997, he received a conditional offer of employment, subject to meeting the medical standards promulgated by the Commonwealth\u2019s human resources division. After conducting an auditory examination, the department\u2019s physician, Dr. Luther Arnold, determined that Dahill had a \u201cCategory B Condition,\u201d which does not automatically disqualify a person from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>employment as a police officer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Arnold certified that Dahill met the Commonwealth\u2019s hearing requirements with the use of his hearing aids.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Dahill subsequently entered the Boston Police Academy for a twenty-six week training program required of all new police officers. At the academy, several episodes occurred that raised concerns on the part of the department that Dahill\u2019s hearing might make him unfit to be a police officer. In one incident Dahill did not respond to an oral instruction to retrieve water bottles after a training run. On another occasion he did not respond to a radio call. He also did not hear a gunshot during a firearms training exercise. Dahill has offered explanations for these incidents, but they are not germane to the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">After receiving reports of the episodes, Dr. Arnold again evaluated Dahill\u2019s hearing, and sent Dahill to another specialist for auditory tests.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the basis of his examination, the specialist\u2019s report, and the instructors\u2019 reports of Dahill\u2019s training, Dr. Arnold sent a report to the police commissioner of Boston stating that \u201c[t]here remains a major question [of] safety\u201d regarding Dahill\u2019s ability to perform the duties of a police officer. The department then terminated Dahill, explaining to him that his \u201cauditory deficiencies\u201d rendered him \u201cincapable of effectively and safely performing the essential duties of a Police Officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Dahill sued, claiming that his termination violated the Massachusetts antidiscrimination statute, G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Massachusetts equal rights statute, G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 103; the Federal Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 (2000), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101 et seq (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">We are asked to decide only whether a person who brings a claim pursuant to G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16),* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> has a \u201chandicap\u201d as defined by G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (17),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> if the person\u2019s impairment has been or can be alleviated by the use of corrective devices or other mitigating measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The department urges that we be guided by the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471 (1999), where the Court concluded that, under the ADA, \u201cif a person is taking measures to correct for, or mitigate, a physical or mental impairment, the effects of those measures \u2014 both positive and negative \u2014 must be taken into account when judging whether that person is \u2018substantially limited\u2019 in a major life activity and thus \u2018disabled.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482. The ADA defines \u201cdisability,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in part, as: \u201ca physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102 (2). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Because the definition of \u201chandicap\u201d contained in G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (17) (\u201ca physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more . . . major life activities\u201d), is essentially identical, the department suggests that the interpretation of the Federal statute by the Supreme Court compels a similar reading of the Massachusetts statute. We must first ascertain what the Massachusetts Legislature intended in 1983 when it amended our antidiscrimination statute to prohibit unlawful employment discrimination of handicapped persons, G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (17), \u00a7 4 (16), inserted by St. 1983, c. 533, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 6, before we consider the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of a Federal statute enacted in 1990, seven years later. See Pub. L. 101-336, \u00a7 2, 104 Stat. 328 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The language of the Massachusetts statute is not dispositive. Cf. <em>Acting Superintendent of Bournewood Hosp. </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>431 Mass. 101, 104 (2000). The statute draws a distinction between persons who have a physical or mental impairment, and those whose impairment \u201csubstantially limits\u201d a \u201cmajor life\u201d activity. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (17) (a). Only the latter are protected by the Massachusetts statute. But the statute is silent as to whether mitigating measures or corrective devices must be considered in determining whether a person with an impairment falls into the protected or nonprotected category. A person with a hearing impairment might experience no \u201csubstantial limit\u201d of a \u201cmajor life activity,\u201d even though he uses no corrective device: he would not be protected under the statute. A person with a hearing impairment might, even while using his corrective hearing aids, still suffer a \u201csubstantial limit,\u201d and thus would be protected. Finally, a person with a hearing impairment might experience a \u201csubstantial limit\u201d of a \u201cmajor life activity\u201d when not using his hearing aids, but not experience any such \u201csubstantial limit\u201d while the corrective devices were in use. The statute does not resolve whether this last person would be protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Because the language of the statute does not end our inquiry, we turn to other sources to discern the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Acting Superintendent of Bournewood Hosp. </em>v. <em>Baker, supra </em>at 104. The legislative history of G. L. c. 151B is instructive. In 1983, when the Legislature amended G. L. c. 151B to extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>protection from unlawful employment discrimination to \u201chandicapped\u201d persons, St. 1983, c. 533, \u00a7 2, the Legislature explicitly patterned the definition of \u201chandicap\u201d on the definition of \u201chandicap\u201d contained in a Federal statute enacted ten years earlier, the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (6) (2000). See <em>Talbert Trading Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 56, 60 (1994).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At that time no court had determined, or, to our knowledge considered, whether \u201chandicapped\u201d referred to a person\u2019s impairment in its corrected or mitigated condition; corrective devices or other mitigating measures were simply not relevant. See, e.g., <em>Strathie </em>v. <em>Department of Transp., </em>716 F.2d 227, 228-230 (3d Cir. 1983) (bus driver with controlled hearing impairment assumed to be \u201chandicapped\u201d); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Ohio Barge Line, Inc., </em>535 F. Supp. 1324, 1325 (W.D. Pa. 1982), vacated on other grounds, 697 F.2d 549 (3d Cir. 1983) (\u201ccontrolled epileptic\u201d assumed to be handicapped). We presume that in 1983 the Legislature was aware of the then-existing case law interpreting the Federal statute, and that it must have intended the term \u201chandicap\u201d in the Massachusetts statute to be interpreted in a manner that was consistent with the then-existing Federal jurisprudence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Duarte </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>405 Mass. 43, 47 (1989) (Legislature presumed to be aware of United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>States Supreme Court case interpreting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 when it patterned Civil Rights Act after \u00a7 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Guidance provided by the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) on this issue is also illuminating. In 1998, the MCAD issued guidelines that provide that \u201c[t]he existence of an impairment is generally determined without regard to whether its effect can be mitigated by measures such as medication, auxiliary aids or prosthetic devices.\u201d Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination Guidelines: Employment Discrimination on the Basis of Handicap Chapter 151B \u00a7 II.A.7 (1998). The guidelines explain that \u201can employee who is legally blind, but whose vision is correctable with glasses, may be considered \u2018handicapped\u2019 because his impairment substantially limits his ability to perform the major life activity of seeing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Legislature has delegated to the MCAD the authority to \u201cformulate policies to effectuate the purposes\u201d of G. L. c. 151B and to \u201cadopt, promulgate, amend and rescind rules and regulations\u201d to implement those policies. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3 (5). The guidelines represent the MCAD\u2019s interpretation of G. L. c. 151B, and are entitled to substantial deference, even though they do not carry the force of law. See <em>Berrios </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>411 Mass. 587, 595 (1992), quoting A. Celia, Administrative Law and Practice \u00a7 747 (1986) (administrative agency \u201chas considerable leeway in interpreting a statute it is charged with enforcing\u201d); <em>Bynes </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>411 Mass. 264, 269 (1991) (interpretations of G. L. c. 151B offered by MCAD are \u201centitled to substantial deference\u201d); <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>384 Mass. 198, 206 (1981) (MCAD, not courts, has primary responsibility to determine scope of G. L. c. 151B). It is particularly appropriate to defer to the MCAD\u2019s interpretation where, as here, the legislative policy is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>\u201conly broadly set out in the governing statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204, quoting <em>School Comm. of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>376 Mass. 112, 116 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The public policies underlying G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16), are clear: to protect \u201chandicapped individuals from deprivations based on prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear, while giving appropriate weight to such legitimate concerns of [employers] as avoiding exposing others to significant health and safety risks.\u201d <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>414 Mass. 375, 383-384 (1993), quoting <em>School Bd. of Nassau County </em>v. <em>Arline, </em>480 U.S. 273, 287 (1987). An interpretation that the term \u201chandicap\u201d does not require consideration of corrective devices is consistent with that broad mandate. An alternative interpretation excludes from the statute\u2019s protection numerous persons who may mitigate serious physical or mental impairments to some degree, but who may nevertheless need reasonable accommodations to fulfil the essential functions of a job.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The Legislature has directed that the provisions of G. L. c. 151B \u201cshall be construed liberally\u201d for the accomplishment of the remedial purposes of the statute. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9. Surely one aspect of that remedial purpose is to encourage impaired persons to overcome or mitigate their disabilities.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Advancements in medicine and the biological sciences, as well as rehabilitative technologies, now offer new hope to many individuals who previously may have been totally or significantly incapacitated by an impairment. The broad prohibition against the discrimination of qualified handicapped individuals contained in the 1980 amendment to the Massachusetts Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>tion<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the enactment three years later of legislation extending protection in employment to handicapped persons are recognition that persons who are physically or mentally impaired are nevertheless capable of becoming productive and successful members of the workforce. We construe G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, to give the fullest effect to that recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The department suggests that the interpretation we find persuasive is not compelled because a handicapped person, such as Dahill, who has availed himself of corrective measures may nevertheless seek protection from discrimination under the third prong of the definition of \u201chandicap,\u201d as one who is \u201cregarded as\u201d having an \u201cimpairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.\u201d The Legislature identified three avenues by which a person can establish that he falls within the statute\u2019s protection: the person (a) has an \u201cimpairment\u201d that substantially limits a major life activity, (b) has a \u201crecord\u201d of such impairment, or (c) is \u201cregarded\u201d as having such impairment. See note 6, <em>supra. </em>Loosely speaking, the first prong protects only those persons with actual physical or mental limitations, while the third prong protects those persons who, whether actually impaired or not, may be the victims of stereotypic assumptions, myths, and fears regarding such limitations. A plaintiff may prove that he is a handicapped person under one, two, or all of the three statutory definitions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The question we are asked to answer is whether our antidiscrimination statute requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>\u201cconsideration of mitigating or corrective devices in determining whether a person has a handicap.\u201d It does not, regardless of whether a plaintiff can prevail under the first prong of the definition, as well as under the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">We return to the holding of the Supreme Court in <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471 (1999). There are sound reasons why our interpretation of the Massachusetts statute diverges from the Court\u2019s interpretation of similar language in the Federal statute. First, the Supreme Court attributed little weight to guidelines issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) that \u201cthe determination of whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity [should] be made <em>without regard </em>to mitigating measures [under the ADA]\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>United Air Lines, Inc., supra </em>at 481, citing 29 C.F.R. Part. 1630, App. at 1630.2(j) (1998). Because Congress has not granted to the EEOC the authority to issue regulations interpreting or implementing the generally applicable provisions of the ADA, including the statutory definition of \u201cdisability,\u201d the Court said that it had no need to decide what deference the regulations were due. <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>United Air Lines, Inc., supra </em>at 479-480.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In contrast, as we have explained, the General Court has expressly authorized the MCAD to interpret and implement the provisions of the Massachusetts antidiscrimination statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Second, in the preamble to the Federal legislation, Congress had estimated that forty-three million Americans have disabilities. See <em>id. </em>at 484-485. This number would have been far larger, the Supreme Court reasoned, if Congress had intended the ADA to cover people with \u201ccorrected physical limitations.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 487. The Massachusetts statute, in contrast, contains no such estimate of the number of people in the Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>with handicaps, nor does it contain any analogous provision suggesting that the Legislature intended to exclude from coverage the many persons with significant, but correctable, impairments. While Federal precedents can be \u201cmost helpful\u201d in the resolution of cases involving G. L. c. 151B, <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>414 Mass. 375, 384 (1993), because the Massachusetts nondiscrimination statute differs from the ADA in at least the two critical respects we have discussed, it is not appropriate to follow the Federal jurisprudence in this case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">We are not persuaded that our decision today will open the floodgates of litigation, as the department fears. Our interpretation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (17), heralds no change in Massachusetts jurisprudence: since 1983, when the Legislature made the relevant amendment to G. L. c. 151B, judges and litigants in Massachusetts have assumed that a person with a significant physical or mental impairment met the threshold definition of \u201chandicap,\u201d whether the person used corrective devices or took other mitigating measures. See, e.g., <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, </em>424 Mass. 813 (1997) (no discussion of mitigation); <em>Wooster </em>v. <em>Abdow Corp., </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 665, 667 (1999) (controlled asthma); <em>Handrahan </em>v. <em>Red Roof Inns, Inc., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 13, 15-16 (1997) (controlled epilepsy).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Additionally, the determination whether Dahill has a \u201chandicap\u201d is a threshold inquiry under G. L. c. 151B: does he fall within the class of persons the Legislature sought to protect? If he meets that threshold test, he must still prove that he can perform the essential functions of a police officer, with or without reasonable accommodations. See <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., supra </em>at 383. Reasonable accommodation by the department to his handicap need only be made if it would impose no \u201cundue hardship\u201d on the employer. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16). Dahill must also demonstrate that his handicap was the cause of the department\u2019s allegedly unlawful discrimination. See <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, supra </em>at 821. These legislative criteria constrain any possibility that recovery for Dahill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>will be automatic.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>136 F.3d 854, 861 (1st Cir. 1998) (under analogous Federal provisions, even with earlier \u201cbroad view\u201d of disability, concerns and interests of employers are still \u201camply protected\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We answer the certified question, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The Reporter of Decisions is to furnish attested copies of this opinion to the clerk of this court.

(2000), which provides protection to handicapped individuals from discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, was amended in 1974 to define \u201chandicapped individual\u201d as <em>\u201cany person who (A) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person\u2019s major life activities, </em>(B) has a record [of] such an impairment, or (C) is regarded as having such an impairment\u201d (emphasis added). See Pub. L. No. 93-516, \u00a7 111(a), 88 Stat. 1617, 1619 (1974) (codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 [8][B]). The Massachusetts Legislature originally defined \u201chandicapped person\u201d under G. L. c. 151B as <em>\u201cany person who has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person\u2019s major life activities\u201d </em>(emphasis added). St. 1983, c. 533, \u00a7 2. Since 1983, there have been two amendments to the Massachusetts definition, but the operative language has not changed. In 1989, the Legislature made technical changes to the definition of \u201chandicapped person\u201d to bring G. L. c. 151B into compliance with the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988. See St. 1989, c. 722, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12. In 1995, it excluded from the definition current, illegal use of a controlled substance. See St. 1995, c. 179, \u00a7 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b256-6\">In later cases decided under the Rehabilitation Act, Federal courts were split as to whether that statute requires consideration of mitigating measures. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Compare <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Dallas, </em>2 F.3d 1385, 1390-1391 (5th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1011 (1994) (correctable vision not \u201chandicap\u201d), with <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Meese, </em>692 F.

See <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>136 F.3d 854, 862 (1st Cir. 1998). Two individuals with the same hearing impairment might be treated differently under the statute because one can afford a hearing aid and one cannot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\">In 1980, the voters of Massachusetts ratified an amendment to the Constitution prohibiting all discrimination on the basis of handicap. See art. 114 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. The ballot presented to the voters summarized the proposed amendment as follows: \u201cThe proposed amendment . . . would prohibit discrimination against handicapped people. It would provide that no otherwise qualified handicapped individual could, on the sole basis of that handicap, be excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination in any program or activity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The United States Supreme Court has taken a similar approach to the relationship of the three prongs of \u201cdisability\u201d under the ADA. In <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471 (1999), the Court determined that a person is \u201cregarded as\u201d disabled under prong (C) of the definition if his employer believes \u201ceither that [the person] has a substantially limiting impairment that one does not have or that [the person] has a substantially limiting impairment when, in fact, the impairment is not so limiting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489.
