L. c. 149, \u00a7 27, seeking to recover lost wages and benefits, treble damages, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees. The defendant filed an answer requesting a jury trial, whereupon the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>moved to strike that request. The motion judge, finding that the action was entirely statutory and that the statute lacked an express grant of trial by jury, struck the defendant\u2019s request, and the case proceeded to a trial without jury. The trial judge found that the defendant had violated the provisions of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27, and awarded back wages, treble damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs. The defendant appealed, and the Appeals Court reversed the judgment on the ground that the defendant\u2019s request for trial by jury had been erroneously denied. <em>Rosati </em>v. <em>Boston Pipe Covering, Inc., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 121 (1999). We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for further appellate review. We agree with the Appeals Court that the defendant was entitled to a trial by jury, and therefore vacate the judgment and remand the matter for retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u201cIn all controversies concerning property, and in all suits between two or more persons, except in cases in which it has heretofore been otherways used and practiced, the parties have a right to a trial by jury . . . .\u201d Art. 15 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. Article 15 \u201cmust be construed with \u2018flexibility in its adaptation of details to the changing needs of society without in any degree impairing its essential character.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dalis </em>v. <em>Buyer Advertising, Inc., </em>418 Mass. 220, 222 (1994), quoting <em>Bothwell </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>215 Mass. 467, 473 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The \u201cnarrowly defined\u201d exception to the right of jury trial set forth in art. 15 (\u201cexcept in cases in which it has heretofore been otherways used and practiced\u201d) removes only those cases \u201cin which a court of equity in either England or Massachusetts would have exercised jurisdiction in 1780.\u201d <em>Dalis </em>v. <em>Buyer Advertising, Inc., supra. </em>Thus, if \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s claim is analogous, in either subject matter or remedy sought, to cases within the court\u2019s equity jurisdiction, as it existed at the time of the adoption of the Constitution,\u201d there is no right to trial by jury. <em>Id. </em>at 223. Otherwise, the right to trial by jury remains \u201csacred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The present plaintiffs are suing for \u201clost wages and benefits,\u201d on the ground that they were underpaid for the work they performed for the defendant. Their suit is a \u201ccontrovers[y] concerning property,\u201d and it is a suit \u201cbetween two or more persons,\u201d thus bringing the action plainly within art. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Nothing about the claim makes it one that traditionally came within the court\u2019s equity jurisdiction. Rather, the claim is essentially an action in law sounding in contract. \u201c[Tjhe ordinary action of contract is a controversy concerning property, in which trial by jury was had as of right at the time of the adoption of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Farnham </em>v. <em>Lenox Motor Car Co., </em>229 Mass. 478, 480 (1918). The statute, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 26 and 27, provides that the wage rate for this particular employment contract was that set by the Commissioner of Labor and Industries, but the fact that the contract price is governed and set by statute does not make the claim any less analogous to a contract claim. Similarly, the fact that the statute gives the Attorney General the power to enforce its payment provisions and requires employees to notify the Attorney General prior to filing suit (G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27) does not change the underlying contractual nature of the claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A claim pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27, is not a new statutory cause of action, but is fundamentally a contract claim for wages owed under an employment contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Nei </em>v. <em>Burley, </em>388 Mass. 307, 315 (1983) (no right to jury trial on G. L. c. 93A claim because statute \u201ccreated new substantive rights in which conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>heretofore lawful under common and statutory law is now unlawful\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The remedies sought in the present case (lost wages and benefits, multiple damages, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees) are remedies at law, not in equity. The fact that G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27, also allows a plaintiff to seek injunctive relief in addition to damages,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> thus mixing a traditionally equitable remedy with a traditionally legal remedy, \u201cmay not compromise [the] constitutional right to a trial by jury.\u201d <em>Dalis </em>v. <em>Buyer Advertising, Inc., supra </em>at 227, citing <em>Stockbridge </em>v. <em>Mixer, </em>215 Mass. 415, 418 (1913). Cf. <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 526, 527 (1997), <em>S.C., </em>428 Mass. 543 (1998) (no right to jury trial in shareholder derivative action, which \u201chas traditionally been considered an equitable proceeding,\u201d where plaintiff \u201cprimarily sought equitable relief\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guilfoyle, </em>402 Mass. 130, 136 (1988) (no right to jury trial in action under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11H, which prescribes that Attorney General\u2019s enforcement action is \u201cfor injunctive or other appropriate equitable relief\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In both its legal theories and the nature of the remedies sought, the present action \u201cbelongs to the class of cases, therefore, where under the Constitution trial by jury must be held sacred and jealously guarded against every encroachment.\u201d <em>Farnham </em>v. <em>Lenox Motor Car Co., supra </em>at 481. The defendant was therefore entitled to a trial by jury and, in light of the conflicting evidence regarding the amount of work performed that would qualify for the prevailing wage under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a726 and 27, the denial of trial by jury was prejudicial. Cf. <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>NYNEX Info. Resources Co., </em>419 Mass. 792, 796-797 (1995) (erroneous denial of jury trial not prejudicial where plaintiff failed to establish prima facie case).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The judgment is therefore vacated and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The plaintiffs erroneously contend that their claim is not in the nature of a contract claim because they must have the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cpermission\u201d to bring their \u201cprivate enforcement\u201d action. The statute requires that they file a complaint with the Attorney General and then wait ninety days before filing suit. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27. The assent of the Attorney General is required only if a plaintiff wishes to file suit prior to the expiration of that ninety-day period. <em>Id. </em>In any event, the mere existence of presuit administrative filing requirements does not change the essential nature of the underlying claim. Comparable presuit filing requirements are set by G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, but there is still a right to a jury trial on a G. L. c. 151B employment discrimination claim. See <em>Dalis </em>v. <em>Buyer Advertising, Inc., </em>418 Mass. 220, 226 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b369-6\">In <em>Dalis </em>v. <em>Buyer Advertising, Inc., supra </em>at 226-227, we held that claims under other sections of the same chapter (G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 105A [wage discrimination based on gender], and \u00a7 105D [maternity leave]) \u201cha[d] historical connections to common law tort and contract claims,\u201d and thus entitled the parties to trial by jury. <em>Id. </em>at 226. The section at issue in the present case (\u00a7 27), which governs the amount of wages owed and allows employees to sue in order to obtain those wages, gives employees a cause of action in the nature of a straight contract claim. To whatever extent there is, as in <em>Dalis, </em>some overlay of tort, that overlay does not take away from the traditionally legal nature of the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b370-9\">The present plaintiffs did not seek any form of injunctive relief. The entirety of their prayers for relief against the defendant consisted of monetary claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
