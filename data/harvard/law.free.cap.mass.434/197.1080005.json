Rosado, of murder in the first degree on a theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty. In a separate trial, Kevin M. Babbitt also was convicted of murder in the first degree of the same victim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant alleges (1) that trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate the possibility of presenting expert evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s mental condition constituted ineffective assistance of counsel; and (2) that several errors tainted the judge\u2019s instructions. After reviewing these contentions and the entire record, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we affirm the conviction and decline to grant a new trial or a reduction of the degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">I. <em>Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">The jury heard evidence substantially similar to that set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Babbitt, </em>430 Mass. 700, 702 (2000).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We present only a cursory factual background here and offer more details when necessary to resolve the defendant\u2019s claims of error. In the middle of January, 1995, Babbitt and the defendant, two white males, had a loud party in the motel room in which they lived. The two were vocal exponents of White Supremacy. Their neighbor, an African-American man, pounded on the wall from next door and yelled for them to turn down the music. In response, the defendant turned up the volume and shouted racial epithets and violent threats to the person in the adjacent room. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Although the timing and specifics of the ensuing events were the'subject of some dispute, the evidence suggests that the defendant barged into the victim\u2019s room and, with the assistance of Babbitt, inflicted a brutal physical beating on the victim. The trial testimony indicated that the beating began in the victim\u2019s room, but ultimately moved to the cement parking lot outside the motel. The witnesses described Babbitt and the defendant kicking and punching the victim repeatedly. When that beating ended, the two dragged the victim back to his room where he remained, unable to move or seek help, for several days.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Some days later, the defendant, Babbitt, and another motel resident, Steven Richard, went to the victim\u2019s room and saw him lying on his bed, naked with foam coming out of his mouth and white mucous on his lips. After rejecting a suggestion to seek medical attention for the victim, Babbitt \u2014 with the defendant and Richard present \u2014 put a pillow over the victim\u2019s head and \u201cleaned on it.\u201d The defendant, Babbitt, and Richard then carried the victim\u2019s body and deposited it in a shallow grave in the woods behind the motel. On March 1, 1995, the police recovered the victim\u2019s body and a medical examiner concluded that the cause of death was blunt trauma to the head. Several witnesses reported hearing statements from the defendant regarding his participation in the beating, killing, and burial of the victim. In his defense, the defendant asserted that Babbitt\u2019s suffocation of the victim constituted an intervening, unforeseeable event capable of breaking the chain of criminal culpability arising from the initial beating. Under this theory, the defendant acknowledged his participation in the beating and the burial, but denied any role in the actual murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">To the extent it informs our assessment of the defendant\u2019s claims, we briefly mention the joint venture theory proffered by the Commonwealth. The jury heard strong evidence to conclude that the defendant and Babbitt entered into a joint enterprise to murder the victim. The joint venture spanned from the initial beating to the burial and remained viable at all relevant times, including Babbitt\u2019s suffocation of the victim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>432 Mass. 214, 224 (2000) (facts supported submission to jury on theory that defendant engaged in ongoing joint venture over extended period of time).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>II. <em>Trial Counsel\u2019s Failure To Investigate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The defendant claims that trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate the possibility of presenting expert testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s intoxicated condition deprived him of an otherwise viable mental impairment defense, and contravened his constitutional right to effective counsel. Prior to trial, trial counsel learned of the defendant\u2019s habitual intoxication and related history of aggressive behavior, but, according to the defendant, did not effectively incorporate such information into his defense. Although counsel hired a forensic expert, he admitted to the judge that, at the time of opening argument, he was \u201cunclear\u201d as to the substance of the expert\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *At trial, counsel\u2019s handling of the mental impairment strategy appears somewhat inconsistent. On the one hand, counsel elicited testimony from various lay witnesses regarding the defendant\u2019s intoxicated state and requested an intoxication instruction. On the other hand, he omitted the alcohol impairment theory from both his opening statement and closing argument. He ultimately made the strategic decision not to call the expert as a witness and advanced, as his primary argument, the \u201ccause of death\u201d theory, i.e., that the codefendant\u2019s conduct caused the victim\u2019s death. In a capital case, where a defendant alleges ineffective assistance of counsel \u201cwe do not focus on the adequacy of trial counsel\u2019s performance. Instead we determine \u2018whether there was an error in the course of the trial . . . and, if there was, whether that error was likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dahl, </em>430 Mass. 813, 819 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Viewed \u201cin fight of what a reasonably proficient trial lawyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>properly may have considered to be a reasonable trial strategy,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bertrand, </em>385 Mass. 356, 368 (1982), we note that the expert\u2019s testimony (presuming it supported the intoxication theory) could have weakened other aspects of the defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millyan, </em>399 Mass. 171, 179-180 (1987). First, the cause of death theory hinged largely on the defendant\u2019s recollection of the events in question. The defendant testified in great detail to the events before, during, and after the beating. Given this posture, testimony (be it expert or lay) that focused on the defendant\u2019s intoxicated state could undermine the defense by casting suspicion on his ability accurately and credibly to recall such details.* ***<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 179 (\u201csimply not credible\u201d that defendant could present detailed account of events while also claiming mental impairment). Second, an intoxication theory would be of limited strategic value vis-avis the Commonwealth\u2019s joint venture theory. Where the joint venture spanned several days, intoxication has limited, if any, impact on the defendant\u2019s mental state. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pucillo, </em>427 Mass. 108, 112 (1998). Finally, counsel did not overlook the intoxication theory altogether, but instead effectively presented it through lay testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sarmanian, </em>426 Mass. 405, 407 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bannister, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 71, 76 n.3 (1983). For these reasons, the jury\u2019s verdict is not likely to have been influenced by an expert advocating his mental impairment theory. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>433 Mass. 185, 192 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375, 394 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bousquet, </em>407 Mass. 854, 864 (1990).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Trial counsel\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>sion not to advance that theory, therefore, does not constitute ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">III. <em>Jury Instructions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The defendant claims the judge made several errors in his charge to the jury, some objected to and some not. Where the defendant did not object, we consider whether those portions created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinton, </em>432 Mass. 180, 188 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 681 (1992). Where there was an objection raised, we determine whether there was an error, and, if so, whether it was prejudicial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnie, </em>428 Mass. 161, 163 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">a. <em>Proximate cause of death instruction. </em>As the judge noted, defense counsel presented \u201cthe most plausible defense available,\u201d i.e., the victim survived the defendant\u2019s beating but was suffocated by Babbitt.* ****<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because this theory placed the \u201ccause of death\u201d at the heart of the case, the judge instructed as set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In charging that conduct is a proximate cause of death if, \u201cby the natural and continuous sequence of events, causes the death and without which the death would not have occurred,\u201d the judge properly stated the law as set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rhoades, </em>379 Mass. 810, 825 (1980), quoting California Jury Instructions, Criminal \u00a7 8.55 (4th rev. ed. 1979), and the Model Jury Instructions on Homicide 60 (1999). The defendant objected, however, \u201cto there being no instruction or direction given on supervening [or superseding] cause of death.\u201d Only with the benefit of that charge, the defendant claims, could the jury assess whether Babbitt\u2019s smothering of the victim sufficed to break the causal chain of criminal liability. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Askew, </em>404 Mass. 532, 534 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u201cThe general rule is that the intervening conduct of a third party will relieve a defendant of culpability only if such an intervening response was not reasonably foreseeable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Niemic, 427 </em>Mass. 718, 727 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Askew, supra. </em>After considering the events leading up to the defendant\u2019s death \u2014 especially in light of the proffered joint venture theory<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u2014 we find that Babbitt\u2019s intervening conduct was foreseeable. As a result, we further conclude that the judge adequately instructed the jury on this matter. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Askew, supra </em>at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">During his \u201ccause of death\u201d instruction, the judge twice referred to the import of the alleged joint venture. Given the viability of that theory, we need not speculate as to the jury\u2019s findings regarding the actual cause of death. Whether by beating, asphyxiation, or burial, the jury heard sufficient evidence to support a finding that the defendant and Babbitt participated in a joint venture to kill the victim. At least one eyewitness identified them as the perpetrators of the attack. A few days after the beating, the defendant, Babbitt, and Richard returned to \u201ccheck in\u201d on the victim. The defendant took no action when Babbitt suffocated the victim with a pillow,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but threatened to kill Richard should he tell anyone. Finally, the defendant and Babbitt, along with Richard, carried the victim\u2019s body from the motel and buried it in the nearby woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">On this record, a reasonable jury could conclude that, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>the time of the beating, the defendant and Babbitt entered into a joint venture to kill the victim and that the enterprise spanned the days and events, i.e., the decision not to seek medical attention, the subsequent asphyxiation, and the burial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>432 Mass. 214, 224 (2000) (defendant engaged in ongoing joint venture to inflict brutal and potentially fatal injuries on victim over extended period of time). The joint venture negates the efficacy of the defendant\u2019s theory that, if properly instructed, the jury could find that Babbitt\u2019s smothering broke the causal chain. <em>Id. </em>at 225 (various beatings \u201cwere not independent crimes or ventures producing independent effects\u201d). To the contrary, where joint venturers set out to kill, the resulting death reasonably is foreseeable as long as the joint venture remains intact. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Echavarria, </em>428 Mass. 593, 598 (1998) (\u201cit does not matter which of two joint venturers did the actual killing and the Commonwealth need not prove which is the killer\u201d). An additional intervening cause instruction was not necessary. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>431 Mass. 212, 215 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">b. <em>Failure to instruct on voluntary manslaughter and mitigating circumstances. </em>According to the defendant, evidence that the defendant\u2019s actions were the product of reasonable provocation and \u201csudden transport of passion\u201d triggered the need for a voluntary manslaughter instruction with respect to the mitigating circumstances that would negate malice. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the judge declined to give the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u201cIn deciding whether the judge should have charged on manslaughter, we assume the version of the facts most favorable to the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maskell, </em>403 Mass. 111, 116 (1988), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schnopps, </em>383 Mass. 178, 179 (1981), <em>S.C., </em>390 Mass. 722 (1984). Here, a voluntary manslaughter instruction was not warranted because no reasonable jury could possibly find any of the mitigating factors justifying a reduction from murder to manslaughter. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinton, </em>432 Mass. 180, 189 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>402 Mass. 333, 344 (1988), <em>S.C., </em>412 Mass. 353 (1992), and 420 Mass. 242 (1995) (although defendant testified that victim struck defendant twice, \u201cno <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>reasonable jury could have accepted the suggestion that the defendants were provoked into the brutal killing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Prior to his intruding on the victim, the defendant banged on the wall and threatened, \u201cshut up or we\u2019re going to come over there and kill you.\u201d Then, according to the defendant\u2019s own testimony, he knocked on the victim\u2019s door at approximately 1 a.m. After exchanging unpleasant words, the victim \u201cslammed the door,\u201d causing the defendant to drop his beer. In response, the defendant \u201cthrew [his] shoulder into the [victim\u2019s] door and the door popped open.\u201d Once the defendant intruded into his room, the victim \u201ccame at [the defendant] with his hands up\u201d and \u201clooked angry.\u201d The defendant then proceeded to beat the victim in a brutal fashion by pushing and kicking the victim repeatedly until \u201che wasn\u2019t fighting back no more.\u201d The victim\u2019s efforts to expel the defendant from his premises can hardly be deemed \u201creasonable provocation\u201d for the inhumane beating that ensued. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Berry, 431 Mass. 326, 335 (2000) (instruction warranted where victim \u201ccharged the defendant\u201d and hit him with beer bottle). Moreover, to the extent the evidence presented a joint venture lasting over a period of four days, a case for reasonable provocation or \u201csudden combat\u201d cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Given this record, we are convinced that no view of the evidence \u201cwould warrant a reasonable doubt that something happened [i.e., provocation] which would have been likely to produce in an ordinary person such a state of passion, anger, fear, fright, or nervous excitement as would eclipse his capacity for reflection or restraint, and that what happened actually did produce such a state of mind in the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>431 Mass. 782, 785-786 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, supra </em>at 334. As a result, the judge was correct in refusing to give a voluntary manslaughter charge.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">c. <em>Failure to give </em>Gould <em>instruction. </em>Several witnesses testified to the defendant\u2019s intoxication on the night of the beating. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>On that basis, the defendant submitted a written request for an instruction consistent with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>380 Mass. 672, 685-686 (1980), i.e., that the jury may consider a defendant\u2019s intoxication, or impaired mental capacity, if any, \u201con the issue of [whether the murder was committed with] extreme atrocity or cruelty.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>385 Mass. 639, 648-650 (1982), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gould, supra </em>at 686 (failure to give requested instruction supports reduction to murder in the second degree). The judge denied the request but charged that, \u201c[w]hen proof of a particular crime requires proof that the defendant had a certain intent, mental state, or knowledge, you must consider all the credible evidence relevant to his intent, mental state, or knowledge, including any evidence of whether his mental capacity was affected by consumption of alcohol.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While the judge\u2019s failure to give the requested instruction constitutes error, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDermott, </em>393 Mass. 451, 456-459 &amp; nn. 5, 7 (1984), the omission does not merit a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u201cIn this Commonwealth, while intoxication is no excuse or mitigation of a crime committed, a defendant is entitled, upon request, to an instruction to the effect that if he were so far overcome by intoxicating substances as to be rendered incapable of. . . committing murder with extreme atrocity or cruelty, the jury must return a verdict of murder in the second degree, if they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that all other elements of the crime are present.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>391 Mass. 443, 455 (1984). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shanahan, </em>422 Mass. 631, 632 (1996). Such instructions, \u201calthough <em>required </em>if requested, are not constitutionally based\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>425 Mass. 572, 578 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, supra </em>at 455. The judge erred in omitting the requested charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Unlike <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDermott, supra </em>at 456-459 (omitting requested instruction, over defendant\u2019s objection, war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>ranted reduction to murder in second degree), the error did not prejudice the defendant. First, the judge properly instructed the jury several times that they could take into account the effects of alcohol on the defendant\u2019s state of mind. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sarmanian, </em>426 Mass. 405, 408 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>424 Mass. 770, 790 (1997). Moreover, \u201c[w]e have never required more than a simple instruction that the jury may consider voluntary intoxication when considering state of mind.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 387 (1997). Second, because there was no evidence of intoxication other than at the time of the initial beating, and the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted an ongoing joint venture, a <em>Gould </em>instruction would have been of minimal significance. Finally, the defendant\u2019s extensive recollection of his actions, thoughts, and details regarding that initial confrontation with the victim undercuts the impact of the alleged intoxication. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass. 92, 102-103 (1997). Here, the omission of a more specific Instruction regarding intoxication, although regrettable, is not an adequate basis to reduce the degree of murder, let alone warrant a new trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>426 Mass. 395, 399-400 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">d. <em>Instructing on murder in the second degree before murder in the first degree. </em>The judge offered \u201cthe definition of second degree murder\u201d before defining first degree murder because \u201c[i]t is easiest to understand if I define second degree murder first.\u201d The defendant\u2019s argument that the inversion was error is answered by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, supra </em>at 387, where the judge addressed murder in the second degree first, but \u201cdid not direct the jury to make a decision on second degree murder before considering murder in the first degree, which was the critical error\u201d in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sama, </em>411 Mass. 293, 299-300 (1991) (error where judge repeatedly instructed jury to consider first whether defendant was guilty of murder in second degree and then decide whether evidence supported a finding that would increase verdict to murder in the first degree). Similarly, in this case, \u201cwe see no possibility that a reasonable juror could have misunderstood the instructions simply because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>the judge reversed the correct order of instruction on murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">e. <em>Instructions on inferences. </em>The judge instructed that \u201c[t]he jury may draw reasonable conclusions from the evidence as long as any conclusions or inferences that you draw are solidly based on the evidence and the jury\u2019s calm reasoning applied to the evidence. You may not guess at something, but you may apply your reasoning powers to draw reasonable and fair conclusions from the evidence as long as it is solidly based on the evidence and based on the jury\u2019s fair reasoning.\u201d The defendant objected, stating, \u201cThere was no definition or instruction on what \u2018solidly based\u2019 is. There were no examples . . . given what is a reasonable and what is an unreasonable inference.\u201d Although the judge did not \u201cdefine\u201d the term \u201cinference,\u201d his instructions adequately conveyed the nature of the inference-drawing process, i.e., applying one\u2019s \u201creasoning powers to draw reasonable and fair conclusions from the evidence as long as it is solidly based on the evidence and based on the jury\u2019s fair reasoning.\u201d See S.B. Hrones &amp; W.P. Homans, Jr., Massachusetts Jury Instructions \u2014 Criminal No. 2-2 &amp; comment (2d ed. 1999). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>398 Mass. 264, 270 n.3 (1986). To the extent that inferences were essential to proving any element of the crime, the judge instructed the jury to \u201cdetermine whether the fact [or facts] has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Niziolek, </em>380 Mass. 513, 522 (1980). Moreover, the judge\u2019s decision to forgo approved illustrations such as shoe prints in the snow, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 312 (1850), or mail through the mail slot, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Talkowski, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 720, 722 (1992), does not constitute grounds for reversal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Given the context of the entire charge, the judge\u2019s instruction regarding inferences was sufficient.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">f. <em>Instruction on unlawful act manslaughter. </em>As part of his unlawful act manslaughter charge, the judge stated that \u201cthis type of manslaughter . . . requires an assault and battery not amounting to a felony where the defendant knew or should have known from the circumstances that the assault and battery endangered human life.\u201d The defendant did not object at trial, but now contends that the judge erred by making \u201cthe non-felonious character of the battery an element of the crime of battery involuntary manslaughter.\u201d Based on the evidence, a reasonable jury could find the elements of battery manslaughter, i.e., whether in the circumstances known by the defendant, a reasonable person would have recognized that the battery endangered human life. Our most recent jurisprudence in this matter confirms \u2014 either explicitly, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>428 Mass. 383, 390 (1998), or implicitly, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>430 Mass. 182, 186 (1999) \u2014 that the underlying battery or \u201cunlawful\u201d act must \u201cnot amount[] to a felony.\u201d Accordingly, the judge\u2019s instruction on the matter was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">We reject the defendant\u2019s remaining claims of error. The jury were properly instructed regarding both joint venture, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Semedo, </em>422 Mass. 716, 723 (1996) (knowledge of joint venturer\u2019s possession of weapon not necessary in extreme atrocity or cruelty cases); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Springer, </em>49 Mass.

L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we have reviewed the entire record. We find nothing that compels us to exercise our discretion to disturb the jury\u2019s verdict, either by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>reducing the degree of guilt or granting a new trial. We affirm the conviction. We also affirm the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial and his amended motion for funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-11\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Babbitt, </em>430 Mass. 700 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b216-12\">We consider the defendant\u2019s direct appeal as well as the denial of his motion for a new trial and his amended motion for funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b216-13\">The major difference between the two trials lies in Rosado\u2019s decision to testify in his own defense. His version of the events leading up to the victim\u2019s death are discussed in the context of his claims of error. During the course of his testimony he acknowledged that he participated in the beating, was present during Babbitt\u2019s suffocation of the victim, and assisted in the burial of the victim\u2019s body, but denied killing the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\">As late as the fifth day of trial, defense counsel admitted, \u201cThere\u2019s a question as to whether I\u2019m going to have [the expert testify] or not, but it\u2019s going to be resolved tonight . . . if I have to stay up half the night trying to get ahold <em>[sic] </em>of him.\u201d When the defense rested, the judge asked whether the decision not to call the expert was based on \u201cunavailability\u201d or \u201cfor tactical purposes.\u201d Counsel responded, \u201cI\u2019m not calling [the expert], because I have full knowledge of what his testimony would be had he testified.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The trial judge rejected a similar argument as part of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. In concluding that trial counsel \u201cwas not incompetent or ineffective by pursuing [cause of death] strategy without also seeking out a psychologist to testify about the defendant\u2019s intoxication and mental state,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>the judge noted that the attorney \u201cdid not neglect to present to the jury the issues of intoxication and lack of malice.\u201d \u201c[W]e give weight to the conclusion of the judge, who observed counsel\u2019s conduct throughout the trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drayton, </em>386 Mass. 39, 41-42 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Conversely, the defendant\u2019s ability to recall detail tends to disprove an opinion that he suffered from mental impairment at any pertinent time. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>387 Mass. 758, 761-763 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Relatedly, the defendant challenges the judge\u2019s denial of his motion for funds, pursuant to G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27C, to retain the assistance of a clinical psychologist. \u201cSection 27C does not authorize a judge to allow costs in connection with the presentation of a new trial motion based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>429 Mass. 266, 270 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>(1999). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Erdely, </em>430 Mass. 149, 154 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>410 Mass. 680, 684 (1991) (where Legislature chooses not to fund procedures not constitutionally mandated, \u201cthis court may not rewrite the statute to do so\u201d). Nor did this posttrial denial of funds create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b220-13\">The medical examiner listed \u201cblunt head trauma\u201d as the cause of death, but could not rule out asphyxiation. The jury also heard testimony that the victim\u2019s body emitted \u201ca noise that sounded like air\u201d when dropped into the shallow grave. This evidence suggests that the victim may have survived the attempted suffocation and was buried alive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b220-14\"> \u201cCause of death. I\u2019ve used that term. Let me tell you what that means in the law. For the defendant to be guilty of any form of murder or manslaughter, the defendant\u2019s conduct, either individually or while participating in a joint venture, must have caused the death of [the victim]. Cause means conduct which, by the natural and continuous sequence of events, caused the death and without which the death would not have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-15\">\u201cUnder the law, the defendant\u2019s conduct need not have been the only cause of death. It is not necessary that it be the sole cause of death. If the defendant, either individually or in a joint enterprise, beats a man to a point where his life is in jeopardy and death follows as a consequence of this beating, the defendant\u2019s conduct caused his death in the law, even if other causes cooperated in producing the death. So, as I said, it need not be the sole cause.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The joint venture dimension of this case distinguishes it from those relied on by the defendant. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. Munoz, 233 Conn. 106, 114-127 (1995) (where defendant claimed unidentified third party inflicted fatal blows, failure to instruct on intervening cause warranted reversal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b221-9\">There was testimony that, immediately prior to the beating, the defendant unsuccessfully attempted to suffocate the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The defendant\u2019s contention that the jury could have believed that the victim had a history of mental illness-paranoia also lacks merit. In seven volumes of transcript, only a solitary reference to the victim\u2019s mental history appears and thus such evidence is insufficient to warrant the requested charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The jury interrupted their deliberation to ask for \u201canother explanation of the factors that contribute to a finding of \u2018by extreme atrocity or cruelty.\u2019 \u201d After the judge\u2019s restating the initial instruction, the defendant renewed his objection as to the omission of any intoxication language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Notwithstanding this conclusion, we reiterate our recommendation in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sama, </em>411 Mass. 293, 300 (1991), that a \u201cjury should not be instructed to find murder in the second degree and then proceed to inquire whether the defendant is guilty of murder in the first degree. A jury should be instructed first to decide whether the defendant is guilty of murder and, if so, then to decide whether the defendant is guilty of murder in the first degree.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\">The defendant suggests that the inferences instruction raises a particular concern regarding one juror who expressed an inability to understand \u201cfancy words.\u201d From the outset, the judge encouraged the juror to raise his hand if he had trouble understanding any terms. There is no evidence that the instruction confused this, or any other, juror.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
