Henderson, on four indictments charging wilfully endeavoring to interfere with a witness, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>eight indictments charging violation of a protective order, G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 7; and one indictment charging assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A. On appeal, the defendant claims that the judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on accord and satisfaction and his admission in evidence of opinion testimony warrant reversal of the interfering with a witness convictions. He also contends that convictions under G. L. c. 209A cannot stand because he was denied a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the underlying order. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review. Because the defendant received actual notice of the scheduled hearing, knew the order could be extended, and never expressed a desire to exercise his right to be heard, we reject the argument and affirm the convictions under c. 209A. The judge committed no error in his jury instructions and the convictions under G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, as well as the assault and battery conviction, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The victim had a relationship with the defendant from 1991 until 1995. In December, 1995, the two got into an argument that resulted in the defendant\u2019s striking the victim in the face. This incident gave rise to the assault and battery charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While the defendant was incarcerated for an unrelated instance of abuse,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the victim sought a temporary protective order pursuant to G. L. c. 209A. As discussed <em>infra, </em>the court extended the order for a period of one year. During that time, the defendant remained incarcerated and sent approximately sixty letters to the victim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The content of the letters constituted the main evidence supporting the prosecution\u2019s case of interference with a witness. The letters consisted of repeated pleas, some linked to promises of financial compensation or marriage proposals, for the victim to extricate the defendant from both his confinement and the pending criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>sanctions. Although the content of the letters is further discussed below, we set out samples in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">2. <em>Accord and satisfaction instruction. </em>In response to the four charges of endeavoring to influence or interfere with a witness in violation of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, the defendant asserted an \u201caccord and satisfaction\u201d defense pursuant to G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 55.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Pursuant to the statute, \u201c[a] judge may discharge the defendant from an indictment or complaint on \u2018a charge of assault and battery or other misdemeanor for which he is liable in a civil action . . .\u2019 when a victim appears in court acknowledging that she \u2018has received [monetary payment in] satisfaction for the injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gonzalez, 388 Mass. 865, 867 n.4 (1983), quoting G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 55. See J.R. Nolan &amp; B.R. Henry, Criminal Law \u00a7 618, at 509 (2d ed. 1988). Once acknowledged and accepted, the payment is referred to as an accord and satisfaction. See <em>Mahoney\u2019s Case, </em>371 Mass. 891, 891 (1976). At the charge conference, defense counsel requested an instruction including the text of the accord and satisfaction statute and that \u201cthe Commonwealth must also prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s offer of a promise, gift, or something of value to the witness was not a lawful endeavor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>authorized by [the accord and satisfaction statute].\u201d After considering \u201cthose [approximately] fifty letters that are in testimony,\u201d including their repeated requests that the victim \u201clie\u201d about the underlying incident, the judge declined to give the requested instruction. The defendant preserved his appellate rights and moved for a mistrial. \u201cBecause the defendant objected to the judge\u2019s refusal to give [the accord and satisfaction] instruction, we review the omission to determine if there was prejudicial error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 329, 338 (1999), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>415 Mass. 680, 686-687 &amp; n.8 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">According to the defendant, without the benefit of the desired instruction, the jury were ill equipped to discern whether the letters were an unlawful attempt to influence the victim or a lawful attempt to reach an accord and satisfaction vis-a-vis the outstanding assault and battery charge. Because most jurors are not familiar with the accord and satisfaction doctrine, it should be charged in cases where it is adequately supported by the evidence. Here, however, no view of the evidence could lead a reasonable jury to find that the defendant intended to enter into an accord and satisfaction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>430 Mass. 800, 809 n.11 (2000). We thus conclude that the judge\u2019s omission was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">As the evidence makes clear, the letters invite the victim to participate in a scheme of dishonesty, not one of accord and satisfaction. To effectuate an accord and satisfaction, the victim need only proffer a written acknowledgment \u201cthat I have received satisfaction for my injury and request that the charges be dropped.\u201d R. M. Kantrowitz &amp; R. Witkin, Criminal Defense Motions \u00a7 15.11, at 544 (2d ed. 1998). If this is all the defendant sought to accomplish, there would be no need for the repeated requests for the victim to lie on his behalf. Given this context, statements such as, \u201cplease tell [them] that you got jumped and I didn\u2019t hit you,\u201d and \u201cI know it is a lie, but that is the only way,\u201d linked to offers for financial compensation, can only be understood as prohibited attempts to influence the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The defendant\u2019s desire that the victim remain secretive about the proposed scheme also contradicts the plain operation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>accord and satisfaction doctrine that requires presentation to the court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 55. The defendant\u2019s theory is even less plausible given his history of encouraging the victim to lie to law enforcement agencies in order to protect his penal interests.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Here, a party encouraged a witness to lie, and to keep the proffered payment a secret. This is a far cry from the accord and satisfaction doctrine that enables two parties to strike a publicly approved, judicially sanctioned arrangement. G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 55. For these reasons, no view of the record would support the elements of an accord and satisfaction defense, and the judge\u2019s refusal to give the requested charge was therefore proper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>399 Mass. 80, 91 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">3. <em>Opinion testimony. </em>At trial, the prosecutor asked the victim, \u201cWhen the [djefendant offered you $150 plus the food stamps, what did you think he was offering you that for?\u201d When she answered, \u201cJust to bribe me to get him out of jail,\u201d defense counsel objected and moved to strike the response. At sidebar, the prosecutor argued that the contested statement was relevant, because \u201c[i]t goes to the accord and satisfaction [theory]. . . . What I intend to show is he repeatedly made offers [that] she repeatedly rejected, so that even doing accord and satisfaction was unreasonable because she rejected the offers.\u201d Defense counsel countered that the victim\u2019s \u201csubjective . . . evaluation of what the offer was for\u201d was not relevant; rather, it was a question for the triers of fact to decide. Given the viability of an accord and satisfaction defense at that juncture, the judge overruled the objection.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We review for prejudicial error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>431 Mass. 168, 173 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u201cA judge\u2019s decision that evidence is relevant and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>probative value of relevant evidence is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect will be upheld on appeal absent palpable error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMonte, </em>427 Mass. 243, 243-244 (1998). From his opening statement, the defendant manifested an intent to portray the letters as attempts to negotiate a lawful accord and satisfaction. To the extent that any accord and satisfaction requires a \u201cmeeting of the minds,\u201d the victim\u2019s interpretation of the defendant\u2019s intention is relevant. Although the sheer weight of subsequently admitted evidence would ultimately undermine the accord and satisfaction defense, the theory was very much a live issue at the time the victim testified.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Given this context, the challenged testimony was probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In addition to the statements\u2019 probative value, our conclusion is bolstered by its limited prejudicial effect, if any. First, the victim\u2019s opinion was hardly the only evidence proffered against the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prater, </em>431 Mass. 86, 94 (2000). The jury saw the most compelling evidence, i.e., the letters, and were free to draw their own inferences regarding the drafter\u2019s intent. Second, to the extent the parties maintained an affectionate relationship for several years, the victim\u2019s understanding of the defendant\u2019s expressions and use of language is similar to evidence properly admitted in other cases.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>425 Mass. 685, 687 &amp; n.5 (1997) (witness testified that \u201ccap him\u201d meant to fire pistol or shoot); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Strahan, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 928, 929 (1995) (ship\u2019s mate \u201ctook the defendant\u2019s remarks as a threat to sink the boat\u201d). Third, the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument diluted whatever impact the challenged testimony may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>have had. Not only was there no reference to the victim\u2019s opinion, but the Commonwealth conceded that \u201c[the letters] are not susceptible to any interpretation by a witness on the stand. You will read them and you will understand what they mean. . . . And it doesn\u2019t matter whether [the victim] said she took him seriously about giving her the money.\u201d Where, as here, the probative value of contested evidence outweighs any prejudicial effect, its admission is not error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smiley, </em>431 Mass. 477, 484 (2000), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">4. <em>Violation of Protective Order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">a. <em>Due process. </em>The defendant challenges the convictions for violating the c. 209A protective order on the ground that he was deprived of his constitutional right to a meaningful opportunity to be heard in opposition. Because of his incarceration, the defendant claims he was afforded neither adequate notice nor a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the extension of the underlying temporary no-contact order. Given our holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>425 Mass. 587, 590-593 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1058 (1998), we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">On March 27, 1996, the defendant was arrested, taken into custody, and held at the Nashua Street jail. Two days later, the victim applied for a temporary protective order against the defendant. Consistent with G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 4, the judge granted the victim\u2019s application on an ex parte basis. On April 3, 1996, the jail\u2019s chief investigating officer served the temporary order on the defendant at the jail. See G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As apparent from its face, the order was scheduled to expire on April 12, 1996, pending a hearing (fixed on the expiration date) on the order\u2019s extension. As a result of his incarceration, the defendant did not appear at the hearing and was unaware of the judge\u2019s decision to extend the order. Shortly thereafter, on or about April 17, the defendant commenced his letter-writing campaign, which continued through July 31, in violation of the terms of the order. On November 21, 1996, the defendant was finally served with the extended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">\u201cIt is clear that \u2018[d]ue process requires that no [extended] order be issued against a person without prior notice and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>opportunity to be heard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, supra </em>at 591 n.7, quoting Commentary to \u00a7 5:05 of the Guidelines for Judicial Practice: Abuse Prevention Proceedings (Oct. 1996). There, we concluded that \u201cservice of the extended order on the defendant was not a prerequisite to his prosecution for violating the terms of the order,\u201d where the initial \u201cex parte order informed the defendant that an extended order may be entered against him if he did not appear at the hearing.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, supra </em>at 591, 592. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bachir, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 204, 210-211 (1998). Similarly, in the case at bar, the defendant admits he received the initial order that stated: \u201cThe Defendant may appear [at the scheduled hearing], with or without attorney, to oppose any <em>extension </em>or modification of this Order. If the Defendant does not appear, the Order may be <em>extended </em>or modified as determined by the Judge.\u201d (Emphases added.) It is thus clear from the face of the order that extension beyond the fourteen day period was a very real possibility of which the defendant was forewarned. See G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 4 (\u201cIf the defendant does not appear at such subsequent hearing, the temporary orders <em>shall continue in effect without further order of the </em>court\u201d [emphasis added]). \u201cThis information was certainly sufficient to put the defendant on notice, for \u2018[n]otice of facts which would incite a person of reasonable prudence to an inquiry under similar circumstances is notice of all the facts which a reasonably diligent inquiry would develop.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, supra </em>at 592, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olivo, </em>369 Mass. 62, 69 (1975). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Munafo, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 597, 601-602 (1998). In these circumstances, personal service of the extended order was not required. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olivo, supra </em>at 69-71 (although defendants could not read English, service of official order sufficient to put reasonable person on notice that inquiry is required and party\u2019s \u201cdisability\u201d did not render them incapable of understanding need for such inquiry). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bachir, supra </em>at 211 (father abducted child after issuance of extended order).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The defendant\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, supra </em>(service left at defendant\u2019s last and usual place of abode) because of his incarceration is unpersuasive. Nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>in the record hints that the defendant desired, or made any effort, to attend or to reschedule the hearing. We are particularly mindful of the fact that he was familiar with the process and represented by counsel at all pertinent times. See <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>415 Mass. 278, 287 (1993); <em>Ruml </em>v. <em>Ruml, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 500, 507 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Munafo, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 597, 601 (1998). Moreover, as exhibited by his letters, the defendant did not hesitate to draft correspondence regarding his legal predicament. Had he notified the court of his interest in attending the extension hearing, the means of doing so, i.e., requesting a writ of habeas corpus from the appropriate law enforcement authorities, was readily available.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>429 Mass. 866, 867 &amp; n.2 (1999). Following the hearing date, the defendant did nothing to seek rehearing or reconsideration in light of his alleged inability to attend the originally scheduled hearing. Collectively, these factors suggest that the defendant received notice and had an opportunity to be heard. His choice to ignore the hearing will not exempt him from the extended order issued at that hearing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chartier, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 758, 765 (1997).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">b. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>\u201cTo establish a violation of G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 7, the Commonwealth must prove that (1) a valid c. 209A order was entered by a judge and was in effect on the date of the alleged violation; (2) the defendant violated the order; and (3) the defendant had knowledge of the order.\u201d <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>431 Mass. 401, 403 (2000). The defendant claims that the judge erred in denying his motion for required findings of not guilty because the third element was not supported by sufficient evidence. Service of the initial order placed the defendant on constructive, if not actual, notice of the order\u2019s existence and its terms. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crimmins, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 489, 491 (1999), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collier, </em>427 Mass. 385, 388 (1998). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Molloy, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 306, 308-309 (1998) (defendant not served with annual extension order pursuant to G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 7). We are satisfied that a rational trier of fact could find the \u201cknowledge\u201d element proven beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no need to disturb the judge\u2019s ruling on this matter. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, supra </em>at 404-405.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The defendant asked the victim to inform the court that her bruise resulted from a medical condition, rather than from physical contact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Although unrelated, the abuse was inflicted upon the same victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\">At trial, the Commonwealth produced \u201cten individual letters and then three separate packets of letters\u201d totaling between fifty and sixty letters in all.

It\u2019s not against the law. In fact there is [an accord and satisfaction] statute in this Commonwealth that authorizes that, that says you can offer money, that you can offer a promise to settle a criminal case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">It is not clear whether the accord and satisfaction theory was offered as an affirmative defense (that the Commonwealth would Have to disprove) or as an alternative explanation for conduct that might negate one of the elements of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, i.e., that the defendant <em>wilfully </em>endeavored to influence the witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Given that, according to the text of his letters, the defendant was in contact with his attorney at all relevant times, we are unpersuaded by the suggestion that he simply misunderstood the procedural mechanics of an accord and satisfaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b177-8\">For instance, after one instance of abuse, the victim telephoned the police and the defendant said, \u201cLook how those guys did you, why did you get in that van?\u201d Familiar with the defendant\u2019s \u201ctrying to play his role,\u201d the victim realized that the defendant \u201cwas making a lie for me\u201d to relate to the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b177-9\">This question was asked only with regard to one of the letters.

See P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 7.3.1, at 372 (7th ed. 1999 &amp; Supp. 2001) (discussing admissibility of opinions bearing on \u201cultimate issues\u201d). The judge did, however, instruct the jury to \u201cgive the testimony of each witness whatever degree of belief and importance that you judge it is fairly entitled to receive.\u201d Because the statement itself was of minimal import, any related instruction would be of little assistance, as well. Thus, the absence of any curative instruction was not error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\">On both direct and cross-examination, the witness recounted other familiar expressions used by the defendant and her interpretation of what they meant.
