See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111; Mass. R. Civ. P. 64 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1403 (1996). The dispositive question is whether G. L. c. 93B, entitled \u201cRegulation of Business Practices Between Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, Distributors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>and Dealers,\u201d applies to the business operations of the defendant James A. Ford, Jr. (Ford). Those business operations involve the sales of two lines of products furnished by Deere to Ford that consist, for the most part, of lawn care and ground maintenance equipment. We conclude that G. L. c. 93B is not applicable to Ford\u2019s business operations arising out of his agreements with Deere, and consequently, answer the dispositive question, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The background of the case is as follows. Deere is in the business of manufacturing lawn, garden, and ground maintenance equipment for both residential and commercial use. In 1992, Ford (doing business under the names of Sanda Equipment Corporation and Sanda Equipment Sales), negotiated with Deere to open a Deere dealership in Wilmington. The parties executed two agreements, one that authorized Ford to sell Deere\u2019s lawn and garden line of products (Lawn and Garden Dealer Agreement), and another that authorized him to sell Deere\u2019s commercial product line (Commercial Products Dealer Agreement). (We shall refer to both agreements as \u201cdealer agreements.\u201d) Under the dealer agreements, Deere was to provide its products to Ford on credit, and Ford was to pay for Deere\u2019s services and promotion. Ford and his wife, Aurora A. Ford, signed personal guaranties of the dealership\u2019s obligations. (Aurora Ford is a defendant by reason of her guaranty).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The product line available to Ford under the Lawn and Garden Dealer Agreement consisted of trimmers, brush cutters, chippers, hedge clippers, leaf shredders, lawnmowers, edgers, snowblowers, and lawn and garden tractors. None of the tractors or lawnmowers was capable of speeds in excess of twelve miles an hour. The product line available to Ford under the Commercial Products Dealer Agreement consisted of mowers, utility tractors, utility vehicles, and skid steer loaders. Of these products, four tractor models and two utility vehicle models were capable of speeds in excess of twelve miles an hour (the maximum speed being 15.6 miles an hour). Deere did not file a copy of either dealer agreement with the Attorney General as called for by G. L. c. 93B, for agreements covered by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">By August, 1993, Ford was in arrears on his payments to Deere, and, in early 1994, Deere placed him on credit restriction. In the fall of 1994, Ford was the successful bidder on a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>to lease Deere equipment to the city of Lowell. Under the dealer agreements, the usual form used to complete the transaction would have been a leasing arrangement in which Deere Credit, Inc., would purchase the equipment and then lease it to the customer. Lowell would not accept such an arrangement. In spite of the credit restriction that had been placed on Ford\u2019s dealership, Deere agreed to finance the transaction. In return, Ford gave Deere a promissory note, accompanied by a security agreement, the terms of which differed from the terms of the dealer agreements. Included in the equipment leased to Lowell were two Deere tractors, which the city registered with the Registry of Motor Vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In August, 1996, Ford was still in arrears on both the amounts owed under the dealer agreements and the amounts owed under the equipment loan for the Lowell transaction. Deere subsequently terminated the dealer agreements and, pursuant to an order entered by a judge in the Superior Court, repossessed certain equipment from Ford\u2019s dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Deere sued to recover money owed on the dealer agreements and on the promissory note for the equipment loan. Deere also invoked the defendants\u2019 personal guaranties. The defendants asserted that the dealer agreements, note, and guaranties were unenforceable under G. L. c. 93B, and they filed counterclaims against Deere for alleged violations of the statute. Deere moved for summary judgment on its claims, and in its favor on the defendants\u2019 counterclaims, on the ground that G. L. c. 93B did not govern the parties\u2019 relationship. The judge denied Deere\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all of its claims and on the defendants\u2019 G. L. c. 93B counterclaims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The judge, in her memorandum of decision, reasoned that, although G. L. c. 93B was enacted to remedy specific abuses in the automotive industry, the statute\u2019s broad definitions appeared to extend its reach to other types of dealerships, if the dealerships involved the sale of \u201cmotor vehicles.\u201d See G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 2. Critical to the applicability of G. L. c. 93B, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>determined, is the statute\u2019s definition of \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge recognized that this court, in <em>Hein-Werner Corp. </em>v. <em>Jackson Indus., Inc., </em>364 Mass. 523 (1974) <em>(Hein-Werner), </em>had broadly interpreted G. L. c. 93B to regulate transactions by any party whose contract with a supplier gave it the \u201cpower to accept orders\u201d for vehicles that constitute \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> without regard to whether the vehicles were to be used in a way that would require their registration under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 9 (that is, to be operated on a public \u201cway\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ). The decision in <em>Hein-Werner, supra, </em>according to the judge, compelled a legal conclusion that \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d under G. L. c. 93B included all vehicles capable of speeds in excess of twelve miles an hour, and, because six models of Deere vehicles available through the dealer agreements had that capability, they were \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d for purposes of G. L. c. 93B (even though most of them will never be used in a fashion that would trigger any requirement that they be registered).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The judge determined, therefore, that the statutory requirements of G. L. c. 93B applied to the dealer agreements between Deere and Ford, and Deere\u2019s failure to file the agreements with the Attorney General, as required by G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 8, rendered them null and void under G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 13. The judge concluded that, in the absence of a valid contract, Deere could not pursue its contract claims against the defendants, but that the defendants could assert claims against Deere for violations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>of G. L. c. 93B. The judge summarized the predicament facing her in these words: \u201cAs implausible as it seems that a manufacturer and dealer in such things as leaf shredders, trimmers, lawn mowers and snowblowers would have their relationship governed by a law designed for the specific problems in the automobile industry, the statute has been interpreted by the Supreme Judicial Court [in <em>Hein-Werner] </em>in a fashion that leaves this court with no choice but to apply G. L. c. 93B to the [agreements in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The judge granted Deere leave to amend its complaint to plead claims based on quantum meruit to recover for the products and services provided to Ford. Recognizing that the need for, and content of, any trial rested principally on the decision that G. L. c. 93B applied,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the judge sought a definitive appellate ruling on the applicability of G. L. c. 93B. We granted Deere\u2019s application for direct appellate review.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">1. General Laws c. 93B applies broadly to business practices concerning \u201cmotor vehicle[s],\u201d G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 2, and regulates \u201call written or oral agreements between a manufacturer, wholesaler or distributor with a motor vehicle dealer.\u201d G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 8. The statute defines a \u2018\u2018[m]anufacturer\u2019\u2019 as \u201cany person engaged in the business of manufacturing or assembling new and unused motor vehicles\u201d; a \u201c[mjotor vehicle dealer\u201d as \u201cany person who, in the ordinary course of business, is engaged in the business of selling new or used motor vehicles to consumers or other end users\u201d; and a \u201c[distributor\u201d as \u201cany person who sells or distributes new or used motor vehicles to motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>vehicle dealers.\u201d G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 1 <em>(b), (g), </em>and <em>(h). </em>As the judge correctly observed, the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d is the key to the statute, and the critical factor in its applicability to this case is whether the business relationship between Deere and Ford involved the sale of \u201cmotor vehicles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The statute defines \u201c[mjotor vehicle,\u201d somewhat ambiguously, as \u201cany motor driven vehicle required to be registered under chapter ninety.\u201d G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 1 (a). The ambiguity stems from the fact that G. L. c. 90 requires, with certain exceptions,* ******<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the registration of any motor vehicle that is \u201coperated, pushed, drawn or towed upon or [permitted] to remain upon any way.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 9. \u201cNo motor vehicles are required by the terms, of c. 90 to be registered simply by virtue of their status as such. Instead, c. 90 prohibits certain uses unless the motor vehicle is registered. From this it can be argued that there are no \u2018motor vehicles\u2019 within the meaning of e. 93B. It would follow from this that there are no \u2018manufacturers\u2019 or \u2018motor vehicle dealers\u2019 within the meaning of c. 93B, \u00a7\u00a7 <em>1(b) </em>and 1 <em>(h), </em>respectively. Such a construction would effectively nullify the entire chapter and thus is not to be favored.\u201d <em>Hein-Werner, supra </em>at 526-527, and cases cited. In order to provide a workable definition of the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as used in G. L. c. 93B, and to avoid a construction (based on a vehicle\u2019s possible future use) that could render the statute impractical to administer, the court went on in <em>Hein-Werner </em>to hold that \u201cthe term \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 as used in [G. L.] c. 93B, \u00a7 1 <em>(a), </em>and wherever that term otherwise appear[s] in that chapter, is defined as shown in [G. L.] c. 90, \u00a7 1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The defendants take the definition literally and claim that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>motor driven vehicle that is capable of traveling over twelve miles an hour, no matter how used, is a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under G. L. c. 93B. They conclude that, because the dealer agreements authorized Ford to sell models of Deere tractors and utility vehicles that could achieve speeds in excess of twelve miles an hour, the vehicles constitute \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d under G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 1, and the dealer agreements, and the debt instruments, evidenced by the promissory note and the guaranties, fall within the ambit of G. L. c. 93B. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The Legislature never intended the applicability of G. L. c. 93B to hinge on the ability of a vehicle or vehicles to travel in excess of twelve miles an hour. The <em>Hein-Werner </em>case acknowledged as much. While recognizing that its interpretation of \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d could extend the coverage of G. L. c. 93B beyond the common understanding of the word \u201cautomobiles,\u201d the court stressed that the statute\u2019s applicability should be limited to \u201cthe common usage of that term [motor vehicles].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 529. Thus, the court stated that, \u201c[b]eyond doubt, [the] definition [adopted in the decision] includes only the vehicles which are designed for regular use in the transportation of persons and property on the traveled part of public highways.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>See <em>Arbella Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Vynorious, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 121, 124 (1993) (\u201cSnowmobiles, being vehicles not designed for regular use on public highways, do not fall within that definition [of \u2018motor vehicles\u2019 found in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1]\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The court\u2019s observation in <em>Hein-Werner, supra </em>at 529, limit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>ing the application of G. L. c. 93B to motor vehicles as they are commonly understood and used, intuitively tells us that mechanical implements and motorized products intended to care for lawns and yards and to perform landscaping and garden functions are not \u201cmotor vehicles . . . designed for regular use in the transportation of persons and property on the traveled part of public highways.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That this intuitive conclusion is correct is confirmed by reference to two other sources of clarification that dispel the residual ambiguity that lingers about the scope of G. L. c. 93B. These sources are the legislative background of G. L. c. 93B, and the Legislature\u2019s passage in 1996 of G. L. c. 93G, a statute that squarely applies to the types of business arrangements in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The Massachusetts automotive industry was the subject matter of the Report of the Legislative Research Council Relative to Regulation of the Automotive Industry, 1968 Senate Doc. No. 983 (Senate report). Specifically, the council reviewed a bill, 1967 House Doc. No. 2303, which proposed the creation of a board of registration for the licensing of manufacturers, dealers, and repairmen of motor vehicles, to remedy the unfair bargaining position that automobile manufacturers, because of their concentrated economic power, had over local franchised new dealers. In responding to the asserted need for greater regulation of the automotive industry, the Senate report speaks strictly in terms of \u201cautomobiles,\u201d \u201ccar dealers,\u201d and \u201cautomobile manufacturers and distributers.\u201d Although the proposed bill was not enacted, it is clear that G. L. c. 93B, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>inserted by St. 1970, c. 814, \u00a7 1, codified many of the concerns outlined in the Senate report. See <em>Tober Foreign Motors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Reiter Oldsmobile, Inc., </em>376 Mass. 313, 319 (1978) (G. L. c. 93B responded to \u201clong-recognized problems including that of the coercion of dealers by automobile manufacturers through such means as the cutting off or purposeful manipulation of the supply of cars\u201d). There is nothing in the report to suggest even remotely that G. L. c. 93B was intended to regulate business relations between a manufacturer of outdoor power equipment, such as Deere, and a dealer in lawn and garden equipment, such as Ford. See Brown, A Bill of Rights for Auto Dealers, 12 B.C. Indus. &amp; Com. L. Rev. 757, 760-776 (1971) (describing specific problems in the automotive industry addressed by G. L. c. 93B, all dealing with potentially oppressive power of automobile manufacturers and distributors in relation to affiliated dealers).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Further, by the enactment of G. L. c. 93G, inserted by St. 1996, c. 265, entitled \u201cEquipment Dealers,\u201d the Legislature regulated business relationships between manufacturers and dealers like Deere and Ford. Under G. L. c. 93G, \u00a7 1, a \u201c[d]caler\u201d is defined as a \u201cperson, corporation or partnership primarily engaged in the business of retail sales of farm and utility tractors, forestry equipment, light industrial equipment, farm implements, farm machinery, yard and garden equipment, attachments, accessories and repair parts.\u201d \u201cInventory\u201d is defined as \u201cfarm, utility, forestry, or fight industrial equipment, implements, machinery, yard and garden equipment, attachments or repair parts,\u201d and the term describes precisely what Ford was entitled to sell under the dealer agreements.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is evident that, had the Legislature intended that G. L. c. 93B apply to relationships such as the one between Deere and Ford, there would have been no need to enact G. L. c. 93G.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Habeeb </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Quincy, </em>389 Mass. 634, 639 (1983), quoting <em>Insurance Rating Bd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>356 Mass. 184, 189 (1969) (\u201cAn intention to enact a barren and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>ineffective provision is not lightly to be imputed to the Legislature\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Conversely, if the Legislature had intended the enactment of G. L. c. 93G to effect a substantive change in the scope and applicability of G. L. c. 93B, it would not have done so without comment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>382 Mass. 580, 585-586 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">2. The first reported question \u2014 whether G. L. c. 93B is applicable to the business arrangements between Deere and the defendants \u2014 is answered, \u201cNo.\u201d In view of this answer, there is no need to answer the other two reported questions. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b243-8\">The defendants also asserted counterclaims alleging misrepresentation, invasion of privacy, interference with contractual relations, breach of contract, and violations of G. L. c. 93A. The judge granted summary judgment as to these claims in Deere\u2019s favor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The statute defines \u201c[mjotor vehicle\u201d as \u201cany motor driven vehicle required to be registered under chapter ninety.\u201d G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 1 <em>(a).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b244-7\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 1, defines \u201c[mjotor vehicles,\u201d in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">'\u201c[Ajll vehicles constructed and designed for propulsion by power other than muscular power . . . except . . . vehicles used for other purposes than the transportation of property and incapable of being driven at a speed exceeding twelve miles per hour and which are used exclusively for the building, repair and maintenance of highways or designed especially for use elsewhere than on the travelled part of ways.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The definition also includes certain other exceptions that are not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b244-10\">Chapter 90, \u00a7 1, defines a \u201c[wjay\u201d to be \u201cany public highway, private way laid out under authority of statute, way dedicated to public use, or way under the control of park commissioners or body having like powers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The judge determined that, if G. L. c. 93B is not applicable, Deere would be entitled to summary judgment on its contract claims (needing only an assessment of damages based on a calculation of the amounts still owing), as well as summary judgment in its favor on all of the defendants\u2019 counterclaims alleging violation of G. L. c. 93B. The disallowance of the G. L. c. 93B counterclaims, however, would resurrect the defendants\u2019 counterclaims of breach of contract and violations of G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\">In addition to the question of the applicability of G. L. c. 93B, the judge also reported the following subsidiary questions, to be considered in the event that G. L. c. 93B was determined to govern the parties\u2019 relationship: (1) whether Deere may pursue the alternative remedy of quantum meruit; (2) whether G. L. c. 93B renders the defendants\u2019 personal guaranties unenforceable; (3) whether G. L. c. 93B renders the promissory note for the equipment loan unenforceable. In view of our conclusion that G. L. c. 93B does not apply, we need not address these subsidiary questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Exceptions to the registration requirement are allowed for (1) out of State vehicles; (2) short distance use of a tractor, trailer, or truck used exclusively for agricultural purposes; (3) short distance use of a tractor, trailer or truck used for industrial purposes between two properties of the vehicle\u2019s owner; (4) unloading and short distance delivery to a dealer; (5) golf carts used solely for the purpose of traveling between parts of a golf course property; (6) short distance use of motor vehicles owned by a cemetery; and (7) certain short distance uses of earth-moving vehicles.

This court made abundantly clear its intent to establish a clear standard to be applied by future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>courts interpreting G.

Certain models of vehicles included in the dealer agreements came equipped with headlights and rear backup lights, and accessory turn signal kits were available for a limited number, which permitted their adaptation for use on public roads. This fact does not affect our conclusion that tractors and utility work vehicles designed for landscaping and garden purposes are not \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 93B, and that the enterprise conducted by Ford was not a business intended to be regulated by G. L. c. 93B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The statute provides, however, that \u201cinventory shall not include heavy construction equipment.\u201d G.
