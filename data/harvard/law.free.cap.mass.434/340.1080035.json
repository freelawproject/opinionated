L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2rather than the \u201cfloating\u201d rate, pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6I<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; and (2) specifying that the interest on the awarded amount shall be compounded quarterly. Because imposition of the twelve per cent rate contravenes the existing statutory scheme, the commission\u2019s interest computation constitutes an abuse of discretion. We hold that interest on the underlying judgment is subject to the floating rate. On remand for recalculation, the award may, however, be compounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>This appeal arises out of two commission decisions involving the same two parties: the Commonwealth and the Massachusetts Nurses Association (Association). In each case, the commission issued remedial orders against the Commonwealth. Neither the ruling nor the underlying remedy, an award of back pay to a group of nurses formerly employed by the Department of Social Services (department), is contested. The sole matter before us is the computation of interest due on the money damages component of that remedy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">As the Secretary concedes, the underlying facts before the commission are not relevant to our review. For the purposes of providing context, we briefly note the following. The two cases involved the unlawful termination of union nurses. In one case, the commission concluded that the department unlawfully retali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>ated against the nurses for exercising their statutorily protected collective bargaining rights, pursuant to G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 2, when it transferred bargaining unit work to nonbargaining unit personnel without first giving the Association notice and an opportunity to bargain. To remedy these wrongs the commission ordered the Commonwealth to (1) cease and desist from these activities; and (2) take affirmative action by (a) reinstating the laid-off nurses; (b) restoring all nurse duties to'the Association\u2019s bargaining unit; and (c) \u201c[make] whole the nurses who were laid off. . . for any losses that they have suffered as a result of the Commonwealth\u2019s unlawful actions, <em>plus all interest on all sums due calculated in the manner specified in </em>Everett School Committee, <em>10 MLC 1609 (1984)\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). The commission\u2019s order in the <em>Everett Sch. Comm. </em>case called for interest to be paid at a rate of twelve per cent pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In the second case, the commission issued a similar remedial order, including a cease and desist directive. The order further required that the petitioning nurses be hired into newly created positions, and that the department \u201c[make the two nurses] whole for any loss of wages and benefits suffered as a result of the Commonwealth\u2019s unlawful refusal to hire them, <em>plus interest on any sums owed at the rate specified in M.G.L. c. 231, Section 6B, compounded </em>quarterly\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Secretary appealed, on the ground that the commission\u2019s orders regarding the rate and compounding of interest constituted an abuse of discretion. We transferred the consolidated cases to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">2. <em>Rate of interest. </em>Pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), the commission\u2019s rulings may be set aside or modified if they are issued \u201c[i]n excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>the agency\u201d; \u201c[b]ased upon an error of law\u201d; or \u201c[arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d See <em>Therrien </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>390 Mass. 644, 648 (1983). Our review focuses on whether the floating interest rate set forth in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6I, supplanted the twelve per cent rate set forth in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, which, according to the commission, had been incorporated regularly into its remedial orders issued since the commission first adopted it in 1984. See <em>Everett Sch. Comm., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">In order to remedy a prohibited labor practice, G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11, authorizes the commission to issue \u201can order requiring [the charged party] to cease and desist from such prohibited practice, and [to] take such further affirmative action as will comply with the provisions of this section.\u201d With this statutory enactment, the Legislature bestowed \u201cconsiderable remedial discretion\u201d on the commission. See <em>Therrien </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, supra. </em>See also <em>Leahy </em>v. <em>Local 1526, Am. Fed\u2019n of State, County, &amp; Mun. Employees, </em>399 Mass. 341, 354 (1987) (awarding interest to make plaintiff whole for damages caused by union\u2019s breach).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In <em>School Comm. of Newton </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>388 Mass. 557, 579 (1983), this court reviewed the allowance of interest on back pay awarded to the victims of unfair labor practices. There, the commission ordered the school committee to pay \u201cinterest at the rate of seven percent (7%) per annum, compounded quarterly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Weighing related provisions from the Federal statutory scheme, and mindful that G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11, is broad and delegates \u201cconsiderable discretion to the commission in fashioning an appropriate remedy,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 580, we held \u201c[t]he decision to award interest was within the^commission\u2019s authority . . . and is consistent with Federal practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">On the heels of that opinion, the commission decided <em>Everett Sch. Comm., </em>10 M.L.C. 1609 (1984). After noting its \u201cdiscretion to fix any interest rate necessary to remedy the violations of [G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10],\u201d the commission concluded that \u201cthe public interest is best served by application of the same interest rate which the General Court has judged appropriate for tort claims. Accordingly, [the commission] adopt[ed] the interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>rate specified in [G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B,] as the rate of interest [i.e., twelve per cent per annum] applicable to monetary remedies awarded by the [commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1613. Since then, the commission has repeatedly fixed interest awards at the twelve per cent rate as set forth in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B. See <em>City of Lawrence, </em>26 M.L.C. 29, 30 (1999); <em>Town of Falmouth, </em>25 M.L.C. 24, 26 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Prior to 1993, judgments against the Commonwealth accrued prejudgment interest at the rate of twelve per cent per annum. See <em>Sutton Corp. </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>423 Mass. 200, 213 (1996). In 1993, the Legislature altered the statutory framework governing the imposition of interest on judgments against the Commonwealth. Specifically, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C (governing contracts actions), was amended by St. 1993, c. 110, \u00a7 224,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and \u00a7 6I was inserted by St. 1993, c. 110 \u00a7 225. \u201cPassed as outside sections of an appropriations bill such interest is now calculated by reference to the coupon issue yield equivalent of the price for United States treasury bills, capped at ten per cent.\u201d <em>Sutton Corp. </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, supra </em>(upholding award of twelve per cent interest ordered before 1993 amendment became effective).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Notwithstanding the deference due to the commission and its longstanding practice, we find that application of the twelve per cent interest rate set forth in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, constituted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>error of law in light of the enactment of \u00a7 61. While the commission retains discretion to fashion appropriate remedies, extending the statute\u2019s twelve per cent interest rate to judgments against the Commonwealth is incorrect both as a matter of statutory interpretation and as a matter of public policy. First, \u00a7 6B speaks to tort actions in general, but makes no explicit reference to suits involving the Commonwealth.* *<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Contrast G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 6C, 61. See Note, Postjudgment Interest in Contract Actions, 4 Suffolk U. J. Trial &amp; Appellate Advoc. 95, 109 (1999). Next, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, governs interest added to damages in tort actions',\u2019 yet the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2, explicitly prohibits the imposition of prejudgment interest in tort suits brought against the Commonwealth. See <em>Onofrio </em>v. <em>Department of Mental Health, </em>411 Mass. 657, 658-659 (1992); <em>Dinsdale </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 926, 927 (1995). Moreover, the \u201cinjuries\u201d sustained by the nurses are quite different from the \u201cpersonal injuries [,] .. . . consequential damages, or [property] damage\u201d enumerated in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B. See 1 G. Mottla, Proof of Cases in Massachusetts \u00a7 14.37 (3d ed. 1992) (mapping scope of statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">In contrast, the language of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6I, lends itself more readily to the award under review. As the language of the statute makes clear, the floating rate is addressed to interest the Commonwealth is required to pay. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6I (\u201cInterest required to be paid by the commonwealth . . .\u201d). The statute does not limit the circumstances of such interest.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The delineated formula mirrors a nearly identical provision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>the eminent domain statute, G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that was also added by the Legislature in 1993. See St. 1993, c. 110, \u00a7 137. That the Legislature imposed the floating interest rate against the Commonwealth in two unrelated statutes, at roughly the same time, reveals its intention to establish a uniform interest rate on all payments the Commonwealth must make, regardless of type. Moreover, the continued efficacy of the floating interest rate is bolstered by its direct incorporation into subsequently enacted legislation such as G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 16 <em>(c), </em>inserted by St. 1998, c. 395, \u00a7 2 (requiring return of clean election funds \u201cwith interest ... at the rate computed as specified in section 61 of chapter 231\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">As formulated by the Legislature, the floating interest rate is tailored to fulfil the public policy goals underlying interest awards. \u201cInterest is awarded by law so that a person wrongfully deprived of the use of money should be made whole for his loss.\u201d <em>Perkins Sch. for the Blind </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>383 Mass. 825, 835 (1981). See <em>Milwaukee </em>v. <em>Cement Div., Nat\u2019l Gypsum Co., </em>515 U.S. 189, 196-197 (1995). \u201cThe damaged party is entitled to a return on the money that the party would have had but for the other party\u2019s wrongdoing. [However, t]o give the damaged party more than that would go beyond the purpose of the statute. The purpose behind the prejudgment interest statute is not to penalize the wrongdoer . . . .\u201d <em>McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. 704, 717 (1990). See <em>Mirageas </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>391 Mass. 815, 820-821 (1984). Given fluctuating economic conditions, adherence to what may be, and in this decade has been, a significantly above-market interest rate, i.e., a flat twelve per cent rate, would result in a windfall for the nurses in this case. See <em>Brayman </em>v. <em>99 West, Inc., </em>116 F. Supp. 2d 225, 236 (D. Mass. 2000). Calculating the interest award pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>floating rate, however, yields a figure more akin to the nurses\u2019 actual losses. See <em>Boston Children\u2019s Heart Found., Inc. </em>v. <em>Nadal-Ginard, </em>73 F.3d 429, 442 (1st Cir. 1996) (where application of statutory rate would result in windfall, imposing interest rate tied to United States Treasury bill rates did not prejudice either party).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Although the Legislature\u2019s decision to maintain the twelve per cent rate in certain contexts (e.g., tort judgments against private parties) despite fluctuating conditions<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is undoubtedly its prerogative, the commission\u2019s adherence to the twelve per cent interest rate in this case would make the nurses \u201cmore than whole,\u201d run contrary to the policy underlying interest awards, come at the expense of the taxpayers and, most importantly, in light of the post-1993 statutory scheme, constitute an error of law. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 234, 245-246 (1995). We thus conclude that the commission abused its discretion by adhering to the twelve per cent per annum rate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">3. <em>Compounding interest. </em>The commission acted within its discretion, however, in ordering \u201cquarterly compounding\u201d of the awarded interest. Although this court has expressed an \u201cancient unwillingness to allow compound interest,\u201d <em>Lewin </em>v. <em>Folsom, </em>171 Mass. 188, 192 (1898), we recognize that compound interest awards may be an appropriate component to remedial orders pursuant to G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11, in certain cases. See <em>School Comm. of Newton </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 579 (seven per cent per annum compounded quarterly). See generally <em>Sarrouf </em>v. <em>New England Patriots Football Club, Inc., </em>397 Mass. 542, 551 (1986), and cases cited. Compound interest has been integrated into commission awards for nearly twenty-five years. See <em>Town of Townsend, </em>1 M.L.C. 1450, 1459 (1975); <em>Commonwealth of Mass., </em>8 M.L.C. 1287, 1291 (1981). Where the Legislature has not spoken to the contrary, we respect the commission\u2019s \u201cconsiderable discretion ... in fashioning an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>appropriate remedy.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Newton </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, the commission\u2019s order is vacated and remanded for recalculation of interest. On remand, however, the awarded interest may be compounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-7\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6B, provides: \u201cIn any action in which a verdict is rendered or a finding made or an order for judgment made for pecuniary damages for personal injuries to the plaintiff or for consequential damages, or for damage to property, there shall be added by the clerk of court to the amount of damages interest thereon at the rate of <em>twelve per cent per annum </em>from the date of commencement of the action even though such interest brings the amount of the verdict or finding beyond the maximum liability imposed by law\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 61, provides, in relevant part: \u201cInterest required to be paid by the commonwealth pursuant to this section shall he calculated at a rate equal to the coupon issue yield equivalent, as determined by the United States secretary of the treasury, of the average accepted auction price for the last auction of fifty-two-week United States treasury bills settled immediately prior to the date of judgment; provided, however, that such interest shall not exceed the rate of ten per cent per annum.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b359-9\">As conceded in his brief and at oral argument, the Secretary does not \u201cpresently press [the] issue\u201d of sovereign immunity.

Absent prejudice to either party, \u201c[wjhere injustice might otherwise result, an appellate court properly may consider questions of law which were neither argued nor passed upon in a court or agency below.\u201d <em>McLeod\u2019s Case, </em>389 Mass. 431, 434 (1983). The identical parties briefed this particular issue in the companion case. Perceiving no prejudice to either side and mindful of the consistency necessary to fashion an appropriate \u201cmake whole\u201d remedy, we extend our holding to both actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6C, with the words added by the 1993 amendment in italics, reads: \u201cIn all actions based on contractual obligations, upon a verdict, finding or order for judgment for pecuniary damages, interest shall be added by the clerk of the court to the amount of damages, at the contract rate, if established, or at the rate of twelve per cent per annum from the date of the breach or demand.

Contrary to the Association\u2019s assertion in its amicus brief, we do not read G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6I, as pertaining exclusively to contract actions. If the Legislature intended that result, it presumably would have added the floating rate provision to \u00a7 6C and would not have needed to craft an entirely new section.
