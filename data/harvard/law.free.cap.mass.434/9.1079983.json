On appeal, the defendant claims that the judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty on the indictment charging him with the murder of his daughter when only a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>manslaughter charge was merited by the evidence. He also argues that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of prior violent incidents between the defendant and the child\u2019s mother occurring as long as fifteen months before their deaths, and committed reversible error by improperly instructing the jury on the issue of provocation as it applies to voluntary manslaughter with respect to the mother, and on malice aforethought with respect to both victims. Last, he asks that we exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce this conviction to manslaughter. We affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions and decline to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts as the jury could have found them, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass. 92, 93 (1997). On July 11, 1996, the police found the bodies of Amy Smith (victim) and her twenty-two month old daughter (hereinafter child or daughter) in their apartment on Dwight Street Extension in Springfield. The defendant was the child\u2019s father, but was not residing at that address. The victim\u2019s nude body was discovered in a closet, with her legs protruding. Her hands were bound to her chest, her face was covered by clothing and a stroller, and a sock was stuffed inside her mouth. An autopsy revealed that she died from asphyxia which could have been caused by strangulation due to a choke hold around her neck or suffocation due to the sock found in her mouth. The child\u2019s fully clothed body was found lying on a mattress near her mother. An autopsy determined that she had died from the combined effects of dehydration and starvation due to lack of water and food.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Sergeant Larry Brown and Detective Anthony Pioggia of the Springfield police department examined the crime scene. They found no sign of forced entry or robbery. All of the kitchen windows, which bordered the rear porch (the customary entrance to the dwelling), were locked with the shades drawn. The door <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>to the rear porch was also locked by a deadbolt from the inside. The detectives discovered, in a kitchen drawer, a copy of a protective order that prohibited the defendant from having any contact with the victim and her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Soon after the police arrived, a local television station broadcast the names of the victims and the location of the murder scene. Responding to this broadcast, Brown dispatched officers to locate the defendant, who arrived at the scene while the search was underway. The defendant approached the rear porch door, where two officers were stationed, and angrily demanded to be admitted to the apartment to see his baby. The defendant, who was with two other young men, became aggressive and pushed one of the officers guarding the porch. He was then arrested on an unrelated outstanding warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Detectives Pioggia and Raymond Muise began interviewing the defendant at the Springfield police department at approximately 7 p.m., following the defendant\u2019s signed waiver of his Miranda rights. He signed the waiver as \u201cShawn Fielding.\u201d When asked about the protective order, the defendant claimed it was directed at his twin brother Paul, who had \u201cproblems\u201d with the victim. He also told them that the outstanding warrant on which he had been arrested was really against his twin brother, who was currently in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Detective Pioggia left briefly to make inquiries about the alleged twin brother. When Pioggia returned and confronted the defendant with the fact that no such twin brother existed, the defendant admitted he did not have a twin brother, and then told the detectives that the protective order was issued against him after an incident that occurred when he and the victim lived together on Pearl Street in Springfield, prior to and shortly following their child\u2019s birth. The defendant stated that he struck the victim and that it was the only time that had happened. When asked if he could think of anyone who could have committed these crimes, the defendant mentioned a local street person. The defendant then proceeded to tell the detectives that he had last seen the victim one month before her death. When the police informed him that they had spoken to a person who could place him near the apartment a few days before her death, the defendant remembered that on July 6 he had been paged by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the victim, and had gone to her apartment to give her forty dollars for the baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The police subsequently established that the pager did not exist, and confronted the defendant with this and other inconsistencies in his story. Detective Muise testified that at approximately 10:25 p.m., the defendant \u201clowered his head, looked up at us, and said he did it; \u2018Excuse me, all right, I did it.\u2019 He said he hit her a couple of times, and then he choked her.\u201d The defendant then expressed surprise that he would be spending the rest of his life in jail for murder. Following this admission, a first written statement was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The defendant provided the details of his relationship with the victim and stated that she had obtained a protective order because \u201ca couple of times I slapped her.\u201d In addition, the defendant described his visit to her apartment on July 5, 1996, where he last saw her at about 6 p.m. According to the defendant, he was accompanied by a man named \u201cBroadway.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When they arrived at the apartment, the defendant saw that the child was naked and had fecal matter on her legs. The defendant and the victim got into an argument as he cleaned the baby and diapered her. He stated that he did not put any clothing on the child.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As he finished cleaning the baby, the victim pushed him from behind, he fell forward, and \u201c[his] face went mushing right into the shit.\u201d He was \u201creal mad\u201d and slapped her twice. According to the defendant\u2019s statement, the victim then grabbed a knife from the kitchen and swung it at him repeatedly. She cut his right wrist and right hand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He grabbed her in a head lock and \u201csqueezed her for about 2-3 minutes while she struggled with me.\u201d When he released her, she fell to the mattress and swore at him. He then left the apartment by the back door, after Broadway told him he was going to \u201cstash\u201d her. The defendant claimed that he next returned to the apartment on July 9, 1996, and knocked on her door. He could hear the television on inside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>the apartment. Two neighbors told him they had not seen the victim or her daughter for about one week.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The detectives confronted the defendant with evidence of inconsistencies in his first statement and, after being informed again of his Miranda rights, the defendant gave a second statement. In the second statement, he added that he remained in the apartment and saw \u201c \u2018Broadway\u2019 hitting [the victim] after I let her go and stopped choking her.\u201d Broadway punched her in the face and head and \u201cjust went crazy.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He then held her Ups shut, and she lapsed into unconsciousness. At this point the defendant claimed he walked outside to dispose of a soiled diaper. When he returned, he saw Broadway inserting his fingers into the victim\u2019s genitalia while fondling her breasts. She remained unresponsive. When Broadway was \u201cfinished\u201d he told the defendant he was going to \u201cstash\u201d the victim, and he dragged her to a closet and placed her inside. At this point the defendant \u201cgot real scared\u201d and left by the back door, followed by \u201cBroadway\u201d a few minutes later. The defendant was aware that he had left the child behind, but he claimed that he assumed someone would come in to get her through the unlocked back door.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The detectives, st\u00fcl beheving the defendant was not being forthcoming, took an additional statement from him that was later made an addendum to the second statement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant said he went back to the apartment on July 9 because he knew that his child was there and that her mother was dead. He knocked, but did not try to enter because he did not wish to attract the attention of the neighbors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">2. <em>Motion for a required finding of not guilty with respect to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number><em>the murder of the child. </em>In reviewing a denial of a motion for a required finding, we consider the evidence in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth to determine whether it was sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979). \u201cThe relevant question is whether the evidence would permit a jury to find guilt, not whether the evidence requires such a finding.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lydon, </em>413 Mass. 309, 312 (1992). The Commonwealth proceeded on the theory that, because the defendant intentionally abandoned his infant daughter in circumstances that he reasonably would have known would result in her death, the jury could reasonably have inferred the malice required for conviction of murder in the first degree on a theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant asserts that, because the windows facing the street were open and the door providing access from the building\u2019s common hallway was unlocked, the evidence was sufficient to prove only that he was guilty of wilful and wanton conduct amounting to involuntary manslaughter by abandoning the child without care.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The evidence at trial was sufficient to permit a jury to find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree. The defendant concedes that he left his twenty-two month old child alone with her dead or dying mother in an apartment in the July heat without care, and that he took no steps to alert anyone to the child\u2019s plight. The evidence supports a finding that the apartment door and accessible windows were locked. \u201cThe jury could have found on the . . . evidence that the baby died of starvation and dehydration resulting from the intentional conduct of the defendant in placing it [in isolation] and withholding food and liquids from it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>322 Mass. 523, 527-528 (1948).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Based on the expert testimony, the jury could also have found that, during the days the child would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>have remained conscious prior to her death, she would have experienced a very high degree of suffering. \u201c[T]he theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty does not have a requirement of specific intent. Rather, the determination whether an unlawful killing was perpetrated with extreme atrocity or cruelty \u2018focuses both on the defendant\u2019s actions, in terms of the manner and means of inflicting death, and on the resulting effect on the victim, in terms of the extent of physical injury and the degree of suffering endured.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Judge, </em>420 Mass. 433, 442 (1995), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lacy, </em>371 Mass. 363, 367 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The judge\u2019s charge to the jury on involuntary manslaughter included a careful explanation of \u201c[t]he difference between th[e] third form of malice [that a plain and strong likelihood of death would follow] and wanton and reckless conduct which would amount to involuntary manslaughter.\u201d The jury were made well aware that \u201c[a] fine fine distinguishes murder based on the third prong of malice from the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>427 Mass. 659, 669 (1998). We conclude that the evidence presented was sufficient to permit a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had, as to his child, committed murder in the first degree with extreme atrocity or cruelty.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">3. <em>Use of prior bad acts evidence. </em>At trial, over the defendant\u2019s objection, the judge admitted evidence of prior incidents of violent conduct by the defendant toward the victim, all of which had occurred within fifteen months of the murder.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant argues that this was error because the central is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>sue at trial was whether his three signed statements, and his reported oral admission that he \u201cdid it\u201d and \u201cchoked\u201d the victim, were genuine, truthful, and offered voluntarily. The defendant further argues that if motive were at all an issue, it was amply demonstrated by evidence from two witnesses that the defendant had reported a conflict with the victim at the approximate time of her death. Therefore, the defendant reasons, evidence of past physical abuse was only marginally relevant and the judge exceeded her discretion in admitting it, because it was too remote in time, unnecessarily inflammatory and its prejudicial effect greatly outweighed its materiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The evidence was properly admitted to show the defendant\u2019s state of mind, motive, intent, and relationship with the victim, all live issues at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonardi, </em>413 Mass. 757, 762-764 (1992) (admitting defendant\u2019s prior bad acts against girl friend for relevant probative purposes). The judge correctly exercised her discretion in weighing the probative value of this evidence against its prejudicial effect. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fordham, </em>417 Mass. 10, 22 (1994), and cases cited (\u201cEvidence that has relevance to issues other than bad character or criminal propensity is admissible if not outweighed by its unfair prejudice, which is a determination for the judge to make and one which we do not disturb unless, in our judgment, it is palpably wrong\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>408 Mass. 747, 751 (1990) (\u201cThe evidence of prior violence by the defendant toward the victim)] also further demonstrated to the jury the full nature of the relationship between the defendant and the victim)]\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gil, </em>393 Mass. 204, 216 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>(1984) (evidence of continuing animosity between defendant and victim spouse relevant on issue of motive to kill).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">While \u201c[t]here is no bright-line test for determining temporal remoteness of evidence of prior misconduct,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 228 n.13 (1986), the time period at issue here falls well within a range we have found acceptable. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jordan (No. 1), </em>397 Mass. 489, 492 (1986) (judge did not err in admitting evidence of beatings and mistreatment of victim by defendant from five to seven months prior to events on which indictments were based); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>376 Mass. 233, 238 (1978) (judge did not err in allowing evidence that defendant, two years earlier, had pistol-whipped another man as \u201clesson\u201d to victim).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Finally, the judge correctly gave limiting instructions both when the evidence was presented at trial and in her charge, stating that the evidence was admitted only on the issue of the defendant\u2019s state of mind and intent toward the victim, and not for its full probative value.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There was no error entitling the defendant to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">4. <em>Jury instructions. </em>The judge instructed the jury on murder in the first degree with extreme atrocity or cruelty as to both the victim and her child, and on murder in the first degree based on deliberate premeditation as to the victim alone.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The judge charged the jury on minder in the second degree as to both; on voluntary manslaughter as to the victim, and on involuntary manslaughter as to the child. The defendant alleges several er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>rors in these instructions. No objection was made at trial. Thus, we review the challenged instructions to determine whether they contain error, and if so whether there is a \u201csubstantial likelihood that a miscarriage of justice occurred.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinton, </em>432 Mass. 180, 188 (2000). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Niemic, 427 </em>Mass. 718, 720 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">a. <em>Instruction on provocation with regard to the mother\u2019s death. </em>At trial, the judge correctly determined that the evidence here required an instruction on provocation as to the mother\u2019s death. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carlino, </em>429 Mass. 692, 694 (1999). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, 427 </em>Mass. 714, 715 (1998). The defendant argues correctly that because there was evidence of provocation here, the burden was on the Commonwealth to prove the <em>absence </em>of provocation beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>430 Mass. 746, 751 (2000). The judge in the instant case correctly defined voluntary manslaughter. She then erred in assigning the burden of proof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">\u201cFor voluntary manslaughter, the prosecution must have proved the following three elements beyond a reasonable doubt: First, that Mr. Pickling inflicted an injury upon [the victim] from which she died. <em>Second, that he injured [the victim] as a result of sudden combat or in the heat of passion . . . </em>Third, that he committed the homicide or he committed the killing unlawfully, without legal justification or excuse.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">This language closely matches that which we found erroneous in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, supra </em>at 716.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>431 Mass. 782, 787 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carlino, supra </em>at 694. In effect, the judge \u201cincorrectly told the jury that malice is negated by provocation only if provocation is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The correct rule is that, where the evidence raises the possibility that the defendant may have acted on reasonable provocation, the Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>must prove, and the jury must find, beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act on reasonable provocation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, supra, </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>403 Mass. 659, 661 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Here, the judge went on to instruct correctly that \u201c[wjhere there is evidence of provocation, the prosecution has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that [the defendant] did not act in the heat of passion.\u201d Following further discussion of the required elements of voluntary manslaughter, the judge then made a point of emphasizing the correct instruction: <em>\u201cAgain, </em>the prosecution has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that [the defendant] did not act in the heat of passion or sudden provocation. <em>You may not return a verdict of guilty unless the prosecution has met this </em>burden\u201d (emphasis supplied). This is followed by a final instruction on voluntary manslaughter that repeats the original error.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The defendant argues that the potential confusion caused by these instructions entitles him to a new trial as to his conviction in the victim\u2019s death. He asserts that the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 307, 322 (1985), is controlling here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">\u201c \u2018Language that merely contradicts and does not explain a constitutionally infirm instruction will not suffice to absolve the infirmity\u2019 because \u2018[a] reviewing court has no way of knowing which of the two irreconcilable instructions the jurors applied in reaching their verdict.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-8\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Repoza, </em>400 Mass. 516, 519, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 935 (1987), quoting <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra. </em>The defendant reads the <em>Francis </em>decision too selectively. The passage relied on by the defendant is immediately preceded and qualified by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s prefatory observation that \u201c[n]othing ... in the charge as a whole makes clear to the jury that one of these contradictory instructions carries more weight than the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322. In the instant case, in contrast, the judge emphasized that \u201c[y]ou may not return a verdict of guilty of murder unless the prosecution has met this burden,\u201d that is, \u201cof proving beyond a reasonable doubt that [the defendant] did not act in the heat of passion or sudden provocation.\u201d Here we have two correct instructions on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof on provocation sandwiched between two incorrect instructions. But the two correct instructions make it clear to the jury, as <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra, </em>requires, that those instructions carry more weight than the two incorrect ones. So while the inclusion of incorrect instructions here is far from ideal, we nevertheless cannot conclude that \u201cthe center of gravity of the provocation instructions was strongly on the side of misstatement.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, supra </em>at 717. \u201cReviewing the whole charge, including the judge\u2019s emphatic and repeated statements that only the Commonwealth \u2014 and never the defendant \u2014 bore any burden, we believe that the jury could not have concluded that the judge\u2019s misstatement created an unconstitutional presumption relieving the State of its burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt pf every element of [the crime charged].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>420 Mass. 479, 490-491 (1995).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> These instructions do not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">b. <em>Instruction on malice aforethought with respect to both victims. </em>The defendant also alleges error in the judge\u2019s instructions on malice aforethought, focusing in particular on the following section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">\u201cMalice aforethought does not necessarily imply <em>ill will </em>towards the person killed. <em>Any </em>intentional killing of a human being without legal justification or excuse and with no extenuating circumstances sufficient in law to reduce the crime, for instance, to manslaughter, is malicious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>within the meaning of malice aforethought\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The defendant claims that this instruction was incorrect because it was \u201coverbroad,\u201d and \u201ccould have led the jury to conclude that any intentional act resulting in the death of another person was malicious unless extenuating circumstances were present.\u201d We are not persuaded. Immediately following the challenged portion of the instructions, the judge properly defined malice aforethought as including \u201ca <em>specific </em>intent to kill the victim or a <em>specific </em>intent to do her grievous bodily harm\u201d (emphasis supplied). The judge then goes on to define carefully \u201cspecific intent\u201d for the jurors, and uses that term no fewer than five times.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Further, the judge repeatedly emphasized that the burden was on the Commonwealth to prove each element of the crime charged, including specific intent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>417 Mass. 592, 598 (1994). This is not \u201coverbroad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">As for the use of \u201cill will\u201d language in the judge\u2019s instruction, the defendant correctly notes that we have disapproved such language since our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagles, </em>419 Mass. 825, 836 (1995), where we declared that such phrasing \u201cis not helpful and ought in the future to be omitted.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, this single use of the term \u201cill will\u201d is followed by repeated, correct definitions of malice, including the third prong relevant to murder with extreme atrocity or cruelty: \u201cmalice aforethought may also include having an unexcused intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>commit an act which creates a plain and strong likelihood that death will follow.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> While we continue to discourage the use of \u201cill will\u201d or \u201cstate of mind\u201d language, \u201cwe have said that instructions on malice that include both the three prong definition and an obsolete definition adequately convey the meaning of malice to the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>426 Mass. 395, 401 (1998), and cases cited. We conclude that there is no error in these instructions that creates a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">5. <em>G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have reviewed the entire record of the defendant\u2019s trial pursuant to G.

See <em>Simpkins </em>v. <em>State, </em>88 Md. App. 607, 617-618 (1991), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, supra. </em>See generally Annot., Homicide by Withholding Food, Clothing, or Shelter, 61 A.L.R.3d 1207 (1975). The <em>Simpkins </em>court concluded that \u201c[wjhere a young child, incapable of self-help, is knowingly, deliberately, and unnecessarily placed in confinement and left alone for up to five days without food, drink, or attention and death ensues from that lack, malice may be inferred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 620. Both the Commonwealth and the defendant acknowledge that many seemingly applicable cases from other States have limited usefulness, because of important differences in the wording of their respective malice statutes. The <em>Simpkins </em>decision, however, appears to be largely based on the common law, including our <em>Hall </em>decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Witnesses testified that in April, 1995, there was an incident in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>defendant solicited two female friends to administer a beating to the victim. The defendant watched this beating and then kicked the victim in the head as she lay bleeding on the sidewalk and screaming for her baby. In a later incident that same month, the defendant offered his cousin forty dollars to \u201cfight\u201d the victim. In October, 1995, a security guard responded to an argument between the victim and the defendant outside her apartment building. The guard observed that the victim\u2019s hands were bleeding and that she was crying. She told the guard that the defendant had hit her with a baby stroller. The defendant threatened to return later with a gun to retrieve his daughter. On July 2, 1996, shortly before the murders, the defendant asked a female relative to, \u201cGo beat that bitch\u2019s ass.\u201d On July 5, the defendant told a woman in the neighborhood that he had spent the night in jail because of an argument with the victim that resulted in her calling the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The judge stated in the final charge to the jury: \u201cLet me start by saying you heard evidence during the trial that [the defendant] may have struck or committed an assault and battery upon [the victim] some months before July 1996. You\u2019ve also heard some testimony that [the defendant] asked or encouraged other persons, other women, to beat. . . [the victim]. Bear in mind, [the defendant] is not on trial for any act or conduct other than the two charges which are before you. It\u2019s very important that you not consider this evidence, the prior beatings or the evidence respecting any request he may have made of other persons. You may not consider this evidence as proof that [the defendant] has a criminal personality or a bad character. You absolutely must not use this evidence as any proof that [the defendant] committed the offense of which he stands accused. As I instructed you earlier during this trial, and it\u2019s important that I reemphasize and that you note this point, you may consider this evidence only on the issue of [the defendant\u2019s] intent toward [the victim].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b35-9\">The jury did not convict the defendant of murder in the first degree by reason of premeditation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The case at bar was tried in 1997, prior to our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>427 Mass. 714 (1998). However, we have noted previously that the holding in <em>Acevedo </em>was stated in substantially similar terms in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>403 Mass. 659, 663 (1989). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carlino, </em>429 Mass. 692, 695 n.1 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b38-7\">We have reached different outcomes in other cases where the charge taken as a whole was not adequate on this point. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, supra </em>at 716-717 (incorrect instruction on burden of proof as to provocation in main charge, then correct instruction, followed by incorrect instruction; erroneous instruction then repeated in supplemental charge). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>433 Mass. 558, 562 n.3 (2001) (\u201c[h]ere, the pattern is an incorrect instruction, followed by a correct instruction in the main charge, followed by an incorrect instruction in the supplemental charge\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>431 Mass. 782, 787-789 (2000) (main charge, oral supplementary instruction, and written supplementary instruction all incorrect); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carlino, supra </em>at 694-695 (erroneous instruction accompanied by no correct instruction); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 169, 173 (2000) (\u201chere the one correct instruction on the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof on provocation in the judge\u2019s final instructions to the jury at the close of evidence was sandwiched between two incorrect instructions\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The judge- uses the term \u201cspecific intent\u201d once again when charging the jury on the specific elements, including malice aforethought, required to prove the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree with extreme atrocity or cruelty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b39-8\">We further explained: \u201cThe language is not helpful, for example, because it may focus the jury on the need for proof of some special animosity that the defendant harbored toward the victim, when the relevant inquiry is the defendant\u2019s intent to kill or do grievous bodily harm, or the defendant\u2019s knowledge of circumstances which would indicate to a reasonably prudent person that the conduct in question would likely cause death; or because it may lead the jury to believe that anger, hatred, revenge or a selfish, wrongful mood is enough to show malice. The term \u2018malice\u2019 should be defined by reference to the three prongs described in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, supra, </em>with such additional explanation as may be appropriate to the understanding of those concepts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagles, </em>419 Mass. 825, 836 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b40-7\">While the defendant concedes that the judge \u201cultimately restated the government\u2019s burden to prove malice and referred again to its three prongs, [he argues that] any remedial effect was undercut when she prefaced those instructions with the equivocal introduction, \u2018in this particular case, as I said, malice aforethought <em>may be considered </em>on those three \u2014 in those three separate forms\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in defendant\u2019s brief). We are not persuaded. Heard in context, we believe it would have been clear to the jury that the term \u201cmay\u201d as used by the judge here refers to the making of an appropriate choice among the three prongs of malice, and <em>not </em>to a choice as to whether malice aforethought \u201cmay\u201d constitute an element of the crime of murder, as the defendant\u2019s argument implies. In fact, the defendant omits the last portion of the challenged sentence of the judge\u2019s instructions, in which she stated that malice, regardless of the form, <em>\u201cmust </em>be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Niemic, </em>427 Mass. 718, 720 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sellon, </em>380 Mass. 220, 231-232 (1980) (\u201cIn support of his argument, the defendant \u2018parses the charge and attacks it piecemeal. We, however, must view the charge in its entirety since the adequacy of instructions must be determined in light of their overall impact on the jury\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The defendant argues that, even if this court concludes that in the circumstances of this case his abandonment of his daughter could be found to be malicious, we should exercise our authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce the degree of that guilt to manslaughter, because the jury concluded he had not acted with premeditation, and thus his behavior here is \u201cmore consistent with the evidence that he acted out of panic, fear, and ignorance than that he harbored malice.\u201d However, \u201c[e]xtreme atrocity or cruelty requires the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s actions and their effect on the victim, <em>but does not require that the defendant be aware of how shocking his actions were or how much suffering his conduct caused the victim\u201d </em>(emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Judge, supra </em>at 442, and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
