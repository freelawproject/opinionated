L. c. 58, \u00a7\u00a7 13-17, of land located in Boylston that is part of the Wachusett watershed and reservoir. The land is held by the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC), division of watershed management, for the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA). The commissioner made the valuations to determine the payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT) due to Boylston by the MWRA under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5G.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The board concluded that the land under the waters of the Wachusett reservoir should not be valued for purposes of computing PILOT and that the commissioner\u2019s valuation methodologies were properly formulated and applied. We transferred the appeal here on our own motion and now affirm the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The background of the case may be summarized as follows. As of January 1, 1990, and again as of January 1, 1995, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>commissioner undertook to value Wachusett watershed and reservoir lands held by the MDC within Boylston for purposes of computing PILOT under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5G, to reimburse Boylston for tax revenues lost as a result of the Commonwealth\u2019s ownership of watershed property. Using differing valuation methodologies, the commissioner assigned a value of $100 an acre to the land under the Wachusett reservoir in 1990 (before applying a size-based discount), and approximately $70 an acre for the land under the reservoir in 1995. The commissioner estimated the total value of the Wachusett reservoir and watershed lands held by the MDC within Boylston as $10,940,200 on January 1, 1990, and $10,610,694 as of January 1, 1995.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Boylston appealed from both valuations to the board, and the appeals were consolidated. Boylston maintained that the land beneath the Wachusett reservoir was part of the Wachusett watershed for \u00a7 5G purposes, and that the commissioner appropriately had included the submerged land in calculating the \u00a7 5G PILOT, but Boylston contended that the commissioner had substantially undervalued that land. The board determined, however, that \u201cthe land beneath the Wachusett Reservoir was not part of the Wachusett Watershed and, therefore, was not part of the \u00a7 5G PILOT program. Accordingly, the Commissioner should not have included the land beneath the Wachusett Reservoir in his valuations.\u201d Despite the commissioner\u2019s improper inclusion of values for the submerged land, the board affirmed the commissioner\u2019s net valuations because \u201csmall discrepancies\u201d with respect to the amount and type of eligible acreage \u201cmore than offset, in favor of Boylston, any difference in the total net value of the MDC-held land.\u201d This appeal by Boylston from the board\u2019s decision followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">1. Because the commissioner\u2019s valuations were made under G. L. c. 58, \u00a7\u00a7 13-17, the board, in reviewing the valuations, was \u201cperform[ing] a more traditional appellate function, rather than makfing] a de nova determination of value.\u201d <em>Assessors of Sandwich </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>393 Mass. 580, 586 (1984). In assessing the board\u2019s decision, we, therefore, do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>apply a substantial evidence test, but, instead, examine to see whether the board committed any error of law in concluding that the commissioner acted in accordance with G. L. c. 58, \u00a7\u00a7 13-17. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The first question is whether the board correctly concluded that the land under the waters of the Wachusett reservoir should be excluded for the purposes of computing PILOT to Boylston under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5G. Boylston argues that the language and legislative history of \u00a7 5G demonstrate that the board erred. The commissioner relies on the same sources, and principles of statutory construction, to argue that the board\u2019s conclusion was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The key inquiry is what land is included within the general, undefined term \u201cwatershed\u201d used in \u00a7 5G. Because \u00a7 5G does not provide a definite answer to the question, it is appropriate to consult other sources to obtain a resolution, see <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Dunstable, </em>418 Mass. 841, 843 (1994); <em>Oxford </em>v. <em>Oxford Water Co., </em>391 Mass. 581, 587-588 (1984), and we now proceed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">(a) The legislative history underlying \u00a7 5G, and the statutes creating the Wachusett reservoir, provide pertinent information. That history reaches back more than one hundred years when, recognizing the need to create a water supply for Boston and its surrounding suburbs, the Legislature authorized the creation of the Wachusett reservoir (initially reservoir on the Nashua River). St. 1895, c. 488, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4, 6. A board of health report, referenced in the 1895 statute, described the proposed reservoir as requiring 5,163 acres of land in Boylston and other municipalities, 4,195 of which would be submerged land, and the remainder to serve as a \u201cmargin\u201d around the reservoir, including islands. 1895 House Doc. No. 500, at 130 (cited in St. 1895, c. 488, \u00a7 3). That same report also described the watershed in these terms: \u201cThe boundary of the water-shed was reconnoitered for its whole length, and carefully located upon the State map. Every part of the water-shed has been visited, and all of the swamps, ponds and reservoirs have been located with care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125-126 and Plan No. 4. The 1895 legislation also directed that annual $2,000 payments be made to Boylston \u201cas part of the expenses of said metropolitan water works,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>specified that the Commonwealth\u2019s water board \u201cshall pay no tax or other payment to [Boylston] on account of any property held by said water board for the purposes of a water supply.\u201d St. 1895, c. 488, \u00a7 16. The following year, the $2,000 payment was increased to $3,000. St. 1896, c. 436, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">By 1897, the Legislature had imposed a dual payment scheme, explicitly distinguishing between payments for land within and without the proposed reservoir. With respect to land within the proposed reservoir, the Legislature amended St. 1895, c. 488, \u00a7 16, to provide that, until Nashua River waters were acquired to supply the proposed reservoir, the Commonwealth would make interim annual tax payments based on the assessed value of the property taken to create it; thereafter, the $3,000 annual payments would compensate the town for the reservoir land. St. 1897, c. 467, \u00a7 1. Land outside the limits of \u201csaid proposed reservoir,\u201d however, was treated differently. The statute required the Commonwealth to make annual payments based on an assessed value of the land so long as the Commonwealth owned the land, but the statute went on to specify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">\u201c[N]o part of the fifty-one hundred and sixty-three acres described in the report of the state board of health on a metropolitan water supply made to the general court in the year eighteen hundred and ninety-five as necessary for said reservoir and the margin around the same shall be included in determining the amount to be paid in consequence of the taking of property outside the limits of said reservoir and margin.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">St. 1897, c. 467, \u00a7 1. It is thus apparent, from primary legislative sources, that the Legislature intended to, and did, treat the original 5,163 acres described in the board of health report as \u201creservoir\u201d land differently from watershed lands outside the reservoir\u2019s limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">That distinction has continued. In 1928, the Legislature repealed that portion of St. 1895, c. 488, \u00a7 16, which related to lands \u201coutside the limits of the Wachusett reservoir in the town of Boylston [held by the Commonwealth] for the purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the metropolitan water supply.\u201d St. 1928, c. 290, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Among other matters, the statute provided, for the first time, that G. L. c. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 7, would \u201capply to the reimbursement of [Boylston] by the commonwealth on account of said land.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Legislature left unchanged the payment scheme for lands within the Wachusett reservoir, which continued to be governed by St. 1895, c. 488, as amended.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In the ensuing fifty-six years, G. L. c. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 7, were renumbered and revised, but none of the changes modified the quantum of land to be valued for the purposes of PILOT in any relevant manner.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> *8Indeed, the parties do not dispute that from 1895, until at least the mid-1980\u2019s, St. 1895, c. 488, governed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>payments to Boylston on account of land within the limits of the Wachusett reservoir.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In 1984, the Legislature established the MWRA and authorized it to maintain and operate the water supply system for the greater Boston area. St. 1984, c. 372, \u00a7 1. Initially, the MWRA was required by G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5G, inserted by St. 1984, c. 372, \u00a7 40A, to make PILOT solely with respect to lands held by the Commonwealth within the Quabbin and Ware River watersheds, and no provision was made in \u00a7 5G to provide payments for reservoir land, or to apply \u00a7 5G to land within the Wachusett watershed or reservoir.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The omission did not go unnoticed. In 1986, the Legislature directed the Department of Revenue to conduct a study to determine the then-current level of PILOT to Boylston and other communities, as well as what such payments would be if they were based on \u201ccurrent assessed valuation\u201d of such lands, as required by G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5G. St. 1986, c. 696. The department reported that, if payments were based on the current assessed valuation, PILOT would rise by $87,929.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Following submission of the study, the Legislature amended G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5G, to provide for PILOT for land within the Wachusett and Sudbury watersheds. St. 1987, c. 564, \u00a7 52. Nothing in the legislative history discloses any legislative intent to change or discontinue the disparate treatment of reservoir and watershed lands; to apply G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5G, for the first time, to land within the boundaries of the Wachusett reservoir; or to expand the scope of the land to be valued for purposes of PILOT. In the absence of some indication of specific legislative intent to change a long-standing practice, we decline to infer one.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">(b) Language used in other related statutes further suggests that the Legislature did not intend to treat the term \u201cwatershed\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>to include \u201creservoirs\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 5G. Notably, the MWRA Act, St. 1984, c. 372, \u00a7 2, defines, for the purposes of the Act, a \u201c[watershed system\u201d as including the \u201cQuabbin watershed, Quabbin Reservoir, Ware River watershed, Wachusett watershed, Wachusett Reservoir, North and South Sudbury Watersheds, [and] Sudbury Reservoir.\u201d Thus, to interpret the term \u201cwatershed,\u201d as used in the 1984 version of G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5G, to include \u201creservoirs\u201d is inconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s use of both terms to describe distinct entities elsewhere in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Similarly, G. L. c. 92, \u00a7 104, defines the term \u201c[watersheds\u201d as \u201cthe natural basin from within which water drains or in natural course would drain into the Quabbin reservoir, the Wachusett reservoir, or the Ware river upstream of the Ware river intake.\u201d That statute also defines \u201c[watershed system,\u201d and includes the Wachusett watershed and the Wachusett reservoir as separate entities. <em>Id. </em>These sources indicate that, while both a watershed and a reservoir are part of a \u201cwatershed system,\u201d a reservoir is distinct from a watershed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">(c) A general principle of statutory construction provides that a term should be given its plain and ordinary meaning, unless a contrary legislative intent is demonstrated. <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Dunstable, </em>418 Mas. 841, 843 (1994). We usually determine the \u201cplain and ordinary meaning\u201d of a term by its dictionary definition. The term \u201cwatershed\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s Third New Int'l Dictionary 2584 (1993), as \u201ca region or area . . . draining ultimately to a particular watercourse or body of water.\u201d A second lexical reference, the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1448 (1970), defines \u201cwatershed\u201d as \u201c[t]he region draining into a river, river system, or body of water.\u201d \u201cReservoir,\u201d by contrast, is defined as \u201c[a] body of water collected and stored in a natural or artificial lake.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1106.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">These sources (legislative history, language in related statutes, and dictionary definitions) satisfy us that, for over one hundred years, land above the water and land below the water in a watershed system have been treated differently, and that the term \u201cwatershed\u201d in \u00a7 5G encompasses only the former, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>the term \u201creservoir\u201d encompasses the latter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude that the board correctly decided that land under the waters of the Wachusett reservoir should not be valued for purposes of PILOT. This conclusion, an almost intuitive one, comports as well with the established principle that the exemption from local taxation for State owned property granted under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Second, can be overridden only by \u201cexpress enactment or by clear implication,\u201d <em>Boylston Water Dist. </em>v. <em>Tahanto Regional Sch. Dist., </em>353 Mass. 81, 83 (1967), quoting <em>Worcester County </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Worcester, </em>116 Mass. 193, 194 (1874), a situation that clearly does not exist here.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">2. We reject Boylston\u2019s arguments challenging the commissioner\u2019s valuation methodologies for the nonreservoir land within the watershed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Boylston contends that the valuations were arbitrary and capricious, and violated G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5G, because they did not produce values that reasonably approximated \u201cfair cash value.\u201d General Laws c. 58, \u00a7 13, which controls the valuation procedure used by the commissioner for PILOT, provides that \u201cthe commissioner shall . . . determine as of January first the fair cash value as hereinafter provided of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>all [eligible PILOT land] .... The determination of value made under this section shall be in such detail as to lots, subdivisions or acreage as the commissioner may deem necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Boylston maintains that the statute does not define the \u201cdetail\u201d necessary to arrive at a valuation, and that the commissioner\u2019s valuation methodology was insufficient under <em>Assessors of Sandwich </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>393 Mass. 580 (1984). In that decision, this court stated: \u201c[I]n the context of a Statewide valuation program [namely, a valuation under G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 13] . . . the board should determine whether the Commissioner has adopted a procedure which (1) can be applied equally to each town where there are eligible State owned lands and (2) will produce values reasonably approximate to fair cash value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In the <em>Assessors of Sandwich </em>case, the commissioner had undertaken a valuation of all State owned lands, pursuant to G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 13, and the town appealed from the commissioner\u2019s valuation to the board, which modified the commissioner\u2019s determination. This court, concluding that the board had overstepped its role under G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 13, reversed and stated the following standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">\u201cIn determining whether the Commissioner complied with the statute, the board\u2019s task is not to substitute its own judgment as to the most appropriate method of valuation. Rather, it .should determine whether the method used by the Commissioner is reasonably designed to achieve the statute\u2019s objectives, and whether that method was properly implemented in the particular case. ... If. the procedure adopted by the Commissioner is not arbitrary or capricious, it should be upheld.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Boylston\u2019s principal assertion is that the commissioner\u2019s valuation methodology is fundamentally flawed because it purportedly did not account for various unpaved roads in the determination of lot frontages. After considering Boylston\u2019s evidence and arguments, the board concluded that the commissioner\u2019s methodolo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>gies for the relevant years met the standards of G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 13, and that they had been appropriately applied.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The board was correct. The commissioner was not required to conduct valuations for purposes of G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 13, using the same approach a real estate appraiser might use for a single purpose. <em>Assessors of Sandwich </em>v. <em>Commissioner of </em>Revenue, <em>supra </em>at 587-588. Instead, the commissioner was required only to provide towns \u201cwith ... an approximate reimbursement of lost taxes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 587. The board made extensive findings of fact on the commissioner\u2019s applications of his methodologies in arriving at valuations for PILOT purposes. The board considered the testimony of experts offered by Boylston on whether the commissioner had met the statutory objectives of G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 13, and it was not convinced by the criticisms voiced by those experts about the commissioner\u2019s valuations. The board also acted within its authority in rejecting various plans and testimony offered by Boylston to prove the number of \u201cfrontage\u201d or developable lots within the watershed. Having decided that the commissioner\u2019s valuations satisfied, and complied with, the duty imposed on him under G. L. c. 58, \u00a7\u00a7 13-17, the board acted properly in upholding the valuations.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">3.

St. 1984, c. 372, \u00a7\u00a7 38, 39, 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">Finally, we note that St. 1930, c. 416, \u00a7 11, a provision not cited by any of the parties, generally substituted the board of tax appeals for the Superior Court for review purposes, but also rewrote G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 7, to provide that G. L. c. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 7, would not apply to property held for the purposes of a metropolitan water supply in Boylston. Nothing in that provision changes our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The last paragraph of G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5G, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>provides for PILOT for lands within the Quabbin Reservation, but \u201conly on lands which are above the high water mark of the total acreage in question that is held by [the specified communities].\u201d Boylston argues that the absence of a similar modifying phrase with respect to the statute\u2019s description of the Wachusett watershed indicates that the Legislature intended to include the land under the Wachusett reservoir for PILOT purposes. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">One difference between the Quabbin and Wachusett watersheds is that, prior to G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5G, municipalities within the Quabbin watershed had never received PILOT on account of Commonwealth-owned lands within the borders of communities annexed following the creation of the reservoir. St. 1938, c. 240, \u00a7 9, amending St. 1927, c. 321, \u00a7 20. The effect of the term \u201chigh water mark\u201d in the last paragraph of \u00a7 5G is to remedy that express exclusion with respect to lands outside the \u201chigh water mark\u201d of the Quabbin reservoir. See <em>id. </em>By so doing, the Legislature required the MWRA to make PILOT for the benefit of municipalities containing watershed lands of the Quabbin Reservation that had been included in the municipalities taken to establish the watershed system. The Legislature did not intend to alter the entire scheme of \u00a7 5G in the manner suggested by Boylston. If anything, the presence of the modifying phrase tends to confirm the interpretation given by the board to \u00a7 5G with respect to the Wachusett watershed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Based on what has been decided, we do not address Boylston\u2019s arguments concerning valuation of the land beneath the Wachusett reservoir.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b426-8\">The board concluded that Boylston \u201cdid not adequately show the existence or extent of any other possible streets or ways that might have provided additional road frontage for development, consistent with the [1985 State Owned Land Valuation] Guidelines.\u201d Indeed, the Guidelines do not appear to limit valuation consideration to paved roads; they focus, instead, on \u201cfront lots on applicable municipal streets, roads or state highways and value the land as developable building lots.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
