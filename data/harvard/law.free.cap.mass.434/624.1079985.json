(Gotham), an ink manufacturer in Marlborough. The blast killed two workers and severely injured several others. The plaintiffs commenced these personal injury and wrongful death actions against three manufacturers and suppliers of the chemicals allegedly involved in the conflagration: Exxon Company, U.S.A. (Exxon); Unocal Chemicals Division, Union Oil Company of California (Unocal); and Houghton Chemical Corporation (Houghton).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After nearly six weeks of testimony at a consolidated trial on the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for negligence and breach of warranty for faulty product design and failure to warn, the jury returned special verdicts in favor of all defendants, and the complaints were dismissed. The plaintiffs filed a motion for a new trial that was denied. The plaintiffs have appealed, and we transferred the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>cases to this court on our own motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A pivotal question in this appeal concerns the duty of a bulk supplier to warn all foreseeable users of the risks associated with a product\u2019s use. We adopt the \u201cbulk supplier doctrine\u201d as an affirmative defense in products liabilities actions, and affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The trial record is voluminous; we summarize only the evidence on which the jury could have based their verdicts that is relevant to the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The defendants manufacture and supply chemical products in bulk. Unocal supplied Gotham with acetone and methanol in fifty-five-gallon drums. Unocal and Houghton supplied Gotham with toluene, which was delivered by tanker truck and stored in Gotham\u2019s large underground storage tanks. All three chemicals, which were involved in the tragic explosion, are highly volatile, flammable solvents.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">There was extensive testimony concerning the nature and extent of instructions and warnings given by the defendants to Gotham. Prior to the date of the explosion and in the course of their dealings with Gotham, both Unocal and Houghton periodically supplied Gotham with documents detailing the properties and safe handling of the chemicals. Houghton gave Gotham material safety data sheets (MSDS) for toluene that had been supplied by the manufacturer, Exxon. The MSDS warned the company, among other things, to keep toluene away from sparks and static electricity. The MSDS also contained \u201cempty drum warnings,\u201d advising Gotham of the specific dangers relating to the reuse of empty containers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Houghton also provided its own empty drum warnings to Gotham.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Unocal gave Gotham MSDS for acetone and methanol that had similar warnings about product flammability, the need to avoid contact with ignition sources, and the importance of not storing the product in unreconditioned drums. Additionally, Unocal issued drum label warnings with its methanol and acetone products, and its drum labels indicated in words and pictorially that the drum contents were flammable.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The defendants had ample reason to believe that Gotham was a knowledgeable purchaser of their products, able to understand the product warnings and to pass appropriate safety warnings on to their employees. As an ink manufacturer for the industrial market, Gotham annually purchased thousands of gallons of flammable chemicals. In compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations, the company had grounding devices in its receiving and production areas designed to dissipate any static charge accumulated in the transfer of chemical solvents from one container to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Gotham also had an independent obligation under OSHA regulations to train employees about workplace safety. The evidence established that, although the company was not in full compliance with an OSHA-mandated hazard communication program for training and providing safety information to employees,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Gotham periodically conducted safety meetings with its employees. Additionally, its supervisors and laboratory personnel often reminded employees of the importance of bonding and grounding when transferring solvents. For Portuguese-speaking workers, such as the plaintiffs\u2019 decedents Hoffman and Sobrinho, whose knowledge of English was limited, the warnings were given in Portuguese by a bilingual foreman and his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The evidence established that, prior to the explosion, Gotham had on hand a small library of books and other materials by the defendants, other suppliers, and noted authorities concerning the safe transfer of flammable solvents. In December, 1987, Gotham issued its own MSDS to its customers of \u201cpress wash,\u201d a clean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>ing solvent composed of equal parts of acetone, methanol, and toluene.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Gotham MSDS correctly advised that press wash was an OSHA IB flammable liquid that was 100% volatile and that required special precautions in handling, including avoiding exposure to sparks and grounding all vessels when pouring from one container to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The jury reasonably could have found that Gotham, although aware of its obligations to provide a safe workplace and able to carry out those obligations, was lax in its safety procedures. Of relevance here, the company allowed workers to use unreconditioned drums to transfer chemical solvents and to place containers of flammable solvents on dollies with nonconductive wheels. There was no evidence that the defendants were aware that Gotham had not enforced the safety precautions as advised by Houghton and Unocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">On the day in question, the decedent Remolindo Hoffman, who had been instructed to prepare a batch of press wash, was transferring toluene from a grounded pump in the production area to a rusty, unreconditioned drum containing residue from a previous batch of press wash. A jury reasonably could have found that Hoffman used an ungrounded dolly to place the \u201cempty\u201d drum on the grounded weighing scale, and that he dispensed the toluene without attaching back-up grounding clips to the drum. The ungrounded solvent transfer created a static spark that ignited vapors in and around the drum, causing the blast.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">At the close of the evidence, the trial judge, over the plaintiffs\u2019 objection, instructed the jury on the so-called \u201cbulk transfer doctrine\u201d set out in the margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To evaluate this chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>lenged instruction for error, we must inquire whether the instruction should have been given, and, if so, whether the instruction as given was proper. To both we answer in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Because the plaintiffs claim that the judge instructed the jury on the \u201cbulk transfer/sophisticated user\u201d doctrine, we resolve first some thorny issues of terminology. There is confusion, including by the plaintiffs, between the \u201cbulk supplier doctrine\u201d and the \u201csophisticated user defense.\u201d These are separate, conceptually discrete affirmative defenses available to defendants in certain products liability actions. See <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>866 F.2d 1008, 1012 (8th Cir. 1989).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The bulk supplier doctrine allows a manufacturer-supplier (supplier) of bulk products, in certain circumstances, to discharge its duty to warn end users of a product\u2019s hazards by reasonable reliance on an intermediary. See <em>Forest </em>v. <em>E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>791 F. Supp. 1460, 1463 (D. Nev. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>1992); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Hittle Serv., Inc., </em>219 Kan. 627, 637 (1976). In contrast, the sophisticated user defense protects a supplier from liability for failure to warn when the end user knows or reasonably should know of a product\u2019s dangers. <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Phillips Petroleum Co., supra </em>at 1012 (applying Missouri law). For the bulk supplier doctrine to apply, a product must be delivered in bulk to an intermediary vendee. The relevant inquiry turns on the intermediary\u2019s knowledge of a product\u2019s hazard and its ability to pass on appropriate warnings to end users. See, e.g., <em>Sara Lee Corp. </em>v. <em>Homasote Co., </em>719 F. Supp. 417, 424 (D. Md. 1989). The sophisticated user defense, on the other hand, requires no intermediating relationship and need not involve bulk transactions; the relevant inquiry turns on the end user\u2019s level of sophistication. See <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Ashland Oil Co., </em>625 F. Supp. 1515, 1520 (D. Conn. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Both doctrines seek to advance the goal of products liability law to prevent accidents. The bulk supplier doctrine applies where a warning is necessary to apprise end users of product hazards. See, e.g., <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Union Carbide Corp., </em>737 F.2d 1453, 1457 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1062 (1984). The sophisticated user doctrine applies where a warning will have little deterrent effect. Cf. <em>Bavuso </em>v. <em>Caterpillar Indus., Inc., </em>408 Mass. 694, 699 (1990), quoting <em>Colter </em>v. <em>Barber-Greene Co., </em>403 Mass. 50, 59 (1988) (\u201cwhere the danger presented by a given product is obvious, no duty to warn [exists] because a warning will not reduce the likelihood of injury\u201d). Put another way, the bulk supplier doctrine allows a fact finder to find that the duty to warn has been satisfied; the sophisticated user doctrine allows the fact finder to determine that no such duty was owed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Manifestly, the jury instruction at issue here concerned only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>the bulk supplier doctrine. The instruction directed the jury to determine whether the products were delivered in bulk; to assess whether the defendants gave \u201cadequate and sufficient\u201d warning about the products to the \u201cimmediate purchaser\u201d (that is, to Gotham); and to determine whether the defendants\u2019 reliance on Gotham to warn the ultimate users of the products was reasonable in light of the latter\u2019s sophistication and ability to pass on its knowledge of product hazards. See <em>Forest </em>v. <em>E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., supra. </em>The instruction did not permit the jury to find that the defendants had <em>no </em>duty to warn the plaintiffs of the products\u2019 dangers, nor did it require the jury to assess the degree of the plaintiffs\u2019 sophistication about the products\u2019 dangers. We therefore consider only whether a \u201cbulk supplier\u201d jury instruction is consistent with our law.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The bulk supplier doctrine originates in the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 388 comment n (1965).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See generally Cheney, Not Just for Doctors: Applying the Learned Intermediary Doctrine to the Relationship Between Chemical Manufacturers, Industrial Employers, and Employees, 85 Nw. U. L. Rev. 562 (1991). Comment n addresses the duty to warn in that wide array of commercial contexts in which products are supplied to an intermediary, who in turn supplies the products, often repackaged or reformulated, to others. In such circumstances, the supplier\u2019s duty to warn may be discharged by informing the intermediary of the product\u2019s character and the care required to use the product safely. Restatement (Second) of Torts, <em>supra. </em>To avoid liability for failure to warn, however, the supplier must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>have \u201creasonable assurance that the information will reach those whose safety depends upon their having it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The reasonableness inquiry is fact intensive; no bright-line rule can \u201cautomatically determine\u201d when reliance on the intermediary is reasonable. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Ditto </em>v. <em>Monsanto Co., </em>867 F. Supp. 585, 592 (N.D. Ohio 1993), aff\u2019d, 36 F.3d 1097 (6th Cir. 1994), quoting <em>Adkins </em>v. <em>GAF Corp., </em>923 F.2d 1225, 1230 (6th Cir. 1991). Among the factors that may determine reasonable reliance are \u201c(1) the dangerous condition of the product; (2) the purpose for which the product is used; (3) the form of any warnings given; (4) the reliability of the third party as a conduit of necessary information about the product; (5) the magnitude of the risk involved; and (6) the burden imposed on the supplier by requiring that he directly warn all users.\u201d <em>Sara Lee Corp. </em>v. <em>Homasote Co., supra </em>at 421, quoting <em>Goodbar </em>v. <em>Whitehead Bros., </em>591 F. Supp. 552, 557 (W.D. Va. 1984), aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>Beale </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>769 F.2d 213 (4th Cir. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Our previous decisions concerning a product liability defendant\u2019s duty to warn have been guided by the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 388 generally, and by comment n specifically. See, e.g., <em>Bavuso </em>v. <em>Caterpillar Indus., Inc., supra </em>at 700; <em>Slate </em>v. <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>400 Mass. 378, 381-382 (1987); <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>394 Mass. 131, 135-136, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 920 (1985); <em>Schaeffer </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>372 Mass. 171, 174 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">In <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., supra, </em>we held that a supplier of a potentially dangerous product has a duty to warn all foreseeable users of known or reasonably foreseeable hazards of the product\u2019s use, but that, in certain limited circumstances, \u201ca manufacturer may be absolved from blame [for failure to warn] because of a justified reliance upon <em>... a </em>middleman,\u201d so long as such reliance is reasonable. <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Yardley &amp; Co., </em>319 Mass. 92, 99 (1946), and citing Restatement (Second) of Torts, <em>supra. </em>We explained that, in such circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">\u201c[T]he manufacturer\u2019s immunity from liability if the consumer does not receive the warning is explicable on the grounds that the intermediary\u2019s failure to warn is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>superseding cause of the consumer\u2019s injury, or, alternatively, that, because it is unreasonable in such circumstances to expect the manufacturer to communicate with the consumer, the manufacturer has no duty to warn the consumer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">We can imagine few more appropriate circumstances in which to apply these principles than in the context of bulk sales. First, as a practical matter, the nature and function of bulk products are different from those of many other consumer and industrial goods and thus require separate consideration. Bulk products often are delivered in tank trucks, box cars, or large industrial drums, and stored in bulk by the intermediary, who generally repackages or reformulates the bulk product. Even if the product <em>could </em>be labeled by the supplier, any label warnings provided to the intermediary would be unlikely to reach the end user. Often, too, the bulk product has multitudinous commercial uses. Toluene, for instance, is used in gasoline, as well as printing ink; acetone is an ingredient of both nail polish remover and press wash; methanol, another press wash component, commonly known as \u201cwood alcohol,\u201d is used in antifreeze. To impose on bulk suppliers a duty to warn all foreseeable end users <em>directly </em>where the product cannot readily be labeled for such users (if it can be labeled at all); where the intermediary is often in a different industry from that of the supplier, with different means of production; and where the end users themselves are a remote and varied lot would be unduly, indeed crushingly, burdensome. See, e.g., <em>Ditto </em>v. <em>Monsanto Co., supra </em>at 592, citing <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Steve\u2019s Ice Cream, </em>737 F. Supp. 8 (D. Mass. 1990); <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Monsanto Co., </em>863 F. Supp. 285, 289 (W.D. Va. 1994); <em>Forest </em>v. <em>E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., supra </em>at 1465; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Hittle Serv., Inc., supra </em>at 637-638.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Second, the intermediary vendee, particularly the large industrial company, has its own independent obligation to provide adequate safety measures for its end users, an obligation on which bulk suppliers should be entitled to rely. The bulk supplier rarely has any control over the intermediary\u2019s personnel policies or day-to-day safety operations. See <em>Forest </em>v. <em>E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>supra; <em>Sara Lee Corp. </em>v. <em>Homasote </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number><em>Co., supra </em>at 424; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Pennwalt Corp., </em>22 Wash. App. Ct. 718, 723-724, aff\u2019d, 93 Wash. 2d 5 (1979). Thus, the bulk supplier simply is \u201cnot in a position to constantly monitor the turnover of an employer\u2019s workforce\u201d or \u201cto provide the good housekeeping measures, training and warnings to [the intermediary\u2019s] workers on a continuous and systemic basis.\u201d <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Monsanto Co., supra </em>at 289, quoting <em>Goodbar </em>v. <em>Whitehead Bros., supra </em>at 566.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In the oft-quoted words of the authors of comment n: \u201cModem life would be intolerable unless one were permitted to rely to a certain extent on others\u2019 doing what they normally do, particularly if it is their duty to do so.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The goal of products liability law is to \u201cinduce conduct that is capable of being performed.\u201d <em>Vassallo </em>v. <em>Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>428 Mass. 1, 21 (1998). The bulk supplier doctrine advances that goal by permitting a bulk supplier to satisfy its duty to warn by reasonable reliance on an intermediary who understands the product\u2019s risks and is able to pass on to end users warnings about the product\u2019s hazards.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Under the bulk supplier doctrine, the bulk supplier is by no means absolved of its duty either to supply adequate warnings to the intermediary or to ensure that its reliance on the intermediary is reasonable, but is permitted- to discharge its duty to warn in a responsible and practical way that equitably balances the realities of its business with the need for consumer safety. We adopt the bulk supplier doctrine as an affirmative defense to products liability negligence claims. See Part II E, <em>infra </em>(breach of warranty claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">We now turn to the issue whether the bulk supplier instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>tian given by the judge was proper in this case. We conclude that, in all respects but one, tire instruction clearly, adequately, and correctly explained the applicable law to the jury. See <em>Torre </em>v. <em>Harris-Seybold Co., </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 660, 678-679 (1980). See also <em>Back </em>v. <em>Wickes Corp., </em>375 Mass. 633, 638 (1978) (correctness of jury charge \u201cdetermined not in the abstract, but by reference to the state of the evidence in the case\u201d). The instruction properly required that the jury consider whether the defendants supplied their products in bulk; whether they gave \u201cadequate and sufficient\u201d warning; whether they had no reason \u201cto anticipate any negligence or other fault\u201d on the part of Gotham; and whether the defendants \u201chad no indication\u201d that Gotham \u201cwas inadequately trained, or unfamiliar with the product, or incapable of passing on its knowledge about the product to the ultimate users of the product.\u201d The jury were further instructed that the \u201capplication of this doctrine turns on the reasonableness of the defendants\u2019 reliance on Gotham to provide adequate warnings.\u201d See Part II A, <em>supra. </em>All these instructions were proper.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">However, the judge also instructed the jury to consider whether Gotham, as an employer, \u201cwas in the best position to monitor the provision of warnings to its individual employees or users, and train its individuals and employees.\u201d We recognize that such \u201cbest position\u201d language is found in other bulk supplier decisions, generally to explain why the bulk supplier doctrine is sound public policy. See, e.g., <em>Forest </em>v. <em>E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., supra </em>at 1465 (\u201cfar better position\u201d); <em>Sara Lee Corp. </em>v. <em>Homasote Co., supra </em>at 422 (\u201cbetter position\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, we think that requiring a jury to assess in hindsight whether the bulk supplier or the immediate purchaser was in the \u201cbest position\u201d to convey adequate warnings of a product\u2019s dangers injects a measure of uncertainty, of arbitrariness that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>undercuts the very raison d\u2019etre of the doctrine, and may mislead a jury about the applicable law. All that is required to determine whether the bulk supplier has discharged its duty to warn is for the jury to evaluate the reasonableness of the bulk supplier\u2019s reliance on the intermediary. This is an objective standard. <em>Sara Lee Corp. </em>v. <em>Homasote Co., supra </em>at 424. To overlay this inquiry with a second, subjective \u201cweighing\u201d requirement is unlikely to advance consumer safety, but is highly likely to create the kind of uncertainty that increases production costs and spurs on litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The \u201cbest position\u201d language of the judge\u2019s bulk supplier doctrine instruction, then, was given in error. However, as the faulty instruction increased the defendants\u2019 burden, not that of the plaintiffs, there was no reversible error. See <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Welsh Mfg. Co., </em>382 Mass. 340, 343 (1981) (no reversible error unless claimed error affects party\u2019s substantial rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The plaintiffs claim that the bulk supplier instruction allowed the jury to confuse the defendants\u2019 duty to warn under the plaintiffs\u2019 negligence theory with the defendants\u2019 duty to warn under the plaintiffs\u2019 breach of implied warranty theory. The argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">The record makes clear that the judge\u2019s bulk supplier instruction was given under the negligence charge and that she was careful expressly to separate her negligence from her strict liability instructions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The judge also allowed jurors to have copies of her instructions during deliberations, further obviating any possibility that her clearly delineated instructions would be confused. When jurors, during deliberations, posed a question to the judge about the scope of the bulk supplier doctrine, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>conferred at length with counsel and returned a response to which the plaintiffs, but not the defendants, agreed. There is, quite simply, no evidence that the negligence charge somehow migrated to and infected the jury\u2019s deliberations on the breach of implied warranty claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">We do note that the jury reached their determination on the breach of implied warranty claim prior to our deciding <em>Vassallo </em>v. <em>Baxter Healthcare Corp., supra. </em>In that case, we rejected the much-maligned \u201chindsight\u201d analysis of the duty to warn in implied warranty failure to warn cases. That analysis required a manufacturer or supplier to warn foreseeable users of all risks associated with a product, regardless of whether such risks were or reasonably could have been known at the time the warning was given. <em>Id. </em>at 20-23. Joining the majority of jurisdictions and the authors of the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a7 2(c) (1998), we expressly incorporated a reasonableness analysis into an implied warranty failure to warn claim, holding that \u201ca defendant will not be held liable under an implied warranty of merchantability for failure to warn or provide instructions about risks that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time of sale or could not have been discovered by way of reasonable testing prior to marketing the product.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">In <em>Vassallo </em>v. <em>Baxter Healthcare Corp., supra, </em>we implicitly recognized that negligent failure to warn and failure to warn under breach of warranty are to be judged by the same standard: the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s actions in the circumstances.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We expressly recognize that convergence now. Under our holding in <em>Vassallo, </em>then, an instruction on the bulk supplier doctrine may apply to both a claim of negligent failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>to warn and a claim of breach of warranty failure to warn in products liability actions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Finally, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that, even if it were proper to give an instruction on the bulk supplier doctrine, the judge\u2019s instruction was clearly erroneous because it failed to specify the \u201cfactors to be weighed\u201d in assessing reasonable reliance. Once again, the focus of the bulk supplier doctrine \u201cis not on the knowledge of the raw material suppliers but rather on the knowledge of the industrial purchaser.\u201d <em>Sara Lee Corp. </em>v. <em>Homasote Co., supra </em>at 424. In focusing the jury\u2019s deliberations on whether the defendants had reason to anticipate fault on Gotham\u2019s part, and on Gotham\u2019s ability to understand and to pass along warnings about the products\u2019 dangerousness, the judge fairly, completely, and accurately apprised the jury of the elements of reasonable reliance. See <em>Torre </em>v. <em>Harris-Seybold Co., </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 660, 678-679 (1980). No more was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">The plaintiffs raise three other issues on appeal, none novel or complex. They contend that the judge\u2019s instructions on the duty to warn were inadequate, that the judge erred in admitting certain OSHA standards in evidence, and that the judge made erroneous rulings regarding an alleged absent witness. We are unpersuaded by the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments on these issues, which we discuss briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">The plaintiffs claim that the judge\u2019s failure to give certain of their proposed instructions left the jury with insufficient guid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>anee to determine the adequacy of the warnings given. There was no error. The plaintiffs have failed to identify with specificity any alleged defect in the actual wording of the jury instructions that substantially would have affected their rights. See <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Welsh Mfg. Co., supra. </em>All that is left of their argument, therefore, is simply that they would have preferred that the jury hear their version of instructions rather than the instructions actually given by the judge. However, a \u201cjudge is under no obligation to charge the jury in the specific language requested by a party.\u201d <em>Corsetti </em>v. <em>Stone Co., </em>396 Mass. 1, 14-15 (1985), quoting <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Walter Kidde &amp; Co., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 902, 904 (1979). See <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Pine Manor College, </em>399 Mass. 411, 414 (1987). We will not determine reversible error absent instructions that, taken as a whole, are incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise improper. See <em>Torre </em>v. <em>Harris-Seybold Co., supra. </em>Such was not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Unavailing, too, is the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that OSHA regulations were improperly admitted in evidence.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is grounded in the judge\u2019s denial of their motion in limine to preclude the OSHA regulations. However, the plaintiffs cannot rest on a motion in limine to preserve their appellate rights. See <em>Vassallo </em>v. <em>Baxter Healthcare Corp., supra </em>at 12, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gabbidon, </em>398 Mass. 1, 7 (1986). The consequence of the failure properly to object at trial is to waive the issue on appeal. See <em>Adoption of Carla, </em>416 Mass. 510, 515 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In any event, there was nothing amiss in admitting the regulations. The OSHA regulations were relevant to, although not dispositive of, the standard of care Gotham owed to its workers to protect them from workplace hazards. See <em>Herson </em>v. <em>New Boston Garden Corp., </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 779, 793 (1996). See generally <em>Torre </em>v. <em>Harris-Seybold Co., supra </em>at 671-673. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Such evidence buttressed the defendants\u2019 defense that Gotham\u2019s actions were the sole proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. It is \u201celemental\u201d that the defendants had the right to assert such a defense and to support it with relevant evidence. See <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>388 Mass. 342, 352 (1983). The judge did not err in admitting the OSHA standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">We also see no merit in the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the judge erred by failing to give an absent witness instruction, and by ordering the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel not to refer to the witness\u2019s absence in closing arguments. The principles governing absent witnesses are well established: an instruction and comment by counsel on an absent witness are proper only when, without reasonable explanation, a party fails to call a person of whom the party is aware, can bring to trial, and who \u201cis friendly to, or at least not hostilely disposed toward the party, and who can be expected to give testimony of distinct importance to the case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zagranski, </em>408 Mass. 278, 287 (1990), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schatvet, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 130, 134 (1986). Because absent witness instructions and comments might unfairly prejudice a jury, they must be used with caution. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zagranski, supra. </em>In cases where it appears that the witness is likely to be favorable to each side, no inference should be drawn from the witness\u2019s failure to take the stand. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schatvet, supra </em>at 134 n.8. Further, a decision not to call a witness for tactical reasons does not necessarily lead to the inference that the witness\u2019s testimony would have been adverse to the nonproducing party. Cf. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Multicon Constr. Corp., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 291, 294 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Here, for at least four reasons, the \u201cmissing\u201d witness, Houghton\u2019s vice-president and safety manager, Joseph Lima, was not \u201cabsent\u201d in any way that would have justified absent witness rulings favorable to the plaintiffs. First, the plaintiffs themselves could have called him. Lima was listed on their pretrial witness list, and several witnesses called by the plaintiffs testified to postaccident contacts with Lima during which a \u201cred light-green light system\u201d for preventing ungrounded solvent transfers purportedly was discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Second, Lima\u2019s absence on surrebuttal was attributable not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>improper conduct but to Houghton\u2019s reasoned, tactical decision in the wake of the judge\u2019s limitation of testimony. The plaintiffs argue that Houghton had an obligation to call Lima on surrebuttal in response to testimony from the plaintiffs\u2019 rebuttal witness, Gotham\u2019s plant manager, Thomas Malloy. On rebuttal, Malloy, who did not testify during the plaintiffs\u2019 case-in-chief, attempted to refute the testimony of two Houghton witnesses that, prior to the date of the explosion, he had attended at least one \u201copen house\u201d at Houghton during which Lima demonstrated the \u201cred light-green light\u201d system. Houghton did request permission to call Lima and others to refute Malloy\u2019s testimony, but the judge limited Houghton to one surrebuttal witness only. That Houghton chose to call as this witness a former client, a person whom it deemed less vulnerable to cross-examination, was a tactical decision for which no sanction was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Third, even if he had taken the stand, Lima\u2019s testimony on the red light-green light issue would have been cumulative. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schatvet, supra </em>at 134. Once Houghton\u2019s witnesses testified that Lima gave a tour that Malloy attended and Malloy denied it, the issue was one of credibility for the jury to decide.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Uloth </em>v. <em>City Tank Corp., </em>376 Mass. 874, 882 (1978). Fourth, despite the judge\u2019s admonition to the contrary, in his closing argument the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did refer to Lima\u2019s absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">In these circumstances, the judge properly declined to permit the plaintiffs to capitalize on the fact that Lima did not testify. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ariza-Ibarra, </em>651 F.2d 2, 12-13 (1st Cir. 1981). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgments for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b643-14\">The plaintiffs originally joined Gotham\u2019s parent company, Superior Printing Ink Company, Inc., named as a defendant, but all claims against that company were dismissed before trial.

The application of this doctrine turns on the reasonableness of the defendants\u2019 reliance on Gotham to provide adequate warnings. If you find that the product here was delivered in bulk and that the immediate purchaser was in the best position to monitor the provision of warnings to its individual employees or users, and train its individuals [\u00ed\u00bfc] and employees, you may find that the supplier of a bulk product had no duty to warn the individual users of the purchaser or the individual employees of the purchaser of the product\u2019s dangerous properties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b647-10\">The bulk transfer doctrine is most commonly termed the \u201cbulk supplier doctrine\u201d or the \u201cbulk seller doctrine,\u201d but it has also been identified by other terms, including the \u201csophisticated buyer,\u201d the \u201cresponsible intermediary,\u201d and the \u201csophisticated user/bulk supplier\u201d defense or doctrine.
