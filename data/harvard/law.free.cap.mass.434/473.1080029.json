The evidence identifying the defendant as the perpetrator of these crimes included comparison of the handwriting in the graffiti with the defendant\u2019s handwriting in several of his school work papers. At the request of its handwriting expert, the Commonwealth moved to compel the production of witnessed, comprehensive handwriting exemplars for further comparison. The defendant filed a motion to suppress the handwriting samples provided by his high school and a motion to dismiss, claiming that the evidence used to charge him was illegally obtained. A judge in the District Court denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for production of exemplars and granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and his motion to dismiss. The Commonwealth appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The defendant was a student at East Bridgewater High School (high school). During the second semester of the 1996-1997 school year, the defendant had refused to work with his special education teacher, Ms. Shirley Phillips, and had engaged in numerous attempts to disrupt her work in the classroom. The defendant\u2019s disruptive behavior included racial slurs directed at Ms. Phillips, making \u201crude guttural sounds whenever she entered the room,\u201d and calling her \u201cTituba,\u201d a reference to a black slave in \u201cThe Crucible.\u201d Despite warnings, reprimands, and a suspension, the defendant\u2019s harassment of Ms. Phillips did not abate.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">The incidents at issue in the present case occurred during the first two months of the 1997-1998 fall semester. Sometime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>between the end of the school day on Friday, September 5, 1997, and the start of school on Monday, September 8, 1997, racial slurs were written on the blackboard in Ms. Phillips\u2019s classroom. While the defendant\u2019s prior racial animosity toward Ms. Phillips made him a potential suspect, there were many other persons who had had access to the room over the course of the weekend. Photographs were taken and shown to the faculty to determine whether anyone could recognize the handwriting on the blackboard, but no identification was made at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">On October 16, 1997, and again on October 23, 1997, the high school whs vandalized with obscene words and wavy lines written on the corridor walls. The East Bridgewater police department and the bureau of criminal investigation (BCI) took photographs of the new vandalism. The school\u2019s vice principal informed the police that the defendant had been seen by members of the faculty in the corridor at the time of the October 23 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The vice principal investigated the incidents and, on November 3, 1997, she provided the police with statements from other teachers at the school indicating that, for one of the incidents, the defendant was the only student in the vandalized area of the building who was not in his classroom when the vandalism occurred. She also informed the police that she suspected the defendant because, on the day of the October 16 incident, the defendant had been in her office and had spoken the same words that were later written on the walls.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The vice principal provided the police with samples of school work papers written by the defendant, along with \u201ctwo other student samples,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requesting that the police conduct a handwriting analysis to determine whether any of the handwriting matched the writing on the walls or the earlier writing on Ms. Phillips\u2019s blackboard. The police submitted the samples to an analyst at BCI, who reported the next day that the handwrit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>ing in the October 16 and October 23 graffiti matched the defendant\u2019s handwriting. Further handwriting analyses were conducted by an independent expert, who confirmed that the defendant was the likely author of the graffiti on the walls and opined that he was also the likely author of the racial slurs on the blackboard. Based on the handwriting analyses, the statements of faculty members, and the defendant\u2019s history of offensive behavior directed toward Ms. Phillips, complaints were issued for malicious destruction of property and violation of civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The defendant filed a motion to suppress the handwriting analyses and samples, claiming that his school papers containing the samples had been illegally obtained by the East Bridge-water police department. Neither the defendant nor his parents had consented to the high school\u2019s release of the defendant\u2019s school papers to the police, and the police department had not subpoenaed or obtained a warrant for the papers. He also filed a motion to dismiss contending that the evidence used to charge him (i.e., the handwriting comparison) was illegally obtained. The Commonwealth moved for the production of comprehensive handwriting exemplars from the defendant to be taken using the format recommended by its expert. The judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and motion to dismiss, and denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for handwriting exemplars.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">2. <em>Expectation of privacy. </em>In order to suppress the fruits of an allegedly unlawful search, the defendant must first show that there has been a \u201csearch,\u201d and, to show that he has been subjected to some form of \u201csearch,\u201d he must show that the police have intruded on a reasonable expectation of privacy. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>406 Mass. 540, 544, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 832 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>392 Mass. 45, 49, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 861 (1984). The defendant has no expectation of privacy in his handwriting, because \u201c[hjandwriting, like speech, is repeatedly shown to the public, and there is no more expectation of privacy in the physical characteristics of a person\u2019s script than there is in the tone of his voice.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mara, </em>410 U.S. 19, 21 (1973). With regard to school records, we have held that there is no privilege protecting such records from disclosure or restricting the use of such records as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>evidence at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beauchemin, </em>410 Mass. 181, 185 (1991) (defendant subpoenaed school records of complaining witness; error to exclude records at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">To support his claimed expectation of privacy in his school papers, the defendant points to regulations protecting the confidentiality of \u201cstudent records.\u201d Pursuant to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 34D, the Department of Education (department) has promulgated regulations regarding the maintenance of records at public elementary and secondary schools.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.00 (1995). The purpose of these regulations is \u201cto insure parents\u2019 and students\u2019 rights of confidentiality, inspection, amendment, and destruction of student records and to assist local school systems in adhering to the law.\u201d 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Pursuant to the regulations, high school students and their parents have free access to their own \u201cstudent records.\u201d However, third persons may only access \u201cstudent records\u201d with written consent from the student or the student\u2019s parents, unless one of several exceptions identified in the regulations applies and permits release of the records. 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.07(4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Here, the school did not obtain the consent of the defendant or his parents before disclosing the defendant\u2019s papers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>to the police, nor did the police obtain a warrant or a subpoena for these items. Consequently, if we determine that these assignments are \u201cstudent records,\u201d the release of the papers to a third party would be a violation of the regulations governing such records.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The regulations define the term \u201cstudent record\u201d as \u201cthe transcript and the temporary record, including all information ... or any other materials regardless of physical form or characteristics concerning a student that is organized on the basis of the student\u2019s name or in a way that such student may be individually identified, and that is kept by the public schools of the Commonwealth.\u201d 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.02. The term \u201ctranscript\u201d is defined as \u201cadministrative records that constitute the minimum data necessary to reflect the student\u2019s educational progress\u201d and is limited to information identifying the student (name, date of birth, address, telephone number, names and addresses of parents) and course titles, grades, course credits, grade level completed, and the date of completion. <em>Id. </em>The \u201ctemporary record\u201d is defined as \u201call the information in the student record which is not contained in the transcript.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Items in the \u201ctemporary record\u201d must be \u201cclearly ... of importance to the educational process,\u201d including \u201cstandardized test results, class rank (when applicable), extracurricular activities, and evaluations by teachers, counselors, and other school staff.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The defendant contends that his written assignments and tests are part of his \u201cstudent record\u201d because they are \u201corganized on the basis of [his] name or in a way that [he] may be individually identified,\u201d and, while in the school\u2019s possession, are \u201ckept\u201d by the school. 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.02. The defendant also notes that the definition of \u201cstudent record\u201d is broad, and there is nothing expressly excluding homework or classroom tests from the definition. The defendant invokes the provision that the regulations \u201cshould be liberally construed\u201d for the purpose of \u201cinsuring] parents\u2019 and students\u2019 rights of confidentiality, inspection, amendment, and destruction of student records.\u201d 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.01. Thus, the defendant concludes that every one of his homework assignments, tests, quizzes, and other written pieces of school work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>were part of his \u201cstudent record\u201d and could not be disclosed without his consent or the consent of his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The defendant\u2019s interpretation of the regulations is based on a literal reading of selected phrases from the ambiguous and circular definitions of the terms \u201cstudent record\u201d and \u201ctemporary record.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, looking at the definitions in their entirety, and in the context of the regulatory scheme as a whole, we are not persuaded that the department intended the term \u201cstudent record\u201d to include every piece of written work handed in by a student. First, because homework,, tests, class assignments, and the like are not part of the student\u2019s \u201ctranscript,\u201d they can only be part of the \u201cstudent record\u201d if they are in the \u201ctemporary record,\u201d which may include such items as \u201cstandardized test results, class rank[,] . . . extracurricular activities, and evaluations.\u201d Homework, class work, quizzes, and classroom tests have nothing in common with the examples listed. We also note that the listed examples are typically maintained in a central file on the student, whereas homework assignments, tests, and quizzes are typically handed in to teachers, graded, and returned to the students. The papers themselves are only briefly in the school\u2019s possession; all that is \u201ckept\u201d by the school is the resulting grade.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Moreover, the broad interpretation of the regulations suggested by the defendant would prevent the use of student work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>for ordinary teaching purposes. A \u201cthird party\u201d may not access any \u201cinformation in or from a student record\u201d without \u201cinformed written consent of the eligible student or the parent,\u201d 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.07(4), and the term \u201cthird party\u201d is defined as \u201cany person . . . other than the eligible student, his/ her parent, or authorized school personnel.\u201d 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.02. Because the term \u201celigible student\u201d is defined as a student who is at least fourteen years old or has entered the ninth grade (603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.02), students in elementary schools, middle schools, and junior high schools are not \u201celigible students,\u201d and are therefore not allowed to access their own \u201cstudent records\u201d or consent to the release of any portion of their \u201cstudent records.\u201d If all homework and test papers are part of the \u201cstudent record,\u201d teachers could not even hand corrected or graded assignments back to elementary, middle or junior high school students without written consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>from each student\u2019s parent. An interpretation of the term \u201cstudent record\u201d that prevented teachers from reviewing a student\u2019s work with the student in question, or even returning papers, quizzes, and tests to the student, would be utterly absurd and is clearly not what the department intended.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Other standard teaching practices would be forbidden under the defendant\u2019s proposed interpretation of \u201cstudent record.\u201d A teacher could not post a student\u2019s work on a bulletin board, or read a student\u2019s essay aloud in class, without the \u201cspecific, informed written consent\u201d of either an \u201celigible student\u201d or a parent. 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.07(4). For younger students in grade levels lower than ninth grade, teachers would have to contact a student\u2019s parent to obtain written permission to share the student\u2019s work with the rest of the class for educational purposes. Even display of work as a form of recognition, reward, or encouragement would be prohibited unless the parent were first notified and gave written consent. For example, an elementary school art teacher could not display student artwork in the classroom without first obtaining separate written permission from a parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Other features of the regulatory requirements pertaining to \u201cstudent records\u201d would, if applied to routine homework assignments, quizzes, and tests, be absurdly cumbersome. For example, when parents, students, or third parties access a \u201cstudent record,\u201d that access must be recorded in a detailed log. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.07(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It seems reasonable for the school to keep a log of those who access a student\u2019s school file, as one can readily maintain a log sheet in the front of the file listing those who have accessed the file. But it would be burdensome in the extreme for each teacher to keep individual logs of access for each homework assignment, test, quiz, and essay for each student. Teachers usually organize their papers by assignment, not by student, e.g., a stack of quizzes or a stack of book reports. If these assignments were included in the \u201cstudent record,\u201d the teacher would have to keep a log of access for each assignment, or keep a general log for each student to be updated when anyone accessed any of a number of stacks of assignments. A teacher would be required to make detailed entry in the log (see note 6, supra) every time that a student\u2019s work was displayed or read aloud, and, for younger students, every time their written work was handed back to them (after obtaining the written consent described above).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Similarly, the regulations require careful entries whenever an item is added to a student\u2019s \u201ctemporary record.\u201d After specifying that information in the student record \u201cshall be limited to information relevant to the educational needs of the student,\u201d the regulations go on to require that \u201c[information and data added to the temporary record shall include the name, signature, and position of the person who is the source of the information, and the date of entry into the record.\u201d 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.03. If teachers must treat every student paper as part of the \u201cstudent record,\u201d teachers would have to be making an entry in each student\u2019s record every time they collected homework assignments, quizzes, or classroom tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In light of the multiple layers of absurd consequences that would result from the defendant\u2019s proposed interpretation of \u201cstudent record\u201d and \u201ctemporary record,\u201d many of them inimical to ordinary teaching practices, we do not interpret these ambiguous definitions as including homework, written class<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>work, classroom tests, or quizzes. We do not believe that the department intended to interfere with the normal process of returning corrected and graded work to students or to cripple that process with burdensome paperwork requirements. If the department wishes to protect these items, it may of course do so by appropriate regulation, but the regulations in their current version show no such intent on the part of the department.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">While we conclude that homework and the like do not come within the definition of \u201cstudent record,\u201d and thus are not protected by the confidentiality provisions of the regulations, we must also consider whether, on any other basis, the defendant would still have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his schoolwork. A student would, even without reference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>regulations, reasonably expect that any written work handed in to a teacher would be used solely for educational purposes, i.e., that the teacher would review, correct, and grade the paper or test and return it to the student. A student would not expect, for example, that a teacher would turn over copies of student homework, papers, tests, or quizzes to the media.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">A mere expectation that the person to whom an item is entrusted will use it for limited purposes and not reveal it to others does not give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy recognized under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>425 U.S. 435 (1976), the Court held that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his bank records, notwithstanding his expectation that the bank would not disclose such information. \u201c[T]he Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the obtaining of information revealed to a third party and conveyed by him to Government authorities, even if the information is revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose and the confidence placed in the third party will not be betrayed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443. Relying on <em>Miller, </em>we have held that a defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in telephone message records when the taking of those messages had been entrusted to an outside service. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>407 Mass. 827, 833-836 (1990).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Here, we note that the items were turned over to a governmental entity (the public high school), not to a private third party. We also note that school attendance is compulsory, G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 1, and that students handing in schoolwork to their teachers are not doing so in a manner that is entirely voluntary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is unclear whether the principles of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miller, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>would apply when the items are entrusted to a government entity, under some degree of compulsion, for a limited purpose that would not normally entail disclosure to others. It would appear reasonable to expect that a government agency, to which a citizen is required to submit certain materials, will use those materials solely for the purposes intended and not disclose them to others in ways that are unconnected with those intended purposes. Thus, a student may reasonably expect that papers handed in to public school teachers will be used solely for educational purposes and not disclosed outside the educational setting. While holding that school records are not literally privileged (as they may be obtained by means of a mere subpoena), we have nevertheless recognized that there are privacy interests at stake in school records and held that G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c), exempts such materials from public disclosure under G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beauchemin, </em>410 Mass. 181, 185 (1991). For purposes of this case, we shall thus assume that the defendant-had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to his school papers, notwithstanding the fact that he had turned them over to his teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">3. <em>Reasonableness of the search. </em>Assuming that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to his written schoolwork while in the school\u2019s possession, the school\u2019s assembling samples of that work and turning them over to the police would qualify as a form of search. The Fourth Amendment applies to searches by school officials in public schools. <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O., </em>469 U.S. 325, 333 (1985). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>413 Mass. 521, 527-528 (1992). While recognizing that school officials are subject to the Fourth Amendment, courts have also acknowledged the \u201csubstantial need of teachers and administrators for freedom to maintain order in the schools.\u201d <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O., supra </em>at 341, and have thus attempted to balance \u201cthe schoolchild\u2019s legitimate expectations of privacy and the school\u2019s equally legitimate need to maintain an environ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>ment in which learning can take place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340. To that end, school officials are not required to obtain a search warrant prior to conducting a search in school.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snyder, supra </em>at 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The Fourth Amendment also does not require that school officials have probable cause prior to a search. Instead, school officials need only act reasonably in all the circumstances. <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O., supra </em>at 341. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>407 Mass. 528, 533 (1990). School officials need not \u201cmeet the standard of probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In order to determine whether a search was reasonable, a court must determine (1) whether the \u201caction was justified at its inception,\u201d and (2) \u201cwhether the search as actually conducted \u2018was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\u2019 \u201d <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O., supra, </em>quoting <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 20 (1968). A search is justified at its inception \u201cwhen there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school.\u201d <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O., supra </em>342. The standard of reasonable suspicion does not require absolute certainty, but only \u201csufficient probability,\u201d \u201cthe sort of \u2018common-sense conclusio[n] about human behavior\u2019 upon which \u2018practical people\u2019 \u2014 including government officials \u2014 are entitled to rely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 418 (1981). A search is reasonably related in scope \u201cwhen the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.\u201d <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O., supra </em>at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The search conducted here easily meets this standard of reasonableness. It was reasonable to suspect the defendant in connection with these crimes, and the inspection of papers he had turned in to school teachers was a minimal intrusion. Indeed, the only inspection being conducted was of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>handwriting characteristics displayed on the papers, not their substantive content or academic merit. Given that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to handwriting itself, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mara, </em>410 U.S. 19, 21 (1973), the scope of the inspection was limited to a subject that was not even private, and any observations beyond the characteristics of the handwriting were purely incidental.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Assessment of the reasonableness of the school\u2019s conduct here must also recognize that the school itself was the victim of these particular ongoing crimes, and was, like any victim, seeking to assist the police in solving the crimes and preventing further recurrences. While the school may have had some general obligation to use student papers only for educational purposes, it had a clear obligation to prevent further racial harassment of a faculty member and further physical damage to the public school premises. Where a student\u2019s school papers likely contained evidence pertinent to ongoing disruptive conduct at the school, it was reasonable of the school to review those papers and submit them for expert evaluation by the police. This search, if it was a search, easily passes muster under the Fourth Amendment requirement of reasonableness.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">4. <em>Handwriting exemplars. </em>The Commonwealth contends that the motion judge erred in denying its motion for further handwriting exemplars. The defendant contends that the motion for handwriting exemplars was properly denied because the exemplars would be fruit of the poisonous tree. The fruit of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>poisonous tree doctrine is properly invoked when evidence, although legally obtained, is derived from an illegal source. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fredette, </em>396 Mass. 455, 459 (1985). As discussed above, there was no illegality in inspecting the handwriting samples, and evidence from those inspections should not have been suppressed. Thus, there is nothing to taint the Commonwealth\u2019s obtaining other handwriting exemplars from the defendant.

(For example, if someone puts in a student\u2019s file a copy of the program from the school play in which the student starred, or a newspaper clipping concerning that student\u2019s activities or achievements, does that publicly distributed program or newspaper article suddenly become confidential merely because it is now located in the student\u2019s file?) The dissent\u2019s analysis would make the confidentiality of the student\u2019s work hinge on where the student paper was located. <em>Post </em>at 488-489. If students have privacy interests in their own written work, those privacy interests should not be greater or lesser depending on whether the written work is in a teacher\u2019s briefcase to be handed back the next day or in a file in the principal\u2019s office. Given that we are interpreting ambiguous and circular definitions of the terms \u201cstudent record\u201d and \u201ctemporary record\u201d (see note 4, <em>supra), </em>there is no need to interpret them in a way that would have such puzzling consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">To the extent that, as the dissent suggests, the critical issue is whether the written papers in this case were \u201ckept\u201d in the defendant\u2019s file, we agree that the defendant produced no evidence on that issue. The defendant, who had the burden of showing that his reasonable expectation of privacy had been invaded by a violation of these regulations, made no showing as to how or from where his writing samples had been retrieved, and thus no showing that they had been \u201ckept\u201d in some central file on him prior to their transmittal to the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Even with regard to older \u201celigible\u201d students, the regulations would, if interpreted as the defendant suggests, interfere with the ordinary return of assignments to the student. The regulations require that, while a student is enrolled at the school, the school principal \u201cshall periodically review and destroy misleading, outdated, or irrelevant information contained in the temporary record,\u201d but must give prior written notice to both the student and the student\u2019s parents and give them an opportunity to retrieve or copy the material prior to its destruction. 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.06(2). School teachers routinely hand homework assignments, tests, and quizzes back to students (and thereby, if they are part of the \u201ctemporary record,\u201d remove them from the student\u2019s \u201ctemporary record\u201d) without prior written notification to each student\u2019s parent. Requiring teachers to notify parents, in writing, every time they are about to return corrected student work to high school students would be as inane as requiring written parental consent before handing student papers back to elementary and junior high school students.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The detail to be included in the log consists of the name, position, and signature of the person releasing the information; the name, position, and affiliation of the person receiving the information; the date of access; identification of the portions of the record that were released; and the purpose for which access was allowed. 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.07(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The defendant also contends that his papers were protected under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), which imposes requirements on educational institutions receiving Federal funds. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(a), (b), and (e) (1994). FERPA defines protected \u201ceducation records\u201d as all records that \u201ccontain information directly related to a student\u201d and \u201care maintained by an educational agency or institution.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g (a)(4)(A). (Unlike the Massachusetts regulations, FERPA contains no definitions of or limitations on what sorts of items may be placed in an \u201ceducation record,\u201d but rather makes any information that is \u201cmaintained\u201d concerning a student part of that student\u2019s \u201ceducation record.\u201d) The reference to records that are \u201cmaintained\u201d by the school suggests that this definition does not include student papers or tests that are only briefly held by a teacher for correction and grading. The defendant has not cited any case that extended the protections of FERPA to a student\u2019s written work product. Implicitly, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is of the view that the papers themselves are not \u201ceducation records.\u201d In <em>Falvo </em>v. <em>Owasso Indep. Sch. Dist. No. I-011, </em>233 F.3d 1203, 1212-1218 (10th Cir. 2000), cert. granted, 69 U.S.L.W. 3481 (June 26, 2001), the court held that the practice of having students grade each other\u2019s papers and announce the grades in class violated FERPA because the grades themselves were part of the \u201ceducation record.\u201d In its extended discussion as to why the announced grades were, even prior to their entry in any record, an \u201ceducation record,\u201d the court at no point even suggested that the papers themselves were part of the \u201ceducation record\u201d or that the practice of having students read each other\u2019s papers had violated FERPA. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, FERPA is not violated unless a school has a \u201cpolicy or practice of permitting the release of education records\u201d without parental consent. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g (b)(1). A single instance of releasing a record without parental consent (which is all that is alleged here) is not a violation of FERPA. See <em>Achman </em>v. <em>Chisago Lakes Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 2144, </em>45 F. Supp. 2d 664, 674 (D. Minn. 1999) (finding no FERPA violation where plaintiff alleged only one incident of school releasing records without parental consent).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b502-7\">We did recognize that analysis of an expectation of privacy following entrustment to a third party might be different under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights: \u201cIt may be that under art. 14 exposure of information to another party might not compel the rejection of a claim of a reasonable expectation of privacy, particularly in light of the fact that the third party here, [the message service], considered the telephone message records to be confidential.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>407 Mass. 827, 835 (1990).

Here, where the defendant was the only person who had the opportunity to commit one of the incidents of vandalism, the words used in the graffiti were identical to words spoken by the defendant earlier the same day, and the defendant\u2019s prior harassment of Ms. Phillips had included the use of racial slurs, there was probable cause to search the defendant\u2019s school papers for purposes of comparing his handwriting to the handwriting on the walls and blackboard. Framing the defendant\u2019s claim as a violation of art. 14 would not affect the outcome we reach today.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b506-8\">Marshall, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar0\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part). I join in the opinion of the court in all respects but one. The court concludes, incorrectly in my judgment, that \u201chomework, written classwork, classroom tests, or quizzes\u201d are never \u201cstudent records\u201d under 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.02 (2000). <em>Ante </em>at 482-483. In my view, a determination whether a student\u2019s work product is part of the \u201cstudent record,\u201d and therefore subject to the requirements of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 34D, and its implementing regulations, 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.00 (2000), turns initially on whether that work is \u201ckept\u201d by the school and is \u201corganized . . . in a way that such student may be individually identified.\u201d 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.02. I agree with the court that in this case the defendant may not invoke the protections of the provisions of the statute and regulations. He may not do so because he has made no showing (as he must) that school officials \u201ckept\u201d the school work papers at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Assignments that are submitted by a student, graded by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>instructor, and returned to the student serve an evanescent pedagogical purpose: They are not part of the \u201cstudent record\u201d under the department\u2019s regulations because the school does not \u201ckeep\u201d them in its files. 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.02. On the other hand, a school may retain in its central or other administrative files all nature of student work (in addition to transcripts) that records a student\u2019s academic trajectory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These materials are part of the \u201ctemporary record\u201d if they are \u201corganized . . . in a way that [the] student may be individually identified,\u201d are \u201ckept by the public school\u201d and have clear \u201cimportance to the educational process.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>In light of the department\u2019s instruction that its regulations \u201cto insure parents\u2019 and students\u2019 rights of confidentiality . . . should be liberally construed,\u201d 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.01, I cannot subscribe to the court\u2019s holding that the Legislature and the department intended to exclude categorically a student\u2019s own work from statutory protection simply because in some (or even most) circumstances, that type of material would be returned to the student or shared with other students.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">This is not to suggest that all student work that is placed in a school\u2019s central or other administrative files automatically becomes part of the \u201ctemporary record\u201d because of its location. The regulations establish that the \u201ctemporary record\u201d includes only that information, \u201cregardless of physical form,\u201d that meets the three previously identified regulatory criteria. 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.02. There is no conceivable way that the regulations would protect from disclosure, for example, newspaper clippings, programs from school plays, <em>ante </em>at 479 n.5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>or any other individually identifiable materials that happen to be located in a student\u2019s central file, but are not of \u201cimportance to the educational process.\u201d 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Because the inquiry must be directed initially to whether a student\u2019s written work is \u201ckept\u201d in a school\u2019s administrative files, there is also no possibility that the statute or regulations will interfere with a teacher\u2019s use of that work in the course of \u201cordinary teaching practices,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 482, nor would there be any \u201cabsurdly cumbersome\u201d requirements placed on school officials to log the submission and return of that work. <em>Ante </em>at 481. Student work product utilized in the manner the court suggests, <em>ante </em>at 482, is plainly not \u201ckept\u201d by the school and therefore may be disclosed without violating the statute or regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">It is contrary to the plain language of the regulation to conclude, as the court does, that the protection accorded to certain student information under the regulations should never take into account the location of that information. <em>Ante </em>at n.5. While, as a general proposition, information and materials that meet the regulations\u2019 definitional requirements are part of the \u201cstudent record . . . regardless of where they are located,\u201d 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.02, the department has made clear that whether certain information is part of the \u201cstudent record\u201d does turn, in part, on its locus and in what manner it is \u201ckept.\u201d For example, the department has provided that the term \u201cstudent record\u201d does not include \u201cnotes, memory aids and other similar information that is maintained <em>in the personal files of a school employee </em>and is <em>not accessible or revealed </em>to authorized school personnel or any third party\u201d other than the student, a parent, or a substitute of the record\u2019s maker (emphasis added). 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.04. Such information may become part of the \u201cstudent record,\u201d however, if it is \u201creleased to authorized school personnel.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">For these same reasons, I agree with the court that the definition of \u201ceducation records\u201d under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) does not include student papers or tests that are \u201cbriefly\u201d held by a teacher for correction and grading. <em>Ante </em>at 483 n.8.1 do not agree with the court\u2019s suggestion that FERPA protections can never extend to homework, classroom tests and other student work product. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>As a number of courts have observed, the language of the Federal statute reveals that \u201cCongress intended for the definition of education records to be broad in its scope.\u201d <em>Belanger </em>v. <em>Nashua, Sch.

A student\u2019s school papers need only be \u201cmaintained\u201d by an educational institution and contain \u201cinformation directly related to [the] student\u201d to gamer the protection of the statute. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(a)(4)(A). Under this broad mandate, FERPA covers all those aspects of a student\u2019s educational life that \u201crelate to academic matters or status as a student,\u201d regardless of the medium in which the material is presented. 5 J.A. Rapp, Education Law \u00a7 13.04[4][a] (2000). See <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Kincaid, </em>759 F. Supp. 575, 591 (W.D.

Congress\u2019s Joint Statement in Explanation of the Buckley/Pell Amendment, 120 Cong. Rec. 39,862 (1974), explains that to \u201cprotect [an] individuales] right to privacy . . . [the] individual should be able to know, review, and challenge all information \u2014 with certain limited exceptions \u2014 that an institution keeps on him, particularly when the institution may make important decisions affecting his future, or may transmit such personal information to parties outside the institution.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The legislative record of FERPA also makes clear that the statute protects from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>disclosure not just a student\u2019s IQ scores and grades but also \u201csoft data\u201d collected by the school that might contain untrue or embarrassing information about the student or his family.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 120 Cong. Rec. 13,951-13,953 (1974). Many student assignments and other student work papers contain personal information and personal expressions.
