Do claims under workers\u2019 compensation policies have priority over claims under other types of insurance policies in the distribution of the AMLICO and AMI estates?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-13\">\u201cb. If the answer to question (a) is yes, do claims presented by the Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund [MUE] and other guaranty funds and associations attributable to covered claims under policies of workers\u2019 compensation insurance have priority over claims under other types of insurance policies in the distribution of the AMLICO and AMI estates?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\u201cc. Are case reserves and incurred but not reported reserves established by insurers reinsured by AMLICO or AMI properly used as offsets against amounts presently due and owing from such insurers as reinsurers of AMLICO or AMI?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">\u201cd. Does the requisite mutuality for offset exist between obligations of AMLICO as reinsurer of First State Insurance Company (First State) and obligations of New England Reinsurance Corporation (NERCO) as reinsurer of AMLICO, where NERCO and First State are members of the First State Insurance Group that participate in an inter-company pooling and shared underwriting arrangement?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">2. <em>The answers. </em>For the reasons set forth later in this opinion, we answer these questions as follows. Question (a) concerns whether the priority accorded workers\u2019 compensation claims in G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180F, as amended after the March 9, 1989, liquidation date of American Mutual, applies retroactively, effectively ensuring no recovery for the objectors (Liggett Group Inc. and Avondale Mills, Inc.). We conclude that it does. As to question (b), we hold that the same priority applies to claims presented by MIIF and other guaranty funds and associations (guaranty funds) that are attributable to covered claims under policies of workers\u2019 compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">We answer question (c) in the negative, in the absence of a sufficient basis in the common law to conclude that case reserves and incurred but not reported reserves (IBNR) established by insurers reinsured by American Mutual may be used as offsets<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> against amounts presently due and owing from such insurers as reinsurers of American Mutual. As to question (d), we conclude that the requisite mutuality for offset does not exist between obligations of AMLICO as reinsurer of First State, and obligations of NERCO as reinsurer of AMLICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">3. <em>Reported questions (a) and (b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\"><em>Background. </em>American Mutual, property and casualty insurers domiciled in Massachusetts, wrote primarily workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, and automobile lines of insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>anee for both commercial and personal lines policyholders. On March 9, 1989, pursuant to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180C,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a single justice entered an order of liquidation, appointment of permanent receiver and permanent injunction (liquidation order), decreeing that American Mutual was insolvent, and appointing the commissioner as receiver. See <em>Matter of the Liquidation of Am. Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>417 Mass. 724, 725-726 &amp; n.3 (1994) <em>(Liquidation of AMLICO).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Most claims under policies of insurance issued by American Mutual are being handled by MIIF, a guaranty fund established by G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 3, and at least forty-five other guaranty funds established in other jurisdictions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Pursuant to G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7\u00a7 1 (2) and 5, MIIF pays any covered claims that are unpaid and that arise out of and are within the coverage of an insurance policy (to which G. L. c. 175D applies) issued by an insurer that subsequently becomes insolvent if (a) the claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>or insured is a resident of the Commonwealth; or (b) the property from which the claim arises is permanently located in the Commonwealth. Guaranty funds in other jurisdictions are required by their respective statutes to pay comparable claims. See, e.g., Cal. Ins. Code \u00a7 1063.1(c)(1) (Deering 1992 &amp; Supp. 2001); Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 38a-838(6) (2000); D.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 35-3901(6) (1997); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 631.904(2) (Supp. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Unless a claim arises out of a workers\u2019 compensation policy, MIIF' pays only \u201cthat amount of each covered claim which . . . is less than\u201d $300,000. G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 5 (1) (a). MIIF is required to pay claims arising under workers\u2019 compensation policies, without limit. <em>Id. </em>Persons recovering from MIIF pursuant to G. L. c. 175D are deemed to have assigned the rights under their policies to MIIF, but retain the right to recover from the receiver any amounts under the coverage of their policies not paid by MIIF\u2019. G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 8 (1). Once MUF has paid a claim, the receiver is required to grant to MIIF \u201cpriority equal to that which the claimant would have been entitled in the absence of [G. L. c. 175D].\u201d G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 8 (2). This right to assume the priority of the claimant is granted to guaranty funds in other jurisdictions as well. See, e.g., 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. \u00a7 5/545(b) (1999); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24-A, \u00a7 4442 (2000); Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 38.2-1609(B) (1999).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">On March 22, 1989, an order entered in the county court requiring that creditors of American Mutual file proofs of claim with the receiver by March 9, 1990. Because the guaranty funds, including MIIF, are the largest creditors of American Mutual, they are in a position to receive the bulk of the distributions from the American Mutual estates.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The priority of payment for allowed claims is governed by G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180F (Supp. 2001). At the time of the March 9, 1989, liquidation order, the order of priorities read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>\u201cThe priorities of distribution in a liquidation proceeding shall be in the following order:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">\u201c(1) Expenses of administration;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">\u201c(2) Compensation of employees other than officers for services rendered within three months prior to the commencement of a proceeding under [G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180C,] not to exceed [$1,000] for each such employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">\u201c(3) Claims for taxes and debts due to federal or any state or local government which are secured by liens perfected prior to tile commencement of delinquency proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">\u201c(4) Claims by policyholders, beneficiaries, and insurers arising from and within the coverage of and not in excess of the applicable limits of insurance policies and insurance contracts issued by the company, and claims presented by [MIIF], the Massachusetts Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association [MLHIGA], or any similar organization in another state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">\u201c(5) All other claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180F, as amended through St. 1985, c. 745, \u00a7 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">Section 46A of G. L. c. 175 provides a priority for workers\u2019 compensation claims in Massachusetts insolvency proceedings. At the time the liquidation order was issued, \u00a7 46A read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-13\">\u201cWhen any domestic company which has insured the payment of the compensation provided for by [G. L. c. 152] becomes insolvent. . . unpaid losses under its workmen\u2019s compensation policies shall, in the distribution of its assets, whether liquidation is effected by a receiver or otherwise, be deemed and treated as preferred over all claims except debts due the United States and debts or taxes due the commonwealth or any city or town thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">There was at that time no statutory provision that explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>reconciled the priority scheme in \u00a7 180F with that provided in \u00a7 46A.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">On July 12, 1989, approximately four months after the liquidation order of American Mutual was issued, the Legislature amended the priority clauses of \u00a7 180F to make explicit reference to \u00a7 46A as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">\u201c(4) Claims by policyholders, beneficiaries, and insureds arising from and within the coverage of and not in excess of the applicable limits of insurance policies and insurance contracts issued by the company, and claims presented by [MHF], [MLHJGA], or any similar organization in another state; <em>provided, however, that the workers\u2019 compensation claims afforded a preference in [\u00a7 46A] shall be treated as preferred only as respects all other claims in this clause\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180F, as amended through St. 1989, c. 237, \u00a7 12. This statutory amendment became effective by emergency declaration on July 14, 1989. In the emergency letter the Governor declared: \u201c[I]t is in the public interest that this Act [St. 1989, c. 237,] take effect immediately in order to materially assist in confirming the priorities to be ascribed to the claims of creditors in pending proceedings involving insolvent insurers.\u201d Section 46A was not amended at this time, however, leaving an inconsistency between the nearly absolute priority set in \u00a7 46A and the more limited priority set by \u00a7 180F.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">On May 14, 1999, the receiver filed a motion with the county court for approval of a liquidation plan. Section IV of the plan outlined five general classes of distribution priority, intended by the receiver to reflect the five successive classes specified in G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180F, as amended through St. 1989, c. 237, \u00a7 12. The plan provided three successive subclasses within the fourth (policyholder) priority class, with the first two subclasses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>framed in light of the workers\u2019 compensation priority of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 46A (1988 ed.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\"><em>\u201cClass 4a\\ </em>Claims by insureds, insurance guaranty funds, and persons with a cause of action against an insured for losses within the coverage of and not in excess of the applicable limits of workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\"><em>\u201cClass 4b: </em>Claims by insureds, insurance guaranty funds, and persons with a cause of action against an insured for losses within the coverage of and not in excess of the applicable limits of insurance policies other than workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Numerous objections were filed to the plan. On November 22, 1999, the receiver filed an amended plan of liquidation, which resolved the concerns of some, but not all, objecting parties. The class 4a and 4b priorities remained unchanged. On April 28, 2000, however, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180F, was amended once again by the Legislature, St. 2000, c. 78, \u00a7 6, and assumed its current form. The paragraph regarding priorities of distribution was struck and replaced by the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">\u201cThe priority of distribution from the general assets of an insurer in a liquidation proceeding shall be in the order set forth below. Every claim in each priority class shall, subject to such limitations as may be prescribed by law and that do not directly conflict with the express provisions of this section, be paid in full or adequate funds shall be retained for such payment before the members of the next class receive any payment. . . . The order of distribution of claims shall be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-9\">\u201c(1) expenses of administration;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">\u201c(2) claims of policyholders, beneficiaries and insureds arising from and within the coverage of and not in excess of the applicable limits of insurance policies and insurance contracts issued by the company and claims presented by [MIIF], [MLHIGA] or any similar organization in another state, but the workers\u2019 compensation claims afforded a preference in section 46A shall be treated as preferred only as respects all other claims in this clause . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>G. L. c. 175, 180F (Supp. 2000). The Legislature also amended G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 46A, to begin with the proviso: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in section 180F . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 46A, as amended through St. 2000, c. 78, \u00a7 2. Thus, the priority granted in \u00a7 46A to unpaid losses under workers\u2019 compensation policies was explicitly reconciled with the priority scheme outlined in \u00a7 180F. These amendments established in clear language that claims for expenses of the administration of the insolvent estates would have first priority, even over workers\u2019 compensation based claims, and the latter claims would have priority over all other claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, on June 2, 2000, the Legislature expressly made the amendments to \u00a7\u00a7 180F and 46A applicable to pending proceedings: \u201cSections 2 and 6 of this act shall apply to all pending and future claims in liquidation proceedings pending on the effective date of this act and to claims in liquidation proceedings filed after the effective date of this act.\u201d St. 2000, c. 78, \u00a7 8, as amended by St. 2000, c. 96, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In light of the April 28 and June 2, 2000, amendments applicable to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 46A and 180F, on August 2, 2000 the receiver amended and filed her proposed assignment of priorities. There are eight priority classes listed, but we need only consider the first three:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\"><em>\u201cClass 1: </em>Permanent Receiver\u2019s Expenses of Administration;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\"><em>\u201cClass 2a: </em>Claims by insureds, insurance guaranty funds, and persons with a cause of action against an insured for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>losses within the coverage of and not in excess of the applicable limits of workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\"><em>\u201cClass 2b: </em>Claims by insureds, insurance guaranty funds, and persons with a cause of action against an insured for losses within the coverage of and not in excess of the applicable limits of insurance policies other than workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The receiver has concluded that \u201cthe [American Mutual] estates are not likely to have sufficient funds to make any distributions to claimants below Class [2]a.\u201d Avondale Mills, Inc. (Avondale), and Liggett Group Inc. (Liggett), whose claims are in class 2b, and are thus too low in priority to receive any distributions from this liquidation, objected to the proposed priority of class 2a.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\"><em>Question (a). </em>With specific reference to question (a), both Avondale and Liggett (collectively, objectors) concede that because of the most recent amendments, the priorities now provided in G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 46A and 180F (Supp. 2000), expressly apply to this pending proceeding. We need not attempt to reconcile inconsistencies or ambiguities in earlier versions of \u00a7\u00a7 46A and 180F, as the receiver invites us to do, for the Legislature spoke plainly in the 2000 amendments, and where, as here, \u201cthe language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, it is conclusive as to legislative intent.\u201d <em>Pyle </em>v. <em>School Comm. of S. Hadley, </em>423 Mass. 283, 285 (1996), citing <em>Boston Neighborhood Taxi Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>410 Mass. 686, 690 (1991). See <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Envt\u2019l Protection, </em>429 Mass. 798, 802 (1999); <em>Leibovich </em>v. An<em>tonellis, </em>410 Mass. 568, 576 (1991) (\u201cThere is no question of statutory construction in this case, as the Legislature\u2019s intentions with regard to retroactivity [to a case pending when the statute was passed] are expressly stated\u201d). Nevertheless, the objectors contend that these proceedings are governed by the version of the statute in effect at the time of the liquidation order in March, 1989, and that application of the workers\u2019 compensation preference scheme as provided in the 2000 amendments \u201coffends due process in altering retroactively . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>substantial property interest[s] without meaningful justification.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The law concerning the retroactive application of statutes in this Commonwealth is well settled. \u201cThe rule that guides judges in deciding whether a retroactive statute violates due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and arts. 1, 10, and 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights is that only statutes \u2018which, on a balancing of opposing considerations, are deemed to be unreasonable, are held to be unconstitutional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>423 Mass. 1244, 1248 (1996), quoting <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>374 Mass. 181, 189-190 (1978) <em>(American Mfrs.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">This evaluation of reasonableness includes three considerations: \u201cthe nature of the public interest which motivated the Legislature to enact the retroactive statute; the nature of the rights affected retroactively; and the extent or scope of the statutory effect or impact.\u201d <em>Leibovich </em>v. <em>Antonellis, supra </em>at 577. <em>Pielech </em>v. <em>Massasoit Greyhound, Inc., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 322, 328 (1999). In any evaluation of reasonableness, the objectors face a heavy burden, for we give credit to every rational presumption in favor of the legislation. <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>418 Mass. 623, 631 (1994); <em>American Mfrs., supra </em>at 190. See <em>St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>416 Mass. 698, 702 (1993) (\u201cWhere it appears that the Legislature intended an act to be retroactive, this intent should be given effect in so far as the Massachusetts and Federal Constitutions permit\u201d [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">We look first at the nature of the claimed rights affected. The objectors interpret G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180C, to provide that the receivership proceedings should be governed by the version of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>the priority statutes in effect as of the March 9, 1989, liquidation order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">\u201cThe rights and liabilities of the company and of its creditors, except those holding contingent claims, and of its policyholders, stockholders or members, and of all other persons interested in its assets, <em>shall, unless otherwise ordered by the court, be fixed as of the date of the decree ordering </em>liquidation\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180C.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Avondale concludes: \u201cAt a minimum, this provision gives policyholders and other claimholders a substantial interest in the assets of the insolvent insurer as of [the] date of the liquidation order. There is no evading the clear language.\u201d We have noted, however, that because the insurance industry is intensely regulated, the element of reliance essential to a challenge against retroactive application of a statute is lacking. <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>397 Mass. 416, 424 (1986). See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>401 Mass. 1211, 1223 (1987) (because savings bank life insurance system has from beginning been subject to \u201cpervasive regulation,\u201d participating banks are on notice that future legislation may alter their position).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The objectors do not argue that they would have acted differently if they had known that the 2000 amendments would be enacted. Policyholders purchase insurance with the expectation of receiving full coverage from a solvent insurer. The objectors provide no evidence that they, or any other policyholder, purchased insurance in reliance on what the insurer liquidation statutes provided in the way of liquidation priorities. Even if they had done so, the objectors can establish no <em>contractual </em>right to recover any particular distribution in a liquidated estate when such rights are set by statute. Merely entering into contracts for insurance does not in itself implicate the priority scheme established by the Legislature; it is the subsequent insolvency of the insurer that triggers the statute. See <em>Rhode Island Insurers\u2019 Insolvency Fund </em>v. <em>Leviton Mfg. Co., </em>716 A.2d 730, 735 (R.I. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1068 (1999) (enter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>ing into contract for insurance not enough to trigger recoupment provision of Rhode Island insurance act; insolvency of insurer required).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The objectors contend that the \u201crights and liabilities\u201d fixed as of the date of the liquidation order include not only their underlying contract rights and liabilities, but the entire liquidation and distributions systems as then set forth in the statute. However, as Liggett\u2019s brief acknowledges, \u201cpriority schemes applicable to insolvency proceedings frequently are characterized as establishing remedies instead of substantive rights.\u201d Liggett attempts to distinguish the present case by asserting that application of the workers\u2019 compensation preference as provided in the 2000 amendments would \u201cnot merely modify remedies \u2014 it would effectively terminate policyholders\u2019 underlying rights by placing their claims in a category for which no recovery is possible.\u201d However, any contractual right to recover on these claims was impaired by the insolvency of American Mutual, and not by the application of the 2000 amendments to pending proceedings. The priority accorded to the right has been affected, but not the underlying right itself. See Matter of the Rehabilitation of Mut. Benefit Life Ins. Co., No. C-91-00109 (N.J. Super. Ct. Ch. Div. Aug. 12, 1993) (Priority provisions of State insolvency statute are remedial and procedural; creditors \u201cnever had a specified right to a priority formula which could not be altered legislatively. The prioritization scheme does not take away the remedies afforded by the underlying contracts, it only affects the order of payment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In asserting that \u00a7 180C fixes their priority rights as of the liquidation date, the objectors overlook the qualifying phrase, \u201cunless otherwise ordered by the court\u201d set forth in that same section. This is language that \u201cimplie[s] a power of retroactive adjustment,\u201d <em>American Mfrs., supra </em>at 194, and should have put the objectors on notice that future changes in the priority scheme were possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The presence of such language in the statute is hardly surprising in this context. This court long ago held, in evaluating the effect of the application of an insolvency statute to a contract claim: \u201cThe obligation of payment is to be enforced according to the law, as the law may direct from time to time, and the creditor makes and holds his contracts, subject to such alteration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>touching the remedy, as the legislature may prescribe.\u201d <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Pritchard, </em>21 Pick. 169, 175 (1839). We have also noted with approval the exercise of such remedial power by Congress: \u201cThere can be no doubt that Congress has the power to regulate and change [bankruptcy] priority rights . . . without violation of the fifth constitutional amendment where the changes are consonant with a fair reasonable and equitable distribution of the assets of a bankrupt estate\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Boston, </em>v. <em>Keene Corp., </em>406 Mass. 301, 310 n.11 (1989), quoting <em>In re Jay &amp; Dee Store Co., </em>37 F. Supp. 989, 991 (E.D. Pa. 1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In <em>Maryland Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Muhl, </em>66 Md. App. 359 (1986) <em>(Muhl), </em>the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland faced a challenge to the retroactive application of a priority provision similar to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180F,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> based on a statute, Md. Ann. Code art. 48A, \u00a7 156, similar to the portion of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180C, relied on by the objectors. The Maryland court found that apposite Federal and State bankruptcy cases, including <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Pritchard, supra, </em>establish clearly that \u201cinsolvency laws are remedial in nature, and that, while creditors may develop expectations of what they might receive under those laws, they do not acquire vested rights to particular modes of distribution that are beyond the power of [the Legislature] to alter.\u201d <em>Muhl, supra </em>at 372. The court concluded: \u201cThe caveat in [Md. Ann. Code art. 48A, \u00a7 156] is consistent with that notion. If it can be \u2018otherwise directed by the court,\u2019 the rights of the creditors cannot be regarded as so irretrievably fixed as to be beyond alteration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372-373. We agree that this analysis is a sound one.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">We turn next to consider the public interest that motivated the Legislature to enact the amendment. In the 2000 amendments, as noted above, the Legislature made explicit the relationship between the priority provisions of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 46A and 180F (Supp. 2000), and reconciled the apparent inconsistency with respect to these two provisions that had existed since the priority scheme was first added to \u00a7 180F in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>1978. See note 8, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We have remarked before in considering the public interest served by an amendment that clarifies rights and obligations in an area of the law previously marked by uncertainty that such an amendment serves a \u201cworthy legislative goal.\u201d <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>418 Mass. 623, 633 (1994). See <em>Leibovich </em>v. <em>Antonellis, </em>410 Mass. 568, 577-578 (1991) (\u201cby applying the statute retroactively, the Legislature may have intended to correct what had been an inconsistency in the law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Avondale argues that the public interest is not served by the retroactive allocation of the workers\u2019 compensation priority, because the priority arbitrarily distorts the distribution of assets in favor of those guaranty funds that happen to hold a relatively high percentage of workers\u2019 compensation claims. This priority cannot be justified by the fact there is no cap on payment by a fund to an insured under a workers\u2019 compensation policy, because even without the priority, all guaranty funds would share ratably in distributions, and those funds with higher percentages of uncapped workers\u2019 compensation claims would <em>still </em>presumably receive a proportionally higher distribution. This argument, however compelling, is, in the end, simply a disagreement with the priority scheme chosen by the Legislature. As the receiver argues, having chosen to protect uniquely workers\u2019 compensation claimants by the priority and unlimited guaranty fund coverage, the Legislature could reasonably conclude that the guaranty funds should share in this priority, in order to \u201cpreserve the limited resources of the fund[s].\u201d <em>Rhode Island Insurers\u2019 Insolvency Fund </em>v. <em>Leviton Mfg. Co., </em>716 A.2d 730, 734 (R.I. 1998). Avondale may have other ideas about how this end should be accomplished, but \u201c[t]he validity of [the statute] ... is not pinned to the [objectors\u2019] view of what the statute should seek to accomplish. . . . The choice of purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>and means is for the Legislature to make.\u201d <em>Rushworth </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>413 Mass. 265, 270 (1992).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Last, we examine the extent or scope of the statutory effect or impact. Avondale concedes that the number of policyholders adversely affected by the 2000 amendments is very small.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Avondale nevertheless seeks relief on the basis of this factor, asserting that the risk of less than full payment should be spread more broadly so that the consequences to those adversely affected by the insolvency will be less severe. On closer inspection, this is simply a restatement of the arguments offered in regard to the other two elements of this analysis. The practical effect of <em>any </em>insolvency statute may be that certain claims are not paid. This is a result of the insufficiency of the insurer\u2019s assets, however, and does not result from a statutory interference with due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Given the relative weakness of the rights asserted by the objectors, the sufficiency of the public interest that motivated the Legislature to enact the 2000 amendments, and the narrow range of claimants who will be affected by the statutes as amended, we conclude that retrospective application of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 46A and 180F (Supp. 2000), is reasonable and does not violate the objectors\u2019 constitutional guarantees of due process. We answer reported question (a) in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\"><em>Question (b). </em>Because the answer to reported question (a) is \u201cYes,\u201d we address reported question (b), which asks if claims presented by MIIF and other guaranty funds attributable to claims under policies of workers\u2019 compensation insurance have priority over claims under other types of insurance policies in the distribution of the American Mutual estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Avondale concedes that, pursuant to the guaranty fund statutes in Massachusetts and other States, a guaranty fund inherits the priority of the insured on payment of a covered claim to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>insured. \u201cThe receiver, liquidator or statutory successor of an insolvent insurer shall be bound by settlements of claims by [MUF] and shall grant, against the assets of the insolvent insurer, priority equal to that which the claimant would have been entitled in the absence of this chapter.\u201d G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 8 (2). See discussion of G. L. c. 175D, <em>supra </em>at 275-276. See also notes 5 and 7, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text. Avondale contends, however, that the Massachusetts guaranty fund legislation applies by its terms only to the Massachusetts insolvency fund, and that the guaranty funds from other jurisdictions are not granted a similar right in a Massachusetts insolvency proceeding. This argument is simply incorrect. General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 180F (2), explicitly gives priority not only to MUF, but to \u201cany similar organization in another state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">We have previously discussed the right of the funds to inherit the rights of policyholders with respect to claims paid by the funds, also known as \u201csubrogation.\u201d <em>Liquidation of AMLICO, </em>417 Mass. 724, 730 (1994). In <em>Liquidation of AMLICO, </em>we stated that G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7\u00a7 5 (1) <em>(b) </em>and 8 (1), as applied to MUF, and the similar statutory provisions in other jurisdictions that apply to the out-of-State funds, \u201care principally designed to subrogate the funds to any rights the policyholders of American Mutual may have had with respect to claims paid by the funds under the policies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730-731. We did not distinguish between the subrogation rights of MUF and those of the out-of-State funds, as Avondale would have us do now. <em>Id. </em>To do so would, based on the record before us, render the priority granted to such \u201csimilar\u201d funds in \u00a7 180F (2) a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Finally, Liggett asserts that by its terms, \u00a7 46A applies only to claims for \u201cunpaid losses\u201d under workers\u2019 compensation policies, and because the in-State and out-of-State guaranty funds have already paid more than $500 million to cover losses by workers, those claims are no longer \u201cunpaid\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 46A. Thus, this argument goes, such claims have lost their priority. We reject this reasoning as both circular and inconsistent with the relevant statutes. We agree with the receiver that \u201cunpaid losses\u201d in \u00a7 46A refers to <em>losses unpaid </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>by the insurer.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This interpretation not only appeals to common sense, it is also in accord with the evident intent of the Legislature, as expressed in both G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180F (2), and G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 8 (2), that guaranty funds share in the priority provided to policyholders and claimants, whatever that priority might be.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The objectors provide no arguments that disturb our previous understanding of the subrogation rights of the guaranty funds.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We therefore answer reported question (b) in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">4. <em>Reported questions (c) and (d). </em>Questions (c) and (d) concern what may or may not be offset by a reinsurer against the amount that it owes to the insolvent insurer. The proposed setoff of obligations between mutual debtor-creditors (AMLICO and one or more of its reinsurers) that has prompted questions (c) and (d) is a process that, to the extent it proceeds, proceeds outside of the statutory scheme for the liquidation of insolvent insurers. That is because the offset amount is deducted from what is owed to the insolvent\u2019s estate and would not be subject to the priority distribution scheme discussed in relation to reported questions (a) and (b), above. We proceed to first set out the background necessary to a consideration of reported questions (c) and (d), and then, for the reasons given below, answer them in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\"><em>Background. </em>Insurance companies are required to establish \u201closs reserves\u201d so that their financial statements will provide for liabilities arising from insurance policies they have written. Loss reserves include \u201ccase reserves\u201d and IBNRs. Case reserves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>represent claims that have been reported to the insurer. They consist of estimates<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> of amounts that might have to be paid for pending claims that are being adjusted (that is, where liability itself has not yet been determined, the amount of the liability has not yet been determined, or both).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">IBNR are estimates of both the number of claims that have been incurred but have not been reported, and the amounts that might have to be paid on account of those claims. There are a variety of quantitative techniques employed by actuaries to estimate IBNR.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">First State Insurance Company (First State) is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Connecticut, and is wholly owned by Heritage Holdings, Inc. New England Reinsurance Company (NERCO) and New England Insurance Company (New England) are also Connecticut corporations. Each is a wholly owned subsidiary of First State. First State, NERCO, and New England are members of the First State Insurance Group (or Group).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">NERCO and AMLICO are parties to a number of treaties of reinsurance<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> under which AMLICO agreed to cede a portion of the risk on insurance policies written by AMLICO, and NERCO agreed to reinsure (or assume) that risk in exchange for a portion of the premium on those insurance policies, all subject to the terms and conditions of the reinsurance treaties (NERCO Assumed Reinsurance Treaties). AMLICO, through the receiver, has submitted claims to NERCO for monies currently due and owing to it under the NERCO Assumed Reinsurance Treaties.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Similarly, AMLICO and NERCO are parties to a number of reinsurance treaties under which NERCO agreed to cede a portion of the risk on insurance policies written by NERCO, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>AMLICO agreed to reinsure (or assume) that risk in exchange for a portion of the premium on those insurance policies, all subject to the terms and conditions of the reinsurance treaties (AMLICO Assumed Reinsurance Treaties). NERCO, through the receiver, has submitted claims to AMLICO under the AML\u00cdCO Assumed Reinsurance Treaties.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Finally, AMLICO and the members of the First State Insurance Group are also parties to a number of reinsurance treaties under which the members agreed to cede a portion of the risk on insurance policies or reinsurance contracts written by the members, and AMLICO agreed to reinsure (or assume) that risk in exchange for a portion of the premium on those insurance policies or reinsurance contracts, all subject to the terms and conditions of the reinsurance treaties (AMLICO Group Reinsurance Treaties). Members of First State Insurance Group, including NERCO and First State, have submitted claims through the receiver to AMLICO under the AMLICO Group Reinsurance Treaties. NERCO and First State have filed a proof of claim in the receivership action that includes claims not only for monies currently due under the treaties, but also for monies likely to be due in the future under the treaties, based on outstanding case reserves and IBNR liabilities.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The treaties described above reinsure against, among other things, latent liability claims including, but not limited to, asbestos and environmental claims. Such latent liability claims are commonly called \u201clong tail claims\u201d in the insurance industry, meaning that a claim by the original policyholder to the insurer, for which the insurer would then seek reimbursement from its reinsurer, could occur many years after the triggering event and the expiration of the insurance policy. The treaties also reinsure against property and general liability claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">First State, NERCO, and New England have been parties to various reciprocal reinsurance and pooling arrangements among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>themselves since 1965. Since December 31, 1992, First State, NERCO, and New England have been parties to and thus members of a reinsurance and pooling agreement under which NERCO and New England cede all of their underwriting liabilities to First State, and First State then retrocedes percentages of those liabilities and its own underwriting liabilities to NERCO and New England. Pursuant to this agreement, First State, NERCO, and New England cede premiums, losses, and underwriting expenses in amounts determined by their respective shares of the business. The operations, liabilities, expenses, income, and losses, as related to underwriting, are thereby shared. As a result, all reinsurance placed by or on behalf of any member is considered by the First State Insurance Group to be reinsurance of First State. Because First State\u2019s interest in reported question (c) is dependent on our answer to reported question (d), we address the latter question first.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><em>Question (d). </em>The question, simply put, is whether NERCO\u2019s obligations to AMLICO under their reinsurance treaties can be offset against AMLICO\u2019s obligations to First State under their reinsurance treaties.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u201cThe general principle has long been established that a setoff is appropriate between mutual debtor-creditors, even if one of them is insolvent at the time the right to the setoff is asserted.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>v. <em>Munich Am. Reinsurance </em>Co., 429 Mass. 140, 142 (1999) <em>(Munich American), </em>citing <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>12 Mass. 195, 198 (1815). However, \u201c[t]he obligations must be mutual, that is, \u2018the same parities] in both claims.\u2019 \u201d <em>Munich American, supra, </em>quoting <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Banks, </em>291 Mass. 108, 112 (1935). In St. 1998, c. 258, \u00a7 1, the Legislature amended G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180C, adding an eighth paragraph that states, in pertinent part: \u201cNo set off shall be allowed in favor of any insurer where: ... (3) the obligation of the insolvent insurer is owed to an affiliate of such insurer, or any other entity or association other than the insurer.\u201d While St. 1998, c. 258, \u00a7 2, gives this amendment prospective effect only, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>our understanding of the mutuality requirement in preexisting common-law setoff accords with \u201cthe public policy expressed in the new statute.\u201d <em>Munich American, supra </em>at 144.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">NERCO and First State concede that they do not meet the requirements of strict mutuality, but argue that it would be \u201cinequitable to apply the rule of strict mutuality in light of the inter-company pooling and shared underwriting arrangements of the Group.\u201d In substance, despite their separate corporate identities, they contend that their agreements within the Group make them all the same party for purposes of calculating setoff. We are unpersuaded. \u201cCorporations may not \u2018assume the benefits of the corporate form and then disavow that form when it is to their and the stockholders\u2019 advantage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spaneas </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem.

First State and NERCO acknowledge that AMLICO was neither a party to nor aware of the Group\u2019s pooling arrangement, a concession that is also fatal to their equity argument. The cases they cite in support of their argument are all distinguishable on this point. See Stephens <em>vs. </em>Federal Ins.

Co. </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., </em>53 Ohio App. 356, 358-360 (1936) (definite understanding or agreement between the parties that parent company and its two subsidiaries were to be regarded as one organization).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>We have no reason to doubt that NERCO and First State derive substantial benefit from their pooling arrangement, but we see no reason to depart from our long-standing requirement of mutuality, and thus we answer reported question (d) in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\"><em>Question (c). </em>We turn last to reported question (c), which asks us to determine if case reserves and IBNR established by AMLICO\u2019s reinsurers may be used as offsets to current liabilities owed by these reinsurers to AMLICO.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In our <em>Munich American </em>decision, we recognized a common-law right of setoff in Massachusetts. Specifically, we concluded that a creditor of an insolvent insurer \u201cmay apply amounts that it <em>owes </em>to the insolvent insurer as an offset against amounts that the insolvent insurer <em>owes </em>to it\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Munich American, supra </em>at 143. The receiver argues that, because case reserves and IBNR are only estimates of AMLICO\u2019s potential future obligations to its reinsurers, they are not \u201cowed\u201d in the sense we intended in the <em>Munich American </em>case, and therefore cannot be used to offset current liabilities owed to AMLICO by those same reinsurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In the <em>Munich American </em>case the specific question of offsetting case reserves and IBNR was not before us. The certified questions in that case only required us to address the offset issue in general terms. <em>Id. </em>at 141. We held: \u201cThere is nothing explicit or implicit in the statutory scheme for the liquidation of insolvent insurers (G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 180A-180L) that makes common-law principles of setoff inapplicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143. We went on to state: \u201cAuthority that we have cited in our discussion of common-law setoff addresses statutorily regulated liquidations of banks and insurance companies without any suggestion that rules of setoff would be different in a receivership or liquidation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We further noted: \u201c7n <em>every other State, </em>the rule is that a reinsurer does not receive an improper preference by having the benefit of setting off amounts an insolvent insurer owes the reinsurer against the reinsurer\u2019s debt to the insolvent\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 144. Finally, as noted in our discussion of reported question (d), <em>supra, </em>even after demonstrating that the right to set off was firmly grounded in Massachusetts com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>mon law, we nevertheless made a point of emphasizing that our conclusions were in accord with a recent change in an insurance statute, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180C, as amended through St. 1998, c. 258, \u00a7 1, which would recognize the right to set off prospectively, St. 1998, c. 258, \u00a7 2: \u201cThe pattern of our cases concerning equitable setoffs, when one party is insolvent and common-law principles apply, <em>is consistent with the public policy expressed in the new statute\u201d </em>(emphasis added). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">While we recognized the right of setoff in the <em>Munich American </em>case based on extensive common-law precedent and statutory provisions consistent with that precedent, both here and in other jurisdictions, the specific right to offset case reserves and IBNR is not established, either in the Commonwealth or elsewhere. It also runs counter to the policies embodied in the statutory scheme regarding claims against insolvent insurers, which requires that claims be \u201cabsolute\u201d and does not allow payment of any \u201ccontingent claim[s].\u201d G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180H.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">NERCO is able to cite only one Massachusetts case in support of its argument, which it bases in equity, that for purposes of setoff, case reserves and IBNR are \u201cabsolute\u201d and capable of liquidation. NERCO argues that this court, in <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Acc. Co., </em>314 Mass. 558 (1943) <em>(Massachusetts Accident), </em>\u201cexercised its broad equitable powers to ensure that claims against an insolvent are not precluded by a receiver\u2019s invocation of the words \u2018contingent\u2019 or \u2018unliquidated,\u2019 and it should do so here.\u201d We do not agree that that decision bears on reported question (c), for as the receiver points out, the case is distinguishable from the present matter on a number of points.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\"><em>Massachusetts Accident </em>concerned holders of noncancellable disability policies, who had not become disabled prior to the date of the liquidation order pertaining to their insolvent insurer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>We held that such policyholders had noncontingent claims for breach of contract due to the insolvency, which had effectively cancelled a policy that was by its terms noncancellable. Claims for that breach of contract (i.e., the breach occasioned by the cancellation) were therefore properly filed in the insolvency proceedings pursuant to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180C, and were not barred by \u00a7 180H. <em>Id. </em>at 561-566. Unlike the matter now before us, the case did not involve liability insurance, or setoff, or reinsurance, or evaluation of a specific claimant\u2019s claim based on projection of future liabilities. Furthermore, NERCO makes no claim, nor could it, that the calculation methods used in <em>Massachusetts Accident, </em>which relied on \u201cstandard disabled fife and mortality tables\u201d to determine the over-all value of the claims and make a proportional allocation to each policyholder, <em>id. </em>at 571-572, are in any way comparable to the estimation issues in case reserves or IBNR. To the contrary, in the record before us, the affidavits for both parties cite to chapter 10 of the National Association of Insurance Companies Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual for Property/Casualty Insurance Companies (1998), to help explain the nature of case reserves and IBNR, and the cited section simply states that there are \u201c[vjarious methods\u201d for determining IBNR, and case reserves \u201cmay be determined in many ways.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10-1, 10-2. It is no surprise that the receiver and the affiant actuary for NERCO reach starkly different conclusions based on the same industry manual, precisely because there appears to be no single \u201cstandard\u201d method of measurement for IBNR and case reserves.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">NERCO\u2019s attempts to use Federal tax and bankruptcy cases to support its argument are not persuasive. The tax statutes authorize the use of case reserves and IBNR so that insurance companies will not be forced to overstate their taxable income. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>598 F.2d 1211, 1213-1214 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 915 (1979). As for bankruptcy, the Bankruptcy Code does not apply to insurance companies. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 (b)(2), <em>(d). </em>See <em>Stamp </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of N. Am., </em>908 F.2d 1375, 1377 (7th Cir. 1990). Therefore, even if \u201cthe Federal Bankruptcy Code treats a \u2018contingent\u2019 claim as a debt capable of setoff,\u201d as NERCO states in support of its argument, we do not consider this fact persuasive in the context of an industry that has been expressly excluded from that Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We have already explained that the right of setoff in Massachusetts, as applicable to the American Mutual liquidation, is based primarily on our State\u2019s common law; it is certainly not modeled after the Federal bankruptcy laws. See <em>Munich American, supra </em>at 142-144. See also Schwab, Onset of an Offset Revolution: The Application of Set-Offs in Insurance Insolvencies, 95 Dick. L. Rev. 449, 459-460 (1991) (\u201cBecause insurance companies have long been excluded from the operation of federal bankruptcy laws, the application of set-offs in insurance insolvency proceedings developed largely as a matter of state law\u201d [footnote omitted]). The prospective set-off provision in \u00a7 180C is a statutory adoption of common law, not a provision that adopts Federal bankruptcy law on the subject of contingent liabilities. NERCO\u2019s proposed analogy to Federal bankruptcy law thus fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Finally, NERCO would have us follow the lead of the New Jersey Superior Court in <em>Matter of the Liquidation of Integrity Ins. Co, </em>299 N.J. Super. 677 (1996), which addressed the question whether that State\u2019s commissioner of insurance, acting in her capacity as liquidator of the estate of an insolvent insurer, \u201chas the legal authority to estimate the value of [IBNR] losses and reported case reserves in order to allow such contingent claims to participate in the final distribution of assets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> q'hg court found that this was a question of first impression in New Jersey, but also found in cases that predated its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>modem insurance statutes \u201ca willingness according to general principles of equity to permit estimation and allowance of contingent claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">There is no such tradition in Massachusetts law. On the contrary, our cases point to a very different tradition. See, e.g., <em>Webber </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>342 Mass. 455, 458-459 (1961) (no offset if claims \u201cnot rendered certain and capable of calculation\u201d); <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Banks, </em>291 Mass. 108, 113 (1935) (\u201cEquity will allow a set-off if the claim of the party asserting it has matured . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Other States have declined to allow recovery on contingent claims in insurer insolvency proceedings. In <em>Quackenbush </em>v. <em>Mission Ins. Co., </em>46 Cal. App. 4th 458 (1996), the California Court of Appeal considered a challenge to an insolvency plan in which the commissioner proposed, and the trial court approved, \u201can insolvency plan permitting [the commissioner] to estimate future IBNR losses for which Mission\u2019s reinsurers would be li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>able, although liability for, and the exact amount of, such losses remained undetermined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461. Under the applicable California statute, however, \u201cclaims founded upon unliquidated or undetermined demands\u201d cannot share in the distribution of an insolvent estate \u201cuntil such claims have been definitely determined, proved and allowed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463, quoting Cal. Ins. Code \u00a7 1025. The court held that, on its face:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">\u201cSection 1025 expressly forbids claimants with contingent or unliquidated claims from participating in a liquidation plan. . . . While the Commissioner\u2019s policy and economic arguments may be persuasive, they cannot trump section 1025\u2019s express language. The Commissioner notes that actuarial estimates are used to assess the value of future liabilities, and are relied on in the insurance industry to set reserves and estimate future losses. The point of section 1025, however, is to preclude <em>present payment </em>of such contingent and unliquidated claims\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 467. The California court advised: \u201c[T]he Commissioner\u2019s arguments should more properly be addressed to the Legislature, which is empowered to change section 1025 should it choose to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">We find it instructive to note, in this vein, that when the Missouri Court of Appeals upheld the estimation of IBNR claims in a liquidation proceeding, it did so because it found that its Legislature had \u201cspecifically endorsed\u201d the estimation of such claims in a statute (Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 375.1212). <em>Angoff </em>v. <em>Holland-America Ins. Co. Trust, </em>937 S.W.2d 213, 217 (Mo. Ct. App. 1996). Illinois also provides, by statute, for the estimation of contingent claims \u201cthat are not made absolute and liquidated by the last day fixed by the court.... Any such estimate shall be based upon an actuarial evaluation made with reasonable actuarial certainty . . . and, with respect to ceding insurers\u2019 claims, may include an estimate of [IBNR] losses.\u201d 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. \u00a7 5/209(7) (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">As discussed above, our Legislature not long ago amended G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180C, to include an offset provision. If the Legislature believed that estimation of case reserves and IBNR should be allowed in the context of such offsets, we assume this would have been reflected in the statute as amended. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>the Legislature has not acted to allow contingent claims generally, or case reserves and IBNR specifically, and NERCO can provide us with no compelling reason to do so based on the common law of setoff, we answer reported question (c) in the negative.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">To summarize, we answer reported questions (a) and (b) in the affirmative, and reported questions (c) and (d) in the negative.

If AMLICO\u2019s reinsurers were allowed to offset case and IBNR reserves against monies currently due and owing from those reinsurers to the AMLICO estate, however, the receiver states that she would then need to reconsider whether she should seek to recover reinsurance based on AMLICO\u2019s case and IBNR reserves.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
