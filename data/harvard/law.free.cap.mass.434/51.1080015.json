(collectively, HPHC), which conduct business as health maintenance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>organizations (HMO or HMOs).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Health Care for All (Health Care), a nonprofit, consumer advocacy organization, which was permitted, essentially as an amicus curiae, to participate in the receivership proceedings, filed notices of appeal from orders entered by the single justice of this court who presided over the receivership proceedings. The challenged orders approved the amended plan of rehabilitation of HPHC which was presented by the Commissioner of Insurance (commissioner) and the Attorney General; entered permanent injunctions against certain claims being brought against HPHC and others; and dismissed the receivership proceeding, thereby releasing HPHC from receivership. Health Care argues that the single justice did not adhere to applicable legal standards governing his role in overseeing a receivership of this type because he failed to require the commissioner to produce for examination business and financial documents of HPHC that the commissioner had relied on in submitting the proposed plan for HPHC\u2019s rehabilitation. Health Care asks that the case be remanded to the single justice for additional proceedings at which the undisclosed information is to be produced and examined. We conclude that Health Care\u2019s appeal should be dismissed. We shall, however, take this opportunity to discuss how a dispute, like this one should be handled in the future by a single justice dealing with a HMO receivership.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The background of the case is as follows. On January 4, 2000, the commissioner, through the Attorney General, filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>receivership proceedings pursuant to G. L. c. 176G, \u00a7 20,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180B,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County, seeking HPHC\u2019s rehabilitation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> HPHC assented to these proceedings, and that same day, a single justice entered a temporary injunction and order appointing the commissioner as temporary receiver.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Subsequently, Health Care moved for leave of court to appear as an amicus curiae. The commissioner and the Attorney General notified the court that they did not oppose Health Care\u2019s motion. On February 1, 2000, a single justice entered the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">\u201cIt is ORDERED that no action will be taken on the motion[]. Counsels\u2019 appearances will suffice to entitle [Health Care] to receive copies of all papers and to express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>[its] positions as to any matter in writing, and, with leave of court, in oral argument. [Health Care] will not have party status.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">After having filed two status reports with the court, the commissioner and the Attorney General moved, on March 20, 2000, for the approval of a plan of rehabilitation for HPHC. On March 21, 2000, the single justice entered an order which: (1) addressed the manner of notifying interested persons of the proposed plan; (2) established a deadline of April 10, 2000, for the filing of written oppositions to the proposed plan; (3) established a deadline of April 18, 2000, for any response by the commissioner and the Attorney General to any opposition; and (4) scheduled a hearing on the motion for April 27, 2000. On April 10, Health Care, asserting that the evidentiary disclosure supporting the commissioner\u2019s proposed rehabilitation plan was inadequate, filed a motion and memorandum of law opposing the proposed plan, or alternatively, requesting that the plan be amended. On April 18, the commissioner and the Attorney General filed an amended plan for HPHC\u2019s rehabilitation (amended plan), as well as a consolidated response to the various oppositions filed (including Health Care\u2019s opposition) to the initially proposed plan.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The single justice held a hearing concerning the amended plan on April 27, at which Health Care, among others, was heard. On May 24, the single justice entered a memorandum of decision addressing and rejecting objections, including Health Care\u2019s, to the amended plan, and, an order approving the amended plan. After the commissioner filed her certificate (as had been ordered by the single justice) stating that she had completed the steps necessary to implement the amended plan, the single justice, on June 21, 2000, entered an order dismissing the proceeding, vacating the temporary injunction, and discharging the commissioner as temporary receiver.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Health Care filed notices of appeal from the orders approving the amended plan, and dismissing the receivership proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>On appeal, Health Care argues that the single justice erred in approving the amended plan, and in terminating the receivership proceedings, \u201cunder circumstances where the [rjeceiver failed to disclose to the court and the affected parties critical financial data, health care business plans and other reports that served as the exclusive basis upon which the [rjeceiver relied in recommending that the receivership be terminated.\u201d The specific documents that Health Care claims should have been disclosed are (1) HPHC\u2019s \u201cturnaround plan,\u201d (2) HPHC\u2019s \u201c2000 business plan,\u201d and (3) an outside accounting firm\u2019s (KPMG Peat Mar-wick) review of the business plan (collectively, documents). Although the commissioner, in her affidavit in support of the motion for the approval of the amended plan, identified, and to some extent summarized, these documents, Health Care argues that the single justice was required to review these documents independently instead of relying on the commissioner\u2019s reference to, and summary of, these documents in her affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The appellees, the commissioner and the Attorney General, argue that Health Care lacks standing to appeal, and, that, in any event, the single justice acted within his discretion in not requiring the submission of the documents. The appellees further argue that this appeal should be dismissed as equitably moot because the amended plan has been implemented and the receivership has been terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">1. Health Care properly does not dispute the appellees\u2019 claim that it is not a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 114, and has no standing to appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Instead, Health Care contends that the court should exercise its discretion to hear Health Care\u2019s appeal because the appeal involves an issue of significant public interest. In addition, Health Care maintains that other factors weigh in favor of the court\u2019s exercising its discretion, for example, that Health Care was treated like a party before the single justice, and that the appellees never argued below that Health Care lacked standing, but had they, that Health Care could have moved to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Health Care\u2019s latter arguments, listed as \u201cother factors,\u201d provide no basis to accord it the standing it seeks. The single justice made it clear, in his February 1, 2000, order, that Health Care would not have party status in the proceedings, and he essentially treated Health Care, in keeping with its request, as an amicus curiae and not as a party. The issue of standing may be raised at any time. See <em>Ginther </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>427 Mass. 319, 322 (1998); <em>Litton Business Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>383 Mass. 619, 622 (1981). See also Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (h) (3), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). Thus, any failure of the appellees to raise the issue of Health Care\u2019s standing below does not result in a waiver of the issue. See <em>Litton Business Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra. </em>Further, what Health Care \u201ccould have done\u201d in other circumstances is speculative. If Health Care wanted to be treated as a party, it should have moved to intervene during the proceedings, or after the entry of judgment. See <em>Corbett </em>v. <em>Related Cos. Northeast, Inc., </em>424 Mass. 714, 718 (1997); <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>390 Mass. 604, 611 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Health Care\u2019s other arguments that it should be accorded the equivalent of formal standing to attack the orders in issue merit comment. These arguments are essentially threefold: (1) because the issues are fully briefed in an adequate record and concern matters of important public policy that are likely to recur, they should be decided now, see <em>Lenox Educ. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>393 Mass. 276, 278 (1984); <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943); (2) amici curiae (various guaranty funds) in a prior insurance company liquidation case had their arguments formally considered by the full court in its analysis and decision of questions reported to the court by a single justice, see <em>Matter of the Liquidation of Am. Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>417 Mass. 724, 727 n.4 (1994) <em>(American Mutual); </em>(3) a receivership proceeding such as this one is not truly adversary because the commissioner is given virtually unlimited authority to decide whether a plan of rehabilitation should be implemented, and the commissioner\u2019s decision, if improper or unfounded, may adversely affect the HMO\u2019s subscribers, as well as the health care providers with whom it contracts, unless some voice in opposition to the decision is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>fully heard and, if need be, afforded the right to appeal. The allegation here is that the single justice merely \u201crubber stamped\u201d his approval on the commissioner\u2019s amended plan and terminated the receivership solely on the basis of the commissioner\u2019s unsupported assurances that HPHC\u2019s unsound financial condition had abated. Health Care suggests that it is a voice of possible objection to, or constructive criticism of, the amended plan because (quoting from its motion to appear as an amicus curiae): it is \u201ca nonprofit, statewide consumer advocacy organization whose mission is to ensure access to quality health care for Massachusetts\u2019 vulnerable consumers\u201d; it has \u201csubstantial interest and experience in the various plans offered by [HPHC] and the health care needs of its members\u201d; it can provide \u201csubstantial and important feedback on any proposals to alter the management structure of [HPHC]\u201d; and \u201c[i]n the case of insolvency or liquidation, [it] can aid the [c]curt in the transition and equitable assignment of alternative insurance plans to cover [HPHC\u2019s] members in the nongroup, small group, and group markets.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The longstanding rule is that an amicus curiae is not a party to the case and, because the amicus lacks standing, it has \u201cno right... to bring the case from one court to another, or from a single judge to the full court, by [appeal].\u201d <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Tapley, </em>119 Mass. 116, 120 (1875). See <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>A-1 Sales, Inc., </em>385 Mass. 753, 756 (1982). Thus, an amicus curiae \u201cis heard only by the leave and for the assistance of the court.\u201d <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Tapley, supra </em>at 120. See Mass. R. A. P. 17, as amended, 426 Mass. 1602 (1998). These rules exist because the proceeding has undergone an adversary hearing in the trial court where an amicus curiae was not a party, and did not engage in the adversary process. Thus, an amicus is not permitted to enter the picture on appeal with party status, but is allowed to assist the appellate court by way of offering information and legal argument. Usually such argument is limited to only those issues addressed by the parties. See <em>Pineo </em>v. <em>Executive Council, </em>412 Mass. 31, 35 n.6 (1992); <em>United Techs. Corp. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>Ins. Co., </em>407 Mass. 591, 593 n.3 (1990); <em>Samuel Hertzig Corp. </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>295 Mass. 229, 232 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">There is a limited exception to this rule in insurance liquidation or receivership proceedings that is reflected in the <em>American Mutual </em>case, <em>supra. </em>That case involved the liquidation of an insurance company, and the single justice, pending the full court\u2019s response to his reported questions, denied, \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d party status to guaranty funds seeking intervention. <em>American Mutual, supra </em>at 725-727. The guaranty funds, however, were permitted to assert their arguments as amici curiae. <em>Id. </em>at 727 n.4, 729. The single justice reserved and reported the case on four questions of law, framing the report in such a way that the amici curiae, the guaranty funds, became the primary source of argument on the appeal for a position that not only affected their rights, but also was material to a proper resolution of the reported questions. See <em>id. </em>at 728. This court exercised its discretion to hear the appeal in this posture and to address and decide the arguments of the amici. See <em>id. </em>at 727 n.4, 730-731, 733-736. The reasons behind the exception take into account that, although the single justice in the county court is acting as a trial judge, the proceedings there are not truly adversary because the commissioner (at times aided by the Attorney General if a nonprofit entity is involved) and the financially stressed insurance company or HMO are the driving force behind resolution of the litigation. See <em>id. </em>at 727 n.4. There can be objections to the plan proposed by the commissioner. But, in many cases, there are other objectors who represent important interests that have relevant information and legal argument, but who are unable to obtain party status because they do not meet the criteria under Mass. R. Civ. P. 24, 365 Mass. 769 (1974), to intervene. For this reason, single justices have consistently afforded liberal allowance to any person or entity, who has something important to say to the single justice about the commissioner\u2019s action, to do so by means of amicus curiae submissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The <em>American Mutual </em>case is not on point here. As stated above, the <em>American Mutual </em>proceedings were framed by the single justice to bring the amici squarely before us. That procedure was not followed here. Also, in the <em>American Mutual </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>case, some of the guaranty funds would be directly affected by the answers to the reported questions. While Health Care acts as a consumer organization with a special, admittedly sincere, interest in what occurs with HMOs in distress or not in distress, it makes no claim that it, or its members, will be directly affected by the receivership proceedings. In fact, although Health Care asserts it in brief that it \u201crepresents the sole voice before this court for hundreds of thousands of subscribers,\u201d nothing in the record identifies who Health Care\u2019s members are, let alone whether they are subscribers, or members, of HPHC. These facts do not exist without significance. See <em>Animal Legal Defense Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fisheries &amp; Wildlife Bd., </em>416 Mass. 635, 638 n.4 (1993) (to possess associational standing, organization must establish that its members would independently possess standing). Health Care also does not fully take into account the statutory duty of the Attorney General to protect the public interest in the lawful operation of nonprofit entities. Cf. <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>425 Mass. 270, 276 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1049 (1998). In complying with this duty, the Attorney General cannot disregard considering the potential consequences to HPHC\u2019s members associated with the implementation of any proposed rehabilitation plan. It is important to note as well that Health Care apparently believed that it could intervene in the proceedings, but chose not to do so, accepting its assumed status as an amicus, and neglected, as a purported amicus, to comply with the requirements of Mass. R. A. P. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Finally, as a court of general equity jurisdiction under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1, reviewing a proceeding that is equitable in nature, see <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>379 Mass. 703, 730 (1980), we cannot ignore the current posture of this case when considering whether to exercise our discretion to hear the appeal despite Health Care\u2019s lack of standing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the <em>American Mutual </em>case, the proceedings were halted untiLsuch time as the issues stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>in the reported questions were decided. <em>American Mutual, supra </em>at 727. After our opinion was released, the case was remanded to the single justice for additional proceedings based on the analysis and results in the decision. <em>Id. </em>at 739. Here, Health Care did not move to stay the proceedings while it pursued this appeal. In the meantime, third parties have relied on the challenged orders in dealing with HPHC, and, in implementing the amended plan. As pointed out by the appellees, before HPHC was released from receivership, the commissioner, in accordance with the amended plan, executed several settlements, and since the termination of the receivership, HPHC \u201chas not only implemented the [ajmended [pjlan by issuing surplus notes to pre-receivership general unsecured creditors and processing and paying claims in the [HPHC Rhode Island] liquidation, but it has also continued with its business. As a result, it has negotiated and entered into new or renewed contracts with thousands of employers, hundreds of thousands of members, and hundreds of hospitals, physician groups and other providers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that Health Care does not have standing to appeal, and that the circumstances do not warrant our exercising our discretion to grant the review it seeks. Health Care\u2019s appeal will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">2. The case is an appropriate one to comment generally on how similar proceedings might be handled in the future by a single justice. See <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The commissioner and the Attorney General (when he is a party) are public officials who are charged with representing the interests of the public, and protecting the interests and expectations, to the extent possible, of policyholders of insurance companies and members of HMOs who may be adversely affected by the receivership as well as creditors, guaranty funds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>reinsurers, and others. The commissioner is subject to executive and legislative oversight.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">This court, and its single justice, however, play a central role in receivership proceedings. The court has been authorized by the Legislature to have exclusive jurisdiction over receivership rehabilitation and liquidation proceedings. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180B (rehabilitation proceedings), \u00a7 180C (liquidation proceedings). The court provides a statutorily based independent judicial oversight of the commissioner\u2019s actions and proposals with a view toward protecting the rights of the parties as well as the interests of the public, members of \u201cfinancially troubled\u201d HMOs, and others with a stake in the outcome. See St. 1999, c. 143, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The single justice should liberally allow amicus status, and the single justice must comply with the governing standards set forth in G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180B, concerning the approval of rehabilitation plans and the termination of receivership proceedings. These standards obligate the single justice: (1) prior to approving a proposed plan of rehabilitation, to ensure that the receiver has taken \u201csuch measures as may be proper to eliminate the causes and conditions which caused the institution of such proceeding\u201d; and (2) prior to terminating the receivership proceedings, to be \u201csatisfied after due notice and a full hearing that the purposes of the proceedings have been substantially accomplished.\u201d G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180B.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">These enumerated tasks require the single justice to evaluate carefully any objections presented by interested amici to termination of the receivership against the reasons given by the receiver for concluding that the problems that caused the receivership have been corrected. In making the evaluation, the single justice \u201cmay give such weight as he or she considers appropriate to the receiver\u2019s expertise as commissioner.\u201d <em>American Mutual, supra </em>at 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The single justice has discretion to determine whether he or she should examine the underlying documents relied on by the receiver in recommending termination of the receivership. If, after full hearing, it appears to the informed satisfaction of the single justice from the records of the case and the receiver\u2019s submissions that a judgment terminating the receivership is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>proper, the single justice may direct that the judgment enter. On the other hand, if the receiver\u2019s admissions are uninformative by reason of their conclusory nature or otherwise, then the single justice should not terminate the receivership, but rather should call either for more detailed submissions from the receiver or examine the underlying documents in camera (or both). If the single justice calls for the documents and, after examining them, decides that expert assistance is needed to reach an informed conclusion, he or she may engage such help and charge the costs to the receivership. Further, if the single justice decides, in his or her discretion, that an amicus who had raised a proper objection and shown a valid interest in the proceedings, should review and comment on the documents, the single justice may order that the documents be disclosed to the amicus for confidential review subject, when appropriate, to protective orders and confidentiality agreements that ensure that confidential or proprietary information will be adequately safeguarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">We conclude that the single justice here should have called for the underlying documents or required the commissioner to provide a more detailed explanation of the bases for her conclusory opinions. We do not consider the commissioner\u2019s affidavit and submissions, in light of the record as a whole, to have been sufficient to show, without either further explanation from the commissioner or review of the documents by the single justice, that \u201cthe purposes of the [receivership] proceedings have been substantially accomplished.\u201d Cf. <em>American Mutual, supra </em>at 738 (\u201cTo perform review effectively, the single justice should be provided with the information on which the receiver\u2019s decision to settle was based. The receiver\u2019s conclusory statement in her affidavit supporting approval, that the settlement was \u2018a reasonable exercise of [her] authority\u2019 is not enough. The receiver should open her records for scrutiny [by the single justice]\u201d). For the reasons stated in Part 1 of this opinion, however, the single justice\u2019s decision to allow termination of the receivership will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">3.

Whether remediation of the challenged orders, if ordered, would be impracticable or impossible depends on the type of remediation ordered, an issue that cannot be fully examined or resolved unless or until such remediation is ordered. Such a determination would lie with the single justice. Further, even if the appeal were moot, in our discretion we could hear the appeal. See <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>390 Mass. 780, 783 (1984), and cases cited (recognizing exception to mootness where issue was one of public importance, was fully argued, and was very likely to arise again).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
