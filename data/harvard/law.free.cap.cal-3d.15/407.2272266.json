In <em>People </em>v. <em>Burnick </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 306, 332 [121 Cal.Rptr. 488, 535 P.2d 352], we held that application of the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard is constitutionally compelled in mentally disordered sex offender proceedings. The record in this case does not reflect application of that standard, and we may not assume that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>it was applied. (Cf. <em>In re Paul T. </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 886, 896 [93 Cal.Rptr. 510].) Further, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Feagley </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 338, 376 [121 Cal.Rptr. 509, 535 P.2d 373], we held that the involuntary, indefinite confinement of a civilly committed mentally disordered sex offender in a prison setting violates both the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the corresponding provision of article I, section 17, of the California Constitution. Therefore if, after a new hearing, appellant is again found to be a mentally disordered sex offender, the court must consider the other dispositions available to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The order appealed from is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
