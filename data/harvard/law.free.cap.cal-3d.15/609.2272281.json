Petitioner presently is 69 years old, was admitted to practice in California in April 1953, and has no prior record of discipline in California or in Illinois, where he practiced law from 1930 to 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">The disciplinary board\u2019s. recommendation is based on findings by a local administrative committee of the State Bar that petitioner deliber<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>ately misled the Los Angeles County Superior Court by concealing the existence of a letter pertinent to a request by petitioner before the court. In the language of the disciplinary board\u2019s findings: \u201cIn failing to disclose to the Court the existence or content of the Pick letter, Respondent intended <em>to </em>and willfylly <em>[sic] did </em>in fact mislead the Court in connection with the Court\u2019s determination of Respondent\u2019s petition for approval of a fifty percent contingency fee with reference to Civil Action No. NEC 2141. In concealing these matters from the Court, Respondent withheld from the Court material facts bearing upon issues which were before the Court for decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The local administrative committee concluded that \u201c[petitioner] violated his oath and duties as an attorney and counselor at law within the meaning of Section 6103 ... of the Business and Professions Code[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] .. .; [he] wilfully violated Section 6128 ... of the Business and Professions Code[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] . . and \u201c[he] committed acts involving moral turpitude and dishonesty within the meaning of Section 6106 . . . of the Business and Professions Code [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] .. . .\u201d The local administrative committee then recommended that petitioner be suspended from the practice of law for a period of 90 days. The disciplinary board resolved merely to publicly reprove the petitioner, however, by a vote of eight to five.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">This case springs from a series of actions involving the residence of Mrs. Elizabeth Weber. On March 20, 1957, Mrs. Weber allegedly conveyed her Pasadena home (hereinafter \u201cBrent Avenue Property\u201d) to herself and her sole surviving child, Mrs. Gladys Betty Heitz, by a joint tenancy grant deed. The Brent Avenue Property, valued at about $20,000, was Mrs. Weber\u2019s only substantial asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>On May 20, 1963, Mrs. Weber, by then 74 years old and in a hospital recuperating from a stroke, signed a request that Reverend Thomas A. Williams be appointed temporary conservator for her. Mrs. Heitz, who herself desired to act as her mother\u2019s conservator, contested the proposed appointment of Williams. On September 6, 1963, the matter of the conservatorship of Elizabeth Weber received -a hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court; petitioner Sullins' represented Williams. Following the hearing, the superior court appointed Mr. Williams permanent conservator. The court also questioned the effectiveness of the 1957 joint tenancy grant deed, on the grounds that it never had been delivered.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">On these grounds Mrs. Weber, through her conservator Williams, on November 5, 1963, filed the civil action No. NEC 2141 (hereinafter referred to as the \u201ccivil action\u201d) against Mrs. Heitz, seeking to set aside and cancel the purported March 1957 conveyance of the Brent Avenue Property. Petitioner represented the conservator in this civil action, which on December 20, 1963, resulted in a default judgment against Mrs. Heitz. On April 28, 1964, however, through the efforts of Mr. David Daar, her new counsel, Mrs. Heitz succeeded in having this default judgment set aside, and in securing permission to file an answer to the civil action complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Mrs. Weber died on January 8, 1964, leaving a will dated September 19, 1963, drafted by petitioner. The will named Mrs. Weber\u2019s nephew Bradford Pick as sole beneficiary of her estate, specifically disinherited Mrs. Weber\u2019s daughter, and contained a no contest clause<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which forms the basis for one of petitioner\u2019s contentions. The will was admitted to probate; the court named Williams (whose conservatorship had terminated with Mrs. Weber\u2019s death) executor; petitioner continued to represent Williams. The court also substituted Williams as plaintiff in the civil action, in place of the deceased Mrs. Weber. Except for the possibility of obtaining the Brent Avenue property through success of the civil action, the assets of the estate were no more than about $350, less than the unpaid debts (funeral expenses, etc.).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Mrs. Heitz, represented by Daar, contested the will in a petition filed on April 30, 1964, alleging (inter alia) that at the time Mrs. Weber executed the will she had been incompetent and unduly influenced by Williams. Petitioner Sullins represented the estate in this will contest action. In addition, on or about June 4, 1964, pursuant to his duties as attorney for the executor, petitioner wrote to Mrs. Weber\u2019s nephew Bradford Pick, then age 56 and living in Chicago, Illinois, informing him of Mrs. Weber\u2019s will and the status of the estate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Mr. Pick replied promptly in a notarized letter dated June 9, 1964, stating that he wished Mrs. Heitz to have all property under Mrs. Weber\u2019s will, and that he did not wish Mrs. Heitz to contest the will; the letter also asked petitioner to send Pick for signature any papers needed to carry out Pick\u2019s wishes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s treatment of this letter from Pick is the main basis of the disciplinary board\u2019s findings against petitioner, portions of which findings were quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In particular, petitioner admits: that he did not reply to this letter of Pick\u2019s or otherwise acknowledge its receipt; that he made no effort to inform Mrs. Heitz of its contents; and that he. never disclosed the letter\u2019s receipt or contents to the superior court, which in June 1964 had before it the civil action to set aside the 1957 conveyance, the probate of the Weber estate, and Mrs. Heitz\u2019s contest of her mother\u2019s will. On September 18, 1967, moreover, still without disclosing Pick\u2019s letter, petitioner sought and secured from the court approval of a 50 percent contingency fee agreement for petitioner\u2019s legal services pending in the civil action, explaining that a prior court-approved 331/3 percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>contingency fee agreement was inadequate because the civil action had been and would continue to be fiercely contested.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Shortly before the civil action was scheduled for trial, Pick came to Los Angeles at Daar\u2019s request<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and testified at two depositions, in August and September. 1968. Llis testimony revealed his 1964 exchange of correspondence with petitioner, affirmed that before Daar contacted him in 1968 Pick had never communicated with Mrs. Heitz or Mr. Daar concerning matters connected with Mrs. Weber\u2019s' will, and reaffirmed Pick\u2019s intention to assign his interest in the estate to Mrs. Heitz; indeed Pick executed such an assignment on August 12, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Alluding to Pick\u2019s testimony, Mrs. Heitz petitioned the superior court for removal of the administrator of the estate<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and his attorney (petitioner Sullins). After a full hearing, the court on April 2-3, 1969, ordered the requested removal, and directed the public administrator to administer the estate. The court found that the administrator and petitioner Sullins had \u201c. . . committed a fraud upon the Court, and the Estate . . .\u201d when they presented the new agreement for attorney fees to the court without disclosing the existence of the letter or Pick\u2019s intention to make Mrs. Heitz the assignee of his interest in the estate. The court also found, \u201cThat neither petitioner Gladys Betty Heitz or her attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>learned that Bradford Pick had renounced all interest he had in the Estate in favor of Gladys Betty Heitz until during the month of July of 1968.\u201d The Court of Appeal affirmed the removal order in an unpublished opinion filed April 23, 1970. Petitioner Sullins did not request a rehearing, nor did he petition for a hearing from us.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The disciplinary board\u2019s recommendation rests on the above recital of facts. Petitioner\u2019s numerous lengthy contentions in opposition to the recommendation may be consolidated and summarized as follows: (1) The local administrative committee and the disciplinary board permitted procedural irregularities which denied petitioner due process; in particular, the local administrative committee made findings, adopted by the disciplinary board, which involved matters not included in the State Bar\u2019s notice to show cause, as amended. (2) Mrs. Heitz\u2019s attorney David Daar had himself concealed from the court the existence of Pick\u2019s letter, which Daar had acquired shortly after it was written on June 9, 1964. (3) The no contest clause in the will implied that Pick forfeited his interest in the estate when he wrote petitioner offering to sign his interest over to Mrs. Heitz; alternatively, accepting his inheritance under the will estopped Pick from assigning his interest to Mrs. Heitz and thereby defeating Mrs. Weber\u2019s express disinheritance of her daughter. (4) Petitioner\u2019s duty to the creditors of Mrs. Weber\u2019s estate required him to press the civil action to cancel the deed, irrespective of Pick\u2019s intention to assign his interest in the estate to Mrs. Heitz; indeed, to avoid prejudicing this duty to the creditors, petitioner had to keep Pick\u2019s letter off the court records. These contentions will be examined seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Our standards of review of State Bar disciplinary recommendations are well established.  In determining the appropriate discipline for an attorney\u2019s misconduct, this court independently appraises the evidence and makes its own evaluation, recognizing that the disciplinary board\u2019s findings and recommendations, though not binding, are entitled to great weight <em>(In re Ellis </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 442 at p. 445 [115 Cal.Rptr. 795, 525 P.2d 699]); however, the burden is on petitioner to show that the board\u2019s recommendation is erroneous or unlawful <em>(In re Silverton </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 517 at p. 523 [121 Cal.Rptr. 596, 535 P.2d 724]; 7 Cal.Jur.3d Attorneys At Law, \u00a7 135, pp. 419-420).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s contentions of procedural irregularities fail to meet this burden. State Bar Rules of Procedure applicable to proceedings before a local administrative committee (rule 29) and before the disciplinary board (rule 75) are identical in substance. Rule 29 provides in relevant part that: \u201cNo finding or recommendation of a commitee made in a disciplinary proceeding shall be invalidated ... for error in pleading, or in procedure, . . . unless upon th\u00e9 whole record . . . the board is of the opinion that error has been committed and has resulted or will result in miscarriage of justice.\u201d In <em>Linnick </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1964) 62 Cal.2d 17 at p. 23 [41 Cal.Rptr. 1, 396 P.2d 33], we interpreted rule 29 to mean that a variance between the board\u2019s findings and the notice to show cause would not be regarded as a miscarriage of justice if the petitioner in fact had sufficient notice to eliminate prejudicial surprise in the preparation of his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">There are no grounds for belief that the procedures of the local administrative committee and the disciplinary board in any way prejudiced petitioner\u2019s defense to the charges against him. The hearings of the local administrative committee and the disciplinary board extended from July 12, 1972, to October 10, 1974; during these hearings petitioner was given full opportunity to argue his case and to make his very voluminous exhibits part of the record. All issues involved in the disciplinary board\u2019s findings were thoroughly argued in these hearings, as well as in various memoranda and briefs submitted by petitioner himself <em>prior to </em>the local administrative committee\u2019s report of its findings on May 20, 1974. The notice to show cause was twice amended at the urging of petitioner, in conformity with State Bar Rules of Procedure, rule 30. The violations of Business and Professions Code sections 6103, 6106 and 6128, asserted in the conclusions of the local administrative committee, were charged in the notice to show cause. In its original as well as its amended versions! the notice to show cause unmistakably charged that petitioner had concealed the existence of Pick\u2019s letter' from the superior court; this concealment was a major element in the disciplinary board\u2019s findings. We conclude there is no merit to petitioner\u2019s first contention that he was denied due process by variances between the notice to show cause and the board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Petitioner\u2019s second contention, that Mrs. Heitz\u2019s attorney David Daar had himself concealed knowledge of Pick\u2019s letter from the court, is irrelevant to the basic issue before this court, namely whether petitioner deserves discipline.  As we said in <em>Demain </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 381 at page 386 [90 Cal.Rptr. 420, 475 P.2d 652], \u201cIt has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>uniformly held that the purpose of a disciplinary proceeding is not to punish the attorney but to inquire into the moral fitness of an officer of the court to continue in that capacity, and to afford protection to the public, the courts and the legal profession.\u201d  Our decision in the present inquiry would not be affected even if it were proved that Daar had concealed knowledge of Pick\u2019s letter. On these grounds alone, petitioner\u2019s second contention is wholly without merit for the purposes of the. instant proceedings. Moreover, in actuality the contention that Daar acquired a copy of Pick\u2019s June 9, 1964, letter shortly after it was written is against the weight of the evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We therefore reject, as pointless and against the evidence, petitioner\u2019s contention that Daar also concealed the existence of Pick\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Petitioner\u2019s third contention\u2014that Pick\u2019s letter violated the no contest clause in the will, or alternatively that Pick was estopped from assigning his interest to Mrs. Heitz\u2014is used by petitioner as an argument against the disciplinary board\u2019s finding, quoted earlier, that when he sought the 50 percent contingency fee agreement in September 1967 he withheld the material fact of Pick\u2019s letter from the court. Petitioner\u2019s argument is that since either of the above alternatives would prevent Pick from assigning the Brent Avenue Property to Mrs. Heitz, the letter actually was not material to issues before the court in September 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">We find this argument much more ingenious than convincing. This third contention of petitioner\u2019s, concerning which the disciplinary board made no specific finding, will not meet the board\u2019s findings and charges that he intentionally deceived the court unless petitioner in September 1967 thought Pick had forfeited his claim to the estate, or believed that Pick was not free to assign his inheritance to Mrs. Heitz. There is no evidence that petitioner so thought or believed in September 1967; there is-good evidence to the contrary.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, though we question, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>claims that Pick\u2019s letter (see fn. 8, <em>ante, </em>p. 615) violated the no contest clause (see fn. 6, <em>ante, </em>p. 614), or that the will estopped Pick\u2019s assignment of his interest to Mrs. Heitz, we need not rule on the legitimacy of these claims. We conclude that petitioner\u2019s third contention, embodying these claims, is no defense to the disciplinary board\u2019s findings and charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Petitioner\u2019s fourth and last contention, that his duty to the estate\u2019s creditors required him to withhold Pick\u2019s letter from the court, is offered as a defense to the local administrative committee\u2019s finding that petitioner . . intended to and did in fact mislead the Court.\u201d The local administrative committee rejected this defense after full discussion, and incorporated into its findings the language that petitioner . . had committed a fraud upon the Court,\u201d used by the court which ordered petitioner\u2019s removal as \u00e1ttorney for the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The disciplinary board accepted this language, and also accepted the language of the Court of Appeal which in April 1970 affirmed the removal order: \u201cThe issue before the court on the petition for removal was not one of reweighing the issue of employment of counsel to recover the property; it was whether material facts bearing on the proposed contingent fee contract had been withheld from the court.\u201d Although the board did not specifically adopt the local administrative committee\u2019s conclusions, petitioner as an attorney is bound by the Business and Professions Code. Business and Professions Code sections 6068, subdivision (d) and 6128, subdivision (a) <em>unqualifiedly </em>require an attorney to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>refrain from acts which mislead or deceive the court (see fns. 1 and 2, <em>ante, </em>p. 613); petitioner admits he did not disclose the letter\u2019s receipt or its contents to the court. We conclude that petitioner\u2019s fourth contention concerning his duty to the estate\u2019s creditors is no defense to the charge that he intentionally deceived the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In summary, petitioner\u2019s contentions, taken as a whole, fail to meet his burden <em>(In re Silverton </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 517, atp. 523 [121 Cal.Rptr. 596, 535 P.2d 724]) of showing that the board\u2019s recommendation is erroneous or unlawful.  We still must make our independent evaluation of the appropriateness of the board\u2019s recommended discipline however; petitioner\u2019s only request concerning the degree of discipline is that the charges against him be entirely dismissed. The main finding against petitioner is that he intentionally misled the court. The amended notice, to show cause and the board\u2019s findings imply petitioner misled the court for his own gain, an implication accepted by the State Bar;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> petitioner\u2019s fourth contention claims the deception stemmed from his conceived duty to the estate\u2019s creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The rule is: \u201cCharges of unprofessional conduct on the part of an attorney should be sustained by convincing proof and to a reasonable certainty, and reasonable doubts must be resolved in the attorney\u2019s favor\u201d <em>(Bluestein </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 162 at p. 168 [118 Cal.Rptr. 175, 529 P.2d 599]).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>We need not pass upon the issue of whether the petitioner misled the court \u201cfor his own gain,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> because we have concluded that petitioner\u2019s conduct in misleading the court, in itself, called for discipline. Although in analogous cases the discipline imposed has been more severe,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the disciplinary board, in recommending public reproval, undoubtedly took into account the petitioner\u2019s age, his previous 45-year unblemished record as an attorney, and has had the advantage of personal observation of petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Under these circumstances we are satisfied that a public reproval constitutes an appropriate discipline. It is therefore ordered that Paul Goodsell Sullins be publicly reproved by publication of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Petitioner\u2019s application for a rehearing was denied December 30, 1975.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Section 6103 states in part: . . any violation of the oath taken by him, or of his duties as such attorney, constitute causes for disbarment or suspension.\u201d According to Business and Professions Code section 6068: \u201cIt is the duty of an attorney: . . . (d) . . . never to seek to mislead the judge or any judicial officer by an artifice or false statement of fact or law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Section 6128 states: \u201cEvery attorney is guilty of a misdemeanor who ...: (a) Is guilty of any deceit or collusion, or consents to any deceit or collusion, with intent to deceive the court or any party.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b627-10\">According to section 6106: \u201cThe commission of any act involving moral turpitude, dishonesty or corruption,... constitutes a cause for disbarment or suspension.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b627-11\">The five dissenting board members felt that the degree of discipline imposed by the recommended public reproof was insufficient; two of these dissenters stated that the board should recommend petitioner be suspended from the practice of law for 30 days.

On September 14, 1970, the superior court entered summary judgment for Mrs. Heitz in the civil action, finding that Mrs. Weber had, in fact, properly delivered the deed to her daughter; the public administrator represented the plaintiff estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\">We reach this conclusion without having to give the required great weight to the evidence supporting the findings of the local administrative committee, who were able to observe the demeanor of witnesses <em>(Sampson </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 70 at p. 74 [115 Cal.Rptr. 43, 524 P.2d 139].) Petitioner does'not explain away Pick\u2019s uncontradicted testimony that he never had mailed a copy of his letter to either Mrs. Heitz or Mr. Daar, and indeed never had heard of Daar before 1968; petitioner does not accuse Pick of untruthfulness or failure of memory. We remarked earlier that the court which in April 1969 ordered petitioner\u2019s removal as attorney for the estate agreed that Mrs. Heitz and Daar had not learned of Pick\u2019s letter until 1968; petitioner\u2019s arguments in this regard were aired before that court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b633-8\">At no time did petitioner notify Pick that Pick\u2019s June 1964 letter risked forfeiture of his inheritance, or that Pick\u2019s intended assignment to Mrs. Heitz of his interest might be barred by the will. In May 1967, when appointment of Hubbell as administrator with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>will annexed was first requested (see fn. 11, <em>ante, </em>p. 616), petitioner Sullins certified that he served \u201cNotice of Hearing upon BRADFORD PICK, the legatee and devisee named in the decedent\u2019s will\u201d; no notices were served on other potential devisees, though such service would be expected if petitioner believed Pick had forfeited his inheritance. Petitioner referred to this \u201cNOTICE upon BRADFORD PICK\u201d in his May 1, 1972 answer to the State Bar\u2019s original notice to show cause, saying: \u201cIt is thus seen that the fact that I heard nothing whatsoever from Pick in response to my notice to him of May 8, 1967, and his subsequent letter of December 9, 1967, show[s] that he had long since abandoned any supposed idea of conveying his interest to Gladys Betty Heitz, if he ever had any such intention,, which I deny, and was content that the action against her be continued unabated.\u201d In this same answer petitioner also stated, \u201cI deny that Pick\u2019s letter of June 9, 1964, represented his intention to relinquish his interest in the estate to Gladys Betty Heitz.\u201d The theory that Pick was estopped from assigning his interest to Mrs. Heitz was not advanced by petitioner in any of his many prolix written memoranda and statement to the disciplinary board. A related theory, that Mrs. Heitz was estopped from becoming an assignee of Pick was first advanced by petitioner on September 12, 1974, in his supplemental statement in opposition to the report of the local administrative committee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Paragraph Five of the amended notice to show cause states: \u201cNotwithstanding Mr. Pick\u2019s stated intention to relinquish his total interest, as sole beneficiary, in said estate to said Gladys Betty Heitz, you counseled and encouraged the continuance of said civil lawsuit against Gladys Betty Heitz because of your contingent fee interest therein.\u201d Paragraph Fifteen of the board\u2019s findings states: \u201cOn April 23, 1969, the Court . . . granting the petition for removal.. . found, inter alia, that Respondent had committed a fraud upon the Court in his failure to disclose the existence or content of the Bradford Pick letter to the Court and in the mismanagement of the Estate.\u201d The phrase \u201cmismanagement of the Estate\u201d is a reference to Daar\u2019s trial brief in this removal action, which argued that whereas the litigation to cancel the deed was needed to pay at most $2,000 in claims against the estate, successful cancellation of the deed would leave the estate and ultimately Mrs. Heitz (through Pick\u2019s assignment to her of his interest) with no more than half of the $20,000 value of the Brent Avenue Property, because half would go to petitioner Sullins as his fee. \u201cThis,\u201d said Daar\u2019s brief, \u201cis mismanagement, constructive fraud, waste of property of the Estate in maintaining such action, and wholly inequitable.\u201d The State Bar\u2019s brief in the instant case, citing the fact that the civil action eventually resulted in summary judgment for Mrs. Heitz, asserts: \u201cThe evidence irresistably establishes that Petitioner deceived the court, and that he did so with a view to his own financial gain.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The court which appointed a conservator for Mrs. Weber in September 1963 questioned the effectiveness of Mrs. Heitz\u2019s deed and recommended the civil action against her. (See fn. 5, <em>ante, </em>p. 614.) The Court of Appeal which in April 1970 affirmed the removal order wrote: \u201cMr. Pick\u2019s letter did not absolve appellant Hubbell of the statutory duty to take possession of all of the decedent\u2019s estate and collect all debts due her (Prob. Code, \u00a7 571) in order that the expenses of administration and debts of the estate could be paid (Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 951 and 952). While Mr. Pick could assign his interest in the estate, he could not free it from the process of administration. The mere fact that he no longer claimed an interest in debts owing to the estate did not free its representative from the duty to collect them. If Gladys Heitz held property belonging to the estate, it was appellant Hubbell\u2019s duty to gain possession thereof and only redistribute it to her in due course of administration, after all disbursements from the estate had been made in compliance with the law. The existence of the letter from Mr. Pick was therefore of no relevance to the determination of whether recovery of the asset was in the best interests of the estate. The failure to disclose it, however, constituted fraud under Probate Code section 521.\u201d Moreover, Daar\u2019s brief (see fn. 15, <em>ante, </em>p. 621) did not point out that the fee Daar had arranged with Mrs. Heitz in April 1964, before petitioner Sullins received Pick\u2019s letter, was an unqualified half share in Mrs. Heitz\u2019s interest in the Brent Avenue Property; thus, despite the eventual dismissal of the civil action, Mrs. Heitz ultimately retained only half the value of the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\">There are few not outdated cases solely involving intentional deception of the court by an attorney not for his own gain, wherein the attorney had no prior record of misconduct. In <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 367 [246 P.2d 931], petitioner received a 60-day suspension for withholding from the probate court knowledge he had concerning the execution of a will when he presented an allegation of intestacy; petitioner was attempting to advance his client\u2019s interests. In <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 141 [148 P.2d 1], petitioner received a year\u2019s suspension for knowingly filing a complaint asserting facts he knew to be untrue, although apparently without motive of personal gain. In <em>Paine </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1939) 14 Cal.2d 150 [93 P.2d 103], petitioner was suspended for six months for misleading the court by filing a false document in a probate proceeding, without any finding of intent to personally profit thereby.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
