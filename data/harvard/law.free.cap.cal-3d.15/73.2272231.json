Code, \u00a7 23101) and vehicular manslaughter (Pen. Code, \u00a7 192, subd. 3(a)), petitioner seeks a writ of mandate directing respondent superior court to suppress a blood sample withdrawn from him without warrant or consent following <em>a- </em>fatal traffic accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">Respondent court first granted petitioner\u2019s suppression motion, then \u2014upon reconsideration\u2014denied it. The initial order was entered at the conclusion of a special hearing conducted pursuant to subdivision (i) of section 1538.5 of the Penal Code. A week later, the People moved to \u201creopen and reconsider\u201d the 1538.5 motion on grounds that \u201cthrough haste and inadvertence important areas of inquiry were not fully explored and that there is substantial likelihood that the court\u2019s ruling may have been different had the court been made aware of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>additional evidence.\u201d The court granted the motion, setting the matter for another special hearing. After a considerable delay, caused in part by petitioner\u2019s efforts to obtain a writ restraining it from doing so, the court reversed itself by vacating its original order and denying the suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">The question presented by this case is whether the court, having once . granted petitioner\u2019s 1538.5 motion, had jurisdiction to reconsider it <em>prior to trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Section 1538.5 does not confer such jurisdiction. Subdivision (j) provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf defendant\u2019s motion is granted at a special hearing in the superior court, the people, if they have additional evidence relating to the motion and not presented at the special hearing, shall have the right to show good cause <em>at the trial </em>why such evidence was not presented at the special hearing and why the prior ruling at the special hearing should not be binding ....\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In addition to the untimeliness of their motion, the People failed to satisfy at least one other statutory condition precedent to reconsideration. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the People possessed <em>additional evidence </em>to introduce at the second hearing, they failed to show <em>good cause </em>why such evidence had not been introduced at the first hearing. After the People made their offer of proof in support of their motion to reopen, the court asked the district attorney, \u201cWere all the facts you now mention known to the officer at the time the arrest was made?\u201d He admitted they were. The reasons then given for failure to present the additional evidence at the first hearing\u2014haste and inadvertence\u2014do not constitute the requisite good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">However, the People contend compliance with subdivision (j) was not required because the court possesses <em>inherent power </em>to reconsider its order during the 30-day period for review by writ of mandate or prohibition under subdivision (o). The People\u2019s position is supported by dictum in <em>People </em>v. <em>Krivda </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 357, 363-364 [96 Cal.Rptr. 62, 486 P.2d 1262] (reiterated (1973) 8 Cal.3d 623 [105 Cal.Rptr. 521, 504 P.2d 457]).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The question actually decided in <em>Krivda </em>was whether the superior court, having <em>denied </em>a 1538.5 motion at a special hearing, has jurisdiction to reconsider it <em>prior to trial but after the expiration of the 30-day period for review by writ. </em>A related question\u2014whether the superior court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>having denied a 1538.5 motion at a special hearing, has jurisdiction to reconsider it <em>at trial, </em>had been considered in <em>People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 394 [78 Cal.Rptr. 202, 79 Cal.Rptr. 313, 456 P.2d 969],</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Finding no authorization in section 1538.5 for reconsideration at trial of a suppression motion previously denied at a special hearing, <em>O\u2019Brien </em>construed the statute to prohibit such reconsideration. \u201cThe statute is explicit on this point, declaring in subdivision (m) that \u2018The proceedings provided for in this section [and other sections not here relevant] . . . shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedies prior to conviction to test the unreasonableness of a search or seizure. . . .\u2019 Indeed, contrary to the apparent understanding of the parties below, we construe the statute to prohibit the renewal of such a motion at trial if it has previously been made in pretrial proceedings. Subdivision (h) provides that \u2018If, prior to the trial of a felony or misdemeanor, opportunity for this motion did not exist or the defendant was not aware of the grounds for the motion,, the defendant shall have the right to make this motion during the course of trial in the municipal, justice or superior court. Furthermore, the court in its discretion may entertain the motion during the course of the trial.\u2019 By contrast, subdivision (i) expressly grants a defendant the right to \u2018renew or make\u2019 the motion at a special hearing even though he may already have so moved at his preliminary examination (see subd. (f)).- By omitting the word \u2018renew\u2019 from subdivision (h), the Legislature must have intended to limit the operation of that provision to instances in which the motion is \u2018made\u2019 or \u2018entertained\u2019 for the first time at trial.\u201d (71 Cal.2d at p. 403.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Edmonds) </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 605 [94 Cal.Rptr. 250, 483 P.2d 1202] reaffirmed <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>pointing out that \u201cthe intent underlying [section 1538.5] was to reduce the unnecessary waste of judicial time and effort involved in the prior procedures, whereby search and seizure questions could be repeatedly raised in criminal proceedings.\u201d (4 Cal.3d at p. 610, citing 22 Assem. Interim Com. Rep. No. 12 (1965-1967) p. 13, 2 Appendix Assem. J. (1967 Reg. Sess.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Relying on <em>O\u2019Brien </em>and <em>Edmonds, Krivda </em>held that the superior court lacks jurisdiction to consider a renewed suppression motion prior to trial, following the 30-day period within which to seek extraordinary relief. \u201c[I]t seems apparent from the language of subdivision (i) of section 1538.5 that the Legislature, in order to reduce the time spent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>relitigating search and seizure questions, intended that the court\u2019s order denying a motion to suppress should, in the absence of a timely request for extraordinary appellate relief, become final 30 days thereafter and not subject to further review until an appeal is taken following trial. Otherwise considerable judicial time could be expended in rehearing and redetermining matters which had already been fully litigated, thereby possibly delaying the trial of the case.\u201d (5 Cal.3d at p. 363.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">However, <em>Krivda </em>continued by dictum\u2014now relied on by the People\u2014that \u201cuntil the 30-day period has expired and the order has become final, the court should have the inherent power, prior to trial, to reconsider and \u2018reopen\u2019 its prior ruling.\u201d (5 Cal.3d at p. 363.) The only authority cited in support of this proposition was <em>People </em>v. <em>Leighter </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 389, 393-395 [93 Cal.Rptr. 136], Not mentioned in this regard were <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Green) </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 477 [89 Cal.Rptr. 223]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, a case <em>Leighter </em>went to great pains to distinguish, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Dubose </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 43 [94 Cal.Rptr. 376], decided after <em>Leighter </em>but before <em>Krivda. Green </em>and <em>Dubose </em>are clearly inconsistent with the <em>Krivda </em>dictum. \u201cUnder [section 1538.5] a defendant is entitled to make only one pretrial motion to suppress evidence in the superior court; if it is denied his only remedy is, within 30 days, to seek a writ of mandate or prohibition from this court; if he is unsuccessful and the evidence sought to be suppressed is used against him resulting in conviction he may further pursue his remedy by appeal from the judgment upon which further; review of the validity of the search or seizure may be had. He is not entitled to a second hearing on the motion prior to trial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Green), supra, </em>10 Cal.App.3d at p. 481, citation omitted; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Dubose, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.3d at p. 47.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Upon further consideration, we conclude that the intent of the legislation is better served by the <em>Green-Dubose </em>rule.  Therefore, disapproving <em>Leighter </em>and the <em>Krivda </em>dictum, we hold that determination of a 1538.5 motion at a special hearing in the superior court\u2014 whether in the defendant\u2019s or in the People\u2019s favor\u2014deprives that court of jurisdiction to reconsider the matter unless the People, pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>subdivision (j), seek to reopen the matter <em>at trial </em>upon a showing of good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The writ is issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Wright, C. J., McComb, J., Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., Sullivan, J., and Richardson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-6\"><em>Green </em>was mentioned at an earlier point in Krivda, in support of the proposition that no renewal of a suppression motion should be permitted following the expiration of the 30-day period for seeking extraordinary relief. <em>Green </em>did involve more than a 30-day delay. However, the opinion attaches no significance to that fact, simply holding that a renewed motion, whenever made, is beyond the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
