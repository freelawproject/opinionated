The defendant disagrees, claiming that the recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>of prejudgment interest in this case should be limited to the average 52-week U.S. Treasury Bonds or Notes for the relevant period, in this case 5.29%.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Although a trial court has discretion to set a prejudgment interest rate at less than 9% per annum against public entities, the statutory interest rate is presumed fair and reasonable <em>(see Rodriguez v New York City Hous. Auth., </em>91 NY2d 76 [1997]). To overcome the presumption, a defendant must show that prevailing market rates in both public and private securities are significantly lower than the 9% statutory interest rate <em>(see Matter of New York State Urban Dev. Corp., </em>293 AD2d 354 [2002]; <em>Auer v State of New York, </em>283 AD2d 122 [2001]). The defendant failed to submit sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that the statutory rate of 9% was fair and reasonable. Its showing solely addressed the rates of return for riskless public securities and the rate of return it received on its investments <em>(see Balsam v City of New York, </em>298 AD2d 479 [2002]). Therefore, the plaintiff was entitled to prejudgment interest at the statutory rate of 9% per annum. Altman, J.E, Florio, Luciano and Mastro, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
