App. \u00a7 462. He appeals, invoking the jurisdiction conferred upon us by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">On October 31, 1960, Petrie registered with Local Board No. 82, North Hollywood, California. On July 16, 1963, the local board .received from him a Classification Questionnaire (SSS Form No. 100). In his answers to this questionnaire, Petrie claimed to be a conscientious objector and to have been a minister of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses since June 1954. He did not list any dependents but did indicate that he had been employed for one month as an aircraft landing field employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">On August 5, 1963, the local board received from Petrie a completed Special Form for Conscientious Objector (SSS Form No. 150), wherein Petrie again claimed to be a conscientious objector. On November 6, 1963, however, the local board classified Petrie as available for military service (class I-A). Petrie promptly appealed this classification, and ultimately, on June 24, 1965, the appeal board classified him as a conscientious objector available for civilian work contributing to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest (class I-O).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">During the period when his administrative appeal was pending, Petrie supplied the local board with a substantial amount of additional information relating to his classification status. Following his receipt of an order to report for an armed services physical examination, Petrie, on December 29, 1964, mailed a letter to the local board informing it that his father had been killed in a plane crash on December 10, 1964. He further informed the board that his father had left over a quarter of a million dollars in debts, that he was then the only means of support for his mother, and that he was attempting to obtain a commercial pilot\u2019s license, which he expected to receive in three or four weeks. On the basis of these facts, Petrie requested a reclassification of his draft status. In response, the local board notified Petrie that it was in receipt of the information and that it warranted \u201creconsideration\u201d of his selective service status. Soon thereafter, however, the board informed Petrie that no decision would be made upon his request until the appeal board had decided the outcome of his pending appeal concerning his claim to be a conscientious objector.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">On January 22, 1965, Petrie again wrote the local board, requesting a III-A classification due to hardship. He stated not only that he supported his mother, but also that he contributed to the support of his grandmother. He also stated that he was at that time preparing to obtain a flight instructor\u2019s rating. The local board notified Petrie that no action would be taken on his request for a hardship classification until his earlier appeal had been resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">On February 2, 1965, the local board received a letter from Valley Pilots Flying Service explaining that Petrie was at that time taking \u201cextensive training * * * in preparation for his commercial and instructor\u2019s ratings.\u201d On March 10, 1965, Valley Pilots Flying Service further informed the board that it was expected that Petrie would complete the course for a flight instructor\u2019s license by May 9, 1965. On May 3, 1965, Petrie reported for his armed services physical examination and was found acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">As indicated previously, on June 24, 1965, Petrie was placed in class 1-0 by the appeal board. Thereafter, the local board requested that Petrie complete and return a Dependency Questionnaire (SSS Form No. 118). This form, received by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>the board on July 6, 1965, revealed that Petrie was then employed as a flight instructor and was earning $140.00 per week. Petrie listed his mother as being wholly or partially dependent upon him for support and stated that he contributed $450.00 per month for her support.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On July 12, 1965, the board notified Petrie that \u201cthe facts presented do not warrant the reopening or reclassification of your case at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Following this decision, the board received a letter from an attorney whom Petrie had employed. The letter stated that Petrie would soon thereafter file new materials in support of his claims and would make a formal request for reopening of his classification. On August 2, 1965, another letter from the attorney arrived, accompanied by several letters and other documents. In one letter, Petrie\u2019s mother expanded upon the previous information which he had supplied in regard to the fact that his mother and grandmother were dependent upon him. The mother explained, among other things, that the insurance money received following her husband\u2019s death had been used to pay off a number of expenses and debts and to finance Petrie\u2019s flight education. Petrie\u2019s mother also stated that she was earning about sixty dollars per month as a voice teacher and that Petrie\u2019s grandmother was living with her. Other letters accompanying the attorney\u2019s cover letter revealed that there were no assets in Petrie\u2019s father\u2019s estate, that Petrie had been employed by the Valley Pilots Flying Service as a full-time flight instructor since April 1, 1965, and that Petrie was currently completing a course of instruction leading to a rating for helicopter instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">On October 27, 1965, the board received two additional letters from the Valley Pilots Flying Service. These letters recited that Petrie was employed by Valley Pilots as a flight instructor and that his services were extremely valuable to that organization.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On November 3, 1965, Petrie met with the local board and submitted thirty additional letters written in support of his deferment claims by persons acquainted with him and his family. Additionally, on that date letters were received from Petrie, his mother, and Valley Pilots Flying Service. Following a meeting with Petrie, however, the local board determined that his classification was proper, and on November 4, 1966, the board notified Petrie and the other interested parties that the board was of the opinion \u201cthat the facts presented do not warrant the reopening of the registrant\u2019s classification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>The foregoing recitation embraces all the facts which are necessary to an understanding of the disposition to be made on this appeal. Other facts are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Petrie contends that the District Court erred in denying his Motion for Judgment of Acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">It is appropriate first to dispose of the contention that \u201cthe appeal board improperly classified appellant 1-0 in June, 1965, because the local board failed to notify * * * [the appeal board] of the intervening facts that removed appellant from consideration for Class 1-0 and entitled him to classification in Class III-A.\u201d Since the appeal board would have been precluded from considering any such additional information outside the record forwarded to it at the time of the appeal, this contention is devoid of merit. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1626.14, 1626.24(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">Petrie also contends that he was denied due process of law in that the board refused to reopen his classification after a \u201cde facto reopening\u201d had occurred on December 31, 1964. This con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>tention is based upon the fact that on that date, following Petrie\u2019s notification to the board of his father\u2019s death, a clerk of the board had sent Petrie a form letter stating in part that \u201c[w]e are in receipt of information which warrants reconsideration of your Selective Service status by this Local Board * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As noted previously, soon after this letter was sent, the board had again written Petrie, stating that the board had considered his request and had determined that \u201cno decision will be made on your request until your appeal has been resolved on your conscientious objection claim * * In view of these facts, it is manifest that no reopening, \u201cde facto\u201d or otherwise, of Petrie\u2019s classification occurred during this period of time. <em>See </em>32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1625.4, 1625:11-13. The mere use of the word \u201creconsideration\u201d in the letter from the local board cannot change this conclusion, particularly where, as here, there was no reliance, to his detriment, on Petrie\u2019s part. We turn, therefore, to Petrie\u2019s contention that, assuming the truth of the facts presented to the local board, the decision not to reopen his classification was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The applicable Selective Service Regulations provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">\u201cThe local board may reopen and consider anew the classification of a registrant (a) upon the written request of the registrant, the government appeal agent, any person who claims to be a dependent of the registrant, or any person who has on file a written request for the current deferment of the registrant in a case involving occupational deferment, if such request is accompanied by written information presenting facts not considered when the registrant was classified, which, if true, would justify a change in the registrant\u2019s classification * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-11\">\u201cWhen a registrant, any person who claims to be a dependent of a registrant, any person who has on file a written request for the current deferment of the registrant in a case involving occupational deferment, or the government appeal agent files with the local board a written request to reopen and consider anew the registrant\u2019s classification and the local board is of the opinion that the information accompanying such request fails to present any facts in addition to those considered when the registrant was classified or, even if new facts are presented, the local board is of the opinion that such facts, if true, would not justify a change in such registrant\u2019s classification, it shall not reopen the registrant\u2019s classification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASE\">32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.4. The essential question, therefore, is whether Petrie presented to the local board, in writing, facts \u201cwhich, if true, would justify a change\u201d in his classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">Our scope of review as to actions of the local board is well defined. However strongly we may disagree with the appropriateness of an action taken by the local board, we may overturn that action only if it has \u201cno basis in fact.\u201d Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 122, 66 S.Ct. 423, 90 L.Ed. 567 (1946); <em>see </em>Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 75 S.Ct. 392, 99 L.Ed. 428 (1955) ; Dickinson v. United States, 346 U.S. 389, 74 S.Ct. 152, 98 L.Ed. 132 (1953). While in most cases the \u201cbasis in fact\u201d test is applied to the final classification action of the local board, it is equally applicable to a refusal by the board to reopen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the registrant\u2019s classification.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> United States v. Ransom, 223 F.2d 15 (7th Cir. 1955); <em>accord, </em>Stain v. United States, 235 F.2d 339, 343 (9th Cir. 1956); United States v. Burlich, 257 F.Supp. 906, 911 (S.D.N.Y. 1966); United States v. Majher, 250 F.Supp. 106, 110 (S.D.W.Va.1966); <em>see </em>Klubnikin v. United States, 227 F.2d 87, 89 (9th Cir. 1955), <em>cert. denied, </em>350 U.S. 975, 76 S.Ct. 453, 100 L.Ed. 846 (1965) ; <em>cf. </em>United States v. Ruppell, 278 F.Supp. 287, 290 (E.D.N.Y. 1968). Judge Hamley of our court has expressed the rule concisely: \u201cRefusal of a local board to reopen on the ground that the newly-asserted facts would not justify a change in classification may be set aside if such refusal has no basis in fact.\u201d Woo v. United States, 350 F.2d 992, 996 (9th Cir. 1965) (Hamley, J., dissenting on other grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">This definition of our scope of review over the local board\u2019s refusal to reopen a registrant\u2019s classification is also in accord with our recent decision in Miller v. United States, 388 F.2d 973 (9th Cir. 1967). There the official minutes of the local board made it apparent that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">\u201c[t]he local board did not deal with the alleged facts or evidence of appellant\u2019s conscientious objector form as a question of whether this legally could provide basis for a reopening to be made, so as to entitle consideration and evaluation to be engaged in thereafter under the general classification procedure of the regulations. It shortcut the situation by directly proceeding, without purporting to reopen, to a consideration of whether appellant was entitled to a conscientious objector classification on the merits of the probative elements of its file. It weighed the information contained in appellant\u2019s form against other probative factors * * * and arrived at the judgment that he was not in truth a conscientious objector but was merely \u2018seeking to avoid induction.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">\u201cThis was action amounting to a determination of the question of classification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">Miller v. United States, 388 F.2d at 976. As the quoted statement indicates and as the court explained,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Miller </em>is premised on the rationale that the local board followed an improper procedure in reviewing the registrant\u2019s request by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>means of inapplicable standards, thereby violating a procedural right which the <em>Miller </em>court, under the facts before it, equated with infringement of the right of due process. Thus the court concluded: \u201cThe test of whether an administrative result has a basis in fact cannot be given application to sustain a result which has been arrived at by invalid procedural processes.\u201d 388 F.2d at 977. In <em>Miller, </em>therefore, the court did not reach the issue of whether there was basis in fact to support the refusal to reopen.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Here, however, we are directly confronted with the problem of whether or not the board erred in concluding that the registrant had failed to present to the board facts \u201cwhich, if true, would justify a change\u201d in his classification.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"> As applied to an action of the local board in refusing to reopen a classification pursuant to a registrant\u2019s request, the basis in fact test is substan-</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">tially different in degree from that applied to the board\u2019s final classification decision. As to the latter action, basis in fact consists of \u201csome proof\u201d \u2014 something which may be less than substantial evidence \u2014 to support the <em>evaluative classification decision. </em>Dickinson v. United States, 346 U.S. 389, 396, 74 S.Ct. 152, 98 L.Ed. 132 (1953). In comparison, the Regulations governing reopening, quoted <em>supra, </em>have been construed to require only that the registrant present to the local board a \u201cprima facie case\u201d supporting his request for placement in another classification. <em>E. g., </em>Stain v. United States, 235 F.2d 339, 342 (9th Cir. 1956). Thus, \u201crefusal to reopen has no basis in fact if the written request to reopen sets forth a prima facie case for reclassification and if it contains some allegations of fact in addition to those considered when the registrant was originally classified.\u201d Woo v. United States, 350 F.2d 992, 997 (9th Cir. 1965) (Hamley, J., dissenting on other grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>New courts have attempted to define that which was meant by the <em>Stain </em>court when it employed the term \u201cprima facie case.\u201d One District Court explained that \u201c[t]he Board is mandated into at least looking at the facts as stated, considering whether it has previously known those facts when its prior classification was made and considering whether the facts stated, if true, would, to <em>any </em>reasonable mind, justify a reclassification.\u201d United States v. Longworth, 269 F.Supp. 971, 974 (S.D.Ohio 1967) (emphasis in original). While our court recently indicated in <em>Miller, </em>discussed <em>supra, </em>that when the new information received must be \u201cweighed * * * against other probative factors,\u201d then a reopening is necessary, Miller v. United States, 388 F.2d at 976, this suggestion does not mean that the board is required to reopen when all reasonable men would agree that the new claim was frivolous or that the alleged facts would not justify reclassification.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Although it might be properly determined in reopened proceedings that the registrant was not entitled to placement in the newly requested classification, the registrant\u2019s right to a reopening is not an insignificant right. The Regulations provide no means for administrative review of a local board\u2019s decision not to reopen a registrant\u2019s classification. <em>E. g., </em>Stain v. United States, 235 F.2d 339, 343 (9th Cir. 1956). In contrast, \u201c[w]hen the local board reopens the registrant\u2019s classification, it shall consider the new information which it has received and shall again classify the registrant in the same manner as if he had never before been classified.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.11. The Regulations specifically grant to the registrant the right thereafter to take his case to the appeal board. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.13. The registrant\u2019s important right to administrative review of the local board\u2019s <em>evaluative </em>decisions is thereby expressly preserved. These are the reasons which make it obligatory for the board to reopen upon the presentation of a prima facie showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">We now turn to the question of whether there was basis in fact to support the board\u2019s determination that Petrie did not present a prima facie case to the board \u2014that is, that he did not present facts \u201cwhich, if true, would justify a change\u201d in his classification to either class II-A, class <em>II-S, or </em>class III-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">THE II-A CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">The Selective Service Regulations provide that \u201c[i]n Class II-A shall be placed any registrant whose employment in industry, or other occupation or employment, * * * is found to be necessary to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 162.22(a). Additionally, the Regulations provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">\u201ca registrant\u2019s employment in industry or other occupation * * * shall be considered to be necessary to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest only when all of the! following conditions exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">\u201c(1) The registrant is, or but for a seasonal or temporary interruption would be, engaged in such activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-13\">\u201c(2) The registrant cannot be replaced because of a shortage of persons with his qualifications or skill in such activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-14\">\u201c(3) The removal of the registrant would cause a material loss of effectiveness in such activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-15\">32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.23(a). Eligibility for the II-A classification requires, therefore, not only that the essential character of the occupation be such as to make it \u201cnecessary to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest,\u201d but also that the three enumerated conditions, relating to the employment of the specific registrant, be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-16\">The information presented to the board was generally that Petrie was employed by the Valley Pilots Flying Service as a flight instructor, that he was a \u201cvalued employee,\u201d and that his being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>drafted would result in \u201cgreat loss\u201d to the company. This was not enough. Clearly, there was basis in fact for a determination that Petrie did not. make a prima facie showing as to the second of the enumerated conditions, namely, that he could not be replaced as a flight instructor. In fact, no information relating directly to that fact was presented to the board. Both the Flying Service and Petrie represented to the board that, once Petrie had obtained his rating as a helicopter instructor, which he was expected to obtain by the end of November 1965, he would become irreplaceable since he would be the only employee of the Flying Service capable of both ordinary flight and helicopter instruction. Assuming that such a combination of skills in one person would in fact have established that Petrie would be irreplaceable by his employer, the loc\u00e1l board was not required to reopen and consider Petrie\u2019s new request for II-A classification when it was apparent that one of the prescribed conditions did not then exist and would come about, if at all, at some future time. Thus, although it may have been within the discretionary power of the local board to reopen on the basis of the asserted facts as to Petrie\u2019s occupation, we hold that there was basis in fact for the conclusion that Petrie had failed to make the required prima facie showing in regard to his II-A claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">THE II-S CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">At the relevant time, section 1622.25 (a) of the Regulations provided that \u201c[i]n Class II-S shall be placed any registrant whose activity in study is found to be necessary to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest.\u201d E.O. 10984, 27 Fed.Reg. 194 (1962). Petrie contends that, at the time of the board\u2019s second refusal to reopen, on November 4, 1965, he qualified for a deferment under this provision because of his part-time course in helicopter instruction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because of the particular nature of Petrie\u2019s activity in this connection, and in view of its part-time character, the crucial issue regarding establishment of a prima facie II-S case by Petrie involves the meaning in the Regulation of \u201cactivity in study\u201d by a registrant. Unlike the Regulation concerning II-A deferments, the II-S Regulation did not, during the relevant time period, expand upon the meaning of any of the required conditions, other than to include as part of section 1622.25 the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\">\u201c(b) The Director of Selective Service, after consultation with such departments and other agencies of the executive branch of the Government as may be appropriate, may promulgate criteria, which shall be advisory only, concerning the placing of registrants in Class II-S.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">E.O. 10984, 27 Fed.Reg. 194 (1962). This latter provision was placed in the II-S Regulation in 1962. Prior to this 1962 amendment, subsection (b) had provided in part as follows: \u201cA registrant\u2019s activity in study may be considered to be necessary to the maintenance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>of the national health, safety, or interest when any of the following conditions exist * * E.O. 10292, 16 Fed.Reg. 9862 (1951). The latter Regulation, as it was originally promulgated in 1951, thereby establishing <em>for the first time </em>the II-S deferment, is set out in the margin along with typical parts of these \u201cfollowing conditions.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As the terms of all these conditions make abundantly clear, \u201cactivity in study\u201d \u2014 as it was originally defined \u2014 was confined to full-time courses of instruction in a college, university, or similar institution of learning.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">As stated above, the subsection of the Regulation containing these specific conditions was amended in 1962 so as to place the responsibility for issuing appropriate criteria directly in the hands of the Director of Selective Service. Since it was provided that such criteria were to be advisory only, it seems apparent that the 1962 amendment was designed not only to place the responsibility for establishing workable and appropriate criteria upon those with administrative expertise in the area, but also to afford greater flexibility and discretion to the local board. It is also apparent that the amendment was <em>not </em>intended to accomplish any significant change in the long-established meaning of \u201cactivity in study\u201d by a registrant. This conclusion is supported by the fact that when, in March 1966, subsequent to the board\u2019s refusal to reopen Petrie\u2019s case, the Director of Selective Service for the first time promulgated advisory criteria pursuant to the 1962 amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>ment, the criteria were identical to the provisions which had been present in the Regulations prior to 1962. See note 11, <em>supra. </em>Subsequently, in July 1967, section 1622.25 was completely revised by Executive Order so as to provide that \u201c[i]n Class II-S shall be placed any registrant who has requested such deferment and who is satisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction at a college, university, or similar institution of learning * * 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.25(a) E.O. 11360, 32 Fed.Reg. '9790 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Therefore, in light of the history of the II-S Regulation from 1951 through 1962, and in view of the fact that the 1962 amendment was clearly not intended to alter the basic meaning of \u201cactivity in study,\u201d we hold that, in order to have established a prima facie case for a II-S deferment, it was necessary for Petrie to present facts placing him generally within the scope of a student pursuing a full-time course of instruction at a college, university, or similar institution of learning. As Petrie himself revealed on the face of his request, his activity was not within that area. He therefore failed to make out such a sufficient prima facie showing as would have required the board to reopen and consider the claim for a II-S deferment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">THE III-A CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The Selective Service Regulations provide that \u201c[i]n Class III-A shall be placed any registrant whose induction into the armed forces would result in extreme hardship * * * to his * * parent [or] grandparent * * * who is dependent upon him for support * 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.30(b) The facts presented by Petrie concerning his III-A claim have been related previously. Apart from the existence of the special circumstances discussed <em>infra, </em>we are convinced that by the presentation of these facts Petrie made out a prima facie case of his entitlement to such a classification. Although there were facts shown by the record, which might have constituted sufficient basis to support a <em>classification </em>decision rejecting the claim for III-A deferment, these particular facts were such that their consideration could not properly have occurred until the <em>evaluation stage </em>of the classification process. Therefore, they could not operate to destroy Petrie\u2019s right to the reopening to which he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">It may be argued that, despite Petrie\u2019s showing, the local board was justified in refusing to reopen his classification because of the legal consequences of other circumstances peculiar to Petrie\u2019s case. First, there is the question of whether Petrie waived his claim to III-A status because he failed to report his change of dependency status to the local board within the required period of time. Secondly, the Government contends that a registrant already classified as a conscientious objector, as was Petrie at the time of the two refusals to reopen, is, for that reason, not be entitled to a III-A \u201chardship\u201d deferment.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">It is provided in the Selective Service Regulations that \u201c[e]ach classified registrant * * * shall, within 10 days after it occurs, report to the local board in writing any fact that might result in the registrant being placed in a different classification such as, but not limited to, any change in his * * * dependency status * * * \u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.1 (b). In Williams v. United States, 203 F.2d 85, 88 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 345 U.S. 1003, 73 S.Ct. 1149, 97 L.Ed. 1408 (1953), our court held that a \u201c[r]egis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>trant\u2019s failure to notify the local Board of his change in * * * status within the time allowed constituted a waiver of any claim for deferment on the basis of such change in status.\u201d The Second Circuit has expressed doubt concerning the broad scope of the rule as stated in Williams,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and we would be reluctant to say that the rule must always be held to be absolute. Even when a registrant has failed to appeal a classification decision within the required time, that failure has been held excusable in the rare case wherein exceptional circumstances are present. Donato v. United States, 302 F.2d 468 (9th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 374 U.S. 828, 83 S.Ct. 1868, 10 L.Ed.2d 1052 (1963). In the instant case, it should be noted that the local board supplied no indication, upon the record, that the registrant\u2019s delay was a reason, either principal or contributive, for its decision. Cf. United States v. Vincelli, 215 F.2d 210, 213 (2d Cir. 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">As we have seen, Petrie\u2019s father died on December 10,1964, and it was not until nineteen days later that Petrie mailed the letter by which the board was informed of the change in circumstances. In a supplemental brief, the Government concedes that \u201cunder the circumstances of this case, it appears that the registrant advises [sic] the board of the change in circumstances within a reasonable time; therefore, the government does not rely upon the registrant\u2019s failure to comply with the regulation in this case.\u201d In light of this concession, and in view of the fact that the record contains no indication that the local board relied upon, or even considered, Petrie\u2019s delay as a possible basis for its refusal to reopen, we hold that Petrie did not, because of the delay, waive his right to the board\u2019s consideration of his claim to III-A \u201chardship\u201d status.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">The Government\u2019s contention that Petrie was not eligible for III-A status because of the fact that he was already classified as a conscientious objector is based upon our court\u2019s holding in Klubnikin v. United States, 227 F.2d 87, 89 (9th Cir. 1955), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 975, 76 S.Ct. 453, 100 L.Ed. 846 (1956). In <em>Klubnikin </em>the court first pointed out that section 1622.30(b), which established the scope of the III-A classification, \u201capplies only to persons \u2018whose induction into the armed forces would result in extreme hardship and privation * *.\u2019 \u201d 227 F.2d at 89. Therefore, reasoning that \u201cthe hardship deferment is a deferment from <em>military service\u201d </em>the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">\u201cKlubnikin was a recognized conscientious objector with a 1-0 classification, and as long as he remained so classified, could not be inducted into the armed forces. If he could not be inducted into the armed forces then a claim for a classification because of hardship which would result solely from such induction was without merit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">227 F.2d at 89 (emphasis in original) -<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We no longer agree with that reasoning and have determined that we should not adhere to the holding of the <em>Klubnikin </em>court on the particular point under discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">The III-A Regulation applies to registrants \u201cwhose induction into the armed forces <em>would </em>result in extreme hardship * * * \u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.30 (b) (emphasis added). As we have previously held herein, Petrie presented facts to the local board which showed, prima facie, that \u201cextreme hardship\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>would have resulted had he been inducted into the armed forces. While Petrie did not make a further showing that he was about to be so inducted or that he was a potential inductee, there is nothing in the Regulations which requires that such a showing be made. The pertinent Regulation specifies an \u201cinduction * * * [which] would result in extreme hardship,\u201d not an induction which \u201cwill\u201d so result. Nor does the Regulation include any other qualifying term or word having the effect of limiting eligibility for a hardship deferment to those persons who are not otherwise exempted or deferred from service in the armed forces. Petrie met, on a prima facie level, the terms of the Regulation: His \u201cinduction into the armed forces would result in extreme hardship * * * \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Our interpretation of this Regulation is supported by two other Regulations involved in Petrie\u2019s case. Section 1622.14, defining the conscientious objector classification, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">\u201cIn Class 1-0 shall be placed every registrant <em>who would have been classified in Class I-A </em>but for the fact that he has been found, by reason of religious training and belief to be conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form and to be conscientiously opposed to participation in both combatant and non-combatant training and service in the armed forces.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.14 (emphasis added). In view of Petrie\u2019s prima facie case for III-A status, we cannot say, and the board could not have known at the time the III-A classification was claimed that he \u201cwould have been classified in Class 1-A\u201d apart from the fact of his conscientious objection to participation in war.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Secondly, section 1623.2 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-11\">\u201cEvery registrant shall be placed on Class I-A under the provisions of section 1622.10 of this chapter except that when grounds are established to place a registrant in one or more of the classes listed in the following table, the registrant shall be classified in the lowest class for which he is determined to be eligible, with Class I-A-0 considered the highest class and Class I-C considered the lowest class according to the following table:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-12\">Class: I-A-0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-13\">1-0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-14\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-15\">II-A</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-16\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-17\">II- S</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-18\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-19\">III- A</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-20\">* * * * * * <em>&gt;&gt;</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-21\">32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1623.2. Since this Regulation specifically provides that class III-A is a lower classification than class 1-0 and that a registrant is to be placed in the lowest classification for which he is eligible, our holding that Petrie was \u201celigible\u201d for placement in class III-A comports with the apparent intent of the order of the listing. The fact that Petrie was also eligible for placement in class 1-0 should not deprive him of other specified rights. To so hold would be to say, in effect, that his religious beliefs divested him of favorable rights specifically conferred upon others.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-23\">\u201cIn classifying a registrant there shall be no discrimination for or against him because of his * * * creed * * * or because of his membership or activity in any * * * religious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>* * * organization. Each such registrant shall receive equal justice.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.1(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">We conclude that Petrie presented to the local board a prima facie case for entitlement to a III-A classification and that the local board erred in refusing to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-5\">. Petrie made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4KE\">\u201cI am the only member of my mother\u2019s family that is in a position to support her. She has no substantial trade or skill which would adequately support her. Her health and age would not enable her to get any employment; menial or otherwise. She has arthritis and depends almost entirely on my support and my ability to make a home for her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A85\">Similarly, Petrie\u2019s mother stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyV\">\u201cI am unable to work not only because of the reasons stated above, but also because my 87 year old mother lives with us and because of her age and senility as well as a semi-invalid condition she demands my care and can\u2019t be left alone. She is on G.A.S. but is sometimes an extra expense to us as well. My son is our only protection and means of transportation, as I do not drive.

App. \u00a7 456 (j) ; <em>see </em>32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1660.20. This form was not returned <em>to the board, and the </em>board therefore requested that the State Director of Selective Service forward three types of available, appropriate employment, which could then be submitted to Petrie. On August 13, 1965, the office of the State Director replied, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">\u201cThe following three types of civilian work which have been approved are available for Class 1-0 registrants at the present time:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">\u201cInstitutional helper, Los Angeles County Department of Charities, 1200 North State Street, Los Angeles, California 90033.

Salary $125.00 to $150.00 a month for a 40-hour week. \u201cPsychiatric technician trainee, Atascadero State Hospital, Atascadero, California. Salary $255.00 to $281.00 per month for a 40-hour work week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-10\">\u201cIf the registrant comes in to your board it is suggested that you also show him Memorandum No. 209 which sets forth all the various types of approved work in the State of California.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">On August 17, 1965, the local board mailed to Petrie a letter listing the foregoing three available, appropriate jobs and requesting that he inform the board of his preference among them. The local board did not, however, receive a reply to this letter, and on October 22, 1965, the board requested that Petrie appear at a scheduled meeting with a representative of the State Director in order to reach an agreement as to the civilian work which Petrie would perform in lieu of service in the armed forces. At this meeting, which, as previously indicated, occurred on November 3, 1965, Petrie indicated that he was then earning $600.00 per month as a flight instructor and that \u201cdue to financial reasons I cannot accept any of those jobs with that pay * *</p>\n<p id=\"A5Eb\">(This quotation is taken from a copy of the board\u2019s notes of its interview with Petrie.) Therefore, after Petrie had stated that he would not accept any of the jobs offered, and in view of the fact that he had submitted no jobs of his own choice, the board decided that employment as an institutional helper at the Los Angeles County General Hospital, a facility of the Los Angeles Department of Charities, was available and appropriate. The board then requested the State Director to approve and authorize this selection of civilian employment to be performed by Petrie, and on November 29, 1965, such authorization was received by the board. This selection was also approved by the National Director of the Selective Service system. Thereafter, on December 7, 1965, a form was mailed by the board to Petrie ordering him to appear at the board for instructions on December 20, 1965. On that date Petrie did appear and was instructed to report to the office of the Department of Charities for civilian work by the following day. Petrie reported to the Department of Charities as ordered, but he refused all work assignments of any sort. Thereafter, Petrie made no attempt to obtain other appropriate civilian work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b334-6\">. This letter continued, <em>\u201c * </em>* * therefore, this is to advise that your Order to Report for Armed Forces Physical Examination * * * is hereby canceled.\u201d The only notation for December 31', 1964, in the minutes of the local board is that on that date Petrie\u2019s order to report for a physical examination was canceled. As noted previously, Petrie\u2019s letter informing the board of his father\u2019s death was evidently written in response to the board\u2019s order that he report for a physical examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b335-6\">.

United States, 327 U.S. 114, 122-23, 66 S.Ct. 423, 427, 90 L.Ed. 567 (1946). Although the Court was concerned in <em>Estep </em>with a classification decision made by a local board, in earlier discussion in the opinion the Court clearly indicated that a refusal to reopen was another example of an action wherein the board\u2019s jurisdiction might be exceeded. 327 U.S. at 121.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"AHU\">. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACh\">\u201cWe do not believe that such a power, to engage in a general consideration and evaluation and then to accord the result a summary status only, can be harmonized with the provisions and purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 1625.2 and 1625.11. But if such an implied power can be regarded as being intended to exist under the regulations, then it must be held, we think, that the discrimination which the board effects against a conscientious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>objector claimant by dealing with his situation on this basis, as opposed to another such claimant of similar prima facie situation to whom it accords a reopening, would be a violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmJ\">\u201cIn the latter situation, a conscientious objector claimant would be left with the procedural rights to appear, be heard, and take an appeal, while in the first situation there would be a foreclosure of these substantial incidents to a similar claimant.

The Government contended in <em>Miller </em>that since there was evidence in the registrant\u2019s record which would have constituted sufficient basis in fact to support a classification other than that requested by the registrant, the board\u2019s decision, not to reopen should have been upheld.

In view of this conclusion, we need not consider whether Petrie also made a prima facie showing that the essential character of the occupation itself was \u201cnecessary to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest.\u201d Quite obviously, there are situations wherein the employment of a particular registrant would meet the three enumerated conditions, but wherein it would also be clear, without the necessity for evaluative consideration, that the occupation was not a \u201cnecessary\u201d one.

We have not discovered a case, nor has our attention been directed to one, in which this holding has been followed or considered since it was announced in 1955.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b342-9\">. Under the compulsion of <em>KlubniJcin, </em>a 1-0 registrant, such as Petrie, might report a change in his conscientious objector beliefs, or his surrender of them, prior to, or at the same time as, his reporting of a change to \u201chardship\u201d dependency status. Thus the registrant would effect his removal from class I-O, and under <em>Klubmkin, </em>he would qualify for placement in class III-A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"ATY\">. Although we do not believe that the result should depend upon the time of presentation of the III-A claim relative to the registrant\u2019s presentation of a conscientious objector claim, we note that the facts supporting Petrie\u2019s III-A claim were before the local board at the time of the determination by the appeal board that he qualified as a conscientious objector.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
