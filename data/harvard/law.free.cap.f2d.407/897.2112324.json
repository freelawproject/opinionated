A process for the manufacture of shrinkable, seamless tubular foils of polyethylene terephthalate, wherein a tubular foil of said terephthalate is extruded, set by cooling, brought to a temperature of 80-85 \u00b0C, and within this temperature range is extended in length to 3-3% times the original and in diameter to 4-5 times the original and then cooled, with maintenance of the required extending force, at least to 70 \u00b0C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-8\">2. The process of claim 1, wherein a polyethylene terephthalate is employed having a softening point of 257-266\u00b0 C and an intrinsic viscosity of 0.45-0.68, determined in li% by weight solution in a mixture of 3 parts by weight of phenol and 2 parts by weight of tetrachlorethane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-9\">3. The process of claim 1, wherein the extension of the tube in diameter is to 4-4% times the original.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-10\">4. A polyethylene terephthalate tubular foil which upon dipping in water of 90\u00b0 C or higher shrinks by at least 30l% of its length and also of its width.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-15\">The foils are disclosed as useful in the packaging of foodstuffs and other goods, since irregularly shaped articles may be packaged in a skin of plastic film conforming to their shape without creasing or folding. To be practical, shrinkage of the foil should be occasioned \u201cat temperatures below 100 \u00b0C * * * by dipping into hot water,\u201d and \u201cshould not take place at temperatures below 60\u00b0 C.\u201d The specification further states that \u201c[i]n practice a minimum shrinkage of 30% has proved to be desirable or necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b960-16\">THE REFERENCES</p>\n<p id=\"b960-17\">The Goldman et al. patent discloses a method of improving the properties of thermoplastic, polymeric tubular films wherein a thermoplastic polymeric material, such as polyethylene terephthalate, is extruded in the form of a tubular sheet which is quickly cooled. The tubular sheet is then \u201cheated to a temperature within its orientation temperature range,\u201d which is defined as \u201cthe temperature range in which molecular orientation of a polymeric film may be effected\u201d and is stated in Table I as <em>85-110\u00b0C for polyethylene terephthalate. </em>At this temperature, the tubular sheet is expanded to a diameter preferably 2-10 times the original and stretched to a length preferably 2-10 times the original; the preferred elongation range <em>for polyethylene terephthalate </em>is given in Table III as <em>2-6 times the original dimensions. </em>The tubular sheet is then cooled while the stretching forces are maintained. Shrinkage of the polymeric films produced by this process is discussed, and shrinkage data is given for the five working examples but not for polyethylene terephthalate.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>Winter relates to a process for improving the properties of extruded polyethylene terephthalate film by stretching it under heat; the preferred specific stretch ratios are 3.3-4.5 times its original width and 3.0-6.0 times its original length.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">The Panconis et al. patent relates to a process of stretching polyethylene terephthalate in two directions. As disclosed, \u201cthe extent of stretch may be as high as 5X or greater in one or both directions\u201d where X is the original dimension of the film; and Fig. 6 shows stretch ratios of 4.5 times the original for both directions at 84\u00b0C.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">THE REJECTION</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">The examiner rejected claims 1-4 as unpatentable over Goldman et al., taken alone, or in view of either Winter or Pangonis et al., under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, stating as summarized by the solicitor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-8\">[T]hat Goldman et al. showed a process for the production of polyethylene terephthalate tubing which had been extruded, set by cooling, heated to 85-110\u00b0 C, stretched to from 2-6 times its original diameter and length while it was in the heated condition, and finally cooled while the stretching forces were maintained * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">Although the examiner\u2019s application of Winter and/or Panconis et al. is not apparent from the abbreviated record before us, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-10\">Goldman et al. show a process substantially as recited except for the specific increase in length and diameter as recited in the claims. * * * [Goldman et al.\u2019s] elongation range encompasses the range recited by appellants with respect to polyethylene terephthalate. The temperature employed also encompasses the 85\u00b0 C. temperature at which the material is stretched. The material so treated is capable of shrinkage * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-11\">We are in accord with the Examiner\u2019s position that it would be obvious in view of this teaching of Goldman et al. to stretch the material within the range recited in the claims and that the resulting product would be shrinkable to a material extent in both its dimensions as a result of such stretching. Winter also shows it is old to stretch such a material transversely at least 3.3 times and longitudinally from 3-6 times with resulting improvement in the product. In Example I, the product is stretched slightly greater in the transverse direction than in the longitudinal direction. Panconis et al. further illustrate the stretching of a film of the type claimed substantially the same amount in each direction and that the resulting product is heat shrinkable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">Inasmuch as appellants have failed to urge method claims 2 and 3 as being patentably distinct from claim 1, claims 2 and 3 stand or fall with claim 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-14\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b961-15\"> We agree with the board that claims 1-4 are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 and find no error in the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-16\">Appellants argue that, although Goldman et al. teaches of shrinkage of certain films, there is no suggestion concerning <em>shrinkage </em>of <em>polyethylene terephthalate </em>films treated in accordance with the Goldman et al. process. However, a \u201cdisclosure in a reference is not limited to its specific illustrative examples, but must be considered as a whole to ascertain what would be realistically suggested thereby to one of ordinary skill in the art.\u201d In re Uhlig, 376 F.2d 320, 323, 54 CCPA 1300, 1304 (1967). We feel that Goldman et al. suggests the shrinkage of polyethylene terephthalate, as also does Panconis et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-17\">Appellants\u2019 Rule 132 affidavit attempting to show that operation outside of the specific claimed ranges does not result in a film shrinkable to a practical extent is insufficient, we feel, to overcome the rejection. The affidavit fails <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>to sufficiently describe the test apparatus for comparison with that described in Goldman et al. Thus, the affidavit fails to establish that Goldman\u2019s process does not produce such a shrinkable tubular foil.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">The Patent Office refusal to supply appellants with a Rule 107 affidavit is not in error here since the references of record support the examiner\u2019s statement that polyetheylene terephthalate films are commonly known to be shrinkable. Thus, since the knowledge relied upon by the examiner is not his personal knowledge, but rather common knowledge in the art, an affidavit under Rule 107 is not required. See In re Uhlig, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">The board\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b960-11\">.
