In such usage, methylchloroform evidences a strong tendency to decompose, particularly when in contact with light metals such as aluminum, thus destroying its practical value as a solvent. Appellants discovered that this serious detriment to the use of methylchloroform is overcome by formulating the methylchloroform with minor amounts of acrylonitrile.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-22\">Claim 28 reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b962-23\">28. Methylchloroform containing from 0.05 to 5 per cent acrylonitrile by weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>The claim was rejected by the examiner under 35 USC \u00a7 103.

Methylchloroform is mentioned as a chlorohydrocarbon that may be stabilized in the same manner. Other stabilizers such as pyridine may be used with the primary stabilizer.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-26\">Bachtel discloses methylchloroform stabilized with dioxane and states that methylchloroform is more reactive with metals than other ehlorohydroearbons and in general the inhibitors effective with other ehlorohydroearbons are only moderately helpful with methylchloroform.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-27\">Monroe shows the stabilization of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents by the use of an azine, and specifically notes methylchloroform as one of the group of chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-28\">Burch discloses the use of tertiary acetylenic monohydric alcohols such as 3-methyl-l-pentyn-3-ol for chlorinated hydrocarbons including methylehloroform.

The patent states that it is known that tetrachloroethylene may be stabilized by the addition of one or more of a wide variety of organic compounds referred to as general-purpose stabilizers and sets forth as examples of such general-purpose stabilizers a list of a hundred-odd suitable materials including vinyleyanide (acrylonitrile). The selection from this list is said to be based upon satisfactory performance at least cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>The examiner rejected claim 28, along with other claims withdrawn at the oral hearing before the board, as unpatentable over Missbaeh or Klabunde. In his Answer, the examiner adhered to the rejection on Missbaeh while stating as a new ground of rejection that the claim ' was unpatentable over the newly cited British patent to Skeeters. The remaining references, discussed above, were cited as \u201cState of the art references and references cited in the [appellants\u2019] brief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">The board felt that, in view of the withdrawal of some of the claims rejected on Missbaeh, it could not sustain the rejection of claim 28 on Missbaeh. However, it affirmed the rejection on Skeeters under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axz\">This patent discloses a considerable number of stabilizers for chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents such as trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene. These commerical solvents are shown to contain small amounts of other chlorination products, including trichloroethane, which are said to be more unstable and serve to catalyze decomposition of the commercial tetrachloroethylene. Cyanides, and specifically vinylcyanide, are disclosed as stabilizers. The Examiner considered this disclosure to render obvious the use of vinylcyanide to stabilize methyl-chloroform, which is one of the two trichloroethane isomers. Supporting the rejection are a series of references showing the state of the art. These are said to demonstrate that the techniques of stabilizing perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene and other chlorinated derivatives of ethane are also available to stabilize methylchloroform. Cole, Monroe et al., and Burch et al. do in fact state that these various chlorinated hydrocarbons, including methylchloroform, may be stabilized with the same individual agents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKqL\">In response to appellants\u2019 argument that the Patent Office had recognized that methylchloroform stabilization involves unique considerations, the board answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-5\">Appellants urge that the Patent Office has recognized the different status of methylchloroform by issuance of Bachtel, 2,811,252 in face of the above mentioned Petering et al. patent. This is not controlling for this case. Fessenden v. Coe, 1938 CD 62; 495 OG 707; 99 F.2d 426 [69 App.D.C. 193]; In re Atwood, 46 CCPA 901; 1959 CD 321; 747 OG 4; 267 F.2d 954; 122 USPQ 378. The record here is different and for that reason we also do not find our decision and holding with respect to Skeeters et al. (Br.) in Ex parte Sims, Appeal No. 69-16, made of record by appellants in Paper No. 44, to be controlling. In re Huyett, 27 CCPA 1341; 1940 CD 679; 521 OG 537; 112 F.2d 853. The significant differences in the record before us lie in the disclosure herein and the development of the state of the art. On this point compare In re Adamson et al., 47 CCPA 839; 1960 CD 177; 755 OG 5; 275 F.2d 952; 125 USPQ 233 in which upon the same issue but upon a different record a conclusion was reached contrary to that in the prior decision of In re Williams, 36 CCPA 756; 1949 CD 42; 619 OG 614; 171 F.2d 319; 80 USPQ 150.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">Appellants advance several arguments in support of their contention that the board erred. First they argue that Skeeters fails as a teaching reference which renders the claimed subject matter obvious since it constitutes nothing more than a listing of potential additives whose value for stabilizing methyl-chloroform cannot be ascertained from within the four corners of the reference. In support of this position, the appellants refer to the uncontested Dial affidavit of record which establishes that nineteen additives specifically mentioned by Skeeters do not protect methylchloroform. Thus, they contend, Skeeters is at best a starting point for further experimentation and even routine experimentation does not negate patentability under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, citing In re <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>Fay and Fox, 347 F.2d 597, 52 CCPA 1483.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Appellants further argue that methyl-chloroform stabilization involves considerations differing from other chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents. The Dial affidavit is again relied upon to demonstrate that specific additives represented in the art of record as being useful with chlorinated hydrocarbons include some which are not effective with methyl-chloroform.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Appellants then contend that the grant to Bachtel of composition claims to methylehloroform containing dioxane despite the citation of Petering showing that dioxane stabilizes chlorinated hydrocarbons such as trichloroethylene shows Patent Office acceptance of methylchloroform\u2019s uniqueness as grounds for patent-ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">Appellants further contend that the \u201ctrichloroethane\u201d mentioned by Skeeters is not methylehloroform and cite in support of this position a prior board decision, Ex parte Leslie L. Sims, application serial No. 769,546, filed October 6, 1958, U.S. Patent Office Board of Appeals, Appeal No. 69-16, in which was stated with respect to Skeeters (referred to as D.A.C. (Br.)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-8\">The Examiner also rejected the claims as unpatentable over Skeeters et al. or D.A.C. (Br.) on the ground that the tetrachloroethylene (or trichloroethylene) there stabilized with agents, including nitromethane, necessarily carried small amounts of trichloroethane as an impurity. Appellant has pointed out that this trichloroethane is most likely the 1,1,2-trichloroethane rather than the 1,1,-1 \u2014 isomer (methylehloroform) and that of the numerous stabilizing agents mentioned by these references only a very few are satisfactory for stabilizing methylehloroform. The latter is pointed out to be much more active than the other common chlorinated hydrocarbons in attacking metals. Since our views on this rejection nearly coincide with those expressed by appellant in his brief, we will not sustain the same. Accordingly the rejection of the claims on Skeeters et al. or D.A.C. (Br.) is reversed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">As will be demonstrated, it will be unnecessary for us to consider the merit of the latter two contentions. The solicitor\u2019s position with respect to the arguments is set forth in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-11\">Skeeters, while mentioning the stabilization of tetrachloroethylene, specifically states that he desires to stabilize other chlorohydrocarbons as well and he specifically identifies trichloroethane as one of the chlorohydrocarbons associated with the tetrachloroethylene which is stabilized by the use of various additives, including vinylcyanide. The patents to Cole, Monroe et al. and Burch et al. show that the art recognized the need to stabilize methylehloroform and that that result is obtained by utilizing the same techniques found effective with other chlorohydrocarbons. Since it is the totality of the prior art teachings which must be considered in evaluating appellants\u2019 contribution, the mere fact that the Dial affidavit presents data showing that various stabilizers suggested by the prior art do not protect methylehloroform against decomposition which occurs when boiling methylehloroform contacts aluminum, does not weaken the force and affect [sic] the prior disclosures. * * * A showing that stabilizers which were effective for other chlorinated hydrocarbons either do not stabilize, or stabilize in lesser degree, when used with methylehloroform, has little or no evidentiary value as proof that one \u201chaving ordinary skill in the art\u201d would not consider it obvious to use the acrylonitrile disclosed in Skeeter with methylehloroform.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">We cannot accept this position. In examining the evidence considered by the board, we note first, as did the examiner in his Answer, that Skeeters discloses only trichloroethane, a generic term embracing two isomers, one of which is methylehloroform. Turning to the Cole, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>Monroe and Burch patents, we find it significant that Cole and Burch state that their stabilizers are especially effective for trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene while adding, almost incidentally it would seem, that they \u201cmay also be used to stabilize other chlorohydrocarbons such as * * * methyl-chloroform\u201d and that Monroe presents examples directed only to stabilization of trichloroethylene. Bach tel states that \u201cin general the inhibitors effective with other chlorohydrocarbons are only moderately helpful with methylehloroform.\u201d Of the other references cited by the board, Missbach was dismissed by it and Petering and Klabunde tend only to show that reactivity with aluminum is generally characteristic of chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents, not methylehloroform alone. Thus, no reference can be said to unequivocally teach that methylchloroform may be stabilized with the same agents used for other chlorohydrocarbons.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Against this background developed by the prior art we shall assume that a reasonable argument can be made in support of the view that it would be obvious for one skilled in the art to use for the specific chlorohydrocarbon, methylchloroform, those stabilizers taught to be effective for chlorohydrocarbons generally, such as those found in the extensive listing presented by Skeeters. We interpret the position of the board and solictor to be essentially just that. However, the record contains more than this prior art background. It contains an uncontested showing, by way of the affidavit of one skilled in the art, that numerous additives, including nineteen specifically enumerated by Skeeters, reputed to be effective for other chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents fail to stabilize methyl-chloroform.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Thus, we are presented with a situation not unlike that in In re Tomlinson, 363 F.2d 928, 53 CCPA 1421, where this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-7\">As we see it, appellant\u2019s invention is the <em>discovery </em>of <em>what </em>stabilizers for other materials, known in the art, <em>will, </em>and which <em>will not, </em>stabilize <em>polypropylene </em>against degradation by <em>light. </em>The solicitor asserts that one skilled in the art \u201cwould expect an[y] ultraviolet light stabilizer for polyethylene to be effective as an ultraviolet stabilizer in polypropylene.\u201d If this be true, then appellants have clearly discovered, uncovered, or invented the unobvious for the <em>record </em>shows that <em>many </em>which they tested were found <em>not </em>to be effective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">At oral argument appellants\u2019 attorney directed our attention to In re Crabb, 405 F.2d 572, 56 CCPA -, decided January 9, 1969, a case involving the stabilization of methylehloroform where we failed to find that the prior art there involved taught away from looking to the art of stabilization of other chlorohydrocarbons to inhibit methylchloroform. We agree with appellants that In re Crabb, aside from being distinguishable on other grounds, is not controlling here because of appellants\u2019 prima facie showing, uncontested by the examiner or the board, that several stabilizers known to be effective for other chlorohydrocarbons are often ineffective for methylehloroform.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">Considering the evidence as a whole, we are persuaded that Skeeters does not render obvious the composition of the appealed claim. The decision of the board is, therefore, reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b962-26\">.
