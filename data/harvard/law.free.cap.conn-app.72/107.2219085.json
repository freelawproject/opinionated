Pereira, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of five counts of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (l)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and five counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53-21.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>the defendant claims that (1) the trial court improperly (a) instructed the jury in violation of his state and federal constitutional rights and (b) admitted prejudicial evidence that deprived him of a lair trial, and (2) the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument to the jury deprived the defendant of a fair trial. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. During the summer of 1997, when the events that form the basis of the defendant\u2019s conviction took place, the victim was fourteen years old and the defendant was thirty-two years old.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The two lived in the same apartment building in Norwich, he with his family on the second floor, and she with her mother and two sisters on the third floor. They frequently saw one another in the hallways and would stop and talk. Residents of the apartment complex knew the defendant and that he owned a silver colored Porsche automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">After the school year ended in June, 1997, the defendant gave the victim his pager number so that she could contact him. When the victim paged the defendant, he would return her telephone call and they would talk. One evening, the defendant suggested that the victim go for a ride with him. Because it would not look right for the victim to be seen getting into the Porsche with him, the defendant arranged to meet the victim around a comer at the far side of the apartment building. Once the victim was in the vehicle, the defendant drove to a side street and parked the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The defendant instmcted the victim not to be nervous around him and that he wanted her to be comfortable. He began to kiss her. Then the defendant unbuttoned his pants and asked the victim if she wanted to lick his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>penis. She placed the defendant\u2019s penis in her mouth for approximately one minute, but stopped because she did not like the taste. The two returned to the place where they had met, and the defendant told the victim he wanted to date her. He said that it did not matter that she was young. The defendant told the victim to page him when they could talk.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">A few days later, the victim paged the defendant and informed him that they could meet because her mother was out. At approximately 7 p.m., they met where they had done so previously and went in the Porsche to a nearby park. Again, they kissed and the defendant asked the victim to perform oral sex on him. She complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Rain fell on the morning of July 24, 1997. Due to the inclement weather, the victim did not report to her summer job. She knew that the defendant, who poured concrete for a living, would not have to go to his job and paged him. In response, the defendant telephoned the victim, asked if anyone was home and if he could come upstairs. The defendant went to the victim\u2019s apartment at approximately 11 a.m. The victim sat on the defendant\u2019s lap in the living room for about five minutes. Thereafter they went into the victim\u2019s bedroom, sat on the bed and engaged in foreplay. The victim was uncomfortable about the situation, but the defendant reassured her. The defendant performed oral sex on the victim and then engaged in intercourse. When the victim tried to stop the defendant, he moved her hand and calmed her. Later that day, when they saw one another, the defendant told the victim he wanted her to call him. He told her that it was not a good idea to talk to one another where others could observe them.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">The following Saturday morning, the victim paged the defendant and told him to come to her apartment because she was alone. The defendant went upstairs immediately, and the two went directly to the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>bedroom and engaged in sexual intercourse. The defendant left shortly thereafter because his wife was expected home soon.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">On or about August 2, 1997, the victim paged the defendant at night. They arranged to meet, but not where they had done so previously. One of the victim\u2019s friends waited with her on North Street, near the entrance to the apartment complex. The friend knew that the defendant was coming to meet the victim. The defendant arrived in his wife\u2019s red motor vehicle because his Porsche was not working. They went to a parking lot where the defendant removed a child\u2019s car seat from the rear passenger seat, and the two engaged in sexual intercourse. The defendant asked the victim whether she had told her friends about their relationship and warned her that they could both get into trouble if she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">In fact, the victim had confided in her friends. On the evening of August 10, 1997, the defendant\u2019s wife telephoned the victim\u2019s mother and asked if she and the victim would come to her apartment. One of the victim\u2019s friends had told the defendant\u2019s wife that the defendant and the victim were having an affair. The defendant\u2019s wife confronted the victim. The victim denied the affair. When she returned to her apartment, the victim\u2019s mother telephone the police. The victim denied the affair to the responding officer. She later asserted that she believed that she was in love with the defendant and wanted to protect him.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The next day, the victim\u2019s mother informed her that they were going to a hospital so that the victim could be examined. The victim knew that a pelvic examination would reveal that she had engaged in sexual intercourse. On the way to the hospital, her mother again asked the victim whether she was having an affair with the defendant. In response, the victim admitted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>she was. The victim was examined by an emergency room physician, who observed that the victim\u2019s hymen had been perforated.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The victim went to live with her father in a different community. The victim engaged in counseling with a licensed clinical psychologist from September, 1997, through June, 1998. The victim disclosed her sexual encounters with the defendant to her therapist. Between September, 1998, and June, 1999, the victim told a counselor at a school based health care center of the defendant\u2019s sexual behavior toward her. Additional facts will be discussed where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">INSTRUCTIONAL CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">The defendant claims that the court\u2019s instructions to the jury violated his rights under the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut by (1) shifting the burden of proof to him and impinging on the presumption of innocence, and (2) failing to charge on the victim\u2019s delay in reporting the incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">We must first consider the state\u2019s assertion that the defendant\u2019s instructional claims are not reviewable because they were not preserved at trial. The defendant contends that he preserved his claims properly. \u201cAparty may preserve for appeal a claim that a jury instruction was improper either by submitting a written request to charge or by taking an exception to the charge as given. Practice Book \u00a7 16-20. If counsel follows the latter course, he or she must \u2018state distinctly the matter objected to and the ground of objection. . . .\u2019 Id.\u201d <em>Pes-tey </em>v. <em>Cushman, </em>259 Conn. 345, 372-73, 788 A.2d 496 (2002). \u201cThe propose of the rule is to alert the court to any claims of error while there is still an opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>for correction in order to avoid the economic waste and increased court congestion caused by unnecessary retrials.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>186 Conn. 654, 658, 443 A.2d 906 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the court improperly shifted the burden of proof and impinged on his presumption of innocence is based on the following portion of the charge: \u201cIf a defendant should attempt to make false statements respecting himself and his conduct concerning the matter on trial, <em>you may consider this evidence tending to show a guilty connection by the defendant with the crime </em>charged.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defense counsel objected to the cited portion of the instruction, stating that the court had \u201cindicated . . . that if the defendant should attempt to make false statements respecting himself or his conduct concerning the matter of trial, you should consider this evidence tending to show a guilty \u2014 a guilty connection by the defendant with the crime charged. This section, on the testimony of the defendant, basically implies, gives some sort of added scrutiny to the defendant that shouldn\u2019t be there. He\u2019s presumed innocent. He\u2019s presumed innocent on the [witness] stand. There should be no special charges as to him. I point out that the court did not make any similar statements as to the victim, where credibility is an important thing, and she\u2019s not on trial. He\u2019s presumed innocent, and therefore there should not be, in my opinion, anything to say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">In his brief to this court, the defendant has argued that the court\u2019s use of the term \u201cguilty connection\u201d was improper because it \u201csingled out his testimony, reduced the state\u2019s burden of proof and improperly infringed on [his] constitutional right to testify in his defense.\u201d We agree with the state that the defendant did not preserve his claim that the court\u2019s instruction shifted the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>of proof or infringed on Ms rigM to testify. We discern no difference, however, between the terms \u201cadded scra-tmy\u201d and \u201csingled out\u201d with respect to the defendant\u2019s testimony. Nonetheless, we conclude that defense counsel\u2019s objection at trial is not the same as the claim raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">At trial, counsel addressed Ms objection to the court\u2019s mstruction regarding the defendant\u2019s false statements m general. On appeal, the defendant cites R. Leuba &amp; R. Fracasse, Connecticut Selected Jury Mstructions Manual (1998) \u00a7 2.20, p. 49, and concedes that a court properly may charge the jury with respect to statements and acts that may tend to show a consciousness of guilt. The basis of Ms claim is the court\u2019s use of the term \u201cguilty connection\u201d rather than the preferred term \u201cconsciousness of guilt.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant did not bring that difference to the court\u2019s attention at a time when the court could have clarified its instruction to the jury. For that reason, we will not review the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The defendant\u2019s second Mstructional claim is that the court improperly failed to focus on the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>delay in reporting the sexual assault in violation of his constitutional rights and <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 305, 677 A.2d 917 (1996) (en banc). The state argues that the charge given by the court substantially complied with the defendant\u2019s request to charge. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s response to the state\u2019s position is that his counsel took an exception to the court\u2019s instruction after it was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Defense counsel articulated his exception as follows. \u201cThe charge on constancy, I think, goes a little too far in the sense that it . . . says why she kept silent about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>what she did until she came before the <em>court </em>to <em>testify. </em>I think with the new cases and the like out, that\u2019s not what is \u2014 the purpose of those, sort of restrictive. I\u2019m just afraid that that somehow bootstraps in what it is the state has been trying to do in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">We cannot discern how the exception articulated by counsel was intended to apprise the court of the claim the defendant is making in this court, specifically, that \u201ca person to whom a sexual assault victim has reported the assault may testify only with respect to the fact and timing of the victim\u2019s complaint [and that] the defendant is entitled to an instruction that any delay by the victim in reporting the incident is a matter for the jury to consider in evaluating the weight of the victim\u2019s testimony.\u201d Id., 304-305. It is the defendant\u2019s position that his counsel\u2019s use of the term \u201cnew cases\u201d adequately apprised the court of his position. It is difficult for us to understand how the court was to divine <em>Trowpe </em>from the defendant\u2019s exception where the defendant himself did not even cite <em>Troupe </em>in his request to charge, in contravention of Practice Book \u00a7 42-18.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>We therefore conclude that the defendant failed to preserve for our review his constancy of accusation claim with respect to the court\u2019s instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">EVIDENTIARY CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The defendant has raised three evidentiary claims on appeal. He claims that the court improperly (1) failed to conduct a <em>Ported </em>hearing before letting the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>present the testimony of the emergency room physician who examined the victim, (2) permitted the state\u2019s expert witness to bolster the victim\u2019s credibility and (3) admitted testimony under the constancy of accusation doctrine in violation of Troupe.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">We review evidentiary claims pursuant to an abuse of discretion standard. \u201cGenerally, [t]rial courts have wide discretion with regard to evidentiary issues and their rulings will be reversed only if there has been an abuse of discretion or a manifest injustice appears to have occurred. . . . Every reasonable presumption will be made in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and it will be overturned only for a manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>67 Conn. App. 827, 831, 789 A.2d 531 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The defendant claims that the court improperly admitted the testimony of the emergency room physician who examined the victim because the court failed to inquire as to the scientific basis for the witness\u2019 testimony, and the testimony was inconclusive and therefore unreliable and improper for the jury to consider. The state again argues that we should not review the claim because it was not preserved at trial. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\u201cOur rules of practice make it clear that counsel must object to a ruling of evidence [and] state the grounds upon which objection is made ... to preserve the grounds for appeal. . . . These requirements are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>simply formalities. . . . We consistently have stated that we will not consider evidentiary rulings where counsel did not properly preserve a claim of error by objection . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lizotte, </em>200 Conn. 734, 742A, 517 A.2d 610 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The following facts are relevant for our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. The defendant filed a motion seeking a hearing pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>241 Conn. 57, 698 A.2d 739 (1997) (en banc), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1058, 118 S. Ct. 1384, 140 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1998). In that motion, the defendant represented that the police had received a complaint of sexual misconduct that gave rise to the charges against him, the victim was examined by a physician in a hospital, the examining physician provided a discharge diagnosis of alleged statutory rape on the basis of the physical examination and the history provided by the victim\u2019s mother, there are no valid scientific studies or evidence that demonstrate that the physical symptoms are directly correlated to alleged statutory rape and that such opinion or correlation as evidence has no grounding in scientific fact, but is based on speculation and hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a <em>Porter </em>hearing and conducted the hearing outside of the presence of the jury. At that time, the court also ruled on a medical report completed by the physician that contained statements that the victim\u2019s chief complaint was statutory rape and a discharge diagnosis of alleged statutory rape. Counsel for the defendant argued that those portions of the medical report should be redacted as hearsay statements made by the victim\u2019s mother. The state did not object, and the court ruled that the report would not be admitted into evidence and that the physician\u2019s testimony would be limited to his physical findings and the purpose of his examination. The physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>cian testified in accordance with the court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Defense counsel cross-examined the physician, but asked no questions concerning and raised no objection as to the validity of the physician\u2019s methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim as to the court\u2019s failure to conduct a <em>Po rter </em>hearing with respect to the methodology the physician employed to determine whether the victim\u2019s hymen was perforated was not preserved at trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We therefore decline to review the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The defendant\u2019s second evidentiary claim is that the court improperly admitted into evidence the testimony of the state\u2019s expert witness. More specifically, the defendant claims that the expert\u2019s testimony, in response to a hypothetical question posed by the state, bolstered the victim\u2019s credibility. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The following facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. The state called Rosemary Niedzwicki, a licensed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>clinical social worker with special training in child sexual abuse, to testify as an expert witness. Niedzwicki had never treated and did not know the victim. She testified, in part, about the needs, characteristics and behaviors of children who have been sexually abused. The state posed a hypothetical question that paralleled the facts of this case and asked Niedzwicki, on the basis of her education, experience and familiarity with the literature on child sexual abuse, whether the manner in which the child in the hypothetical disclosed the sexual abuse was behavior typical of a child who had been sexually abused under those circumstances. Nied-zwicki answered, \u201cyes.\u201d She also testified that she was not in a position to evaluate whether anything that the victim in this case said or did was credible. The defendant objected to Niedwzicki\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u201cExpert testimony should be admitted when: (1) the witness has a special skill or knowledge directly applicable to a matter in issue, (2) that skill or knowledge is not common to the average person, and (3) the testimony would be helpful to the court or jury in considering the issues. . . . We review claims of improper admission of expert testimony under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Freeney, </em>228 Conn. 582, 591, 637 A.2d 1088 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Expert testimony about the characteristics and behavior of victims of abuse, be it battered woman syndrome or sexual abuse, has been addressed previously by appellate courts of this state. See, e.g., id., 589-93; <em>State </em>v. <em>Borrelli, </em>227 Conn. 153, 629 A.2d 1105 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Niemeyer, </em>55 Conn. App. 447, 740 A.2d 416 (1999), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 258 Conn. 510, 782 A.2d 658 (2001). Our Supreme Court has stated \u201cthat there is a critical distinction between admissible expert testimony on general or typical behavior patterns of . . . victims and inadmissible testimony directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>concerning the particular victim\u2019s credibility.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Borrelli, </em>supra, 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">An \u201cexpert may testify only as to the general behavior of victims of domestic abuse. He may not give an opinion as to whether <em>this particular victim </em>told the truth or whether <em>this particular victim </em>in fact suffered from domestic abuse. . . . These questions are solely within the province of the jury.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Niemeyer, </em>supra, 55 Conn. App. 453. On the basis of our review of the transcript and the arguments of the parties on appeal, we conclude that the court properly admitted Niedzwicki\u2019s testimony with respect to the hypothetical question posed by the state, as it did not intrude on the juiy\u2019s function as the arbiter of credibility and provided guidance to the jury on a matter that is not common knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The third of the defendant\u2019s evidentiary claims is that the court improperly admitted evidence pursuant to the constancy of accusation doctrine in violation of <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 284, and its progeny. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">\u201c[Wjhether evidence is admissible under the constancy of accusation doctrine is an evidentiary question that will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cansler, </em>54 Conn. App. 819, 825, 738 A.2d 1095 (1999). An appellate court will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Orhan, </em>52 Conn. App. 231, 237, 726 A.2d 629 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">In <em>Troupe, </em>our Supreme Court held that \u201cconstancy of accusation witnesses in sexual assault cases would be confined to testify only regar ding the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>victim complained to them, the time when that complaint was made, and the limited details of the assault, including the identity of the alleged perpetrator as reported to the witness by the victim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>256 Conn. 23, 36, 770 A.2d 908 (2001). \u201cAccordingly . . . any testimony by the witness regarding the details surrounding the assault must be strictly limited to those necessary to associate the victim\u2019s complaint with the pending charge, including, for example, the time and place of the attack or the identity of the alleged perpetrator. <em>[State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 304.] Additionally, to admit the constancy of accusation testimony, the trial court must nevertheless, balance the probative value of the evidence against any prejudice to the defendant. Id., 305.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u201c[S]uch evidence is admissible only to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony and not for substantive purposes. Before the evidence may be admitted, therefore, the victim must first have testified concerning the facts of the sexual assault and the identity of the person or persons to whom the incident was reported.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 304-305. Furthermore, \u201cthe rule adopted in <em>Troupe </em>did not affect other rules of evidence or render inadmissible evidence that would otherwise be admissible under other rules of evidence, such as exceptions to the general rule against hearsay.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">In his principal appellate brief, the defendant cites questions that were asked of six witnesses and argues that the court improperly admitted their constancy of accusation testimony because both the state and the court asked the witnesses broad questions that elicited extensive, detailed narratives rather than asking questions tailored to elicit the scope of testimony permitted by <em>Troupe. </em>We disagree that the questions invited expansive responses. Of the seventeen questions cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>by the defendant in his brief, all but three required a yes or no answer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> None of the yes or no questions violated the confines of <em>Troupe. </em>Some of the questions asked in no way related to constancy of accusation and were, in fact, directed to fact witnesses.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although the defendant carefully included the questions he disliked, he did not provide the response or explain how the response was either irrelevant, immaterial, in violation of one of the rales of evidence or prejudicial to him pursuant to the constancy of accusation rale. The defendant merely included portions of the witnesses\u2019 testimony in his appendix and invited us to read it. It is not the job of an appellate court to search through the transcript on behalf of the defendant to find an error that he claims was prejudicial to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument as to the prejudice that supposedly befell him is that the testimony of the constancy witnesses was not constant because those witnesses offered different testimony as to the nature of the victim\u2019s relationship with him. From the perspective of the court, inconsistent testimony from the state\u2019s witnesses rarely is prejudicial to a defendant. If anything, it will call into question the validity of the state\u2019s case in the eyes of the jury, which is the arbiter of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>We have read the testimony cited in the defendant\u2019s appendix and the testimony brought to our attention by the state. None of the witnesses described the details of the sexual activity between the defendant and the victim. Most witnesses merely testified that the victim told them that she was having sex with the defendant and told them in general terms when it took place. At the conclusion of the testimony of several constancy of accusation witnesses, the court instructed the jury regarding constancy of accusation evidence, particularly that it could not be used as evidence of the crimes with which the defendant was charged. We also note that the defendant himself elicited specific facts from the witnesses during his cross-examination of them. For those reasons, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the constancy of accusation evidence of which the defendant complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">ALLEGED PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The defendant\u2019s last claim is that the prosecutor\u2019s final argument to the jury violated his constitutional rights and deprived him of a fair trial. The defendant failed to object to the closing argument of the prosecutor and seeks review under the plain error doctrine; Practice Book \u00a7 60-5;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We will review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>defendant\u2019s claim pursuant to <em>Golding </em>because the record is adequate for us to do so, and an allegation of prosecutorial misconduct in violation of a fundamental right is of constitutional magnitude. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, 70 </em>Conn. App. 515, 526, 800 A.2d 1200 (2002). On the basis of our review of the trial transcript and the briefs and arguments of the parties, we conclude, however, that the alleged constitutional violation did not clearly exist and did not clearly deprive the defendant of a fair trial, and, further that it is not one of those truly exceptional circumstances that warrant plain error review.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u201cProsecutorial misconduct can occur in the course of closing argument. . . . Our standard of review of a claim of prosecutorial misconduct that allegedly results in an unfair trial is well established. [T]o deprive a defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial . . . the prosecutor\u2019s conduct must have so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. . . . We do not focus alone, however, on the conduct of the prosecutor. The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecu-torial misconduct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 526-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The essence of the defendant\u2019s claim is that the prosecutor improperly commented on the credibility of the witnesses and the inferences that could be drawn from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>their testimony. We agree with the defendant that in general, during closing arguments, a prosecutor may not express a personal opinion as to the credibility of witnesses. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 541, 529 A.2d 653 (1987). Where a prosecutor offers an opinion while recapitulating the evidence, however, our Supreme Court has held that such comments are improper, but do not constitute serious misconduct that affects the fairness of the trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Oehman, </em>212 Conn. 325, 336, 562 A.2d 493 (1989). This court has held that it is not improper for a prosecutor to offer an opinion when commenting on evidence that supports the credibility of a witness. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Saez, </em>60 Conn. App. 264, 268, 758 A.2d 894, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 905, 762 A.2d 912 (2000). A prosecutor may contend that testimony is truthful because it is \u201ccorroborated by the other evidence in the case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>211 Conn. 555, 590, 560 A.2d 426 (1989). Furthermore, aprosecutor may properly comment on the credibility of a witness where \u201cthe comment reflects reasonable inferences from the evidence adduced at trial.\u201d <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>52 Conn. App. 385, 401, 726 A.2d 657, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 920, 733 A.2d 233 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\u201c[I]n addressing the jury, [c]ounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument. . . . [W]e must review the comments complained of in the context of the entire trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Abdalaziz, </em>45 Conn. App. 591, 605, 696 A.2d 1310 (1997), aff'd, 248 Conn. 430, 729 A.2d 725 (1999). \u201cThe mere use of phrases such as T submit,\u2019 T find,\u2019 or 1 believe\u2019 does not constitute improper argument.\u201d <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 52 Conn. App. 400. A prosecutor may discuss whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>witnesses have rehearsed their testimony; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>258 Conn. 153, 169, 778 A.2d 955 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 589-90; and bring to the jury\u2019s attention the testimony of those witnesses who have an interest in the outcome of the trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>67 Conn. App. 249, 272-73, 786 A.2d 1189 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 918, 791 A.2d 566 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">We have reviewed the transcript of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument and are mindful of the parameters that guide our determination of whether a prosecutor\u2019s comments were so egregious as to have violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to a fair trial. We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments here fell within those boundaries and that the defendant was not denied a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b128-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and: (1) Such other person is thirteen years of age or older but under sixteen years of age and the actor is more than two years older than such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b128-14\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53-21 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who ...

See also <em>Goodrum v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>63 Conn. App. 297, 309-10, 776 A.2d 461 (phrase identifies permissive inference rather than forced conclusion), cert. denied, 258 Conn. 902, 782 A.2d 136 (2001). In concluding that the term guilty connection did not violate the defendant\u2019s rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, our Supreme Court in <em>Francis </em>advised trial courts that \u201cbecause of the possibility of the jury\u2019s confusing \u2018guilty connection\u2019 as indicating evidence of guilt itself rather than evidence of consciousness of guilt; <em>[State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>199 Conn. 14, 27, 505 A.2d 690 (1986)]; it would be preferable for the trial court to omit the phrase \u2018guilty connection\u2019 from its instructions regarding false statements made by the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>supra, 133 n.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>The defendant here did not bring <em>Francis </em>to the court\u2019s attention when he objected to the charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\"> With respect to constancy of accusation, the court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cAs you know, statements made out of court by a witness generally are not admissible because those out-of-court statements lack the support of tlie oath that a witness taires in court. However, there are exceptions to that general rule, and we have one of those exceptions in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">\u201cNow, the complaining witness here, [the victim], has testified here in court as to the offenses the state and she claim were committed upon her. Now, if that were all we had, you would ask yourselves, why did she keep silent about it until she came here before the court to testify. So, for the purpose of corroborating her testimony, the state is permitted to prove that outside of court, she made complaints or statements about what was done to her by the defendant. She made these statements to other persons. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">\u201cNow, this evidence was admitted to corroborate her testimony in court. It is to be considered by you on a very \u2014 on a limited basis, and considered by you only in determining the weight and credibility of [the victim\u2019s] testimony. The fact that [the victim] made these statements is not being offered to prove that these events happened. But merely that she claimed they happened and to corroborate her in-court testimony. In determining the extent of such corroboration in her statements out of \u2014 the extent of such corroboration of her statements out of court, you will carefully consider all the circumstances under which they were made and, particularly, you should consider whether she has been constant and consistent in what she has said.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">\u201cIn addition, for the purpose of corroborating [the victim\u2019s] testimony, her out-of-court statements may also be used for the purpose of impeaching her testimony. Therefore, you may rely on and consider any contradictions, inconsistencies or falsities which you find in the [victim\u2019s] out-of-court statements in assessing the weight and credibility of her testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">We have reviewed the defendant\u2019s request to charge and conclude that the instruction given by the court was more comprehensive than what the defendant had requested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b136-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 42-18 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen there are several requests, they shall be in separate and numbered paragraphs, each containing a single proposition of law clearly and concisely stated <em>with the citation of authority upon which it is based </em>. . .
