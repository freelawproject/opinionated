On appeal, the plaintiff claims that (1) the board improperly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s determination that she is not entitled to benefits under General Statutes \u00a7 31-308a<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because she relocated to Florida and (2) the board improperly enforced the requirement in \u00a7 31-308a that she be willing and able to perform work in Connecticut because that requirement impermissibly restricts her right to interstate migration in violation of the constitution of the United States and the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to the plaintiffs appeal. The plaintiff suffered a work-related injury on January 25, 1994, while employed by the defendant United States Surgical Corporation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a result, the plaintiff sought workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>compensation benefits and was awarded permanent partial disability benefits, which expired on January 31, 1997. The plaintiff received additional benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-308a in the amount of $271.05 per week from February 1,1997, to August 31,1997, when she relocated to Florida.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the plaintiff believed that she was entitled to 15.72 more weeks of those benefits despite her relocation outside of Connecticut, she filed a claim with the workers\u2019 compensation commission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>The commissioner found that because the plaintiff now lives in Florida, she does not meet the requirement set forth in \u00a7 31-308a (a) that the benefits \u201cshall be available only to employees who are willing and able to perform work in this state.\u201d The plaintiff appealed to the board, which affirmed the decision of the commissioner. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Before addressing the merits of the plaintiffs claims, we set forth the standards governing our review of decisions by the board. \u201c[W]hen a decision of a commissioner is appealed to the [board], the [board] is obligated to hear the appeal on the record of the hearing before the commissioner and not to retry the facts. . . . The commissioner has the power and duty, as the trier of fact, to determine the facts. . . . The conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. . . . Our scope of review of the actions of the . . . [board] is similarly limited.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number><em>Gartrell </em>v. <em>Dept. of Correction, </em>259 Conn. 29, 36, 787 A.2d 541 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">\u201cIt is well established that [a]lthough not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and review board. ... A state agency is not entitled, however, to special deference when its determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny. . . . Where ... [a workers\u2019 compensation] appeal involves an issue of statutory construction that has not yet been subjected to judicial scrutiny, this court has plenary power to review the administrative decision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tower </em>v. <em>Miller Johnson, Inc., </em>67 Conn. App. 71, 74, 787 A.2d 26 (2001); see also <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Southington, </em>259 Conn. 783, 787, 792 A.2d 76 (2002) (\u201ctraditional deference accorded to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statutory term is unwarranted when the construction of a statute . . . has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny [or to] ... a governmental agency\u2019s time-tested interpretation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The plaintiff first claims that the board improperly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s finding that she is not entitled to benefits under \u00a7 31-308a because she relocated to Florida. Specifically, she argues that because she unsuccessfully sought employment in Connecticut for more than one year prior to the time that she relocated to Florida, she demonstrated that she was \u201cwilling and able to perform work in this state,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 31-308a (a). In the alternative, she argues that she is entitled to benefits under \u00a7 31-308a (b) even if she no longer qualifies for benefits under \u00a7 31-308a (a). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Because no Connecticut appellate court has had the opportunity to examine the relevant statutory language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>at issue, we employ our well established canons of statutory construction. \u201c[0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Alvarado </em>v. <em>Black, </em>248 Conn. 409, 414, 728 A.2d 500 (1999). \u201cA cardinal rule of statutory construction is that where the words of a statute are plain and unambiguous the intent of the [drafters] in enacting the statute is to be derived from the words used. . . . Where the court is provided with a clearly written rule, it need look no further for interpretive guidance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>70 Conn. App. 358, 376, 800 A.2d 517 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Indeed, \u201c[w]e are constrained to read a statute as written . . . and we may not read into clearly expressed legislation provisions which do not find expression in its words . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Giaimo </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>257 Conn. 481, 494, 778 A.2d 33 (2001). \u201cIn interpreting the language of a statute, the words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning and their natural and usual sense unless the context indicates that a different meaning was intended.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Darlene C., </em>247 Conn. 1, 10, 717 A.2d 1242 (1998); see also General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We conclude that the language of \u00a7 31-308a is plain and unambiguous. Section 3 l-308a permits the commissioner to award additional benefits to a claimant whose earning capacity has been affected adversely by a work-related accident once a specific award of workers\u2019 compensation benefits has been exhausted. Subsection (a) of \u00a7 31-308a, however, limits the availability of such an award, providing in relevant part: \u201cAdditional benefits provided under this section shall be available only to employees who are <em>willing and able </em>to perform work in [Connecticut].\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>In the present case, the board held that \u201c[entitlement for temporary total and partial disability benefits generally depends upon a claimant\u2019s continuing inability to work and continuing wage loss; similarly, eligibility for \u00a7 31-308a benefits depends upon a claimant\u2019s sustained satisfaction of the criteria in that statute.\u201d The plaintiff argues that because she unsuccessfully sought work prior to relocating to Florida, she was \u201cwilling\u201d to perform work in Connecticut. We agree with the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The use of the word \u201care\u201d in \u00a7 31-308a (a) evinces the legislature\u2019s intent that a claimant must presently fulfill the \u201cwilling and able\u201d requirement to receive benefits. If the claimant ceases to be \u201cwilling and able\u201d to work in Connecticut, she no longer satisfies the statute. In addition, \u00a7 31-308a (a) requires that a claimant be <em>both </em>willing and able to perform work in Connecticut. A look at the ordinary meaning of the words reveals that \u201cwilling\u201d means \u201cdone ... by choice\u201d; Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993); and \u201cable\u201d means \u201chaving sufficient power ... or resources to accomplish an object.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">We conclude that the board properly found that the plaintiff was neither willing nor able to perform work in the state of Connecticut. Although we recognize that the plaintiff did actively seek employment in Connecticut before her relocation, she chose to relocate to Florida of her own volition. Furthermore, the plaintiff relinquished her residency in Connecticut and works part time in Florida. The relocation to Florida clearly demonstrates the plaintiffs unwillingness to perform work in Connecticut. Furthermore, to find that she is able to work in Connecticut while residing in Florida is patently unrealistic.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The plaintiff argues, in the alternative, that she is entitled to benefits under \u00a7 31-308a (b) even if she no longer qualifies for benefits under subsection (a) because she relocated to Florida. She interprets subsection (b) as a provision that confers on the commissioner the discretion to award additional benefits, unfettered by the limitations in subsection (a). The plaintiff\u2019s interpretation does not comport with the express language of the statute. Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s argument, the express language of \u00a7 31-308a (b) restricts the commissioner\u2019s authority to compensate even those employees who meet the criteria in subsection (a) to circumstances \u201conly when the nature of the injury and its effect on the earning capacity of an employee warrant additional compensation.\u201d On the basis of the foregoing, the board properly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision to discontinue the plaintiffs additional benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-308a.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Next, the plaintiff claims that the requirement in \u00a7 31-308a that she be willing and able to perform work in Connecticut impermissibly restricts her right to interstate migration in violation of the constitution of the United States. Specifically, she argues that the requirement is a penalty for relocating out of Connecticut that is unsupported by an appropriate state interest and impinges on her right to migrate to Florida.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">In the present case, the plaintiff is seeking additional workers\u2019 compensation benefits after having voluntarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>relocated to Florida. Relying on <em>Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Maricopa County, </em>415 U.S. 250, 258, 94 S. Ct. 1076, 39 L. Ed. 2d 306 (1974), the plaintiff argues that a law that penalizes those who exercise their right to travel is subject to strict scrutiny analysis and must be justified by a compelling state interest.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further, she contends that the law fails that test because merely saving money is insufficient to demonstrate a compelling state interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">\u201c[T]he constitutional right to travel from one State to another is firmly embedded in our jurisprudence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Saenz </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>526 U.S. 489, 498, 119 S. Ct. 1518, 143 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1999), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Guest, </em>383 U.S. 745, 757, 86 S. Ct. 1170, 16 L. Ed. 2d 239 (1966); see also 16B Am. Jur. 2d, Constitutional Law \u00a7 612 (1998). The right to travel \u201cprotects the right of a citizen of one State to enter and to leave another State, the right to be treated as a welcome visitor rather than an unfriendly alien when temporarily present in the second State, and, for those travelers who elect to become permanent residents, the right to be treated like other citizens of that State.\u201d <em>Saenz </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>supra, 500. Hence, the \u201cright to travel\u201d implicates how a citizen is treated in her <em>new state of residence. </em>See id. (limitation on welfare benefits received by new residents for first year of residency unconstitutional); see also <em>Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Maricopa County, </em>supra, 415 U.S. 250 (one year residency requirement before new indigent resident could receive medical benefits at county\u2019s expense unconstitutional); <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>394 U.S. 618, 89 S. Ct. 1322, 22 L. Ed. 2d 600 (1969) (one year residency requirement before new resident could receive welfare benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>unconstitutional), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Edelman </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 670-71, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 39 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1974). Such is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">In fact, the United States Supreme Court previously addressed an issue similar to that presented by the plaintiff in this case. In <em>Califano </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>435 U.S. 1, 98 S. Ct. 906, 55 L. Ed. 2d 65 (1978), the claimants argued that the provisions of the Social Security Act, which make benefits for aged, blind and disabled persons under the supplemental security income program payable only to residents of the United States, violate their constitutional right to travel. The claimants lost those benefits after relocating from the northeastern United States to Puerto Rico. Id., 3. The court expressly declined to extend the right to travel to encompass one\u2019s right to relocate to another state and yet avail oneself of the benefits to which one was entitled in one\u2019s former state. Id., 4. The court recognized that it \u201chas never held that the constitutional right to travel embraces any such doctrine . . . .\u201d Id. The court further stated that \u201c[s]uch a doctrine would apply with equal force to any benefits a State might provide for its residents, and would require a State to continue to pay those benefits indefinitely to any person who had once resided there. And the broader implications of such a doctrine in other areas of substantive law would bid fair to destroy the independent power of each State under our Constitution to enact laws uniformly applicable to all of its residents.\u201d Id., 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Because the plaintiffs \u201cright to travel\u201d is not implicated, her claim that \u00a7 3 l-308a violates the constitution of the United States because it is not necessary to accomplish a compelling state interest has no merit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>The decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-308a provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) In addition to the compensation benefits provided by section 31-308 for specific loss of a <em>member or </em>use of the function of amember of the body, or any personal injury covered by this chapter, the commissioner, after such payments provided by said section 31-308 have been paid for the period set forth in said section, may award additional compensation benefits .... <em>Additional benefits provided under this section shall be available only to employees who are willing and able to perform work in this state.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">\u201c(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, additional benefits provided under this section shall be available <em>only when the nature of the injury and its effect on the earning capacity of an employee warrant additional compensation.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-9\"> Although the plaintiff claims a violation of her federal and state constitutional rights, she has not presented an adequate and independent state constitutional analysis, and, therefore, we limit our review to her federal constitutional claim.
