This was the rule at common law and, for checks, it is now the rule of \u00a7 42a-3-311 (a). See <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners, P.C. </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 764-65, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996); see also <em>County Fire Door Corp. </em>v. <em>C. F. Wood</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number><em>ing Co., </em>202 Conn. 277, 282 n.3, 520 A.2d 1028 (1987); <em>Munroe </em>v. <em>Emhart Corp., </em>46 Conn. App. 37, 42-43, 699 A.2d 213, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 926, 701 A.2d 658 (1997). The trial court found that the debtor did not prove that it had satisfied this precondition because, at the time when the check was sent, the amount of the debt, both as to principal and as to interest, was liquidated and therefore not subject to a good faith dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">In its appeal, the debtor contests the validity of the court\u2019s refusal to apply the doctrine of accord and satisfaction. We, however, are persuaded that the court\u2019s decision is amply supported by the facts of record at trial. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court ordering the payment of interest for the time between the accrual of the debt and the acceptance of the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">On February 13,2001, the plaintiff Vincent J. Douthwright<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> filed a motion pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-195c<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for a default judgment arising out of the failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>of the named defendant et al.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to pay their full share of an oral settlement agreement. The agreement entitled the plaintiff to recover $3.2 million as settlement of his tort action to recover damages for serious injuries that he received when concrete pylons rolled off a truck and crushed his leg. Pursuant to the agreement, the defendants were obligated to pay $2.5 million of that sum. Although the defendants\u2019 primary insurer had paid $1 million, the defendants\u2019 excess insurance carrier had refused to pay the remaining $1.5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The plaintiff sought a default judgment in the amount of $1.5 million plus interest. In response, on March 13, 2001, the defendants denied that the settlement agreement imposed upon them an obligation to pay the plaintiff immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">On March 26, 2001, the parties appeared before the court for an initial hearing on the motion for default.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Subsequent to that hearing, the defendants sent the plaintiff a check in the amount of $1.5 million, accompanied by a cover letter. The amount of the check repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>sented the principal sum then due. It did not include any payment of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">On May 8, 2001, after an evidentiary hearing, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $40,931.45. That amount represented interest at the rate of 12 percent per year as specified in \u00a7 52-195c (d)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for the period between February 2,2001, when the defendants\u2019 payment became due, and April 25, 2001, when the defendants paid $1.5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">As the basis for its judgment, the court made two central findings of fact. One concerned the terms of the settlement agreement and the other concerned the date when the defendants\u2019 obligation to pay became due. The defendants\u2019 appeal challenges the propriety of these findings as they relate to their claim of accord and satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Our review of the defendants\u2019 appeal is governed by the well established principle that an appellate court will overturn the factual findings of a trial court only if these findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. In applying the clearly erroneous standard to the findings of a trial court, we keep constantly in mind that our function is not to decide factual issues de novo. Our authority, when reviewing the findings of a judge, is circumscribed by the deference we must give to decisions of the trier of fact, who is usually in a superior position to appraise and weigh the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Kulesza, </em>197 Conn. 101, 105, 495 A.2d 1074 (1985); see also Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; <em>Place </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>66 Conn. App. 219, 222, 783 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>A.2d 1260 (2001); <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>13 Conn. App. 355, 359, 536 A.2d 985 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">To support their claim of accord and satisfaction, the defendants maintain that the trial court improperly determined the terms of an oral settlement agreement to which the parties had agreed on December 15, 2000. The court found that the agreement unconditionally entitled the plaintiff to receive $3.2 million in full settlement of his claims against the defendants and New England Pipe Corporation. On an interim basis, the agreement allocated $2.5 million of this payment to the defendants. Further, the agreement provided that the ultimate allocation of payments between the defendants and New England Pipe Corporation would be decided by a subsequent arbitration. The court\u2019s final and most significant finding was that the settlement agreement entitled the plaintiff to immediate payment and that this payment was <em>not </em>conditioned on the execution of the contemplated arbitration agreement. The defendants disagree with the finding that the plaintiff should have been paid immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The court based its finding on the testimony of all the participants in the settlement proceedings. The defendants\u2019 counsel testified that, at the time of the settlement negotiations, he had made it clear that the settlement was contingent upon the execution of the contemplated arbitration agreement between the defendants and New England Pipe Corporation. This testimony was flatly contradicted by the testimony of the other four attorneys who participated in the mediation that led to the settlement agreement. One of these attorneys was the mediator. The court expressly found that, even though the defendants\u2019 counsel believed his testimony to be accurate, the testimony was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u201cIt is within the province of the trial court, as the fact finder, to weigh the evidence presented and deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>mine the credibility and effect to be given the evidence. . . . Where testimony is conflicting the trier may choose to believe one version over the other ... as the probative force of the evidence is for the trier to determine.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>McWeeny, </em>260 Conn. 296, 327, 796 A.2d 516 (2002), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>245 Conn. 301, 318, 715 A.2d 1 (1998). We, therefore, defer to the trial court\u2019s credibility assessments and conclude that there was ample evidence in the record to support its findings about the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Having determined that the settlement agreement entitled the plaintiff to immediate payment, the trial court found that the defendants\u2019 debt matured upon the plaintiffs delivery of the appropriate releases and the withdrawal of his complaint. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-195c (a). The plaintiff fulfilled his responsibilities on January 2, 2001. Accordingly, the defendants\u2019 debt became due and payable on February 2,2001. The defendants\u2019 only challenge to this finding is their aforementioned contention that the settlement agreement was not unconditional. That claim we have already rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff was unconditionally entitled to payment on February 2, 2001, knocked out the underpinnings of the defendants\u2019 claim that their obligation to pay interest was discharged by their tender and payment of a check in the principal amount of their indebtedness.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In order to obtain such a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>charge, the defendants bore the burden of proving not only that there was \u201ca dispute\u201d between the parties, but also that the amount of the plaintiffs claim was \u201cunliquidated or subject to a bona fide dispute . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-311 (a) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">After February 2, 2001, there was no basis for a <em>good faith </em>dispute about the defendants\u2019 indebtedness to the plaintiff. Likewise, there was no basis for a <em>good faith </em>dispute about the amount of the defendants\u2019 indebtedness for interest. Section 52-195c unequivocally required the defendants to pay interest at the rate of 12 percent per year after February 2, 2001. Under these circumstances, the court found that the defendants\u2019 letter stating that the check was tendered as full satisfaction of its indebtedness had no legal effect.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">We are persuaded that the court\u2019s findings must be sustained. The defendants did not satisfy the burden of proof assigned to them by \u00a7 42a-3-311 (a) or by the common law. We conclude, therefore, that the defendants have not provided any sustainable basis for their argument that the trial court\u2019s judgment should be set aside. None of the court\u2019s findings of fact was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">In a last ditch effort to avoid their obligation to the plaintiff, the defendants maintain that the court lost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claim for relief once the plaintiff withdrew its motion for default judgment. This argument would be difficult to sustain in light of \u00a7 52-195c (a), to which the defendants do not refer. We need not consider its merits, however, because it was never presented to the trial court. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The court properly rendered a judgment entitling the plaintiff to recover interest in the amount of $40,931.45.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-8\"> Although there are differences between the statute and the common law, those differences are not relevant under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-311 provides in relevant part: \u201cAccord and satisfaction by use of instrument, (a) If a person against whom a claim is asserted proves that (i) that person in good faith tendered an instrument to the claimant as full satisfaction of the claim, (ii) the amount of the claim was unliquidated or subject to a bona fide dispute, and (iii) the claimant obtained payment of the instrument, the following subsections apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">\u201c(b) Unless subsection (c) applies, the claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted proves that the instrument or an accompanying written communication contained a conspicuous statement to the effect that the instrument was tendered as full satisfaction of the claim. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">\u201c(d) A claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted proves that within a reasonable time before collection of the instrument was initiated, the claimant, or an agent of the claimant having direct responsibility with respect to the disputed obligation, knew that the instrument was tendered in full satisfaction of the claim.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\"> The plaintiffs wife, Sandra Douthwright, also was named as a plaintiff.

The court found that the letter sent by the defendant did not communicate its intent to seek discharge of its principal obligation as well as of its indebtedness for interest.
