Scalzi, Anthony G. Scalzi and Celeste Scalzi, from the judgment of the trial court rendered upon the acceptance of a report by an attorney trial referee (referee) recommending judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, Mary Fitzpatrick and Charles Morgan, the sublessors in this residential housing action for the return of a security deposit. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">The referee found the following facts. The defendants owned certain real estate (premises) at 921 Stillwater Road, Stamford, and had leased the premises to Nancy Rivero and Carlos Rivero for a term to run from June 1, 1997, until May 31, 1998. By the terms of the lease, the premises could be sublet with the written approval of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">The Riveros sublet the premises to the plaintiffs for a term to run from September 15, 1997, until May 31, 1998, with the consent and active participation of the defendants. Because the defendants were unwilling to accept the plaintiffs\u2019 credit, they retained the Riveros\u2019 security deposit, in the sum of $3700, and the Riveros, in turn, were paid that sum by the plaintiffs to replace their deposit made to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>The plaintiffs occupied the premises for the entire term of their sublease and subsequently informed the defendants of their forwarding address and made due demand for the return of their security deposit. The defendants failed to return the deposit or to forward an itemized list of damage to the premises that was to be withheld from the deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">The plaintiffs thereafter filed an action claiming unlawful retention of their security deposit under General Statutes \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2), violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., and unjust enrichment. After a trial, the referee found violations of \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2) and CUTPA, and that the defendants had been unjustly enriched. The referee determined damages to be $3700 for the failure to return the plaintiffs\u2019 deposit, an additional $3700 because that failure was wilful and wrongful, $1411 in interest under General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a and $1321 for attorney\u2019s fees under CUTPA for a total of $10,132. The court accepted the referee\u2019s findings and recommendation that judgment be rendered in favor of the plaintiffs. After the court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The defendants claim that the court improperly accepted the report of the referee because (1) the referee improperly concluded that the defendants were landlords as to the plaintiffs and that the defendants were liable to the plaintiffs under \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2), (2) the referee improperly concluded that the defendants were liable to the plaintiffs under CUTPA, (3) the referee improperly concluded that the defendants had been unjustly enriched and (4) the amount of the damages award was improper in light of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">We first set forth the standard of review for matters involving referees. \u201cIt is axiomatic that [a] reviewing authority may not substitute its findings for those of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>the trier of the facts. . . . The factual findings of a [trial referee] on any issue are reversible only if they are clearly erroneous. ... [A reviewing court] cannot retry the facts or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it . . . or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted). <em>Meadows </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>249 Conn. 155, 162, 733 A.2d 172 (1999). Thus, the findings of the referee will be disturbed only if they are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">THE DEFENDANTS\u2019 LIABILITY UNDER \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">The referee found that under \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2), the defendants were hable to the plaintiffs for failure to return their security deposit. The relevant language of \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2) provides: \u201cUpon termination of a tenancy, any tenant may notify his landlord in writing of such tenant\u2019s forwarding address. Within thirty days after termination of a tenancy, each landlord . . . shall deliver to the tenant or former tenant at such forwarding address either (A) the full amount of the security deposit paid by such tenant plus accrued interest as provided in subsection (i) of this section, or (B) the balance of the security deposit paid by such tenant plus accrued interest as provided in subsection (i) of this section after deduction for any damages suffered by such landlord by reason of such tenant\u2019s failure to comply with such tenant\u2019s obligations, together with a written statement itemizing the nature and amount of such damages. Any such landlord who violates any provision of this subsection shall be hable for twice the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>or value of any security deposit paid by such tenant &gt;5</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The defendants contend that they were not landlords as to the plaintiffs for the purposes of \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2) and that the referee\u2019s finding that they were was improper. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">The Landlord and Tenant Act, General Statutes \u00a7 47a-1 et seq., defines the term \u201clandlord\u201d in both \u00a7 47a-l (d) and \u00a7 47a-21 (a) (6). Section 47a-l provides in relevant part: \u201cAs used in this chapter and <em>sections 47a-21 .. . </em>(d) \u2018Landlord\u2019 means the owner, lessor or sub-lessor of the dwelling unit, the building of which it is a part or the premises.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 47a-21 (a) (6) further defines landlord as \u201cany landlord of residential real property, and includes (A) any receiver; (B) any person who is a successor to a landlord or to a landlord\u2019s interest; and (C) any tenant who sublets his premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">The term \u201ctenant\u201d is defined in \u00a7 47a-l <em>(V) </em>as \u201cthe lessee, sublessee or person entitled under a rental agreement to occupy a dwelling unit or premises to the exclusion of others or as is otherwise defined by law.\u201d The term is also defined in \u00a7 47a-21 (a) (12) as \u201ca tenant, as defined in section 47a-l . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">As is apparent from the pleadings and the referee\u2019s findings, the defendants meet the definition of landlord as defined in those two statutes. They are the owners of the dwelling unit in accordance with \u00a7 47a-l (d), and, under \u00a7 47a-21 (a) (6) (B), they were also \u201csuccessors to ... a landlord\u2019s interest . . . .\u201d The Riveros, as sublessors, were the plaintiffs\u2019 landlords by virtue of \u00a7 47a-21 (a) (6) (C). When the plaintiffs paid a security deposit to the Riveros, however, to replace the security deposit that the Riveros had paid to the defendants, the defendants became successors to the Riveros\u2019 interest in the plaintiffs\u2019 security deposit. The Riveros\u2019 inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>est as holders of the second security deposit was transferred to the defendants. Nancy Rivero testified that the defendants understood that the security deposit in their hands belonged to the plaintiffs. Therefore, for purposes of \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2), the defendants are the plaintiffs\u2019 landlords with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 security deposit. Further, the plaintiffs fit under the statutory definitions as tenants. They are the persons entitled under a rental agreement to occupy a dwelling unit or premises to the exclusion of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Section 47a-21 (d) (2) imposes liability on a landlord who does not deliver a security deposit to the former tenants. A landlord may deduct from the deposit the amount of any damage caused by the tenant in breach of his rental agreement, but must submit an itemized account of such damages to the former tenant. The referee found that the defendants, as the plaintiffs\u2019 landlords, delivered to the plaintiffs neither their security deposit nor an itemized account of damage to the premises. That finding is not clearly erroneous, and liability under \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2) is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">THE DEFENDANTS\u2019 LIABILITY UNDER CUTPA</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">The referee also found that the defendants were hable to the plaintiffs under CUTPA for having engaged in unfair trade practices. General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a) provides: \u201cNo person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d The defendants raise the following two claims concerning the court\u2019s award under CUTPA: (1) none of the facts found by the referee supports the referee\u2019s conclusion that they violated CUTPA;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) the award was not sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>ported by the evidence because the plaintiffs were not tenants of the defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Our Supreme Court has determined that CUTPA is applicable to residential landlord-tenant transactions. See <em>Conaway </em>v. <em>Prestia, </em>191 Conn. 484, 464 A.2d 847 (1983). General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (d) also provides: \u201cIt is the intention of the legislature that this chapter be remedial and be so construed.\u201d Also, our Supreme Court has held \u201cthat CUTPA is remedial in character . . . and must be liberally construed in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted). <em>Service Road Corp. </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>241 Conn. 630, 637, 698 A.2d 258 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The referee found that because the defendants had violated \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2) by not delivering the plaintiffs\u2019 security deposit to them, the defendants had committed a CUTPA violation. The legislature and courts mandate a liberal reading of CUTPA. The referee\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous and will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">THE DEFENDANTS\u2019 LIABILITY FOR UNJUST ENRICHMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">The referee found that the defendants\u2019 wrongful retention of the plaintiffs\u2019 security deposit amounted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>to unjust enrichment. The defendants claim that they were not unjustly enriched and that this finding was improper because there was no evidence of a $3700 payment from the plaintiffs. The referee\u2019s findings are in opposition to the defendants\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The plaintiffs concede that they never gave the defendants $3700 as a security deposit. During negotiations for the sublease between the plaintiffs and the Riveros, the defendants became unwilling to accept the plaintiffs\u2019 credit. Because of that, the defendants refused to return the $3700 security deposit that had been given to them by the Riveros. To remedy that situation, the plaintiffs paid that same amount to the Riveros, and Nancy Rivero testified that the defendants understood that the deposit in their hands then belonged to the plaintiffs. That was sufficient evidence for the referee to find that the $3700 deposit in the hands of the defendants properly belonged to the plaintiffs at the termination of their tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">\u201cUnjust enrichment applies wherever justice requires compensation to be given for property or services rendered .... A right of recovery under the doctrine of unjust enrichment is essentially equitable, its basis being that in a given situation it is contrary to equity and good conscience for one to retain a benefit which has come to him at the expense of another. . . . With no other test than what, under a given set of circumstances, is just or unjust, equitable or inequitable, conscionable or unconscionable, it becomes necessary in any case where the benefit of the doctrine is claimed, to examine the circumstances and the conduct of the parties and apply this standard. . . . Unjust enrichment is, consistent with the principles of equity, a broad and flexible remedy. . . . Plaintiffs seeking recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>for unjust enrichment must prove (1) that the defendants were benefited, (2) that the defendants unjustly did not pay the plaintiffs for the benefits, and (3) that the failure of payment was to the plaintiffs\u2019 detriment.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hartford Whalers Hockey Club </em>v. <em>Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co., </em>231 Conn. 276, 282-83, 649 A.2d 518 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">The referee found that the defendants were benefited by retaining the deposit, that it was unjust of them to fail to return the deposit to the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs had sustained a detriment in the amount of $3700. The defendants retained money that rightfully belonged to the plaintiffs. That act was inequitable, and the defendants were unjustly enriched. The referee\u2019s finding that the defendants were unjustly enriched therefore is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The referee found that the plaintiffs should be awarded $3700 for the failure to return of the security deposit, an additional $3700 for the wrongful detention of the deposit under \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2), $1411 in interest under \u00a7 37-3a and $1321 in attorney\u2019s fees under CUTPA. The defendants claim that amount is improper. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">Under \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2), a landlord who wrongfully does not return a tenant\u2019s security deposit is \u201cliable for twice the amount or value of any security deposit paid by such tenant . . . .\u201d Under that provision, \u201c[t]he court, therefore, need only determine two factual questions to award twice the value of the security deposit under the statute: (1) Was the security deposit returned with interest, or a written notification of damages delivered, within thirty days of the tenant\u2019s termination; and (2) if a written notification of damages was delivered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>was the balance of the security deposit and a statement of damages delivered within sixty days of the termination?\u201d Kufferman <em>v. Fairfield </em>University, 5 Conn. App. 118, 122, 497 A.2d 77 (1985). Because the defendants neither returned the plaintiffs\u2019 security deposit nor provided the plaintiffs with written notification of damage to the premises, an award of twice the value of the security deposit ($7400) was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The referee awarded $1411 in interest to the plaintiffs under \u00a7 37-3a. That section provides in relevant part that \u201cinterest at the rate of ten per cent a year, and no more, may be recovered and allowed in civil actions ... as damages for the detention of money after it becomes payable. ...\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a. Further, this court has reiterated our Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cwell established propositions that \u00a7 37-3a provides for interest on money detained after it becomes due and payable, that the question under that statute is whether the money was wrongfully withheld, and that the ultimate determination is one to be made in view of the demands of justice rather than through the application of any arbitrary rule. ... It is equally well established that we will not overrule the trial court\u2019s award of interest absent a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Spearhead Construction Corp. </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>39 Conn. App. 122, 136, 665 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 928, 667 A.2d 554 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The security deposit was wrongfully detained after it became due and payable. Therefore, it was within the discretion of the referee to determine the amount of interest. We find no abuse of that discretion in the award of interest under \u00a7 37-3a.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The referee also awarded $1321 in attorney\u2019s fees for the defendants\u2019 violation of CUTPA. General Statutes \u00a7 42-1 lOg (d) provides in relevant part: \u201cIn any action brought by a person under this section, the court may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>award, to the plaintiff, in addition to the relief provided in this section, costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees based on the work reasonably performed by an attorney and not on the amount of recovery. . . .\u201d The referee found a CUTPA violation, and we have affirmed the court\u2019s acceptance of that finding. The standard of review for determining whether an authorized award of attorney\u2019s fees is unreasonable pursuant to \u00a7 42-1 lOg (d) is whether the amount of the award represents an abuse of discretion by the court. <em>Thames River Recycling, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>50 Conn. App. 767, 795, 720 A.2d 242 (1998). Under the facts of this case, we find no such abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-9\"> In support of their claim, the defendants in their brief state merely that \u201c[t]he referee\u2019s report is utterly devoid of any finding of any specific facts which would support a conclusion of any CUTPA violation on the part of any of the defendants.\u201d The defendants did not provide any further analysis in support of that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>\u201c[F]or this court judiciously and efficiently to consider claims of error raised on appeal . . . the parties must clearly and fully set forth their arguments in their briefs. We do not reverse the judgment of a trial court on the basis of challenges to its rulings that have not been adequately briefed. . . . The parties may not merely cite a legal principle without analyzing the relationship between the facts of the case and the law cited. . . . [Assignments of error which are merely mentioned but not briefed beyond a statement of the claim will be deemed abandoned and will not be reviewed by this court. . . . Where the parties cite no law and provide no analysis of their claims, we do not review such claims.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wittman </em>v. <em>Krafick, </em>67 Conn. App. 415, 416, 787 A.2d 559 (2001), cert. denied, 260 Conn. 916, 797 A.2d 516 (2002).
