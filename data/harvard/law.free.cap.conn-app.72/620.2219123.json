J.</author>\n<p id=\"azv-dedup-0\">The plaintiff, Mario Mallozzi, Jr., appeals from the summary judgment rendered by the trial court in favor of the defendant, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company. The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment after finding that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that the defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the automobile insurance policy at issue clearly and unambiguously did not provide the plaintiff coverage under the circumstances. On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the insurance contract at issue is ambiguous, and, therefore, the court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We agree with the trial court and conclude that the motion for summary judgment was properly granted. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant. On May 20, 1997, the plaintiff was involved in an automobile accident resulting in his being named a defendant in four civil actions that were brought by parties seeking monetary damages. The plaintiff was driving a pickup truck that was owned by Mallozzi Builders, Inc. (Mallozzi Builders).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff thereafter brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment as to his rights to insurance coverage for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>potential and alleged liability resulting from the accident. The policy under which he sought coverage was a personal automobile policy issued by the defendant to the plaintiffs mother, Floria Mallozzi.</p>\n<p id=\"Aytv\">At the time of the accident, the plaintiff lived with his parents. The plaintiffs father, Mario Mallozzi, Sr., was employed by Mallozzi Builders. The truck was separately insured under a business automobile insurance policy, with a total liability limit of $500,000, also issued by the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Floria Mallozzi\u2019s personal automobile policy provided liability coverage to the policyholder, the policyholder\u2019s resident spouse and resident relatives when driving a vehicle scheduled or listed in the insurance policy declarations. The truck was not a scheduled or listed vehicle. Under certain circumstances, however, the policy insures covered drivers while they are operating \u201cother motor vehicles.\u201d The parties disagree as to the meaning of the provision detailing that coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">That provision states in relevant part that \u201ccoverage also applies to certain <em>other motor vehicles </em>as follows .... 3. A motor vehicle owned by a non-member of your household .... a) This applies only to policies issued to individual persons (not organizations) and while the vehicle is being used by you or a relative. It protects the user, and any person or organization, except as noted below in b), who does not own the vehicle but is legally responsible for its use. b) <em>This does not apply to losses involving a motor vehicle . . . (2) owned, rented or leased by an employer of an insured . . . </em>.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>At the hearing on its motion for summary judgment and on appeal, the defendant claims that, pursuant to the clear language of that provision, the plaintiff is not covered by the personal automobile policy. It argues that this is so because, at the time of the accident, the plaintiff was driving a truck owned by Mallozzi Builders, which, while \u201ca non-member\u201d of the Mallozzi household, was the employer of Mario Mallozzi, Sr., \u201can insured\u201d under the policy. The plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that this provision, read in conjunction with other policy language, is ambiguous and thus should be read to afford him coverage. We agree with the defendant that the policy clearly denies the plaintiff coverage under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">\u201cOur standard of review of a trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment is well established. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-49, summary judgment shall be ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>dered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Such questions of law are subject to plenary appellate review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mytych </em>v. <em>May Dept. Stores Co., </em>260 Conn. 152, 158-59, 793 A.2d 1068 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">In the present case, the plaintiff does not claim that there are genuine issues of material <em>fact. </em>Instead, he argues that summary judgment in favor of the defendant was inappropriate because the court improperly interpreted the insurance contract, as a matter of law, to disallow him coverage. Particularly, he claims that for various reasons, the provision at issue is ambiguous and therefore must be construed so as to afford him coverage. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">\u201cIt is the function of the court to construe the provisions of the contract of insurance. . . . Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision of this issue is de novo. Unlike certain other contracts . . . where . . . the intent of the parties and thus the meaning of the contract is a factual question subject to limited appellate review . . . construction of a contract of insurance presents a question of law for the court which this court reviews de novo.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bonito </em>v. <em>Cambridge Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>64 Conn. App. 487, 489, 780 A.2d 984, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 926, 783 A.2d 1028 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">\u201cWell established principles guide our interpretation of the policy. The [interpretation of an insurance policy, like the inteipretation of other written contracts, involves a determination of the intent of the parties as expressed by the language of the policy. . . . The determinative question is the intent of the parties, that is, what coverage the . . . [insured] expected to receive and what the [insurer] was to provide, as dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>closed by the provisions of the policy. ... It is axiomatic that a contract of insurance must be viewed in its entirety, and the intent of the parties for entering it derived from the four corners of the policy. . . . The policy words must be accorded their natural and ordinary meaning . . . [and] any ambiguity in the terms of an insurance policy must be construed in favor of the insured because the insurance company drafted the policy. <em>... A necessary predicate to this rule of construction, however, is a determination that the terms of the insurance policy are indeed ambiguous. . . . </em>The fact that the parties advocate different meanings of the [insurance policy] does not necessitate a conclusion that the language is ambiguous.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The plaintiff argues first that the phrase \u201cinsured,\u201d as used in part 3 (b) (2) of the \u201cuse of other motor vehicles\u201d provision, is ambiguous and therefore should not be read to include Mario Mallozzi, Sr., and thus to deny coverage on the ground that the plaintiff was driving a vehicle owned by the employer of an \u201cinsured.\u201d We are not convinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">According to the definitions section of the policy, \u201c \u2018INSURED\u2019 means one who is described as entitled to protection under each coverage.\u201d That section also provides that \u201c \u2018YOU\u2019 and \u2018YOUR\u2019 mean the policyholder and spouse if living in the same household,\u201d and \u201c \u2018RELATIVE\u2019 means one who regularly lives in your household and who is related to you by blood, marriage or adoption . . . .\u2019\u201d The policy\u2019s table of contents lists its four types of \u201ccoverages,\u201d one of which is \u201cauto liability,\u201d which includes the \u201cuse of other motor vehicles\u201d provision at issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">By its plain terms, the \u201cuse of other motor vehicles\u201d provision extends coverage to certain other vehicles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>\u201cwhile the vehicle is being used by you or a relative.\u201d Under the clear language of the definitions section, \u201cyou\u201d means the policyholder, Floria Mallozzi, and her resident spouse, Mario Mallozzi, Sr., and \u201crelative\u201d includes her son, the plaintiff, who was living with his parents at the time of the accident. Those three individuals thus are described as entitled to protection under the auto liability coverage portion of the policy; therefore, pursuant to the definitions section of the policy, they all are \u201cinsureds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The plaintiff asks us to disregard that clear terminology and instead to engage in a convoluted analysis on the basis of language in the family compensation coverage section of the policy to conclude that \u201cinsured,\u201d as used in the auto liability coverage section, is ambiguous. The family compensation provision cited by the plaintiff provides coverage for \u201cpersons other than you and a relative . . . [wjhile occupying your auto . . . .\u201d The plaintiff argues, therefore, that \u201chypothetically, anyone else could be an insured\u201d and that \u201c[t]he constellation of persons who are \u2018any insured\u2019 is everyone.\u201d Consequently, he claims, there would never be any coverage for any of the Mallozzis while driving a \u201cnonowned . . . automobile if the owner had any employees since any one of the employees could, like Mallozzi, Sr., be \u2018an insured\u2019 . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">It is a well established principle of insurance law that \u201cpolicy language will be construed as laymen would understand it . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Israel </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>269 Conn. 503, 508, 789 A.2d 974 (2002). Further, the meaning of policy language ordinarily is drawn from the context in which it is used; <em>Peerless Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>241 Conn. 476, 484-85, 697 A.2d 680 (1997); here, within the auto liability coverage section. As such, we cannot conclude that the language would convey to the average policyholder an expectation of coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>on the basis of the reasoning now advanced by the plaintiff or even that a policyholder would find the applicable provision ambiguous. Although ambiguous provisions are construed in favor of insureds, \u201c[t]here is no presumption that language in insurance contracts is inherently ambiguous. Only if the language manifests some ambiguity do we apply the rule that ambiguous insurance contracts are to be construed in favor of insureds and to provide coverage.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Buell Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Greater New York Mutual Ins. Co., </em>259 Conn. 527, 545, 791 A.2d 489 (2002). We conclude that the plaintiffs argument is unreasonable and that, as used in the auto liability coverage section of the policy, \u201cinsured\u201d unambiguously refers to Mario Mallozzi, Sr. Because the exclusion at issue applies when the nonowned automobile is owned by the employer of an insured, and because the pickup truck in this case was owned by the employer of Mario Mallozzi, Sr., the court properly found that the policy did not afford the plaintiff coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The plaintiff also claims ambiguity in the word \u201can,\u201d as used in the phrase, \u201c[coverage] does not apply to losses involving a motor vehicle . . . owned ... by an employer of <em>an </em>insured.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff argues that \u201can insured\u201d means \u201cthe insured,\u201d rather than \u201cany insured,\u201d and that \u201cthe insured\u201d contemplates only the particular insured who is operating the vehicle at the time of the accident, in this case the plaintiff. Therefore, he claims, because it is not <em>the plaintiffs </em>employer that owned the truck, but that of a different insured, the exclusion is inapplicable. Again, we conclude that the phraseology used in the policy is not ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Dictionaries identify \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d as \u201cindefinite\u201d articles and define \u201cindefinite\u201d as \u201cnot defining or identifying,\u201d \u201cnot precise\u201d or \u201chaving no fixed limit or amount.\u201d See, e.g., Merriam-Webster Dictionary (3d Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>1974); see also American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (New College Ed. 1981) (\u201cindefinite article\u201d is one \u201cthat does not fix or immediately fix the identity of the noun modified\u201d); see also <em>Builders Service Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning </em>Commission, 208 Conn. 267, 282, 545 A.2d 530 (1988) (\u201c[i]n statutory construction, unlike the definite article \u2018the,\u2019 which particularizes the words it precedes and is a word of limitation, the indefinite article \u2018a\u2019 has an \u2018indefinite or generalizing force\u2019 \u201d). Thus, as stated by the trial court, \u201can\u201d means \u201cany\u201d and therefore, \u201cthe contract provides, clearly and unambiguously, that the exclusion extends generally to a vehicle of an employer of . . . any insured,\u201d in this case, to the truck owned by the employer of Mario Mallozzi, Sr., regardless of who was driving the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">This interpretation also is supported by the choice of language in part 3 (a) of the \u201cuse of other motor vehicles\u201d section, which defines the coverage to which the exclusions of part 3 (b) apply. Part 3 (a) states that part 3 (b) \u201capplies . . . while the vehicle is being used by you or a relative. It protects <em>the user </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The choice of a different term in part 3 (b) (2), \u201can insured,\u201d rather than \u201cthe user,\u201d implies that a different, broader meaning was contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">\u201cA court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity, and words do not become ambiguous simply because lawyers or laymen contend for different meanings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jack A. Halprin, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hermitage Ins. Co., </em>58 Conn. App. 598, 601, 753 A.2d 954 (2000). We agree that the phrase \u201can insured\u201d clearly means \u201cany insured\u201d and that the court properly concluded that the exclusion at issue applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The plaintiff argues finally that the punctuation used in part 3 (a) of the \u201cuse of other motor vehicles\u201d provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>sion implies that the exceptions set forth in part 3 (b) are not intended to apply to \u201cusers\u201d of vehicles such as the plaintiff. Part 3 (a) states in relevant part that coverage \u201capplies . . . while the vehicle is being used by you or a relative. It protects the user, <em>and any person or organization, </em>except as noted below in b), who does not own the vehicle but is legally responsible for its use.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff claims that the limiting clause, \u201cexcept as noted below in b),\u201d modifies only the immediately preceding phrase, \u201cany person or organization,\u201d and does not modify \u201cthe user,\u201d meaning the plaintiff. We are not convinced because it is clear from the format of part three<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, more obviously, from the actual content of the exceptions listed in part 3 (b), which contemplate various uses of nonowned vehicles by the policyholder or the policyholder\u2019s family members, i.e., <em>users, </em>that the interpretation suggested by the plaintiff is untenable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As conceded by the plaintiff, \u201cpunctuation is not to be permitted to control meaning [in an insurance policy] where the text is clear . . . .\u201d <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Pray, </em>204 F.2d 821, 824 (6th Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Because there were no genuine issues of material fact and because the insurance policy provision at issue clearly operated to disallow coverage to the plaintiff while he was driving a vehicle owned by his father\u2019s employer, we conclude that the court properly rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-11\"> When the court heard argument on the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, it was unclear whether the truck was owned by Mallozzi Builders or by the plaintiffs father, Mario Mallozzi, Sr. Because the parties agree that the policy does not afford coverage in the event of the latter, that issue of fact is immaterial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-9\"> The defendant does not deny that coverage is available under the business automobile insurance policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b642-10\"> The entire provision regarding use of other motor vehicles is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"Ay8\">\u201cUSE OF OTHER MOTOR VEHICLES</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">\u201cThis coverage also applies to certain other motor vehicles as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AQ3\">\u201c1.
