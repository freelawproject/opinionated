J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUn\">The plaintiff, A. Aiudi and Sons, LLC, appeals from the judgment of the trial court, which dismissed the plaintiffs appeal from the decision of the defendant, the planning and zoning commission of the town of Plainville (commission). At issue is the defendant\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs application to excavate sand and gravel from a residentially zoned parcel. Essentially, the plaintiff claims that its application was a site plan application and that the defendant had no discretion to deny the application because it satisfied the site plan requirements. We conclude that the plaintiffs application actually was a special permit application and that the defendant properly exercised its discretion in denying the application. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The court set forth the following relevant facts in its memorandum of decision. On October 1, 1996, the plaintiff applied to the defendant for site approval to remove 90,000 to 95,000 cubic yards of sand and gravel from property that it owns on Camp Street in Plainville. The property is located in an R-ll zone, which is a residential zone, and lies between residential homes and a concrete plant owned by the plaintiff. Public hearings were held on November 12,1996, and December 10, 1996. At the first public hearing, the plaintiff made a presentation regarding the area to be excavated, and area residents spoke in opposition to the project. At the second public hearing, attorney Gregory P. Granger intervened on behalf of some area residents, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19, and presented their opposition to the plaintiffs application. He also called four expert witnesses, who testified as to the negative effect that the proposed plan would have on the air quality, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>noise, neighboring property values and the parcel\u2019s diminished future use for residential purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Members of the defendant deliberated on the application at their January 14, 1997 meeting. Although three members voted in favor of the application with only one in opposition, the application failed because it did not receive the support of the majority of the six board members present. See <em>Merlo </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>196 Conn. 676, 683, 495 A.2d 268 (1985) (\u201cfailure of an application to gamer enough votes for its approval amounts to a rejection of the application\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">On February 14, 1997, the plaintiff filed an appeal in Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-9, which was dismissed. Relying on <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>222 Conn. 262, 608 A.2d 1178 (1992), the court concluded that the defendant properly denied the application after taking into account general health and safety considerations because the town of Plainville\u2019s zoning regulations expressly permitted it to do so and gave the defendant the discretion to deny a site plan application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As to the plaintiffs contention that there was little on the record to support the defendant\u2019s denial, the court searched the record and stated that it \u201cestablishes that the mining poses a serious health risk, violates existing noise pollution standards, depreciates property values and destroys the ability to use that residentially zoned prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>erty for residential purposes.\u201d The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Following the court\u2019s denial of its motion to reargue, the plaintiff was granted certification to appeal and thereafter appealed to this court. It claims that the trial court improperly concluded that (1) general criteria in zoning regulations may serve as a basis to deny a site plan application, (2) the defendant\u2019s regulations permitted the defendant to deny the site plan application on the basis of such general criteria and (3) there was evidence in the record to support the defendant\u2019s decision. Additional facts will be provided as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Although the plaintiff argues that it filed a site plan application, we conclude that the plaintiff actually applied for, and was denied, a special permit. Our review leads us to conclude that the court improperly treated the plaintiffs application as one seeking site plan approval because the application was, in substance, an application for a special permit. Viewing the application as such, we conclude that the defendant acted within its discretion in denying the application. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment on the basis of one of the alternate grounds argued by the defendant because there is evidence in the record in support thereof. See <em>Delfino </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>30 Conn. App. 454, 460, 620 A.2d 836 (1993). \u201cWhere a trial court reaches the correct result, but has based that result on mistaken grounds, we will sustain the trial court\u2019s action if proper grounds exist to support it.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\u201cA special permit allows a property owner to use his property in a manner expressly permitted by the local zoning regulations. . . . The proposed use, however, must satisfy standards set forth in the zoning regulations themselves as well as the conditions necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>to protect the public health, safety, convenience and property values. . . . An application for a special permit seeks permission to vary the use of a particular piece of property from that for which it is zoned, without offending the uses permitted as of right in the particular zoning district. . . . When a special permit is issued, the affected property may be allowed an exception to the underlying zoning regulations, but it continues to be governed in the same manner as provided in the overall comprehensive plan.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Heithaus </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>258 Conn. 205, 215-17, 779 A.2d 750 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u201cWhen ruling upon an application for a special permit, a planning and zoning board acts in an administrative capacity. . . . Generally, it is the function of a zoning board or commission to decide within prescribed limits and consistent with the exercise of [its] legal discretion, whether a particular section of the zoning regulations applies to a given situation and the manner in which it does apply. The [Appellate Court and] trial court [have] to decide whether the board correctly interpreted the section [of the regulations] and applied it with reasonable discretion to the facts. ... In applying the law to the facts of a particular case, the board is endowed with a liberal discretion, and its action is subject to review by the coruts only to determine whether it was unreasonable, arbitrary or illegal.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>244 Conn. 619, 627-28, 711 A.2d 675 (1998). Furthermore, although \u201cthe zoning commission does not have discretion to deny a special permit when the proposal meets the standards, it does have discretion to determine <em>whether </em>the proposal meets the standards set forth in the regulations.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>The plaintiff first argues that the court improperly concluded that general criteria in zoning regulations are proper bases to deny a site plan application. Because we conclude that the trial court improperly treated the plaintiffs application as one for a site plan application when it was, in fact, an application for special permit, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment on the basis of an alternate ground raised by the defendant. As a matter of law, general considerations enumerated in the zoning regulations are an adequate basis for denying an application for a special permit or exception. <em>Whisper Wind Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>229 Conn. 176, 177, 640 A.2d 100 (1994). Here, \u00a7 502 of the defendant\u2019s regulations provides that general considerations such as \u201cpublic health, safety, or general welfare to the public,\u201d \u201charmony and character with the surrounding properties,\u201d and \u201cthe value of adjacent properties,\u201d may be taken into account when considering a special permit. Accordingly, because the defendant had the discretion to deny the plaintiffs application based on general considerations, we must first explain how we reach our conclusion that the plaintiff applied for a special permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 8-2, which grants zoning commissions the authority to promulgate regulations provides in relevant part: \u201cAll such regulations shall be uniform for each class ... or use of land throughout each district, but the regulations . . . may provide that certain . . . uses of land are permitted only after obtaining a special permit or special exception from a . . . combined planning and zoning commission . . . subject to standards set forth in the regulations and to conditions necessary to protect the public health, safety, convenience and property values. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The plaintiffs property is located in an R-ll zone, which is zoned for multifamily and single-family use. Not only is the removal of sand, gravel or clay not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>permitted as of right in an R-l 1 zone,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00a7 900 of the zoning regulations provides in relevant part that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided for in this Article, there shall be no removal from the premises, in any district, of earth, sand, gravel or clay . . . .\u201d Although the removal of sand, gravel or clay is not permitted as of right, the plaintiff applied for a two year permit pursuant to \u00a7 910.2. Section 910.2 provides in relevant part that \u201cthe [defendant] <em>may, </em>after a public hearing, subject to the provisions of Article 6, <em>grant a permit </em>for the removal of sand, gravel or clay in any zone . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because the plaintiff was applying for a permit that is not allowed as of right in that zone, we conclude that it was applying for a special permit. The terms \u201cspecial permit\u201d and \u201cspecial exception\u201d are interchangeable. <em>A.P. &amp; W. Holding Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board, </em>167 Conn. 182, 185, 355 A.2d 91 (1974); R. Fuller, 9 Connecticut Practice Series: Land Use Law and Practice (1999) \u00a7 5.1, p. 135. As a result, we conclude that the defendant could take into account the general considerations enumerated in the special exception regulations when examining the plaintiffs application.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Our conclusion that the defendant considered this to be an application for a special exception is further supported by the posture of the application process. Following the public hearing on its application, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>is required by General Statutes \u00a7 8-26e for special exceptions, the defendant consented, in writing, to an extension of time for the public hearing and action on its application. That procedure was in accordance with \u00a7 501 of the defendant\u2019s regulations, which addresses special exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">As previously discussed, \u00a7 910.2 provides that the defendant \u201cmay\u201d grant a permit, and \u00a7 130.3 provides that \u201cthe word \u2018may\u2019 is permissive.\u201d When, as here, the zoning board is reviewing a special permit application for a use that theoretically is permitted in any zone, it must \u201cdetermine whether the particular proposal is suitable for the particular zone.\u201d <em>Barberino Realty &amp; Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>222 Conn. 607, 616, 610 A.2d 1205 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Even if the defendant could not rely on the general considerations listed in the special exception regulations, it could have relied on the general considerations enumerated in the site plan regulations in article VI of the zoning regulations. When a site plan is an integral part of a special permit application, a planning and zoning commission may refer to special permit considerations when assessing the site plan. Id., 612. In this case, the reverse also is true. Section 910.2 of the gravel removal permit regulation provides that the defendant must take the provisions of article VI into consideration. Accordingly, the defendant properly referred to \u00a7 603, which provides in relevant part that \u201cthe [defendant] may approve, approve with conditions, modify <em>or deny </em>a Site Plan Application or Site Plan Modification\u201d on the basis of general considerations. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The plaintiff makes two arguments to support its claim that the defendant had before it only a request for approval of a site plan. First, the plaintiff argues that the defendant\u2019s consideration of special exceptions or permits is limited to the specifically delineated uses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>listed in its regulations. Second, it argues implicitly that the consideration of the issue is barred by claim preclusion and issue preclusion. We disagree with both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Section 500 of the defendant\u2019s regulations specifically delineates uses that must be considered to be special exceptions permitted in any zone. Because that section does not include sand and gravel removal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiff argues that the permit it sought is not subject to the rules regarding special exceptions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Although \u00a7 500 lists certain uses that \u201cmust\u201d be considered to be special exceptions permitted in any zone, the regulation does not state that this list is exclusive. As previously discussed, a permit that is not allowed as a matter of right is a special permit, and the terms \u201cspecial permit\u201d and \u201cspecial exception\u201d are interchangeable. We are able to conclude that a party is applying for a special permit even where the zoning regulations do not refer specifically to that term of art, so long as that is what the party is applying for in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>substance. <em>Etzel </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 539, 540-41, 235 A.2d 647 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Although it did not invoke the terms specifically, the plaintiff also argues that the defendant\u2019s special permit ar gument is barred by claim preclusion and issue preclusion. In support, it cites to litigation resulting from the defendant\u2019s approval of a two year permit for the same purpose for the same property in 1993;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> see <em>Granger </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. CV93-0704362 S (March 11,1994); and its counsel\u2019s presentation before the defendant that this permit was needed to complete the prior job.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Dismissing the neighbors\u2019 appeal from the granting of the 1993 permit, the court concluded that the project required only a site plan and was not subject to the rules of a special exception. Because we denied the neighbors\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>petition to certify that appeal on April 27, 1994, we address the issue for the first time here. It is well settled that a denial of certification by an appellate court does not signify approval of the decision from which certification to appeal is sought. See <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>249 Conn. 350, 358, 732 A.2d 754 (1999), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Doscher, </em>172 Conn. 592, 376 A.2d 359 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">To the extent that the plaintiff argues that the defendant was estopped from denying its permit application because it granted a previous two year permit, we disagree. Otherwise, the two year limitation on the permit\u2019s validity in \u00a7 910.2 would be superfluous. We interpret the language of zoning regulations so that no clause is superfluous. See <em>Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>46 Conn. App. 566, 571, 700 A.2d 67, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 935, 702 A.2d 640 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Although the court found that the defendant properly exercised its discretion, it concluded that the defendant did not state a reason for its denial. As a result, the court, citing <em>Protect Hamden/North Haven from Excessive Traffic &amp; Pollution, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 527, 544, 600 A.2d 757 (1991), searched the record to see if there was a sufficient reason to uphold the defendant\u2019s decision. As a result, the court found that there was substantial evidence for the defendant to have rejected the plaintiffs application, particularly the testimony of the expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Although we agree with the court\u2019s conclusion as to the sufficiency of the evidence, its search of the record to find a sufficient reason for the defendant\u2019s denial was improper. General Statutes \u00a7 8-3c (b) provides in relevant part that \u201c[w]henever a commission grants or denies a special permit or special exception, it shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>state upon its records the reason for its decision. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See also General Statutes \u00a7 8-26e (same); <em>Anastasi </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>163 Conn. 187, 191, 302 A.2d 258 (1972) (affirming trial court\u2019s sustaining of plaintiffs appeal where defendant \u201cdid not state on the record sufficient reasons to support the granting of the [special exception]\u201d); R. Fuller, 9A Connecticut Practice Series: Land Use Law and Practice (2d Ed. 1999) \u00a7 33.4, p. 161. Even though the untethered search of the record was improper, the commission did state a reason for its denial. The lone dissenting member stated that although he recognized that the prior permit was approved, \u201cI don\u2019t feel that this application is the same as the application of 1993, and I feel that we have to go according to the new regulations that are in effect, and that\u2019s my only reason.\u201d Although we recently restated that \u201c[e]vidence of the individual views of one member [of the planning and zoning commission] is not available to show the reasons actuating the [commission] or the grounds of its decision\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Grasso </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>69 Conn. App. 230, 237, 794 A.2d 1016 (2002); that general proposition is inapplicable here, where the stated views are of those of the sole individual responsible for the denial of the application. Following our review of the stated reasons, we conclude that there is evidence in the record to support the defendant\u2019s stated reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">\u201cIn situations in which the zoning commission does state the reasons for its action, the question for the court to pass on is simply whether the reasons assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>are reasonably supported by the record and whether they are pertinent to the considerations which the commission is required to apply under the zoning regulations. . . . [0]n factual questions ... a reviewing court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the agency. ... If there is conflicting evidence in support of the zoning commission\u2019s stated rationale, the reviewing court . . . cannot substitute its judgment as to the weight of the evidence for that of the commission. . . . The agency\u2019s decision must be sustained if an examination of the record discloses evidence that supports any one of the reasons given.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 629. The evidence, however, must be substantial. See <em>Quality Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>55 Conn. App. 533, 540, 738 A.2d 1157 (1999), citing <em>Huck v. Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>203 Conn. 525, 540, 525 A.2d 940 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">We conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the defendant\u2019s stated reason that \u00a7 603, which replaced \u00a7 620 in the time between the plaintiffs first and second permit applications, expressly required the defendant to take general circumstances into account. Granger testified at the December 10, 1996 hearing as to the changes between sections 603 and 620 and how the project would not fit in with the general considerations enumerated in \u00a7 603. Similarly, each of the four expert witnesses testified as to the project\u2019s effect on air quality, noise, neighboring property values and the parcel\u2019s diminished future use for residential purposes. The defendant also had before it a letter dated January 9, 1997 from Mary Hughes, the town planner, which stated that \u201cSection 603 is more explicit than Section 620. Section 603 includes a specific requirement for a finding that the character and appearance of the proposed use shall be in general harmony with the charac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>ter and appearance of the surrounding neighborhood and that it will not adversely affect the general health, safety or welfare of the inhabitants of the Town of Plainville.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that there is substantial evidence to support the defendant\u2019s action. Cf. <em>Anastasi </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 163 Conn. 189-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The plaintiff would fare no better even if we were to agree that the defendant had before it only a site plan review. Just as a zoning commission may exercise its discretion to deny a special permit application on the basis of general conditions if those conditions are enumerated in the zoning regulations; see <em>Whisper Wind Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 177; it also has the discretion to deny a site plan on the basis of general conditions if site plan denial is specified in the regulations. General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (g) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe zoning regulations may require that a site plan be filed with the commission or other municipal agency or official to aid in determining the conformity of a proposed . . . use . . . with specific provisions of such regulations. ... A site plan may be modified or <em>denied </em>only if it fails to comply with requirements already set forth in the zoning . . . regulations. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) As previously discussed, \u00a7 603 of the zoning regulations provides that the defendant may deny a site plan application and specifies: \u201c5. . . . The character and appearance of the proposed use . . . shall be in general harmony with the character and appearance of the surrounding neighborhood and will not adversely affect the general health, safety or welfare of the inhabitants of the Town of Plainville.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant properly could deny the site plan on the basis of general considerations. See, e.g., <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 266-68 (traffic con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>siderations proper basis for denying site plan where regulations required to be satisfied for \u201capproval,\u201d which implies denial); cf. <em>TLC Development, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>215 Conn. 527, 532, 577 A.2d 288 (1990) (general considerations improper basis for denying site plan where regulations specify they may be used only for \u201cmodification\u201d). We further conclude, for the reasons previously discussed, that the defendant did not abuse its discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\"> Section 603 of the Plainville zoning regulations provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Commission may approve, approve with conditions, modify or deny a Site Plan Application or Site Plan Modification.
