The defendant claims that the court improperly (1) admitted the testimony of an expert witness and (2) denied the defendant\u2019s motions for a mistrial due to prosecutorial misconduct. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>The defendant and three fellow members of a street gang, Darcus Henry, Carlos Ashe and Johnny Johnson, each were charged in a four count substitute information with murder, conspiracy to commit murder and two counts of assault in the first degree for firing automatic or semiautomatic weapons at three unarmed members of a rival street gang. All four cases were consolidated and tried jointly before a twelve person jury. The jury found the defendant and Darcus Henry guilty as charged, and both men appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The defendant\u2019s claims were fully addressed and rejected by this court in the companion case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>72 Conn.
