Scribner, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-222a. On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury that contributory negligence is a valid defense under General Statutes \u00a7 14-283<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>the charge of negligent homicide with an emergency vehicle. We conclude that the defendant was not entitled to the requested jury instruction because it was an incorrect statement of the law. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The following facts are relevant to the resolution of the defendant\u2019s appeal. While on duty in his patrol car on June 16, 1998, the defendant, a New Milford police officer, responded to a \u201ccode three\u201d call, the highest priority call, by the police dispatcher for all available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>units to respond to a brawl involving as many as twenty combatants at Warner Beach on Candlewood Lake. With the emergency lights flashing on his patrol car, the defendant followed another patrol car operated by Officer James Antonelli southbound on Route 7 toward Warner Beach. Evidence was presented at trial that the defendant\u2019s patrol car followed Antonelli\u2019s patrol car through the intersection where the accident occurred at a distance of approximately three hundred to five hundred feet. Approximately one-half mile from where the defendant and Antonelli entered Route 7, the highway intersects with Sunny Valley Road. As the patrol cars approached the intersection, Angela D\u2019Aquila\u2019s vehicle entered Sunny Valley Road and proceeded toward Route 7. After Antonelli\u2019s vehicle passed through the intersection of Route 7 and Sunny Valley Road, D\u2019Aquila began to turn left onto Route 7. As D\u2019Aquila entered Route 7, the defendant continued southbound on Route 7. Upon seeing D\u2019Aquila\u2019s vehicle, the defendant braked and slid until the left front portion of his vehicle collided with the operator\u2019s side door of D\u2019Aquila\u2019s vehicle. D\u2019Aquila died as a result of injuries sustained in the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">On April 11, 2000, the state filed an amended long form information alleging that the defendant negligently had operated his vehicle at or near the intersection of Route 7 (Danbury Road) and Sunny Valley Road in New Milford, causing the death of D\u2019Aquila in violation of \u00a7 14-222a, in that the defendant had \u201cproceeded past a red light without slowing down or stopping to the extent necessary for the safe operation of his motor vehicle, exceeded the posted speed limit and endangered life by doing so and therefore breached his duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons and property.\u201d On April 19, 2000, the juiy found the defendant guilty of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>violation of \u00a7 14~222a. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly refused to instruct the jury that contributory negligence constitutes a defense under \u00a7 14-283 to a charge of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle in violation of \u00a7 14-222a. The defendant acknowledges that the instruction given to the jury by the court in the present case is consistent with Connecticut case law stating that contributory negligence is not a defense to negligent homicide with a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He argues, however, that he nonetheless was entitled to the requested instruction because the legislature could not have envisioned the result in this case when it enacted \u00a7 14-283. Specifically, he argues that the court\u2019s jury charge without the additional requested instruction fails to give \u00a7 14-283 effect and causes a \u201cbizarre result,\u201d whereby he could be convicted of a crime while being exonerated from any liability in a civil action on the basis of the same facts. The defendant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Initially, we set forth the standard of review. \u201cIt is well established that [a] request to charge which is relevant to the issues of the case and which is an accurate statement of the law must be given.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bonan </em>v. <em>Goldring Home Inspections, Inc., </em>68 Conn. App. 862, 867, 794 A.2d 997 (2002). Conversely, it also is true that a court is under no duty to give a requested jury instruction that is an improper statement of law. Accordingly, if this court concludes that the requested jury instruction was an improper statement of law, the defendant is not entitled to the requested jury instruction and the court\u2019s refusal was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Nesteriak, </em>60 Conn. App. 647, 654, 760 A.2d 984 (2000), this court stated that \u00a7 14-283 (b) does not immunize the operator of an emergency vehicle from criminal liability for a violation of \u00a7 14-222a, negligent homicide with a motor vehicle. The defendant argues that our discussion in <em>Nesteriak </em>regarding the interaction of \u00a7 14-283 with \u00a7 14-222a is merely dicta and not binding on this court because the defendant in that case was not charged with negligent homicide with a motor vehicle. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s assertion that the discussion of those statutes in <em>Nesteriak </em>is dicta.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The fact that the defendant in <em>Nesteriak </em>was not charged with negligent homicide does not undermine the precedential force of our discussion of \u00a7\u00a7 14-222a and 14-283 or its effect of serving notice of this court\u2019s conclusion that the protections against liability afforded under \u00a7 14-283 do not apply to a charge of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle. The legitimacy of the proposition from <em>Nesteriak, </em>on which we now rely, not only is supported by Connecticut case law, but also by what we interpret as the legislature\u2019s intent when enacting \u00a7 14-283 (b) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>6 Conn. Cir. Ct. 712, 714, 313 A.2d 84 (1972), the Appellate Division of the Circuit Court held that the general rule that contributory negligence is not a defense in a criminal case applies in a negligent homicide case where ordinary negligence is one of the required elements, unless such negligence on the part of the decedent is found to be the sole proximate cause of his death. We adopt the appellate division\u2019s reasoning in <em>Pope </em>and thus conclude that the requested jury instruction is an improper statement of law. Accordingly, the court properly denied the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Further, we note that the court\u2019s instruction as given in the present case did not cause a bizarre result unin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>tended by the legislature when enacting \u00a7 14-283 (b) (3). The language of the statute clearly limits immunity in favor of preserving the safety of the public. Thus, we conclude that the legislature did not intend to extend liability protection to a defendant in circumstances such as are present in the case at hand. In his brief, the defendant acknowledges that \u00a7 14-283 (d) provides an exception when, even in the civil context, an emergency vehicle operator will be liable for failing to operate his vehicle with \u201cdue regard for the safety of all persons and property.\u201d It is clear to this court that the legislature did not intend to put the limitation of liability offered under \u00a7 14-283 above the safety of the public. The charge in the present case alleged that the defendant exceeded the posted speed limit and did not slow to an appropriate speed when entering the intersection. Section 14-283 (b) (3) itself has within it a limitation on the protection against liability it offers for speeding. Under \u00a7 14-283 (b) (3), an emergency vehicle driver may exceed posted speed limits only \u201cas long as he does not endanger life or property by so doing . . . .\u201d In the present case, the defendant was charged with and found to have endangered life improperly by speeding through the intersection where the collision occurred. Thus, \u00a7 14-283 does not offer the defendant any protection against liability in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b757-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-283 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) \u2018Emergency vehicle\u2019, as used in this section, means . . . any state or local police vehicle operated by a police officer . . . answering an emergency call or in the pursuit of fleeing la.w violators.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">\"(b) The operator of any emergency vehicle may ...
