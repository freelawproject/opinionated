Specifically, we must decide when the firm\u2019s claim accrued for the purpose of a statute ofhmitations. The trial court held that the claim accrued at the time when the firm completed its services for the bankruptcy estate. The firm argues, however, that the claim accrued at the time when the bankruptcy petition was dismissed without any distribution of the assets of the bankruptcy estate. We agree with the firm and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">The plaintiff, Anquillare, Lipnicki, Ruocco &amp; Company, an accounting firm, brought an action for breach of contract against the defendant partnership, VCR Realty Associates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had filed a petition for protection against creditors pursuant to chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq., and that, two years later, the defendant had obtained a dismissal of the petition. The plaintiff further alleged that, during this interval, it had performed accounting services for the bankruptcy trustee, the debtor in possession,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for which the plaintiff had not been paid during the pendency of the bank-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>raptcy proceedings. The plaintiff sought to recover its fees, interest and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">The defendant did not dispute the plaintiffs factual allegations. Furthermore, it did not dispute that, after the dismissal of the bankruptcy petition, the bankruptcy estate revested in the defendant; 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349 (b); and that the defendant thereupon became liable for costs associated with postpetition transactions. <em>In re Safren, </em>65 B.R. 566, 571 (Bankr. C.D. Cal. 1986); 3 W. Collier, Bankruptcy (15th Ed. Rev. 2000) \u00a7 349.03. Instead, the defendant filed an affirmative defense based on the alleged expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court rendered a judgment in favor of the defendant on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The parties stipulated to most of the relevant facts. On November 30,1992, the defendant sought chapter 11 protection. Thereafter, until July 16, 1993, the plaintiff performed accounting services worth $4013.46.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On November 23, 1994, in response to a motion by the defendant, the bankruptcy petition was dismissed. On March 31, 2000, the plaintiff brought the present cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The trial court made two additional findings. First, it implicitly found that the plaintiffs fees were administrative expenses of the bankruptcy estate when it stated that the plaintiff might have filed a claim pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503 (b). That section deals only with recovery for administrative expenses. Second, it found that \u201caccording to the plaintiff ... [its services] were provided with the approval of the [Bankruptcy] Court.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>Significantly, the court did <em>not </em>say that the defendant contested this allegation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">In its appellate brief, the defendant disputes these findings. The defendant did not dispute them at trial. It filed no motion for articulation to clarify the court\u2019s opinion. See Practice Book \u00a7 66-5. In its appeal, the defendant has not raised any claim of alternate grounds for affirmation of the trial court\u2019s judgment. All that we have before us are repeated assertions in the defendant\u2019s brief that ask us to ignore the court\u2019s findings. In effect, the defendant would have us decide this case on facts directly opposite to those found by the trial court. It is axiomatic that this court cannot find facts. This case must be reviewed on the facts found by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The trial court concluded that General Statutes \u00a7 52-576 (a) barred the plaintiffs claim for relief. This statute provides, in relevant part: \u201cNo action for an account . . . shall be brought but within six years after the right of action accrues . . . .\u201d The court rejected the argument of the plaintiff that its cause of action accrued on the date on which the bankruptcy petition was dismissed. Instead, it agreed with the defendant that the claim accrued on the date on which the plaintiff completed the accounting services that it rendered to the defendant in its role as bankruptcy trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">In coming to its conclusion, the court held that ongoing bankruptcy proceedings did not toll the accrual of the plaintiffs postpetition claim. In the court\u2019s view, the statute of limitations began to run when the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>completed its services to the bankruptcy estate because the plaintiff could have, and inferentially should have, sought payment from the bankruptcy trustee while the bankruptcy proceedings were pending.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">In its appeal, the plaintiff challenges the validity of the court\u2019s conclusion of law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Our review of the issues, therefore, is plenary. <em>Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>259 Conn. 592, 598, 790 A.2d 1178 (2002); <em>Olson </em>v. <em>Accessory Controls &amp; Equipment Corp., </em>254 Conn. 145, 156, 757 A.2d 14 (2000); <em>Shoreline Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norwich Taxi, LLC, </em>70 Conn. App. 60, 65, 797 A.2d 1165 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">We agree with the trial court that there are no provisions in the federal Bankruptcy Code that allow a debt- or\u2019s filing of a bankruptcy petition to toll the running of the statute of limitations with respect to a postpetition claim. <em>See Rogers </em>v. <em>Corrosion Products, Inc., </em>42 F.3d 292, 297 (5th Cir. 1995); <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>United States Lines, Inc., </em>64 F.3d 62, 66 (2d Cir. 1995); <em>Aslanidis </em>v. <em>United States Lines, Inc., </em>7 F.3d 1067, 1073 (2d Cir. 1993). Likewise, a postpetition creditor is not entitled to suspension of a statute of limitations because 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 108 (c)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> provides protection only for prepetition credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>tors.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we must decide this case with the understanding that the six year time limitation stated in \u00a7 52-576 (a) was in no way extended by the bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">The conclusion that bankruptcy proceedings did not toll or suspend the running of the statute of limitations does not, however, determine the date on which the cause of action accrued. Unless an applicable statute provides to the contrary, \u201c[t]he true test [for accrual] is to establish the time when the plaintiff first could have successfully maintained an action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Polizos </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>255 Conn. 601, 609, 767 A.2d 1202 (2001); <em>Wynn v. Metropolitan Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., </em>30 Conn. App. 803, 808, 623 A.2d 66 (1993), aff'd, 228 Conn. 436, 635 A.2d 814 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The trial court held that the plaintiffs cause of action accrued upon the completion of its services to the bankruptcy estate because, in the court\u2019s view, the plaintiff had a right to payment at that time. It relied on a non-bankruptcy case for the proposition that a common-law right of action accrues upon the completion of the services rendered. See <em>R.A. Civitello Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>6 Conn. App. 212, 215-16, 504 A.2d 542 (1986). The court concluded that bankruptcy law was to the same effect. It held that, upon completion of its services, the plaintiff could have obtained immediate payment from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>the Bankruptcy Court. For this proposition, the court relied on 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503 (b), which permits administrative creditors to seek immediate allowance of their claims. It held that the plaintiffs contract claim was time barred because, as a result of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503 (b), it accrued upon the plaintiffs completion of its professional services. The plaintiff contests the validity of the court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">On its face, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503 (b) appears to support the reasoning of the trial court. In relevant part, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503 (b) provides: \u201cAfter notice and a hearing [before the Bankruptcy Court], there <em>shall be allowed </em>administrative expenses . . . including \u2014 (1) (A) the actual, necessary costs of preserving the estate, including wages, salaries, or commissions for services rendered after the commencement of the case . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This statute does not, however, describe the consequences that attach to the allowance of a claim for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The meaning of \u201cshall be <em>allowed\u201d </em>in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503 (b) is clarified by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 331, entitled \u201cInterim compensation.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That statute addresses the right of compensation of an administrative creditor who has been authorized to provide professional services for the bankruptcy estate. For such a claimant, a Bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>Court <em>\u201cmay allow and disburse . . . </em>compensation or reimbursement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Indeed, federal cases hold that even \u201c[i]nterim fee awards are not final determinations intended to put a matter to rest. Rather, they are interlocutory and reviewable.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 331. <em>In re Evangeline Refining Co., </em>890 F.2d 1312, 1322 (5th Cir. 1989); see also <em>In re Anolik, </em>207 B.R. 34, 37 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1997) (interim compensation awards are interlocutory and subject to disgorgement).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">Two principles flow logically from the juxtaposition of \u00a7\u00a7 503 (b) and 331. First, bankruptcy law distinguishes between the allowance of a claim and the disbursement of moneys for its payment. Second, bankruptcy law leaves any decision about disbursements to the discretion of the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">It follows from these principles that, although the plaintiff might have presented its bills to the debtor in possession, acting as bankruptcy trustee, it had no duty to do so. It had no right to require the Bankruptcy Court to pay these bills at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">There was no event before the dismissal of the bankruptcy petition that would have triggered an obligation to request timely payment. During bankruptcy proceedings, there is \u201cno bar date to filing requests for the allowance of administrative expenses under \u00a7 503 . . . <em>.\u201d In re Megafoods Stores, Inc., </em>163 F.3d 1063, 1071 (9th Cir. 1998). \u201cNeither the Bankruptcy Code nor the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure . . . set forth a deadline within which administrative claims must be filed . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Southern Soya Corp., </em>251 B.R. 302, 311 (Bankr. D.S.C. 2000). The timing for filing a request for payment of administrative expenses is a matter to be determined within the discretion of the Bankruptcy Court. 4 W. Collier, Bankruptcy, supra, \u00a7 503.02 [2].</p>\n<p id=\"b850-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>This case would have been different if the bankruptcy proceedings had resulted in a distribution plan. The plaintiff would then have been <em>required </em>to seek payment as a priority claimant to the bankrupt\u2019s assets. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Indeed, even earlier, if the plaintiff had been notified of a claim bar date, it would have been <em>required </em>to file a proof of claim with the Bankruptcy Court before the deadline established by the court. 11 U.S.C \u00a7 1111 (a);<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, Rule 3003 (c) (2);<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Pioneer Investment Services Co. </em>v. <em>Brunswick Associates Ltd. Partnership, </em>507 U.S. 380, 383, 113 S. Ct. 1489, 123 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1993). Under the circumstances of this case, these requirements are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">On the present record, upon the completion of its accounting services, the plaintiff had the right to <em>request </em>payment but no right to <em>require </em>payment. The test for the accrual of a cause of action is not met by a demonstration that a claimant had a right to request payment. The statute does not begin to run before the time \u201cwhen the plaintiff first could have successfully maintained an action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Polizos </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number><em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 255 Conn. 609. The first time that the plaintiff could have maintained an action was the date of the dismissal of the bankruptcy petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">In sum, the trial court improperly concluded that the plaintiffs cause of action accrued before the dismissal of the bankruptcy petition filed by the defendant. The plaintiffs complaint was timely. Because the defendant has not claimed that the court\u2019s judgment should be affirmed on any other ground, the plaintiff is entitled to be paid for the services that it rendered to the bankruptcy trustee during the pendency of the bankruptcy petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The amount of the plaintiffs damages have, however, not yet been determined with respect to interest and fees. Upon remand, the trial court must make this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the plaintiff on the merits of its claim and for further proceedings to determine the amount of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-11\"> Section 503 (b) of title 11 of the United States Code, entitled \u201cAllowance of administrative expenses,\u201d provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-12\">\u201c(a) An entity may timely file a request for payment of an administrative expense, or may tardily file such request if permitted by the court for cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-13\">\u201c(b) After notice and a hearing, there shall be allowed, administrative expenses . . . including\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-14\">\u201c(1) (A) the actual, necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate, including wages, salaries, or commissions for services rendered after the commencement of the case ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-15\">\u201c(4) reasonable compensation for professional services rendered by an attorney or an accountant of an entity whose <em>expense is </em>allowable under paragraph (3) of this subsection, based on the time, the nature, the extent, and the value of such services, and the cost of comparable services other than in a case under this title, and reimbursement for actual, necessary expenses incurred by such attorney or accountant. . .</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b843-5\"> Section 349 of title 11 of the United States Code, entitled \u201cEffect of dismissal,\u201d provides in relevant part: \u201c(b) Unless the court, for cause, orders otherwise, a dismissal of a case other than under section 742 of this title . . .

For convenience, we will refer to all three as the defendant, in the singular.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b843-7\"> The fact that the postpetition bankruptcy estate was being administered by the debtor in possession, rather than by a trustee, is of no legal significance, under the circumstances of this case, because 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503 (b) does not differentiate between an appointed trustee or a debtor in possession. Be<em>llus </em>v. <em>United States, </em>125 F.3d 821, 823-24 (9th Cir. 1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b844-7\"> The defendant withdrew its second affirmative defense relating to the statute of frauds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b844-8\"> Although the parties stipulated that the plaintiff had performed services worth $5513.46, it performed $1500 of these services on November 9, 1992, before the filing of the bankruptcy petition.

It maintains that the services provided by the plaintiff were not administrative services because the Bankruptcy Court had not held any hearings in that respect. This argument comes too late. The defendant made no effort, at trial, to seek rectification or articulation of the findings of the trial court. We have no way of knowing the basis for the court\u2019s statement.To state the obvious, we do not make findings of fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b846-6\"> On the present record, we presume that no request for payment was then made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b846-7\"> In this appeal, the plaintiff has not challenged the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the statute of limitations barred the plaintiffs right to obtain payment for accounting services that it performed before the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b846-8\"> Section 108 of title 11 of the United States Code, entitled \u201cExtension of time,\u201d provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-9\">\u201c(c) Except as provided in section 524 of this title, if applicable nonbank-ruptcy law, an order enteredinanonbankruptcyproceeding, or an agreement fixes a period for commencing or continuing a civil action in a court other than a Bankruptcy Court on a claim against the debtor, or against an individual with respect to which such individual is protected under section 1201 or 1301 of this title, and such period has not expired before the date of the filing of the petition, then such period does not expire until the later of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-10\">\u201c(1) the end of such period, including any suspension of such period occurring on or after the commencement of the case; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-11\">\u201c(2) 30 days after notice of the termination or expiration of the stay under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>section 362, 922,1201, or 1301 of this title, as the case may be, with respect to such claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b847-7\"> The statute does not apply to the claims of the plaintiff, a postpetition creditor.
