In the first cause of action the complaint alleged that plaintiff is a Negro and a citizen of the United States; that at all times defendant operated and maintained a dental office in Duarte, California, which was open to the use of the general public, at which defendant offered services for the extraction of teeth among other things; that on or about the 10th of March, 1955, plaintiff was suffering from a toothache and called defendant\u2019s office and made an appointment to have a tooth extracted; that upon arriving at defendant\u2019s office he was informed that defendant did not give dental service to Negroes. Plaintiff further alleged that by reason of the conduct of defendant he was deprived of rights guaranteed by sections 51 and 52 of the Civil Code, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and article I, section I, of the California Constitution, and prayed for $2,000 in damages. The second cause of action by incorporation substantially restated the first cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">We must determine whether the complaint does, or may be amended to, state a cause of action, since if it can be so amended it was an abuse of discretion to sustain the demurrer without leave to amend. <em>(Gaglione </em>v. <em>Coolidge </em>(1955), 134 Cal.App.2d 518, 522 [286 P.2d 568].)</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The first question is whether a dentist\u2019s office is to be considered as one of the \u201cother places of public accommodation or amusement\u201d within section 51 of the Civil Code, or is to be included within the meaning of similar language in section 52 of the Civil Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">In <em>Long </em>v. <em>Mountain View Cemetery Assn. </em>(1955), 130 Cal.App.2d 328, 329 [278 P.2d 945], the court held that the words \u201call other places of public accommodation or amusement\u201d within section 51 of the Civil Code mean all other places of like nature to those enumerated, and that it does not include cemeteries. The particular places enumerated are inns, restaurants, hotels, eating-houses, places where ice cream or soft drinks of any kind are sold for consumption on the premises, barber shops, bath houses, theaters, skating rinks, and public conveyances. A similar enumeration is made in Civil Code, section 52. We do not consider that a dentist\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 835\">*Supp. 835</page-number>office is a place of like nature to those enumerated. In <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rinaldo, </em>(Ohio Ct.App.) 119 N.E.2d 657, the court was faced with a factual situation similar to the one before us, and it held that a dentist\u2019s office is not a place of public accommodation or amusement. The court stated, <em>supra, </em>at page 659: \u201cA dentist may be classified as one of the learned professions like unto a physician or surgeon. An office of a physician or surgeon does not connote that it is a place of public accommodation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The court also quoted the following statement from 41 American Jurisprudence 135: \u201cIn the absence of statute, a physician or surgeon is under no legal obligation to render professional services to everyone who applies to him or seeks to engage him. Physicians are not public servants who are bound to serve all who seek them, as are innkeepers, common carriers, and the like. \u2019 \u2019 This is the law of this state. <em>(McNamara </em>v. <em>Emmons </em>(1939), 36 Cal.App.2d 199 [97 P.2d 503].) We believe that this statement may also be applied to dentists. (Carnahan, \u201cThe Dentist and the Law,\u201d p. 42, citing <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Parker </em>(1932), 121 Cal.App. 264 [8 P.2d 908].) In view of the foregoing, plaintiff cannot state a cause of action under sections 51 and 52 of the Civil Code. <em>(Cf. </em>14 C.J.S. Civil Rights, \u00a7 6, pp. 1165-1166.)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Appellant also argues that the public policy of California is opposed to racial discrimination, and that this policy applies to private as well as public action, and may be enforced without the necessity of a statute. Although a policy against racial discrimination exists in this state, the cases which recognized that a statute is not necessary to enforce such a policy involved discrimination by organizations, to wit: labor unions which are unincorporated associations. <em>(James </em>v. <em>Marinship Corp. </em>(1944), 25 Cal.2d 721 [155 P.2d 329, 160 A.L.R. 900] ; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>International Brotherhood of Boilermakers </em>(1946), 27 Cal.2d 586 [165 P.2d 903].) In establishing this principle, the Supreme Court relied upon the analogy between a labor union and public service businesses, such as innkeepers and common carriers, who, at common law, could not discriminate on the grounds of race, subject to the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d doctrine. (See <em>James </em>v. <em>Marinship Corp., supra, </em>at p. 740.) In the James and Williams cases, <em>supra, </em>there was no applicable statute under the terms of which the discrimination complained of was prohibited. On the other hand, in the case at bar the discrimination is alleged to have been committed by a particular individual in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 836\">*Supp. 836</page-number>particular location. In Civil Code, sections 51 and 52 the Legislature has enacted provisions which are specifically designed to cover discrimination by individuals in particular places enumerated therein; and it has included the places where discrimination was proscribed at common law, i. e. inns and public conveyances.  As we have noted, there is no established public policy that compels a dentist to treat anyone who comes to him (see also <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Emmons, supra </em>(1939), 36 Cal.App.2d 199) and since the Legislature has specifically declared the public policy of the state in regard to discrimination in particular locations, and has not included \u201cdentists,\u201d it is the office of the Legislature, and not this court to make any additional enumerations which may be desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s order sustaining the demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Bishop, P. J., and Swain, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
