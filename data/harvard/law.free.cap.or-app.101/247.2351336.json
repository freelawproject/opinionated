J.</author>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Defendant has moved to dismiss the state\u2019s appeal from a judgment of acquittal entered on a Class B felony charge on the ground that there is no authority for the state to appeal. The trial court ordered dismissal of the accusatory instrument pursuant to ORS 136.120<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and directed entry of a judgment of acquittal pursuant to ORS 136.130.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The state\u2019s appeal is purportedly taken under ORS 138.060(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">\u201cThe state may take an appeal from the Circuit Court or the District Court to the Court of Appeals from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">\u201c(1) An order made prior to trial dismissing or setting aside the accusatory instrument.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Defendant argues that the judgment from which the appeal is taken is neither an order of dismissal nor an order setting aside the accusatory instrument; instead, it is a judgment of acquittal. That fact, defendant asserts, bars further the appeal. ORS 136.130.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">On its face, <em>State v. Hansen, </em>37 Or App 461, 587 P2d 508 (1978), supports the state\u2019s position. It begins by assuming that ORS 138.060(1) permits the state to appeal from an \u201cOrder and Judgment of Acquittal.\u201d However, the question of whether the appeal was permissible under the meaning of the statute does not appear to have been raised, and it is not expressly decided by the case. We have found no case in which the issue has been discussed or decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Giving the statutory terms their ordinary technical meanings, only an \u201corder\u201d can be the basis for an appeal by the state. There is nothing in the statute that permits, by its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>express terms, an appeal from <em>any </em>\u201cjudgment\u201d in favor of a defendant in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">ORS 136.120 says that, if the conditions calling for its application are presented, \u201cthe court shall order the accusatory instrument to be dismissed\u201d or, if \u201cthe public interests require the accusatory instrument to be retained for trial,\u201d the court may order it to be \u201cretained.\u201d Although it is not very clear what that last quoted word means, the trial judge did not enter any such order. ORS 136.120 deals <em>only </em>with the circumstances under which a trial court may enter an <em>order </em>dismissing an accusatory instrument, and it has nothing, in and of itself, to do either with appealability or double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">If, acting under ORS 136.120, a trial judge orders the accusatory instrument dismissed, then the <em>order </em>is expressly made appealable by ORS 138.060(1). However, ORS 136.130 permits the trial judge to do more than issue a mere order. If, under ORS 136.130, \u201cthe court orders the accusatory instrument * * * dismissed and the instrument charges a felony or Class A misdemeanor, the order is not a bar to another action for the same crime unless the court so directs.\u201d Thus, by itself, no order under ORS 136.130 dismissing a felony or a Class A misdemeanor charge has a double jeopardy effect. However, the same statute empowers the trial judge to give a dismissal of a felony or Class A misdemeanor charge a double jeopardy effect by entering a <em>judgment </em>of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\"><em>State v. Hansen, supra, </em>involved a dismissal under ORS 136.120 of a Class A misdemeanor charge. The trial judge apparently followed the procedure in ORS 136.130 exactly. There was a <em>judgment </em>of acquittal, and there was, and is, no basis in the law for the state to appeal from that <em>judgment. </em>The problem in <em>Hansen </em>was that the trial judge may not have had a basis for acting under ORS 136.120 in the first place. The opinion seizes on that matter, jumps over to <em>former </em>ORS 135.755<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and proceeds to decide the case on the basis of a discovered abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number><em>State v. Hansen, supra, </em>was wrongly decided. ORS 136.130 authorized the trial judge there, and here, to enter a judgment of acquittal. He did that, which should have been the end of the case. There was no \u201corder\u201d from which the state could appeal under ORS 138.060(1). The judgment of acquittal was just that: a judgment that the defendant is not guilty of the charged offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Oregon Constitution, Article I, section 12, plainly provides: \u201cNo person shall be put in jeopardy twice for the same offence [sic] * * *.\u201d That should have been the result in <em>Hansen. </em>The same is true in this case, and we overrule <em>State v. Hansen, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-10\"> ORS 136.120 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-11\">\u201cIf, when the case is called for trial, the defendant appears for trial and the district attorney is not ready and does not show any sufficient cause for postponing the trial, the court shall order the accusatory instrument to be dismissed, unless, being of the opinion that the public interests require the accusatory instrument to be retained for trial, the court directs it to be retained.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-12\"> ORS 136.130 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-13\">\u201cIf the court orders the accusatory instrument to be dismissed and the instrument charges a felony or Class A misdemeanor, the order is not a bar to another action for the same crime unless the court so directs.
