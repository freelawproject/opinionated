ORS 163.435. She argues that the trial court erred by failing to specify in its sentence the amount of restitution that she would be required to pay as a condition of her probation. She concedes that she did not make an objection in the trial court, pursuant to ORS 137.106(3). Her failure to object was a waiver of her rights under that statute. <em>See State v.
