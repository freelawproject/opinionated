BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-24\">On July 18, 2008, Artjen Complexus, Inc. and Arthur M. Barat (together \u201cArtjen Parties\u201d) filed a notice of removal, seeking to remove a suit filed by Corporate Management Advisors, Inc. from a Florida state court to the District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The Artjen Parties sought removal on the basis of diversity jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. However, in their notice of removal, the Artjen Parties alleged only the residency of one of the parties, rather than his citizenship. Since residency is not the equivalent of citizenship for diver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>sity purposes, the district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c), the district court <em>sua sponte </em>remanded the case to state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-3\">On July 23, 2008, the Artjen Parties filed an amended notice of removal in which, they contend, they alleged sufficient facts to establish complete diversity of citizenship between the parties. However, on July 29, 2008, the district court again remanded the case to state court. The district court concluded that, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), it lacked jurisdiction to review a remand order \u201con appeal or otherwise. ...\u201d The Artjen Parties appealed. Although we initially dismissed their appeals for lack of jurisdiction, on November 26, 2008, we granted the Artjen Parties\u2019 motion for reconsideration of our order of dismissal and consolidated their appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-5\">\u201cThe interpretation of a statute is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>United States v. Murrell, </em>368 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). Accordingly, we review the district court\u2019s interpretation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447 <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1318-6\">Section 1447(d) provides that \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.... \u201d Furthermore, we are precluded from reviewing such a remand order \u201cwhether or not that order might be deemed erroneous by [us].\u201d <em>Thermtron Prods., Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, </em>423 U.S. 336, 351, 96 S.Ct. 584, 593, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976), <em>overruled on other grounds by Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>517 U.S. 706, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996). However, \u00a7 1447(d) \u201cis tightly circumscribed to cover only remand orders within the scope of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c), based on (1) a district court\u2019s lack of subject matter jurisdiction or (2) a defect in removal other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction that was raised by the motion of a party within 30 days after the notice of removal was filed.\u201d <em>Ellenburg v. Spartan Motors Chassis, Inc., </em>519 F.3d 192, 196 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-8\">The district court may remand a case <em>sua sponte </em>for lack of subject matter jurisdiction at any time. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). Furthermore, a remand order based on subject matter jurisdiction is not reviewable. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-9\">However, we have jurisdiction to review whether the \u201cdistrict court exceeded its authority under \u00a7 1447(c) by remanding this case because of a perceived procedural defect in the removal process without waiting for a party\u2019s motion.\u201d <em>Whole Health Chiropractic &amp; Wellness, Inc. v. Humana Med. Plan, Inc., </em>254 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2001). As we held in <em>Whole Health, </em>\u201c[t]he language of \u00a7 1447(c), especially Congress\u2019s use of the language \u2018a motion to remand ... must be made,\u2019 in connection with remand based on a procedural defect in the removal process, and the lack of that phrase with respect to removal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, indicates that the district court must wait for a party\u2019s motion before remanding a case based on procedural defect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1320-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-10\">Here, the district court based its <em>sua sponte </em>remand order on a perceived lack of subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 1447(c), specifically, on the absence of diversity. However, we conclude that the failure to establish a party\u2019s citizenship at the time of filing the removal notice is a \u201cprocedural, rather than jurisdictional, defect. ...\u201d <em>In re Allstate Ins. Co., </em>8 F.3d 219, 221 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-11\">In so holding, we rely substantially on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s well-reasoned opinion in <em>In re Allstate. </em>In that case, because All<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>state failed to adequately allege a party\u2019s residency in its notice of removal, the district court remanded the ease to the state court. <em>Id. </em>at 220. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit reasoned that \u201ca \u2018procedural defect\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 1447(c) refers to any defect that does not go to the question of whether the case originally could have been brought in federal district court....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, \u201cAllstate\u2019s failure to allege, in its notice of removal, the plaintiffs citizenship at the time the original petition was filed constitutes a procedural, rather than jurisdictional, defect; although Allstate failed conclusively to <em>demonstrate </em>diversity, the record discloses no dispute that it in fact <em>existed.\u201d Id. </em>The Fifth Circuit then held that district courts lack the \u201cdiscretion <em>sua sponte </em>to remand for purely procedural defects,\u201d specifically, defects in establishing citizenship for the purpose of establishing diversity jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 223. <em>See also Harmon v. OKI Sys., </em>115 F.3d 477, 479 (7th Cir.1997) (citing with approval the reasoning in <em>In re Allstate </em>that \u201ca defendant\u2019s failure to allege citizenship as opposed to residency ... constituted a procedural defect\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-4\">We agree with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1447(c) and construction of a party\u2019s failure to establish citizenship in its notice of removal as a procedural defect. \u201c[Wjhere subject matter jurisdiction exists and any procedural shortcomings may be cured by resort to \u00a7 1653, we can surmise no valid reason for the court to decline the exercise of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>In re Allstate, </em>8 F.3d at 223. <em>See also Ellenburg, </em>519 F.3d at 198 (holding that the Fourth Circuit has jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>remand order, even when that remand order is styled as a remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, if the order was in fact based on the procedural insufficiency of the Notice of Removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-9\">Section 1653 provides that \u201c[d]efec-tive allegations of jurisdiction may be amended, upon terms, in the trial or appellate courts.\u201d As the Fifth Circuit has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1319-10\">The general allegation in the original petition for removal in this case, \u201cthat the controversy in said case is entirely between citizens of different states,\u201d although conclusionary in nature and possibly not sufficient if not amended, is sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the federal courts to permit the curing of the defect by amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1319-11\"><em>Firemen\u2019s Ins. Co. v. Robbins Coal Co., </em>288 F.2d 349, 350 (5th Cir.1961) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If a party fails to specifically allege citizenship in their notice of removal, the district court should allow that party \u201cto cure the omission,\u201d as authorized by \u00a7 1653. <em>D.J. McDuffie, Inc. v. Old Reliable Fire Ins. Co., </em>608 F.2d 145, 146-47 (5th Cir.1979). For example, in <em>Armada Coal, </em>a party \u201cimperfectly pled\u201d federal diversity jurisdiction as the ground for its removal to federal court. <em>Armada Coal Export, Inc. v. Interbulk, Ltd., </em>726 F.2d 1566, 1568 (11th Cir.1984). We remanded the case to district court with instructions to grant the party leave to amend its notice of removal to \u201cunequivocally\u201d establish diversity of citizenship. <em>Id. </em>at 1569. <em>See also Barrow Dev. Co. v. Fulton Ins. Co., </em>418 F.2d 316, 318 (9th Cir.1969) (holding that defective allegations of citizenship may be amended to establish diversity jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-12\">Here, the Artjen Parties appeal the district court\u2019s refusal to allow them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>amend their notice of removal, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)\u2019s prohibition on review of a remand order \u201con appeal or otherwise.\u201d Because we hold that the district court erred by remanding this case on jurisdictional grounds when faced solely with a procedural defect in the removal process, we direct the district court to permit Artjen leave to amend its notice of removal, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court\u2019s July 21, 2008 Order of Remand and July 29, 2008 Order of Remand. We remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1317-15\">. Although we have previously addressed this question in <em>In re First National Bank of Boston, </em>as that case was vacated on other grounds, we have no binding precedent to guide us. 70 F.3d 1184 (11th Cir.1995), <em>vacated, </em>102 F.3d 1577 (11th Cir.1996) (per curiam). Today, we reassert much of the reasoning from <em>In re First National.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1319-5\">. <em>See Bonner v.
