The New Haven <em>&amp; </em>Northampton Co. in 1848 constructed a railroad, which in 1849 they leased for twenty years to theNew York &amp; New Haven Railroad Co. The latter company soon after taking possession of the road built a platform for the accommodation of passengers at a place on the road which was thereafter called \u201c Brooks\u2019s Station,\u201d and placed upon it an old baggage-car which served as a shelter for passengers waiting at the station. No agent was ever placed at the station and no tickets were sold there, nor was freight way-billed to or from that station, but to and from another station in the same town. But tickets were sold at other stations to passengers for that station, and trains were stopped to take up passengers, and trains carrying the mail stopped regularly.

Said car was about twelve feet long and of the width and height of ordinary baggage cars, and served as a shelter or protection from the weather. No agent was ever appointed at said station, and no tickets were sold thereat, nor was any freight over way-billed at or to that station, but was way-billed from or to the station at Cheshire. But tickets were sold at other stations on said road to passengers for said station, and trains were stopped to take up passengers at said station when flagged so to stop, and trains carrying the mail stopped without being flagged, and occasionally, and not to exceed an average of once in every month, said New York <em>&amp; </em>New Ha-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>yen Railroad Company, under special contracts for that purpose, received and delivered freight of large bulk and quantity at said station.

That soon after taking possession they found that the operation of said road in a judicious, proper and discreet manner, so as fairly to develop its resources, and at the same time to secure the best interests of the public, required the discontinuance of the stoppage of their -passenger trains at the flag stations on said road, and among these at Brooks\u2019s Station, so called, and they have, with this end alone in view, since the 1st day of August, 1869, discontinued the stopping of their passenger trains at said Brooks\u2019s Station.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-7\">\u201c And the respondents further show that, since taking possession of their said road upon the only application ever made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>to them to receive, or deliver freight at said Brooks\u2019s Station, they, for reasons which they deemed sufficient, declined to contract for its delivery at said Brooks\u2019s Station.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-5\">\u00a3&lt; And the respondents submit to this honorable court, that for the causes aforesaid as hereinbefore set forth, said writ of mandamus prayed for in said application should not bo granted, <em>but </em>that said application should be dismissed, and they pray that the same be dismissed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-6\">To this answer the attorney for the state demurred, and the case was reserved for the advice of this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-7\">The application of Rier Bristol and others was made under the act of 1868, to a judge of the Supreme Court, by whom a committee was appointed to hear the parties, make an order in the premises, if in their judgment such an order should be made, and report to the Superior Court.

Both the statutes under which the proceedings in the two cases are brought, are intended to guard and secure the interests of the public as against the antagonistic private interests of the corporations. But they both properly contemplate that a station may be abandoned, or that a company may discontinue stopping a passenger train at a depot, not only without detriment to, but in furtherance of the public interests. And each statute provides a tribunal for the determination of this question as a pre-requisite to the issuing of any judicial mandate. Where there are different statutes relating to the same subject matter, though made at different times, and not referring to each other, they shall be taken and construed together as one system, and as explanatory of each other. <em>Rex v.

But if the statute or the general law of the land afford any other specific and adequate remedy, it must be pursued. Redfield on Railways, 456; Moses on Mandamus, 117; <em>Louisville &amp;c. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>The State, </em>25 Ind., 177. The act of 1866, under the first section of which the application for a mandamus is brought to restore an abandoned station, provides in its second section a specific and adequate remedy for such abandonment. The: two sections construed together mean, that if any railroad, company shall abandon a station which has been established by them for a period of twelve months, or, if the abandonment occur after the 1st day of January, 1866, then irrespective of the period it has been so established, the railroad, commissioners may, upon application, restore such station. Any other construction would involve consequences disastrous, alike to the public and to the company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-5\">4. There is not and never was at \u201c Brooks\u2019s Station,\u201d so. called, any such station as is contemplated in the act of 1866,. or any such depot as is contemplated in the act of 1868. It was not a freight station. The record finds \u201c that no freight was ever way-billed to or from it, but was way-billed from or to. the station at Cheshire.\u201d It was not such a depot or station, as is required by the act of 1866, because the \u201c posting a notice.conspicuously in said station or depot,\u201d could not be complied: with. A depot, within the ordinary meaning of that term,. \u2014and the legislature must be deemed to have used' it in' that sense, \u2014 involves buildings for the accommodation of passengers, and some sort of facilities for the procuring of tickets thereat. At this station there was no agent, no tickets were ever sold, and the only structure was a platform, with an old and dilapidated baggage car upon it. It would not come even within the term \u201c passenger station,\u201d as used in the act of 1867, providing under a penalty for the construction of \u201csuitable water closets\u201d at such stations. Acts of 1867, p. 110. There is a well understood distinction, recognized both by the public and railroad companies, between flag stations and ordinary depots or stations ; and legislation regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>lating the latter, cannot fairly, by implication merely, be construed to include the former.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-5\">5. The defendants have not, within the true intent of the act of 1866, abandoned this station. The act assumes, what the word \u201c abandon\u201d of necessity implies, that the establishment of the station must precede its abandonment. The establishment and the abandonment must be under the same authority. The defendants cannot be charged with abandoning what they never have established or authorized to be established. They did not establish this station, nor was it done by their authority, or in their interest, or that of the public. Their lessees, who had \u201c the entire and absolute use, management and control of the road,\u201d established it for their own purposes, and in violation of their contract \u201cto operate the road in a proper, judicious and discreet manner.\u201d To bring the abandonment within the statute, the defendants must have possessed, and neglected to exercise, the right of discontinuing the station for a period of twelve months after its establishment. Neither individuals or the public can, as against a lessor, having no possession or right of possession to property, acquire rights therein, originating in his presumed acquiescence and.permission. The defendants, immediately after acquiring the power to discontinue the station, exercised the right.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b154-9\"> The act of 1866, upon which the application of the State Attorney was founded, is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">\u201c Sec. 1. No railroad corporation shall abandon any depot or station, which is on its road, and in this state, after the same has been established for twelve months, except by the approval of the general railroad commissioners, given after a public hearing held at the depot in question, and of which hearing and of the intention <em>to </em>abandon, notice shall be given by posting the same conspicuously in said depot or station for one month previous to the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\"><em>\u201c </em>Sec. 2. Any depot or station on any railroad in this state, which has been abandoned at any time since the first day of January, 1866, shall, upon the petition to the general railroad commissioners of thirty freeholders residing in the town where .said depot or station was located, be restored upon the approval of said commissioners given after a public hearing held at the depot nearest to said discontinued depot, and after notice of said hearing shall have been conspicuously posted at the place of hearing for one month previous to the hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">The act of 1868, upon which the other application was based, is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">\u201c Sec. 1. Whenever any railroad company in this state shall refuse to stop any one or more of its passenger trains at any depot on the line of its railroad, any number of citizens not less than ten of the town or city in which such depot is situated, may make their application in writing to the Superior Court in the county where such depot is located, and if said court is not in session, to any judge of the Superior or of the Supreme Court of Errors, praying that said com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>pany may be ordered to stop tbe train or trains mentioned in said application at said depot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"APh\">Section 2d provides for tbe appointment of a committee of three disinterested persons who are to hear the case, upon notice given, and if they shall be of opinion that the application ought to be granted in whole or in part, are to issue an order to the company, directing it to stop its trains in the manner stated in the order,' and make return of then- doings to the next term of the Superior Court in the county.</p>\n<p id=\"AlE\">Sections 3d and 4th provide for final proceedings in the Superior Court upon the report, by which the order made by the committee is to be established or set aside, and for the enforcement of the order by mandamus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b162-6\">Seymour, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqV\">These two cases are closely related to each other and were argued together, and will be considered as parts of one case.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The first is an application for a mandamus, to which an answer was filed, to which answer the attorney for the state demurred, and the questions reserved for the advice of this court arise on the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The application is based on the statute passed in 1866, which in substance provides that no railroad corporation shall abandon any depot or station which is on its road in this state after the same has been established for twelve months, except by the approval of the railroad commissioners. The complaint is for an alleged violation of this statute in respect to what is called \u201c Brooks\u2019s Station,\u201d and the first question is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>whether upon the facts appearing in the answer and admitted by the demurrer that place is a depot or station upon the respondents\u2019 road, within the intent of the statute. The answer sets forth \u201c that there was a platform there for the accommodation of passengers, connected with which platform was an old baggage car with an opening which served as a doorway, the car being about twelve feet long and of the width and height of ordinary baggage cars and serving as a shelter or protection from the weather. No agent was ever appointed at said station and no tickets were sold thereat, nor were any freight-bills ever way-billed at or to that station, but were way-billed at or to the station at Cheshire; but tickets were sold at other stations on said road to passengers for said station, and trains were stopped to take up passengers at said station when flagged so to stop, and trains carrying the mail stopped without being flagged. Occasionally under special contracts freight was received and delivered at said station.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The words of the statute are \u201c depot or station.\u201d A mere ' station falls within the letter of the law, but to come within its spirit the station must be one at which trains stop not \u25a0 merely for wood and water but for the transaction of the ordinary business of the company, the receiving and delivering of freight and passengers. Now it is true that this Brooks\u2019s station is a humble one, not important enough to employ at it a station-master, nor of sufficient importance to be made a regular stopping place for all trains, yet it is a place where heretofore, for a period of about twenty years, passengers could always take the cars and where they could always be left, where a shelter was provided for them while waiting for the trains and where a platform was built at which freight could be received and delivered. It had a name as an acknowledged station on the road for which tickets were sold. Business would naturally cluster around such a station. The object of the statute is to prevent railroad companies from arbitrarily changing their places of business on the- road to the prejudice of those who, relying on the permanency of such places, shape their business accordingly. We think we ought so to construe the statute as fairly to carry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>out the object of its makers. Where there are reasonable grounds for changes the approval of the railroad commissioners can doubtless be obtained. The business at this station was the same in kind as at'those of more importance. It is true all the trains did not stop there unless flagged to do so, hut the mail train did stop regularly, and being a place where passengers were received and left and freight deposited it was a depot or place of deposit, and as such entitled to the protection of the statute, falling as we think it does within the letter and spirit of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The next question which arises is, whether the respondents have abandoned Brooks\u2019s Station, and they claim that the station was never established by them and that they therefore cannot properly be charged with its abandonment; It seems the road was run by the respondents\u2019 lessees until July, 1869. From 1848 to 1869 the station had -been used by the lessees in the manner hereinbefore stated. Since August 1st, 1869, the respondent corporation, having themselves resumed the running of the road, have discontinued the stopping of their trains there.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The statute forbids the abandonment by a railroad company of any depot or station on its road in this state after the same has been established for twelve months. We think the statute applies to cases where the depot is in fact established, and does not concern itself with the question whether established by the corporation which abandons it or by its predecessor in the management of the road. The present occupants of the road are so far bound by the acts of the former occupants that they cannot without the consent of the railroad commissioners abandon stations which have in fact become established as such. If the lessees of the road improperly established the depot, as the respondents claim they did, the railroad commissioners have adequate powers to give. immediate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">It is next claimed by the respondents that a mandamus is not the proper remedy. But the duty imposed by the statute is a corporate duty, of such a nature that its nonperformance affects the public, and the remedy by mandamus is appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>ate unless the public have, as the respondents claim they have, an adequate and specific remedy in the second section of the act. On examining that section however it will be found to apply to cases of abandonment of a depot or station after January 1,1866, and before the passing of the act. The first section of the act is wholly prospective; the second is wholly retrospective, and furnishes no remedy whatever for the neglect which is the subject of complaint before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">It was also urged that the answer of the respondents alleges that they found that the operation of their road in a judicious, proper and discreet manner, so as fairly to develop its resources and at the same time secure the best interests of the public, required the discontinuance complained of, and that the demurrer admits these allegations to be true; and that upon such a state of facts as appears by the answer the application ought not to be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">It is true that a demurrer admits the truth of all the allegations demurred to which are properly pleaded and which are relevant to the issue. The statute refers all questions of public and private interest connected with the continuance and abandonment of railroad stations to the railroad commissioners, and railroad companies may not, without consent of the commissioners, in disregard of the statute abandon a station, and then on application for a mandamus tender an issue to be tided by the court upon the interests \u00a1mblic and private involved in the abandonment, and thus transfer to the courts a question which the statute has committed to another tribunal . The allegations therefore in the answer which are relied on by the respondents are not properly in issue before the court and are therefore not admitted by the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The Superior Court is advised to render judgment that the respondents\u2019 answer is insufficient. The application is for an order in its terms more general than is warranted by the facts as they appear in the pleadings. The Superior Court will make the appropriate order, and will be guided in that duty by the proceedings in the other of the two cases under consideration, that of Bristol and others against the same New Haven and Northampton Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>This last mentioned case is founded on a statute of 1868, which provides in substance that when any railroad company shall refuse to stop at any one or more of its passenger trains at any depot on the line of its railroad, any number of citizens not less than ten, of the town, &amp;c., may make application to the Superior Court, or to a judge in vacation, praying that the company may be ordered to stop the trains mentioned in the application at such depot. The second section provides for the appointment of a committee, &amp;c. The application was heard by a judge in vacation, who found the facts upon which the questions befor\u00e9 us arise, the principal matter in dispute being whether there was or was not a depot at Brooks\u2019s station in Cheshire within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The judge found <em>profound </em>that there was such depot there and appointed a committee by whom an order was made requiring certain of the company\u2019s trains to stop there. The report of the committee was returned to the Superior Court and accepted, and the case comes to this court by motion in error. The decision and proceedings in the former case substantially settle this case. The facts as to the depot are found here in about the same terms as they appear in the former case. By the proceedings in that case the depot or station is restored to its condition as such, but under the act of 1866 no power is conferred upon the court or railroad commissioners to direct how many and which trains shall stop at the station. The act of 1868 confers that power on the committee of the Superior Court and by the proceedings now under consideration that power has been exercised; and it having been decided in the former case that there is a depot at Brooks\u2019s station, and the Superior Court having been advised to order the company in general terms to continue that depot, the object of the present proceedings is simply to determine what privileges that depot shall enjoy in respect to the number of trains that shall stop there.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">We refer to the former case as giving the reasons for regarding Brooks\u2019s station as a depot duly established so as to be entitled to the benefit of the two statutes of 1866 and 1868, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>and, no other questions being raised, we are of opinion that there is nothing erroneous in the action of the Superior Court accepting and establishing the report of the doings of the committee, and the judgment of the Superior Court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
