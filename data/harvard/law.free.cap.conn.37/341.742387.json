At the May Term 1869 the defendant pleaded a discharge in bankruptcy obtained upon proceedings instituted by him on the 26th day of February, 1868. The plaintiff replied that his suit was commenced by a valid attachment of certain real estate of the defendant, described in the return of the officer upon the writ, that the attachment had remained from that time to the present without being released or discharged, and that at the time when the bankrupt proceedings were commenced the attachment had existed for more than four months; that the plaintiff had never proved his claim against the estate of the defendant in bankruptcy, and had never received payment of the whole or of any part of it from the defendant or his assignee in bankruptcy; and that he was entitled to a judgment against the defendant for the amount of his claim and costs, to be satisfied only out of the real estate attached, and in no other way to constitute an indebtedness against the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-7\">The defendant demurred to this replication, and the court <em>(Sanford, J.') </em>rendered judgment for the plaintiff, \u201c to be satisfied only out of the interest which the defendant had in the property attached at the time of the attachment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-8\">The defendant brought the record before this court by a motion in error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b341-9\"><em>Wright, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq7T\">cited <em>In re Winn, </em>1 Bankrupt Reg., 131; <em>In re Reed, </em>6 Int.

An attachment might have been made of the property of a debtor while he was possessed of a large estate, and yet during the delay of justice he might have become bankrupt before judgment could be obtained in the case. Surely the act was not intended to dissolve an attachment under such circumstances. Suppose in such a case the property had been receipted and redelivered to the debtor, and by him disposed of while he was a man of wealth, and long before he became insolvent or proceedings in bankruptcy had commenced ; would the creditor\u2019s security be gone ?</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">The defendant claims that the twentieth section of the act preserves to the plaintiff his lien of attachment, but that he must go into the courts of the United States to enforce it. But how can a lien of attachment on process issued by a state be preserved and enforced in the courts of the United States ? The lien is incident to the process. It cannot exist without it. When the process dies, as die it must according <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>to the claim of the defendant, the lien must necessarily die with it. If anything is preserved it must he a lien different in character from a lien of attachment. And would the Congress of the United States in a bankrupt act convert a lien of attachment on state process into a lien of a higher nature in order to confer upon it a separate and independent existence ? This would be favoring the attaching creditor. This would place his lien on a par with that of a pledge. Such is the character of the liens described in section twenty-one. It is there provided that \u201c where a creditor has a mortgage or pledge of real or personal property of the bankrupt, or a lien thereon for securing the payment of a debt owing to him from the bankrupt, he shall be admitted as a creditor only for the balance of the debt after deducting the value of such property, to be ascertained by agreement between him and the assignee or by a sale thereof to be made in such manner as the court shall direct; or the creditor may release or convey his claim to the assignee upon such property, and be admitted to prove his whole debt. If the value of the property exceeds the sum for which it is so held as security, the assignee may release to the creditor the bankrupt\u2019s right of redemption therein on receiving such excess ; or he may sell the property subject to the claim of the creditor thereon; and in either case the assignee and creditor respectively shall execute all deeds and writings necessary or proper to consummate the transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">i It will be perceived that the lien by mortgage, the lien by pledge, and the lien that a creditor may have for securing the payment of a debt owing to him from the bankrupt, are all considered together in the section, and neither is regarded as superior to the other. Hence, if the claim of the defendant is correct, the plaintiff\u2019s lien of attachment .is preserved to him and converted into a lien equal in character with that of a mortgage or pledge of the property attached, which manifestly is incorrect. We think the provision in section fourteenth, which declares that on the assignment being made all the property of the debtor, both real and personal, shall vest in the assignee; and the provision in section twenty-one, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>\u2022which declares that \u201c no creditor whose debt is provable under this act shall be allowed to prosecute to final judgment any suit at law or in equity therefor against the bankrupt\u201d ; and the provision in section thirty-four in relation to the discharge of the bankrupt from all his obligations that might have been proved against his estate in bankruptcy, must be construed as not applying to a case like the one under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The plaintiff seeks to apply the property attached in payment of his claim and that only. He asks merely for the enforcement of his lien of attachment, and not for a judgment <em>in personam.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">A lien by attachment can be enforced in no other way than by the qualified judgment which was rendered by the court below, and we think correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">A case similar in all respects to the one under consideration was decided by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in the late case of <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Tappan, </em>99 Mass., 376, in accordance with the view we have taken of this case. That decision was reaffirmed in the case of <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Turrell, </em>100 Mass., 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">There is no error in the judgment complained of and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
