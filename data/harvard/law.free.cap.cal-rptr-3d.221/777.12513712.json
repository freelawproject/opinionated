Code, \u00a7 211 ; all undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code), one count of carjacking (\u00a7 215, subd. (a)), and one count of vehicle theft ( Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851 ). He admitted enhancements for the\n   personal use of a firearm (former \u00a7 12022.53, subd. (b)) as to the robbery and carjacking counts, and further admitted that he had suffered two prior strike convictions within the meaning of the \"Three Strikes Law\" (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On January 19, 2001, Daniels was convicted by court trial of the first degree murder of LeWayne Carolina (\u00a7\u00a7 187, 189); the second degree murder of LaTanya McCoy (\u00a7 187); deliberate and premeditated attempted murder of Tamarra Hillian (\u00a7\u00a7 664, 187); attempted robbery ( \u00a7\u00a7 664, 211 ); first degree robbery ( \u00a7 211 ); residential burglary (\u00a7 459); and evading arrest causing serious bodily injury ( Veh. Code, \u00a7 2800.3 ). The court found true special-circumstance allegations that the murder of LeWayne Carolina occurred while Daniels was engaged in the commission of robbery and burglary (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)), and found true a multiple-murder special-circumstance allegation (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3)). It also found true various allegations for personally discharging a firearm causing great bodily injury (former \u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d)), personally using a firearm (former \u00a7 12022.53, subd. (b)), and personally inflicting great bodily injury (former \u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 31, 2001, the court imposed the death penalty and an indeterminate term of life without the possibility of parole for 45 years, consecutive to an indeterminate sentence of 441 years to life, to be served consecutively following a determinate term of 125 years. The court subsequently heard and denied Daniels's automatic application for a new trial and modification of death sentence. This appeal is automatic. (\u00a7 1239, subd. (b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Based on the opinions that follow, the judgment of death is reversed because Daniels's waiver of his right to jury trial on penalty was invalid. The\n   sentence of death in connection with the conviction of second degree murder (count 21) is vacated as unauthorized, and the superior court is directed to issue an amended judgment as to this conviction reflecting the appropriate sentence of 15 years to life. The judgment in all other respects is affirmed, including the judgment of guilt as to all counts tried, the true findings of special circumstances, and all convictions entered by way of guilty plea. The case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The lead opinion of Justice Cu\u00e9llar, joined by Justice Werdegar and Justice Liu, expresses the opinion of the entire court on all issues except part II.D (Knowing and Intelligent Waiver of the Right to Jury Trial). Justice Liu writes a concurrence to the lead opinion, which Justice Cu\u00e9llar signs. Justice Corrigan dissents from part II.D of the lead opinion in an opinion joined by Chief Justice Cantil-Sakauye and Justice Chin. Justice Kruger issues an opinion concurring in part with, and dissenting in part from, part II.D of the lead opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    LEAD OPINION BY CU\u00c9LLAR, J., CONCURRING AND DISSENTING IN THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-336\">\n    Cantil-Sakauye, C.J., Werdegar, J., Chin, J., Corrigan, J., Liu, J., Cu\u00e9llar, J., and Kruger, J.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <author id=\"p-14\">\n    Cu\u00e9llar, J.\n   </author>\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    The jury lies at the heart of California's criminal justice system and its capital sentencing\n    scheme. Despite the costs and practical burdens associated with juries, the federal Constitution requires safeguards \"[t]o protect against inappropriate incursions\" on a defendant's exercise or waiver of the fundamental right to a trial by a jury of his or her peers. (\n    <em>\n     People v. Collins\n    </em>\n    (2001)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456742\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/26/297/#p307\">\n     26 Cal.4th 297\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 307,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20836\">\n     109 Cal.Rptr.2d 836\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20P.3d%20726\">\n     27 P.3d 726\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Collins\n    </em>\n    ).) Our state Constitution proclaims that \"[t]rial by jury is an inviolate right and shall be secured to all.\" ( Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16.) And California statutes afford capital defendants the right to a jury trial not only with respect to adjudication of guilt or innocence, but also with respect to determinations regarding special circumstance allegations and the decision to impose the death penalty. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.4, subds. (a), (b) ; all further unmarked statutory references are to the Penal Code.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    A criminal defendant is permitted to waive his or her jury trial rights-but only if the record demonstrates the waivers are express, voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. (\n    <em>\n     Collins\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 26 Cal.4th at p. 305,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20836\">\n     109 Cal.Rptr.2d 836\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20P.3d%20726\">\n     27 P.3d 726\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) That proves to be a problem in this case. We, the undersigned, cannot conclude that defendant David Scott Daniels's\n    waivers of jury trial were knowing and intelligent, in compliance with constitutional requirements. That this error results in unquantifiable prejudice is the reason we would reverse Daniels's guilt convictions, the true findings of special circumstances, and the penalty of death. Our view on this issue, however, does not today command a majority of the court. Thus, we concur in the court's reversal of the penalty of death, while we dissent from the judgment to affirm Daniels's trial convictions and special-circumstance findings.\n    Because the court reverses the judgment of death, we need not address Daniels's claims challenging specific aspects of his trial relating to his death sentence, or California's death penalty scheme more generally. We analyze Daniels's remaining claims only to the extent they seek to attack his convictions or the special-circumstance determinations. With the exception of Daniels's claim maintaining that his jury trial waiver was invalid, discussed in part II.D, the court unanimously agrees with the reasoning and resolution of Daniels's claims examined below.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    <strong>\n     I. FACTS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    <strong>\n     A. Guilt Phase Evidence\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    The People presented the following evidence during the guilt phase of trial. Daniels did not present any guilt phase evidence or argument.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    <em>\n     1. Armed Robberies and Carjacking\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    From November 26 through December 27, 1999, Daniels committed several armed robberies of businesses in Sacramento. The robberies proceeded in substantially the same fashion: Daniels would enter a bank or store, pull out a firearm or insinuate that he had a firearm, and demand money from the cash register. On one occasion, Daniels led a customer and a clerk to the back of the store, took $25 from the customer's wallet, and bound the customer's and clerk's necks and faces with cable wire before taking $1,000 dollars from the store's cash register.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    On January 1, 2000, Daniels approached Gabriel Tover and Lisa Lovado outside a Blockbuster Video in Stockton, holding what looked to be a machine gun or an Uzi. Daniels pointed his firearm at Tover and demanded the keys to a silver 1995 Chevrolet Camaro; Tover obliged. After also taking Lovado's purse and Tover's wallet, Daniels got into the car and drove off.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    In connection with these and similar incidents, Daniels pleaded guilty on January 8, 2001, to 11 counts of armed robbery with use of a firearm, one count of carjacking with use of a firearm, and one count of vehicle theft. In addition, Daniels admitted he had suffered two prior strike convictions within the meaning of the Three Strikes Law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    <em>\n     2. LeWayne Carolina Homicide\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Jennifer O'Neal and Daniels were dating and had known each other about four years. At approximately 6:30 p.m. on December 28, 1999, Daniels picked up O'Neal and O'Neal's eight-year-old daughter in his car. O'Neal\n    noticed that Daniels had, under his clothing, a Tec-9 firearm tied around his neck with a shoelace. Daniels told O'Neal he needed the firearm for protection, explaining that he was \"on the run\" and not going back to prison.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Around 8:00 p.m., Daniels, O'Neal, and O'Neal's daughter went to the Ramada Inn on Auburn Boulevard, where O'Neal rented a room. Daniels made a phone call in the lobby, as well as some calls in the hotel room. Daniels smoked three cocaine cigarettes between approximately 8:00 and 9:30 p.m. Daniels, O'Neal, and O'Neal's daughter left the hotel together by car.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    They picked up a woman named Marcie, then drove to Martina Daniels's house in South Sacramento where they picked up Martina and her friend Lamar. Lamar recommended a place where Daniels could buy illegal drugs. Daniels drove the car and its passengers to an apartment complex on Mack Road. He seemed \"very high\" and \"very hyper.\" His driving was \"okay, a little fast, but he was driving normally.\" When they arrived at the Stonegate apartment complex, Daniels indicated he would be right back, and both he and Lamar exited the car. O'Neal described Daniels's demeanor as \"very aggressive\" and observed that \"he was\n    not in a normal state of mind. He was not rationally thinking.\" Martina, Marcie, O'Neal, and O'Neal's daughter waited in the car.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Around 9:00 p.m. that same evening, Tamarra Hillian arrived to visit Ray Jedkins, a friend of hers from high school, at Jedkins's apartment. Jedkins's cousin, LeWayne Carolina, was also at the apartment. As Hillian sat in the apartment living room watching television, there was a knock at the door. Jedkins answered the door and spoke with Daniels, who was standing outside, for \"a little while\" before Jedkins let Daniels inside. Daniels and Jedkins walked into the kitchen and chatted with Carolina before Jedkins returned to the living room. A few minutes later, Daniels walked into the living room and demanded money while pointing a large firearm in Jedkins's direction. Jedkins handed Daniels a wad of money from his pocket. Then, Hillian heard gunshots and covered her face. Jedkins climbed out the living room window. After the gunshots stopped, Daniels ran out of the apartment. Hillian never saw Daniels point the gun at her or Carolina.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    After Daniels fled the apartment, Hillian tried to stand up, but her leg crumpled and she fell to the floor. She had been shot in the hand and in the leg. She crawled to the kitchen telephone and saw that Carolina had been fatally shot. As Hillian attempted to dial for help, Jedkins returned to the apartment and called 911. Sacramento police officers later arrived at the Stonegate apartment complex and collected nine-millimeter and .380 bullet casings from the scene. Forensic pathologist Dr. Gregory Reiber, who\n    performed the autopsy of Carolina, testified that Carolina suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the head and a superficial grazewound on the left side of his back. No soot or gunpowder\n    was found on Carolina's head, indicating that the fatal gunshot was fired from a distance greater than 12 to 18 inches.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    About 10 minutes after the group had arrived at the apartment complex, Lamar returned alone to the car. He appeared scared and looked as though he was praying. Daniels returned to the car soon after, holding his left side and gasping for air. Daniels told O'Neal, \"I've been shot. That guy shot me.\" Daniels drove the car away from the apartment complex and back to Martina's house, swerving while appearing to nod off. At Martina's house, O'Neal and the other adults attempted to treat Daniels's bullet wounds on his left arm and left side near his back. Martina saw that Daniels had a gun, one she would identify in court as similar to the nine-millimeter gun found on Daniels at his arrest.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Martina drove Daniels, O'Neal, and O'Neal's daughter back to the Ramada Inn. In the hotel room, Daniels told O'Neal that there were three other men and a woman in the Stonegate apartment. He said a man in the kitchen started shooting, and Daniels had returned fire. Daniels told O'Neal he shot the woman, who had been yelling, and also shot the man sitting on the couch. He said \"he would not be taken alive\" by law enforcement. While relaying his account of events, Daniels smoked a cocaine cigarette. Martina observed a smaller gun on the dresser, which Daniels explained he got from the man who shot him in the apartment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    <em>\n     3. LaTanya McCoy Homicide\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    On December 30, 1999, local law enforcement authorities issued an arrest warrant for Daniels for the murder of LeWayne Carolina. On the morning of January 2, 2000, Sacramento Police Detective Michael Kaye was conducting surveillance in front of Martina's house. Around 6:00 a.m., Daniels drove a silver Chevrolet Camaro down the street, making unusual maneuvers before he paused in front of the residence. When the Camaro pulled away, Kaye followed in pursuit. Kaye broadcasted the Camaro's direction of travel to responding patrol units.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Officer Shaunda Davis of the Sacramento Police Department was on patrol, positioned on a nearby road. She activated the patrol car's overhead lights, as did officers in another patrol car, in anticipation of a felony vehicle stop. Daniels initially pulled over, but then drove off at a high speed before the officers could position themselves for a vehicle stop. Fog limited visibility. Police dispatchers were advised that Daniels's car was traveling on Mack Road at speeds up to 100 miles per hour. Daniels's car weaved in and out of\n    traffic. After passing the intersection\n    of Mack Road and Franklin Boulevard, Daniels's Camaro collided with another car at a minimum of 80 miles per hour. The other car spun across the embankment that divided the roadway and burst into flames. Davis unsuccessfully attempted to remove the driver, LaTanya McCoy, from the burning car. The fire killed McCoy and burned her entire body.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The Camaro veered off the road and eventually stopped. Shortly thereafter, several Sacramento City police officers arrived at the scene. Officer Brian Ellis advised Daniels to put up his hands outside of the vehicle. Daniels raised his left hand but claimed his right hand was stuck. As Sergeant Steven Weinrich reached into the Camaro to extract Daniels, Daniels fired his Tec-9 firearm. Weinrich returned fire and was shot as he retreated behind the car. One bullet was later found lodged in Weinrich's bulletproof vest, while another bullet entered his upper thigh.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Penalty Phase Evidence\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    <em>\n     1. Prior Statements by Daniels\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The penalty trial commenced on January 23, 2001. The prosecution began its\n    case by introducing statements made by Daniels on January 19, 2000, in which he threatened officers while hospitalized in the surgical intensive care unit. The prosecutor argued that these statements constituted an uncharged violation of section 69 (obstructing or resisting an officer by means of threat or violence).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Sacramento County Sheriff's deputies testified regarding two confiscated letters written by Daniels while in jail in April and June of 2000. In one six-page letter addressed to a woman named Nikki, Daniels stated that he felt responsible for McCoy's death and wished that he had died instead of McCoy. He also wished he had \"killed every last one\" of the police officers he shot. Daniels wrote he was not afraid to die and preferred death to life in prison. He stated he knew he would get caught and \"that's why [he] robbed every bank an [\n    <em>\n     sic\n    </em>\n    ] store in sight.\" Included with an 11-page letter from Daniels to his aunt was a printout labeled \"Daniels Investigation Time Line,\" which contained admissions and details of crimes committed between November 16, 1999, and January 1, 2000. The listed offenses included 6 bank robberies, 17 robberies, 2 carjackings, and a shootout with the Turlock Police Department.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    <em>\n     2. Prior Convictions\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    During the guilt phase, Daniels admitted to two prior felony convictions: a January 1986 felony conviction for attempted first degree burglary ( \u00a7\u00a7 664,\n    459 ) and a July 1991 felony robbery conviction (\u00a7 212.5). Daniels understood that those prior pleas could be relevant, admissible evidence for penalty purposes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    At the penalty phase, the prosecution introduced certified copies of three prior convictions: a March 1988 felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350 ); an October 1990 felony conviction for sale of a controlled substance ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11352 ); and a February 1998 felony conviction for second degree burglary ( \u00a7 459 ). Daniels acknowledged he had seen copies of these prior convictions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    <em>\n     3. Uncharged Crimes\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The prosecution introduced evidence of several uncharged crimes that occurred in December 1999. Specifically, the prosecution elicited a bank teller's testimony regarding Daniels's armed robbery of the Washington Mutual Bank in Stockton on December 11, 1999, and his departure from the bank with about $6,000 in stolen cash. In addition, business proprietor Vorn Chan and his daughter Junda Chan testified about an armed robbery of Lim's Market in Stockton on December 22, 1999, during which a man took money from the cash register and Vorn's personal effects before driving off in a Toyota pickup owned by Vorn's son-in-law. Neither Vorn nor Junda identified Daniels as the perpetrator of the robbery, but Daniels indicated that he committed a crime at Lim's Market in the printout he had included in the letter to his aunt.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Witnesses testified that on December 30, 1999, Daniels was driving with an unidentified female on the J14 highway in Merced County. After driving off the roadway at a high speed, he exited his car in a daze and\n    appeared \"really loopy\" and \"spaced out.\" Shantel Little stopped to help. After Daniels approached her with a firearm, Little exited her white Camaro. Daniels and his female passenger entered the Camaro and drove away.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Deputy Sheriff Mark Goddard, who was advised by dispatch of the carjacking, observed Daniels in the Camaro and pulled him over. But once Goddard pulled in from behind, Daniels took off, weaving through traffic at speeds up to 80 miles per hour.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Officers from the Turlock Police Department pursued the Camaro until Daniels collided with another car while driving 55 to 60 miles per hour. Daniels got out of the Camaro and fired approximately four to six gunshot rounds at the officers. He then fled on foot while the injured female passenger was arrested. Officers collected discharged shell casings from the scene and later concluded that the casings had been fired from Daniels's Tec-9 firearm.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Jose Campos testified that on the evening of December 30, 1999, Daniels walked into the garage of Campos's home in Turlock with a firearm and\n    asked Campos for his car keys. Campos retrieved his keys from within the house, gave them to Daniels, and returned to his house. When Campos reentered the garage, his car was gone.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <em>\n     4. Statement of Apology\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Daniels declined to present evidence or deliver a closing argument during the penalty phase trial. He did, however, offer a lengthy apology-expressing deep remorse and sadness-to the Carolina and McCoy families. Daniels stated that he had \"no intention on doing anything\" to Carolina. He spoke of being a father to four boys, and apologized in particular to Carolina's father. He \"accept[ed] some responsibility for that accident\" that killed McCoy. The chance to apologize to the families, he said, \"means a lot to me, and I have to live with this for the rest of my life.\" He also noted that \"it took a long time for me to really prepare myself to say this\" to the family members. The court would later identify Daniels's statement as potentially mitigating evidence, stating, \"During the penalty phase, Mr. Daniels addressed the families of the victims. At that time, Mr. Daniels did express some remorse for his actions and took some responsibility for the crimes. These facts may constitute a mitigating factor.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    <strong>\n     II. DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    <strong>\n     A. Knowing and Intelligent Waiver of the Right to Counsel\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Daniels contends that the record does not reflect a valid waiver of the right to counsel. To wit, he argues that the court did not adequately advise him of the complexities of a capital trial, made no meaningful inquiry into his understanding of the charges and possible defenses, and ignored his comment that he did not view self-representation as a disadvantage. We reject this claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    <em>\n     1. Background\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    At a court proceeding on April 28, 2000, Daniels asked to speak to the judge. Judge Ransom told Daniels that he had to speak through his lawyer. Daniels responded, \"I'm not agreeing with nothing that's going on. I'm not agreeing with nothing that's going on here-I'm not agreeing with nothing that's going on here.\" The proceeding terminated without further discussion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    In a letter dated December 7, 2000, Daniels advised the court, \"I am Respectfully Requesting that I be allowed to withdraw my 'Not Guilty' Plea and enter a 'Guilty Plea.' I am also Requesting that I Be allowed to Represent\n    myself, my feretta [\n    <em>\n     sic\n    </em>\n    ] Rights. I fully understand that I am charged with the Capitol [\n    <em>\n     sic\n    </em>\n    ] offense of Murder penal code Section 187 with the special circumstances.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    About two weeks later, on December 20, 2000, Judge Ransom engaged Daniels in a colloquy regarding the benefits of counsel and the drawbacks of self-representation. In response to the court's questioning, Daniels indicated that he knew he had the right to counsel at all stages of the case, he\n    understood that self-representation is \"generally not a wise choice\" in criminal matters, and he would face the death penalty if convicted. Further, Daniels acknowledged that the court would not help him present his case or grant him special treatment, he was being\n    opposed by a trained prosecutor, he would be required to comply with all rules of criminal procedure and evidence, he would forfeit a potential ineffective assistance of counsel claim on appeal, he would be removed from the courtroom if he were disruptive, and he had a right to hire his own attorney at any time but the court would not delay proceedings to accommodate attorney preparation. In response to the court's questioning, Daniels informed the court that he had a high school education and could read and write. He then stated, \"I want to exercise my Faretta\" and reiterated his wish to represent himself. The court then expressed that it was \"satisfied he's doing this knowingly and intelligently,\" and granted the motion for self-representation. Later that day, Daniels signed a \"Record of Faretta Warnings\" form, acknowledging that he had been personally advised of various rights which had been discussed during the oral colloquy. Daniels rejected the court's offer to appoint advisory counsel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The case was subsequently assigned, for all purposes, to Judge Long. At the outset of proceedings on January 5, 2001, Judge Long confirmed that Daniels was representing himself and that Judge Ransom had advised him of the pitfalls of self-representation. Daniels then acknowledged that he had received the amended information in this case. Thereafter, Judge Long arraigned Daniels on the amended information, reading aloud each of the 22 charges and the sentencing enhancements. After reading each charge, the court asked, \"Do you understand the charges?\" Daniels responded affirmatively as to each charge. While arraigning Daniels on counts 12 and 21, the special-circumstance murder counts, Judge Long informed him that these were serious felonies. The court explained that, as to these charges, if Daniels were found guilty of these charges, the case would proceed to a penalty phase where the People would seek the death penalty. Daniels said he understood. After the court finished reading all the charges, the following colloquy transpired:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n    \"THE COURT: Sir, did you understand all those charges?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n    \"MR. DANIELS: Yes, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    \"THE COURT: Are there any questions you need to ask me relating solely to the nature of the charges that the People of the State of California have filed against you?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n    \"MR. DANIELS: No, sir.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n    Thereafter, by asking a series of yes or no questions, Judge Long warned Daniels about the dangers of self-representation. Despite the fact that the judge informed Daniels that the prosecutor in this case was \"one of the experts in this county in prosecuting\" death penalty cases, Daniels expressed his desire to continue self-representation. During this colloquy, the following exchange occurred:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n    \"THE COURT: You understand that these are very, very serious matters and that whatever your legal training is and I don't know what it is, I'm going to get into that, that you, sir, are placing yourself at a severe disadvantage? Do you understand that?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n    \"MR. DANIELS: Yes, your Honor.

DANIELS: No.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n    \"THE COURT: All right....\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Judge Long reminded Daniels that he would be held to the standards of a lawyer, the court could not assist him in any way, the consequences of self-representation were \"enormous\" in this case, it is \"never wise\" for an unskilled person to represent himself, and that \"it is said that he who represents himself is a fool.\" Judge Long asked Daniels if he understood that \"it could get so bad in here based upon your lack of skill and you may have skill, that if this were a professional [sporting] event in the legal sense, it might be like a flag football team going up against the Tennessee Titans?\" Daniels responded, \"I hear you.\" Daniels stated he understood that he would not be able to raise the issue of counsel's competence on appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    As part of his analysis of Daniels's decision to exercise his right to self-representation, Judge Long made several inquiries about Daniels's mental state that day. Daniels responded that he was thinking clearly, he knew what he was doing, he was taking\n    Neurontin for nerve damage in his hand but the medication was not interfering with his choice to represent himself, and that he was not under the effect of any substance that would cloud his judgment. In response to the court's questioning, Daniels stated that he was\n    33 years old, could read and write, had graduated from high school, and had been employed \"off and on\" as a mailroom clerk-a job which required reading and understanding documents. He also stated that no threats had been made against him or his family members in connection with his decision, nor had he been subject to any force or pressure influencing him to represent himself. When the court asked Daniels to state, in his own words, the potential penalty he would be facing if found guilty and the special circumstances found true, Daniels replied, \"I could be put to death.\" This exchange followed:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n    \"THE COURT: Are there other areas that you think I need to explore at this time? Oh, and further, if you did want a lawyer, do you understand that I would appoint a lawyer for you and give you what additional time you need to prepare for this trial? Do you understand that?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n    \"MR. DANIELS: Yes, I do.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n    \"THE COURT: And even with that offer, you still want to represent yourself and proceed to trial?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n    \"MR. DANIELS: Yes, your Honor.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n    Daniels again declined advisory counsel. Following a 15-minute recess for Daniels to reflect on his decision, the court concluded its advisements and ruled on Daniels's\n    <em>\n     Faretta\n    </em>\n    motion:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n    \"THE COURT: All right.

[\u00b6] The Court also finds that Mr. Daniels understands and is aware of the risk and dangers of representing himself, and I further find that he is waiving his right to a lawyer and proceeding to trial by way of self-representation.

The court advised him that it is \"never wise\" for an unskilled person to represent oneself.

But Daniels's statement does not divulge a conditional waiver, such as one contingent upon the receipt of some undisclosed benefit. In light of the court's admonitions, Daniels's statement at most reflects his personal preference to control his own defense-which, no matter how ill-advised, he was entitled to do under\n    <em>\n     Faretta\n    </em>\n    . (See\n    <em>\n     Faretta\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 422 U.S. at p. 834,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/#p807\">\n     95 S.Ct. 2525\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [\"the defendant ... must be free personally to decide whether in his particular case counsel is to his advantage\"].)

He insists that, because his written request to represent himself was coupled with a request to plead guilty, it should have been apparent to the court that Daniels was trying to circumvent the statutory limitation on his ability to plead guilty. Daniels argues that the court should have sua sponte appointed additional counsel or determined whether Daniels was able to negotiate a plea that would not\n    have subjected him to the death penalty. We are not aware of any binding authority-nor has Daniels identified any-that would have required the court to take such action. There is no dispute that Daniels's express waiver of counsel was voluntary. Considering the record as a whole, we conclude that Daniels's counsel waiver was also knowing and intelligent, and therefore valid.\n    <strong>\n     B. Self-Representation in Violation of Section 1018 and the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Representing himself, Daniels expressly waived the right to a trial by jury. At trial, he did not present any evidence or argument, did not raise any objections, and did not conduct cross-examination. Daniels argues that his actions at trial were tantamount to a guilty plea in violation of section 1018, and that the proceedings were insufficiently reliable so as to violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. He seeks reversal of the murder convictions and the special-circumstance findings. For reasons elucidated below, this claim is one we reject.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    <em>\n     1. Background\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    At a court appearance on April 28, 2000, Daniels asked to speak with the judge. Judge Ransom informed Daniels that he would need to speak through his lawyer. In response, Daniels stated, \"I'm not agreeing with nothing that's going on. I'm not agreeing with nothing that's going on here-I'm not agreeing with nothing that's going on here.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    On August 7, 2000, at a proceeding to set a date for Daniels's preliminary hearing, Daniels told Judge Ransom that he wished to plead guilty. Daniels's counsel confirmed that Daniels was facing the death penalty for these charges. The court informed Daniels that he was not permitted to plead guilty without his counsel's consent; the court then entered Daniels's plea of not guilty.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    On August 23, 2000, in response to the court's request that Daniels waive his right to a continuous preliminary hearing so that the court could start later the next day, Daniels told the court, \"[I'm] willing to waive all my rights ... and go no further in the matter.\" The next day, after Daniels was held to answer, he repeated his desire to plead guilty. The court asked counsel if, \"in light of the seriousness of the offense,\" he wished to enter pleas of not guilty and denials of enhancements on behalf of Daniels; counsel replied in the affirmative. At Daniels's arraignment a week later, the court refused Daniels's request to address the court in private after the court asked Daniels whether he wanted counsel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    In a letter dated December 7, 2000, Daniels wrote to Judge Ransom: \"I am Respectfully Requesting that I be allowed to withdraw my 'Not Guilty' Plea and enter a 'Guilty Plea.' I am also Requesting that I Be allowed to Represent myself, my feretta [\n    <em>\n     sic\n    </em>\n    ] Rights. I fully understand that I am charged with the Capitol [\n    <em>\n     sic\n    </em>\n    ] offense of Murder penal code Section 187 with the special circumstances.\" He enclosed a partially completed fill-in-the-blank\n    <em>\n     Faretta\n    </em>\n    motion form. On December 20, 2000, the court granted Daniels's request to represent himself, though it advised Daniels that, even if he was self-represented, he could not \"plead guilty to a death penalty case and get the death penalty.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The case was reassigned from Judge Ransom to Judge Long for all purposes on January 5, 2001. Despite Judge Ransom's prior admonition, Daniels again attempted to plead guilty to all charges. The court prohibited Daniels from pleading guilty to the murders and related counts (counts 12-16, 20-22), but allowed him to enter\n    guilty pleas to all other\n    counts that had not been dismissed. Daniels waived his right to a jury trial and agreed to have Judge Long decide guilt and penalty. At trial, which lasted two days, the prosecution presented the testimony of 27 witnesses and entered 90 exhibits in evidence. Daniels asked no questions of any witness, raised no objections, presented no witnesses or evidence, and made no argument in his defense.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    On review, Daniels argues that-by waiving counsel and jury trial and then failing to present any defense-he effectively pleaded guilty without consent of counsel, in violation of section 1018. He contends that because his conviction obtained in violation of section 1018, it must be reversed. Moreover, Daniels asserts that reversal is warranted because the proceedings below lacked the reliability required by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    <em>\n     2. Analysis\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Section 1018 provides, in relevant part: \"No plea of guilty of a felony for which the maximum punishment is death, or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, shall be received from a defendant who does not appear with counsel, nor shall that plea be received without the consent of the defendant's counsel.\" In 1973, the Legislature amended the statute to add the requirement that defense counsel consent to a guilty plea in capital cases. (Stats. 1973, ch. 719, \u00a7 11, p. 1301.) We have recognized this amendment to be a component in an overhaul of California's death penalty laws, following the high court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Furman v.

In the proceedings below, the state was put to its burden of proof as to the murder charges and related counts. A plea, on the other hand, \"serves as a stipulation that the People need introduce no proof whatever to support the accusation\" and \" 'is itself a conviction.' \" (\n    <em>\n     Chadd\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 28 Cal.3d at p. 748,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=170%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20798\">\n     170 Cal.Rptr. 798\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=621%20P.2d%20837\">\n     621 P.2d 837\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .)

When Daniels's waiver of counsel was accepted, he had already expressed to the court his desire to plead guilty to all charges and had repeatedly declined advisory counsel and an investigator.

Before the prosecutor began his first examination, the court sought to confirm Daniels's decision to waive jury trial. In doing so, the court said to Daniels, \"We also talked about your right to a jury trial with members of these communities that would determine whether or not-the question of guilt or innocence.

Analysis\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    The record demonstrates Daniels personally and expressly waived a jury trial regarding guilt, special circumstances, and penalty. This Daniels does not deny, and indeed, the record reveals no equivocation in his request to waive a jury for all phases of trial. He makes no claim that his waiver was coerced or otherwise involuntary. What Daniels instead contends is that his waiver was infirm because the record does not demonstrate he made his waiver with full awareness of the nature of the right being relinquished. The court, he contends, did not inform him that a jury would be comprised of 12 impartial members who must reach a unanimous verdict, nor did it explain the consequences of a hung jury. The record contains no indication that counsel discussed the jury trial right during the course of representation, and Daniels asserts that he received no advisements from counsel regarding this right.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    Under both the federal Constitution and the California Constitution, a defendant in a criminal prosecution is guaranteed the\n    right to a jury trial.

(Cf.\n    <em>\n     Sivongxxay\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 3 Cal.5th at p. 167,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513544\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/265/#p170\">\n     219 Cal.Rptr.3d 265\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513544\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/265/#p170\">\n     396 P.3d 424\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [defendant initiated request to waive jury].)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    The court orally advised Daniels that the judge alone, instead of a jury, would make determinations in the different phases of his capital trial. The court admonished Daniels that, in the event of waiver, the judge alone would determine whether Daniels was guilty, whether special circumstances were true, and whether the appropriate punishment was death. This information may have illuminated the nature of the court trial Daniels was opting to pursue. But Daniels was provided nearly no information about the right he would abandon. The court did not, prior to accepting the waiver, elaborate on what a\n    jury trial entails, other than that it is not the same thing as a trial before a judge. The court did not explain anything about the nature of the jury-for example, what constitutes a jury, how a jury is selected, or that jury members must be impartial and their verdict unanimous. Daniels replied yes to the court's questions, \"Do you know what you are doing?\" and, moments later, \"Do you know what you have just done?\" With that, the court accepted Daniels's express oral waiver on January 5. The court never inquired whether-even in a general sense-Daniels understood what a jury trial entailed, or if he had any questions about the waiver of the jury right. The waiver was never memorialized in writing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    When the guilt phase commenced a week and a half later, on January 16, 2001, the court sought to orally confirm that Daniels maintained his desire to proceed by way of court trial. The court stated, \"We also talked about your right to a jury trial with members of these communities that would determine whether or not-the question of guilt or innocence. [\u00b6] Do you remember that?\" The court was mistaken on this point: it had not previously informed Daniels that members of the community would determine guilt or innocence. Nonetheless, Daniels responded \"Yes\" to the court's query of whether he recalled such an advisement. This exchange reveals a discrepancy between what the court evidently believed it told Daniels and what it actually told him. Daniels's affirmative response as to whether he remembered the purported previous advisement, despite no record it was given, ultimately provides little support for conclusion that Daniels's waiver was based on full awareness of the nature of the jury trial right.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    The appellate record contains a January 4, 2001, memorandum with the subject line \"Waivers,\" which was filed by the prosecutor. In this memorandum, the prosecutor requested that the court conduct supplemental\n    colloquies as to various waivers. One proposed advisement was, \"You have an absolute right to have your case heard by a jury of twelve persons.\" The court did not provide this advisement to Daniels, nor did it mention this memorandum in any proceedings. The record does not establish that Daniels ever received, much less read or understood, this memorandum. Although Daniels is listed as an intended recipient, there is no proof of service or any notation of service on the document. In contrast, a \"Notice of Evidence in Aggravation\" memorandum dated two days earlier on January 2 bears the notation, \"Hand\n    delivered to Daniels 1/3/01,\" with the prosecutor's initials. The Notice of Evidence in Aggravation memorandum was also discussed on the record in Daniels's presence, while the Waivers memorandum was never referenced in court. The Waivers memorandum does not contain indicia of reliability which would accompany a written waiver signed by the defendant or a document referenced during court proceedings. Thus, the existence of this memorandum is minimally probative in our assessment of Daniels's knowledge. We know of no other written materials in the record regarding Daniels's waiver of his jury right.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    To its credit, the court obtained Daniels's express waiver for three separate phases of trial: guilt, special circumstances, and penalty. The prosecutor, perhaps cognizant of the People's interest in ensuring that the record reflected a valid waiver, interjected at one point to confirm that Daniels would waive a jury for the special-circumstance determinations. What remains both striking and relevant, however, is that the court accepted Daniels's waiver without ever inquiring as to Daniels's understanding\n    of\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    substantive aspect of what a jury is.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-190\">\n    The People point out that Daniels \"never expressed confusion or asked for clarification regarding his jury trial right.\" While this may be true, we decline to infer Daniels's knowledge from his failure to ask unprompted questions of the court. And though an utterance of bewilderment might have weighed in favor of our finding Daniels's waiver to\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    be knowledgeable, the absence of such an expression does not push us toward the inverse finding of a knowing waiver. The phrase \"You don't know what you don't know\" encapsulates the futility of relying on defendants to raise questions or identify misunderstandings on their own when they lack the very basis to understand what lies beyond the scope of their knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-191\">\n    We do not dispute that Daniels expressly affirmed-multiple times-his desire to waive a jury for all trial phases. But we decline to conflate a knowing, intelligent waiver with an emphatic one. The former is constitutionally required; the latter is not. Moreover, our concurring and dissenting colleagues are mistaken in declaring that we \"dismiss Daniels's repeated affirmations that he understood his right to a jury trial and the consequences of forgoing it.\" (Conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Corrigan, J.,\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    221 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 824, 400 P.3d at p. 424.) Not once did Daniels say he understood what the jury right entails. We are not persuaded that Daniels's purported \"overarching aim ... to accept responsibility for the charged crimes\" is relevant to whether his jury trial waiver was knowing and intelligent. (Conc. opn. of Kruger, J.,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , at p. 831, 400 P.3d at p. 429.) That a defendant \"may have made a 'tactical choice' to waive a jury tells us nothing about whether he understood what he would be giving up by making such a choice.\" (\n    <em>\n     U.S. v. Shorty\n    </em>\n    (9th Cir. 2013)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3898765\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/961/#p969\">\n     741 F.3d 961\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 969 (\n    <em>\n     Shorty\n    </em>\n    ).) Nor was\n    Daniels permitted by statute to plead guilty to capital charges in any event, so it strains logic to assume we should in any way give weight to his desire to plead guilty when-after it was settled that Daniels would proceed to trial on the murder counts and related charges-the trial court was still required to ensure a constitutionally valid proffered waiver.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    Confidence does not imply comprehension. Individuals are entirely capable of categorically asserting a position without awareness that the roots of that position lie in ignorance or lack of reflection. It was incumbent upon the court to verify, not merely to assume, that Daniels indeed grasped the actual nature of the jury right-even if only at a basic level. In his own mind, Daniels may have had an impression of what a jury trial is. Just what impression that was-and whether it\n    bore any relationship at all to the required constitutional standard-is well beyond what we can discern from this record.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    Our concurring and dissenting colleagues may believe Daniels demonstrated \"some legal sophistication by filing a written motion to represent himself and referring to his 'Faretta' right.\" (See conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Corrigan, J.,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 824, 400 P.3d at p. 424.) That's\n    <em>\n     some\n    </em>\n    definition of \"legal sophistication.\" The \"written motion\" was a fill-in-the-blank\n    <em>\n     Faretta\n    </em>\n    form motion; Daniels failed even to fill in all the blanks. He also handwrote a note to the judge that stated, \"I am also Requesting that I Be allowed to Represent myself, my feretta [\n    <em>\n     sic\n    </em>\n    ] Rights.\" This misspelled reference to\n    <em>\n     Faretta\n    </em>\n    perhaps disclosed the gist of his aim to represent himself, but Daniels's request does not demonstrate legal sophistication, much less his understanding of the jury trial right. Even a defendant with enough acumen to invoke the\n    <em>\n     Faretta\n    </em>\n    right by filling\n    in all the blanks of a form or drafting his or her own motion in no way forfeits the protections rooted in the wholly distinct requirement that waiver of a jury trial right must be knowing and intelligent. Of course, what must be knowing and intelligent for present purposes is Daniels's understanding of the\n    <em>\n     jury trial\n    </em>\n    right, not his appreciation of the separate\n    <em>\n     Faretta\n    </em>\n    right.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    A proper weighing of the totality of the circumstances forces us to take into account Daniels's lack of representation, even if it was his own choice to exercise his right to self-representation. The sparseness of the colloquy's substance in this case is especially conspicuous given that Daniels was without the benefit of counsel when he proffered his waiver. Counsel plays a crucial part in transmitting information to the client. Time and time again, our precedent has recognized as much, incorporating within the totality of relevant circumstances not only the fact of representation by counsel, but also record references to discussions between counsel and defendant.

Here, Daniels had representation for approximately eleven months before he discharged counsel on December 20, 2000, and about four of those months elapsed after a trial date had been set. Yet there is no indication that counsel had at any point discussed with Daniels the substantive nature of a jury trial or the consequences of giving one up in favor of a court trial in his capital case. The People argue we should \"presume[ ] that competent counsel would have informed [Daniels] of the nature of a jury trial.\" Although we decline the People's invitation to speculate as to possible discussions with counsel which would have had no bearing on decisions made or topics even mentioned on the record during the course of counsel's representation, we observe that their argument correctly evinces the importance our cases have placed on an attorney's role in explaining the jury right to a layperson defendant, and not the mere fact of representation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    As we have found,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , Daniels's waiver of counsel was knowing and intelligent. But while Daniels's choice to represent himself meant that he agreed to assume certain duties of counsel, perhaps to his detriment, this decision did not constructively vest him with the knowledge and intelligence he was entitled to have as a defendant entering a jury trial waiver. It bears repeating that our cases do not treat a jury trial waiver as valid solely because a defendant has counsel; we have ascribed importance to the presence of counsel only insofar as it tells us something about the state of a defendant's substantive awareness of the nature of the jury trial right and the consequences of forgoing it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    Here, Daniels's waiver of counsel did not signify his willingness to forgo access to basic, meaningful information about his separate\n    jury trial right. When the court advised Daniels of what self-representation would entail, it certainly did not probe Daniels's knowledge of the jury right, nor did it mention that the court would no longer be obliged to ensure his jury waiver was knowing and intelligent. Hence, Daniels's valid counsel waiver did not absolve the court of its duty to ensure a valid\n    waiver of his separate constitutional right to be tried by a jury. Considering the inferences this court has consistently drawn from counsel representation in assessing the validity of jury waivers, our inability to surmise that Daniels had any discussions with counsel about a jury waiver means that we have one less assurance that Daniels understood the nature of the right he was relinquishing and the effects of doing so.\n    A defendant's knowing and intelligent waiver of jury trial is required by both the state and federal Constitutions and applies to both represented and self-represented defendants. In\n    <em>\n     Barnum\n    </em>\n    , we invalidated a rule requiring trial courts to advise in propria persona defendants of the privilege against compelled self-incrimination before they were called by the People or testified in their own defense.

In doing so, we also rejected the argument that \"because a right like the privilege against compelled self-incrimination may be lost only by waiver, and because a waiver is effective only if it is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, the effectiveness of a waiver is ensured only if the trial court gives an advisement of what is to be relinquished.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at p. 1224,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20499\">\n     131 Cal.Rptr.2d 499\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20P.3d%20788\">\n     64 P.3d 788\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; see\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at p. 1223,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20499\">\n     131 Cal.Rptr.2d 499\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20P.3d%20788\">\n     64 P.3d 788\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .)

The court here told Daniels as much-at least prior to the presentation of evidence at trial, if not at the time the jury waiver was actually entered. But the Seventh Circuit's finding of a valid waiver\n    hinged in significant part on the role of competent counsel in advising the defendant. (\n    <em>\n     DeRobertis\n    </em>\n    , at p. 1181, italics added [\"We are unpersuaded that... it would be fundamentally unfair to give effect to a waiver executed without knowledge of [certain jury trial] attributes,\n    <em>\n     particularly where the defendant was represented by competent counsel\n    </em>\n    ....\"];\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at pp. 1177, 1180-1181 [defendant waived jury trial on advice of counsel].)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    This reasoning reinforces an important principle: Courts generally rely on counsel to transmit to defendants critical information about whether to waive the jury trial right and the consequences of waiving it, and they do not assume that defendants otherwise already possess requisite information to make a knowing and intelligent waiver.\n    <em>\n     DeRobertis\n    </em>\n    does not hold that a bare-bones mention of trying the case to a judge rather than jury, without further explanation, would be sufficient in the absence of advice from competent counsel or other affirmative indications of the defendant's legal sophistication.

The record contains certified copies of five of Daniels's prior felony convictions. Two of these convictions were introduced at the guilt phase to establish prior strikes within the meaning of the Three Strikes Law: a January 1986 conviction for attempted first degree burglary; and a July 1991 robbery conviction. During the penalty phase, the prosecution additionally introduced certified copies of three prior convictions as evidence\n    in aggravation: a March 1988 conviction for possession of a controlled substance; an October 1990 conviction for sale of a controlled substance; and a February 1998 conviction for second degree burglary. All five convictions were the result of guilty pleas, and in all those plea proceedings Daniels was represented by counsel. In none of those cases did the presiding judge conduct any inquiry into Daniels's understanding of the jury right beyond counsel's representations. The plea colloquy for Daniels's 1986 attempted burglary conviction reflects a court advisement that Daniels had a right to either a jury trial or a court trial, with no discussion of what a jury trial entails. And the record of Daniels's February 1998 burglary plea is comprised of a complaint, a series of minute orders, and a judgment-with no recorded advisement of rights. For each of Daniels's felony pleas in March 1988, October 1990, and July 1991, counsel represented that he or she advised Daniels-each time with the exact same language-\"that he cannot be convicted unless all twelve jurors agree that the prosecution has proved his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-202\">\n    Given these facts, the People's contention raises a fundamental question: How much weight to afford such prior pleas in assessing the totality of the circumstances indicating whether a jury trial right waiver is \"knowing and intelligent\"? It is true that we have previously inferred some degree of a defendant's knowledge and intelligence of the jury right from a vaguely\n    articulated cognizance of criminal history. (See\n    <em>\n     People v. Langdon\n    </em>\n    (1959)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4383991\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/52/425/#p432\">\n     52 Cal.2d 425\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 432,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=341%20P.2d%20303\">\n     341 P.2d 303\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [no duty of trial court to inquire into waiver of jury trial, in part, because defendant had \"been before the criminal courts on at least three previous occasions\"].) This court has also once upheld a guilt phase jury waiver after consideration of several factors, including the fact the defendant had previously pleaded guilty to two prior offenses, once signing a waiver stating that he \"fully underst[ood]\" his right to a jury trial. (\n    <em>\n     Sivongxxay\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 3 Cal.5th at p. 167,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513544\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/265/#p170\">\n     219 Cal.Rptr.3d 265\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513544\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/265/#p170\">\n     396 P.3d 424\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) We are mindful, however, that courts-both state and federal-exercise prudence in determining what types of prior criminal experience would be most relevant to the waiver at issue, and nothing in our prior cases supports the conclusion that a defendant's receipt of previous advisements is bound to satisfy the requirement that a subsequent waiver of a jury trial right be knowing and intelligent.\n    Consider\n    <em>\n     Parke v. Raley\n    </em>\n    as an example. When the high court stated that \"evidence of a defendant's prior experience with the criminal justice system [is] relevant to the question whether he knowingly waived constitutional rights,\" it did so in the context of examining evidence of prior guilty pleas to determine the validity of the guilty plea at issue. (\n    <em>\n     Parke v. Raley\n    </em>\n    (1992)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11924885\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/20/#p37\">\n     506 U.S. 20\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 37,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11924885\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/20/#p37\">\n     113 S.Ct. 517\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11924885\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/20/#p37\">\n     121 L.Ed.2d 391\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) And when criminal history is brought to bear on an inquiry into a waiver of the right to a jury trial in favor of a bench trial, the most relevant experience is\n    <em>\n     previouslyhaving undergone a criminal trial\n    </em>\n    .

Is that a fair statement ...?' \"].) Here, we know of no evidence that Daniels had ever previously stood trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-203\">\n    Nor can we ignore that the plea colloquies describing certain elements of the jury right preceded Daniels's jury waiver in this matter by a decade in one case, 11 years in another case, and 13 years in another. Unless we\n    assume Daniels already harbored the kind of detailed knowledge of the jury system that would make the previous advisements all but irrelevant, to weigh those previous advisements so heavily implies an enormously contingent conclusion about the quality of Daniels's memory and the extent of knowledge he\n    gleaned from those advisements. In a recent Ninth Circuit case, the government likewise asserted the defendant's waiver was knowing and intelligent because he had prior experience with the criminal justice system, including both prior guilty pleas and a three-day jury trial. (\n    <em>\n     Shorty\n    </em>\n    , 741 F.3d at p. 968.) In\n    <em>\n     Shorty\n    </em>\n    , the court rejected this argument because, among other reasons, \"[E]ven if [the defendant] was properly instructed on his right to a jury trial, nothing suggests that he retained that information ten, fifteen, or even twenty years later when he waived the right again in 2010.\" (\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20A.3d%201094\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ) The record in Daniels's case does not contain evidence that Daniels had cognitive impairments that may have affected his ability to understand the consequences of waiving a jury trial, unlike the record in\n    <em>\n     Shorty\n    </em>\n    (see\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20A.3d%201094\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at p. 967 ). Yet we find only an attenuated connection, at best, between Daniels's jury trial right waivers in this capital case and the oral advice Daniels received in connection with guilty pleas a decade earlier.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    A court may not accept a jury waiver that is not \"knowing and intelligent, that is, ' \" 'made with a full awareness both of the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.' \" ' \" (\n    <em>\n     Collins\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 26 Cal.4th at p. 305,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20836\">\n     109 Cal.Rptr.2d 836\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20P.3d%20726\">\n     27 P.3d 726\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) Here, the court may have advised Daniels of a modicum of meaningful information about the nature of a jury trial before accepting his waiver, insofar as it told him that the right applied to each of\n    the three phases of trial. Daniels was orally informed that the judge alone would decide his fate at different stages in his trial. Daniels also consistently replied in the affirmative when asked whether he understood what he was being told. Nonetheless, Daniels tendered his waiver without assistance of counsel-appointed or standby. And nowhere does the record offer even a suggestion that he ever discussed the jury right with competent counsel. We do not find that the court made a sufficient effort to assure that this self-represented defendant understood any substantive aspects of the fundamental jury trial right he would give up in this case. The court's only reference to any characteristic of a jury occurred when it asked Daniels-a week and a half after the waiver was accepted-whether he recalled an earlier conversation (that had not occurred) regarding \"members of these communities\" who would determine guilt or innocence. Guilty plea colloquies from over 10 years prior demonstrate that Daniels had previously in his life been orally advised of certain characteristics of a jury trial. But we are not persuaded that these remote plea advisements can patch the record's void on this question of whether Daniels waived his jury right in this case in accordance with constitutional requirements. We have never before found an effective waiver of jury based on so few available inferences. Neither the People nor any of our concurring and dissenting colleagues is able to identify a single case when our court has upheld a jury waiver based on so thin a record. We conclude, based on the totality of the circumstances of this record, that the trial court erred in accepting Daniels's jury trial waiver.\n    Unfortunately, a majority of the court does not share our view that Daniels's waivers of jury trial were invalid as to all three phases of trial. Instead, four members of the court today would find Daniels's guilt phase and special-circumstance phase waivers to be knowing and intelligent. (See conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Corrigan, J.,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 829, 400 P.3d at p. 428; conc. opn. of Kruger, J.,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , at pp. 830-831, 400 P.3d at p. 429.) To elucidate why we do not concur in the judgment supported by a court majority to affirm Daniels's guilt convictions and the true findings of the special circumstances, we assess the consequences of the error we have found.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    A failure to obtain an informed waiver results in a complete denial of defendant's right to a jury trial.

Knowledge and intelligence are required components of an effective waiver of jury trial and are equally pivotal as the requirements that a waiver be express and voluntary. Hence, a court's failure to obtain a knowing and intelligent waiver falls within the\n    limited class of errors that infect the integrity of proceedings to such a degree that they are reversible per se.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    The court obtained Daniels's waivers of jury trial for guilt, special circumstance determinations, and penalty immediately in succession after conveying roughly the same information. Constitutional inadequacies, we find, pervade the entire trial. Daniels was denied his fundamental right to a jury trial under the state and federal Constitutions. We cannot attempt to assess the prejudice Daniels suffered as a result of this deprivation. In accordance with precedent from both the high court and our court, we would reverse the judgment of the superior court on all counts tried, on the basis of structural error arising from Daniels's ineffective waivers of jury trial. We respectfully dissent from the judgment of the court, which affirms the guilt convictions for all counts tried and the true findings of special circumstances.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    The record is even more bereft of support for the conclusion that Daniels's penalty phase waiver was valid. Any weight that could conceivably be accorded to Daniels's prior pleas, for example, would be diminished in an assessment of whether there is support in the record to conclude that Daniels's jury waiver at the penalty phase was knowing and intelligent. Even supposing Daniels retained the information received orally in connection with guilty pleas to burglary and drug charges over 10 years prior, we are not persuaded there is an adequate basis to presume Daniels's knowledge that any particular jury attributes would necessarily translate to the unique context of punishment determinations in capital trials.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-209\">\n    Although the court provided Daniels another opportunity to opt for a jury trial right before the penalty phase, it did not describe any aspect of a jury's role in the penalty phase or otherwise add to what had been conveyed to Daniels earlier in the trial. A defendant's decision to waive the right to have a jury determine whether he or she will\n    be subjected to the death penalty is enormously consequential, as \"[t]he decision to waive the right to jury sentencing may deprive a capital defendant of potentially life-saving advantages.\" (\n    <em>\n     Jells v.

(See \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3).) The court convicted Daniels of McCoy's murder in the second degree and found true the special circumstance.

But we cannot conclude from this record that the trial court's acceptance of Daniels's jury waiver complied with the constitutional requirements that the waiver must be knowing and intelligent. Because we find Daniels's waiver of jury trial was invalid in consideration of the totality of the circumstances, we would reverse Daniels's convictions with respect to all counts tried (counts 12-16 and 20-22), the true findings establishing the presence of special circumstances, and his death sentence. Accordingly, we dissent from the court's judgment today to affirm the validity of Daniels's jury trial waivers for the guilt phase and special-circumstance determinations, and we concur in the reversal of Daniels's death judgment on the basis of an invalid penalty phase waiver.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-219\">\n    In all other respects, we would affirm.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-220\">\n    We Concur:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    Werdegar, J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-222\">\n    Liu, J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCURRING OPINION BY LIU, J.

The fact that Daniels repeatedly and \"most emphatically\" said he understood what he was doing\n    (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Corrigan, J.,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 823-824, 400 P.3d at pp. 423-424) is of limited significance because there is no indication in the record of what he understood. Similarly, although Daniels's \"manifest desire was to plead guilty\" (conc. opn. of Kruger, J.,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , at p. 831, 400 P.3d at p. 429), it does not follow that his jury trial waiver was knowing and intelligent. Justice Kruger speculates that \"while an express advisement about the fundamental attributes of jury trial might have made even clearer to defendant the protection that a jury might afford, there is every indication that he did not want that protection at his trial on the substantive charges-and that additional advisements on that point, if anything, would have simply reinforced his resolve to waive a jury trial.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at pp. 831-832, 400 P.3d at p. 430.) But how can we conclude that Daniels \"did not want that protection\" and would have persisted in admitting guilt, when the record contains no indication that he understood what \"that protection\" consists of? Finally, although it is\n    true that Daniels had been advised by counsel in different proceedings a decade earlier and that the trial court here told Daniels that a jury consists of members of the community, these circumstances do not show that his jury trial waiver in this case was knowing and intelligent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-226\">\n    For the average reader (or writer) of judicial opinions, it is perhaps elementary what a jury is and how it functions in a criminal trial. But we cannot assume such knowledge among the general populace or even in \"a literate high school graduate.\" (Conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Corrigan, J.,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 824, 400 P.3d at p. 424.)

(Greene,\n    <em>\n     Study: One in Three Americans Fails Naturalization Civics Test\n    </em>\n    (Apr. 30, 2012) U.S. News &amp; World Report &lt; https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2012/04/30/study-one-in-three-americans-fails-naturalization-civics-test&gt; [as of Aug. 31, 2017] [reporting on Xavier University study].) In California, half of high school seniors cannot state the function of the United States Supreme Court; their understanding of the structures and functions of government is \"modest, at best.\" (Kahne et al., Constitutional Rights Foundation, The California Survey of Civic Education (2005) pp. 4, 8.) I would not assume that despite these glaring gaps in civic literacy, the average American\n    nonetheless has a clear understanding of the right to a jury trial. (But see conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Corrigan, J.,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 825-826, fn. 5, 400 P.3d at p. 425, fn. 5.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-228\">\n    Judges have long recognized these shortcomings in the citizenry's knowledge of civics and the role of courts. Retired United States Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has called attention to the \"steady decline\" of civics education over the past generation (O'Connor &amp; Hamilton,\n    <em>\n     A democracy without civics?\n    </em>\n    (Sept. 18, 2008) The Christian Science Monitor, at p. 9), with particular concern for students' understanding of \"the importance of an independent judiciary\" (Singer,\n    <em>\n     Trailblazing Justice Now Has Games on Docket\n    </em>\n    , N.Y. Times (Mar. 28, 2016) p. B1). Justice O'Connor is not alone. (See Cantil-Sakauye &amp; Padilla,\n    <em>\n     Engage, protect your democracy\n    </em>\n    , The Sacramento Bee (Sept. 17, 2015) p. 7B [noting that \"more than 20 percent of Californians typically do not report for jury service when summoned\" and urging California schools to get civics education \"back on track\" by \"teach[ing] students how our government works, how the three branches provide checks and balances, and how to participate in our democracy\"].)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-229\">\n    There is an additional reason why courts cannot assume that laypeople know the fundamental features of a jury trial: Those features vary from one setting to the next. The unanimity requirement, for instance, has long been considered an essential aspect of jury trials (3 Blackstone, Commentaries 375-376), and under the California\n    Constitution, criminal defendants are entitled to a unanimous jury verdict ( Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16 ). But in civil cases, \"three-fourths of the jury may render a verdict.\" (\n    <em>\n     Ibid\n    </em>\n    .) Moreover, although the Sixth Amendment to the federal Constitution requires juror unanimity in federal criminal cases, that federal constitutional requirement does not extend to state courts. (See\n    <em>\n     Apodaca v. Oregon\n    </em>\n    (1972)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171091\" index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/404/\">\n     406 U.S. 404\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171091\" index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/404/\">\n     92 S.Ct. 1628\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171091\" index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/404/\">\n     32 L.Ed.2d 184\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     McDonald v.

In fact, some states permit criminal convictions with less-than-unanimous jury verdicts. (See Or. Const., art. I, \u00a7 11 [\"[I]n the circuit court ten members of the jury may render a verdict of guilty or not guilty, save and except a verdict of guilty of first degree murder, which shall be found only by a unanimous verdict.\"]; La. Const., art. I, \u00a7 17 [\"A case in which the punishment is necessarily confinement at hard labor shall be tried before a jury of twelve persons, ten of whom must concur to render a verdict.\"].)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-230\">\n    The jury's role in a capital case is particularly likely to be unfamiliar. The defendant is unlikely ever to have experienced a capital trial (certainly this was Daniels's first), and the jury performs a unique function when considering whether to render a death verdict. \"Unlike its role at the guilt phase, the jury's role in a capital penalty trial 'is not merely to find facts, but also-and most important-to render an individualized,\n    <em>\n     normative\n    </em>\n    determination about\n    the penalty appropriate for the particular defendant-i.e., whether he should live or die.' [Citations.] This inherently ' \"moral endeavor\" ' [citation], which is designed ' \"to maintain a link\n    between contemporary community values and the penal system\" ' [citation], renders a defendant's decision to waive a jury trial at the penalty phase particularly consequential.\" (\n    <em>\n     People v.

The jury's normative function as sentencer in a capital trial is unusual and especially unlikely to be a matter of common understanding.

When his counsel refused to agree, Daniels moved to\n    represent himself. The motion was granted, and Daniels pleaded guilty to vehicle theft, carjacking, and 11 counts of robbery. Informed that he could not plead guilty to the murders, which carried a possible verdict of death, or to other related counts, Daniels waived his right to a jury trial in favor of a bench trial for both the guilt and penalty phases. He repeatedly declined the assistance of a defense investigator or advisory counsel. He presented no evidence, cross-examined no witnesses, and made no argument on his behalf. The trial court convicted him of all remaining counts and entered a judgment of death.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-242\">\n    The record demonstrates that Daniels personally and expressly waived the right to jury trial on the issues of guilt, special circumstances, and penalty. Daniels now contends, however, that the record does not demonstrate his waiver was knowing and intelligent. He faults the trial court for failing to advise him that a jury consists of 12 members, that the jurors must be impartial, and that they must unanimously agree in order to reach a verdict. He also assigns as error the trial court's failure to advise him about the consequences of non-unanimity. He claims that his penalty phase waiver was invalid \"for the same reasons that his earlier waiver of a jury at the guilt phase was invalid\" and for the additional reason that he was not told his waiver of a jury trial would result in the \"loss of the right to an independent trial court review of the penalty imposed by a jury.\" Daniels asserts that he received no advisements from counsel before discharge regarding the jury trial right.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-243\">\n    Daniels's arguments are unpersuasive. As recently as two months ago, we reaffirmed that that there is no \"rigid formula or particular form of words that a trial court must use in taking a jury waiver.\" (\n    <em>\n     People v.

Here, Daniels personally entered an express waiver of his right to jury trial three separate times: twice before trial began and a third time before the start of the penalty phase. During the colloquy, the trial court informed Daniels that he had a right to be tried by a jury made up of members of the community and that, if he waived jury trial,\n    the court alone would determine the issues of guilt, special circumstances, and penalty. Daniels stated no fewer than 15 times that he understood the jury trial right he was giving up. He unwaveringly assured the court that he understood the nature of the proceedings and the decisions he had made. He specifically expressed his confidence that he would receive a fair trial before the judge who would hear his case. He was no stranger to criminal proceedings. Approximately a decade before, when represented by counsel, he had thrice pleaded guilty after being informed that he was entitled to a unanimous\n    verdict of 12 jurors on the question of guilt. The totality of these circumstances\n    demonstrates a knowing and intelligent waiver of the jury trial right.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-244\">\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-245\">\n    Because the outcome of this case turns heavily on the colloquies between Daniels and the court, they are set forth in detail here. On August 7, 2000, before the preliminary hearing, Daniels informed the court that he \"wish[ed] to plead guilty.\" When his counsel interjected, \"He doesn't mean that,\" Daniels retorted, \"I know exactly what I'm saying. We discussed this already.\" Counsel told the court that she had advised Daniels to enter not guilty pleas so that the case could proceed to preliminary hearing. Daniels responded, \"I understand exactly what she is saying. What I am saying [is] I am prepared to enter a plea of guilty.\" The court replied that Daniels could not enter a guilty plea without his counsel's consent. Defense counsel proposed a sentence of life without the possibility of parole in exchange for defendant's guilty plea, but the prosecutor refused. The court then entered pleas of not guilty. Following a preliminary hearing, Daniels was held to answer on 22 of 24 charges.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-246\">\n    On December 7, 2000, after Daniels was arraigned on the information, he filed a letter requesting that he be allowed to represent himself and to plead guilty to the charges. In the letter, he stated, \"I fully understand that I am charged with the Capitol [\n    <em>\n     sic\n    </em>\n    ] offense of Murder penal code section 187 with the special circumstances.\" Daniels also filed a written motion in support of his request. On December 20, the court questioned Daniels about his choice to waive counsel. It advised him that he was facing the death penalty and that, even if he chose self-representation, he could not plead guilty to the capital charges. Daniels said he understood. The court admonished Daniels about his right to be represented by counsel and the risks of self-representation. Daniels affirmed that he understood each of the court's admonishments and that he wanted to exercise his \"Faretta\" right. Daniels executed a written waiver, and the court granted his request to proceed pro se. When asked if he wanted the assistance of advisory counsel, Daniels declined. The court asked, \"Are you sure of that?\" and Daniels responded, \"Positive.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-247\">\n    Two weeks later, on January 5, 2001, Daniels appeared before a different judge for trial. Again, the court extensively discussed Daniels's desire to represent himself. After reviewing the charges, the court emphasized that they were \"very, very serious\" and that the special circumstance allegations exposed him to the death penalty. Daniels said that he understood. The court warned that the prosecutor was an expert in capital litigation, it is unwise to elect self-representation, and Daniels would be at a \"severe disadvantage.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-248\">\n    The court likened it to \"a flag football team going up against the Tennessee Titans.\" Daniels stated that he understood and that \"I don't look at it as a disadvantage.\" The court emphasized that Daniels would have to conduct himself in a lawyerly fashion and that he would receive no special assistance from the court. It also stated that Daniels would forgo an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on appeal. Daniels indicated that he understood everything the court had explained. The court asked Daniels if he was \"thinking clearly.\" Daniels replied, \"Yes, I am\" and affirmed that he knew what he was doing. Daniels said that he was 33 years old, had graduated from Galileo High School in San Francisco, and was literate. He had previously worked as a mailroom clerk which required him to read and understand documents. He did not suffer from mental illness and was not under the influence of\n    any substance that would impair his judgment. He made his request freely and voluntarily, without any threats or pressure.\n    The court then asked Daniels if he was \"satisfied that you know what you are doing?\" to which he replied, \"Yeah.\" Daniels declined the assistance of advisory counsel. The court took a 15-minute recess to allow Daniels to think about his decision. When proceedings resumed, the court asked Daniels if he felt capable of presenting a defense on his own behalf, to which he replied, \"Yes, I do.\" The court then found that Daniels had made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel and confirmed his pro se status. Daniels again executed a written waiver of his right to counsel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-249\">\n    The court then asked Daniels if he wished to proceed \"by way of jury trial or by way of court trial.\" Daniels replied, \"Court trial.\" The following colloquy ensued:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-250\">\n    \"THE COURT: Are you satisfied that that's what you want to do?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-251\">\n    \"MR.

The court then\n    asked, \"Do you know what you are doing?\" to which Daniels replied, \"Yes.\" After obtaining a waiver from the People, the court again asked Daniels, \"Do you know what you have just done, sir?\" to which Daniels again replied, \"Yes.\" The court found a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of the right to jury trial.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-270\">\n    Daniels declined the services of a defense investigator. He then stated his desire to plead guilty to the noncapital counts and to\n    enter pleas admitting the truth and validity of two prior convictions. The court obtained oral waivers of Daniels's constitutional rights, including the right to jury trial:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-271\">\n    \"THE COURT: Although I reference jury trial, you have a right not only to-these charges, you have a right to a jury trial and a court trial, but my understanding is you don't want either one of those, you wish to plead guilty and to admit, right?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-272\">\n    \"MR.

Before the prosecutor's opening statement, the court revisited Daniels's waivers of the right to counsel and jury trial. The court offered to appoint counsel \"even at this late date,\" but Daniels declined. The court offered Daniels the services of an investigator and advisory counsel; again Daniels declined. The court then noted, \"We also talked about your right to a jury trial\n    <em>\n     with members of these communities\n    </em>\n    that would determine whether or not-the question of guilt or innocence.\" (Italics added.) Daniels responded that he remembered discussing this with the court.

The trial court convicted him on all counts and found true all special allegations and enhancements.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-295\">\n    On January 19, before the penalty phase trial began, the prosecutor informed the court that he had spoken to Daniels and had \"advised him that ... he does have the right to present mitigating evidence in his own defense if he wishes.\" The prosecutor reported that he had offered Daniels the services of an investigator to help him present a case in mitigation, but Daniels had declined. The court told Daniels he faced \"the gravest consequences in the criminal law in terms of\n    punishment.\" The court explained that, at this phase of the trial, \"the District Attorney is going to present what is called aggravating factors\" and that Daniels would \"have the right to present what is known as mitigating evidence that the [court] ... would consider relative to aggravating factors versus mitigating factors.\" Based on this evidence, the court would \"consider whether or not you should be imprisoned for the rest of your life without the possibility of parole, or whether you shall suffer death.\" The court offered to \"stop these legal proceedings, appoint a lawyer, appoint advisory counsel, appoint an investigator for you, and give them ample time to prepare before we enter this penalty phase.\" Daniels declined, stating, \"Your Honor, I respect and thank you for being concerned, that you are the Judge James L. Long, and I trust and have faith in you, whatever your decision is.\" The court replied, \"Do you realize, although you have waived your right to a jury trial, that I would empanel a jury to try these questions in the penalty phase, you have that right, but heretofore you have waived that right, and said you wanted a court trial. [\u00b6] Do you still feel that way?\" Daniels responded, \"I do.\" The court then observed: \"Now, Mr. Daniels, I have watched you in terms of your demeanor, your manner, physical movement, your verbal statements, looking for any indication that you are not competent within the meaning of California law. [\u00b6] I have watched you carefully. I have asked you earlier do you understand the nature of these proceedings?\" Daniels replied that he did, and stated that he was capable of presenting a penalty phase defense.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-296\">\n    Daniels in fact presented no defense or argument. He apologized to the victims' families.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-297\">\n    In a statement to the probation officer after trial, Daniels explained that \"he chose not to fight the case, choosing to plead guilty to the majority of the charges, to put this matter behind him and to bring some closure to this case. He felt it would be unfair to the victims and their surviving\n    family members for him to attempt to fight these charges, knowing he was guilty of each of the crimes.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-298\">\n    II.

In\n    <em>\n     DeRobertis\n    </em>\n    , the Seventh Circuit upheld a jury trial waiver as knowing and intelligent where the defendant \"understood that the choice confronting him was, on the one hand, to be judged by a group of people from the community, and on the other hand, to have his guilt or innocence determined by a judge.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at p. 1180.)

But a review of the entire record casts no doubt on Daniels's understanding. He was a literate high school graduate who had been gainfully employed. He showed some legal sophistication by filing a written motion to represent himself and referring to his \"Faretta\" right. He spoke most emphatically about his ability to comprehend the proceedings. When his counsel questioned his desire to plead guilty, he retorted, \"I know exactly what I'm saying. We discussed this already.\" He assured the court that he \"fully underst [ood]\" the charges against him. He told the court he was \"positive\" that he did not need the assistance of advisory counsel. He emphasized his confidence that the court would give him a fair trial. He had repeated opportunities to ask questions or express reservations. He did neither. At one point, the court observed that it had\n    carefully watched Daniels's \"demeanor, [his] manner, physical movement, [his] verbal statements, looking for any indication that [he was] not competent within the meaning of California law,\" and noted none. In the words of the high court, \"if the record before us does not show an intelligent and competent waiver ... by a defendant who demanded again and again that the judge try him, and who in his persistence of such a choice knew what he was about, it would be difficult to conceive of a set of circumstances in which there was such a free choice by a self-determining individual.\" (\n    <em>\n     Adams v.

Counsel may explain the features of a jury trial, the nuances of jury selection, how a jury is likely to view the facts of the case, and the possibility of a mistrial.

By choosing a court trial, Daniels did not forgo a normative determination of penalty or the prospect of a life without parole sentence. Whether made by a jury or a judge, the normative features of the penalty decision remain the same. As discussed above, the basic core of the jury trial right is the \"interposition between the accused and his accuser of the commonsense judgment of a group of laymen, and in the community participation and shared responsibility that\n    results from that group's determination of guilt or innocence.\" (\n    <em>\n     Williams v.

Daniels was repeatedly advised of this distinction as it pertained to all aspects of his jury trial waiver, including penalty.\n    Moreover, Daniels was not ignorant of the manner in which a penalty determination would be reached in his case. Before the penalty phase began, the prosecutor advised Daniels of his right to call witnesses who would present mitigating evidence. The trial court explained to Daniels that the prosecutor would present evidence in aggravation, and that the court would consider the aggravating factors and mitigating factors in reaching a verdict of death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Daniels indicated that he understood. The court persisted in its inquiry, stating, \"Do you realize, although you have waived your right to a jury trial, that I would empanel a jury to try these questions in the penalty phase, you have that right, but heretofore you have waived that right, and said you wanted a court trial. [\u00b6] Do you still feel that way?\" Daniels replied, \"I do.\" These advisements are similar to those given in S\n    <em>\n     ivongxxay\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513544\" index=\"485\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/265/#p170\">\n     3 Cal.5th 151\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513544\" index=\"486\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/265/#p170\">\n     219 Cal.Rptr.3d 265\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513544\" index=\"487\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/265/#p170\">\n     396 P.3d 424\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . There, the defendant was told about the basic features of the penalty phase: that the prosecution would present aggravating evidence and the defendant would have the right to present mitigating evidence. He was advised that he had a right to a jury trial at the penalty phase and that, if he waived that right, the court would decide the appropriate punishment, which could result in a death sentence.

(Conc. opn. of Kruger, J.,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 831-832, 400 P.3d at p. 430.) True, Daniels did not ask to be sentenced to death. But this is largely beside the point for two reasons. First, the judge was just as capable as the jury of returning a life without parole sentence. Daniels clearly expressed his confidence in Judge Long to make that decision, declaring immediately before the penalty phase that \"I trust and have faith in you, whatever your decision is.\" Second, Daniels consistently employed the same strategy throughout the trial. He contested no part of the prosecution's case and presented no argument, leaving the outcome in the hands of the judge. Before the penalty phase began, Daniels was again offered the services of counsel, either appointed or advisory, and an investigator, as well as additional time to prepare a penalty phase defense. He declined. Empaneling a jury for the penalty phase trial would have required that the bulk of the guilt phase evidence be presented again, undermining Daniels's desire to bring closure to the case and not further burden the victims and their surviving family members. As with the guilt phase, an advisement regarding the normative role of the jury in selecting penalty would not have made Daniels's waiver materially more informed in light of the strategy he employed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-321\">\n    It is always possible to elaborate on the extent of a right being waived. When asked if he waives his right to counsel, a defendant could be told that a\n    lawyer must have a law degree, pass the bar examination, and take continuing legal education courses. But such granular detail has never been required in order to support the\n    conclusion that the waiver of counsel is properly made.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-322\">\n    So too here. Regarding the right to a jury, a defendant could be told that the jury will be instructed on the law, will deliberate in private, can discuss the case with no one,\n    receives no outside information, selects one of their group to act as foreperson, and can be polled before a verdict is recorded. My colleagues in the plurality select a few items from the menu of possibilities and would require that they be mentioned under penalty of verdicts being reversed 16 years after the fact. Settled precedent rejects such a rigid rule, and correctly so. Under the totality of the circumstances and based on a clear and extensive record, I would find that Daniels entered a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to a jury trial on the issues of guilt, special circumstances, and penalty.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-323\">\n    We Concur:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-324\">\n    Cantil-Sakauye, C.J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-325\">\n    Chin, J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-326\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION BY KRUGER, J.

The court itself supplied no information on the subject,\n    nor did it confirm that defendant had received such information elsewhere-for example, from a written advisement (which defendant did not receive) or from counsel (which defendant, who was then self-represented, did not have).

The omission is particularly striking given the seriousness of the charges and the penalties defendant faced. (See\n    <em>\n     Patton v.

U.S. ex rel.

My agreement on this point rests primarily on the indications in the record that defendant's overarching aim throughout the proceedings was simply to accept responsibility for the charged crimes. (See conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Corrigan, J.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 824-825, 400 P.3d at pp. 424-425.) Defendant's manifest desire was to plead guilty (which, of course, would also have entailed waiving his right to jury trial). Once he was prevented from doing so, defendant attempted to accept responsibility by the means that remained available to him. Consistent with that aim, he discharged his lawyer, declined to question prosecution witnesses, and presented no defense. As he told the probation officer, he \" 'felt it would be unfair to the victims and their surviving family members for him to attempt to fight these charges, knowing he was guilty of each of the crimes.' \" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at p. 820, 400 P.3d at p. 421.) His choice to waive his right to jury trial on the substantive charges was of a piece with his general approach to the trial on guilt that he did not want in the first place.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    The high court has made clear, at least in similar contexts, that the information a defendant must possess to make an intelligent waiver can vary from case to case.

Unlike most jury waivers, defendant's waiver as to guilt and special circumstances was plainly not made with an eye to \"self-protect[ion],\" or to secure any litigation \"advantages.\" (\n    <em>\n     Adams\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 317 U.S. at p. 278,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"303755\" index=\"533\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/269/#p278\">\n     63 S.Ct. 236\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) As such, while an express advisement about the fundamental attributes of jury trial might have made even clearer to defendant the protection that a jury might afford, there is every indication that he did not want that protection at his trial on the substantive\n    charges-and that additional advisements on that point, if anything, would have simply reinforced his resolve to waive a jury trial. Our examination of \"the totality of the circumstances\" (\n    <em>\n     Sivongxxay\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 3 Cal.5th at p. 167,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513544\" index=\"534\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/265/#p170\">\n     219 Cal.Rptr.3d 265\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513544\" index=\"535\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/265/#p170\">\n     396 P.3d 424\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ) cannot ignore this one.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-332\">\n    The record provides no comparable indication with respect to defendant's penalty phase waiver, however. Although the record clearly reflects defendant's desire to accept legal responsibility for his crimes by pleading guilty, the record does not reflect that defendant affirmatively sought the penalty he received. True, defendant did not put on his own case in mitigation. But when the People rested at the penalty phase, defendant asked the court for a few days to use the law library. When proceedings resumed, defendant apologized to the families of Carolina and McCoy, admitting his crimes against the deceased and expressing \"deep remorse and sadness.\" (Conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Cu\u00e9llar, J., 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at 786, 400 P.3d at p. 392.) Based on this record, it is unclear what defendant hoped to achieve at the penalty phase. I therefore cannot conclude that information about the fundamental attributes of a jury trial would have been irrelevant to, or merely confirmatory of, defendant's choice to waive a penalty phase jury. Nor do I think it clear, on this record, that defendant already understood these attributes. The penalty phase of a capital trial is \"the only context in which California law authorizes a jury to decide the appropriate punishment for a criminal offense.\" (\n    <em>\n     Sivongxxay\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 3 Cal.5th at p. 213,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513544\" index=\"536\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/265/#p170\">\n     219 Cal.Rptr.3d 265\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513544\" index=\"537\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/265/#p170\">\n     396 P.3d 424\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Liu, J.).) None of the decade-old advisements defendant received in connection with earlier criminal cases touched on the characteristics of a\n    penalty phase jury (cf.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513544\" index=\"538\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/265/#p170\">\n      ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ), and there is little reason to think that those characteristics would be \" 'obvious to an accused' \" (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Corrigan, J., at pp. 821-822, 400 P.3d at p. 422, quoting\n    <em>\n     Tovar\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 541 U.S. at p. 90,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3633280\" index=\"539\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/77/#p88\">\n     124 S.Ct. 1379\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ).

I discuss this fact in further detail below. Here, I note that my colleagues suggest\n     <em>\n      DeRobertis\n     </em>\n     \"reinforces an important principle: Courts generally rely on counsel to transmit to defendants critical information about whether to waive the jury trial right and the consequences of waiving it....\" (Conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Cu\u00e9llar, J.,\n     <em>\n      ante\n     </em>\n     , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 806, 400 P.3d at p. 409.) Notably, however, the Seventh Circuit accepted the defendant's representation, supported by affidavit, that counsel\n     <em>\n      had not informed him\n     </em>\n     of his right to participate in jury selection and his right to be convicted only upon a substantial majority vote of the jurors. (\n     <em>\n      DeRobertis\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1882281\" index=\"552\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/715/1174/#p1180\">\n       supra\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1882281\" index=\"552\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/715/1174/#p1180\">\n      ,\n     </extracted-citation>\n     715 F.2d at pp. 1177, 1181.) It held that \"\n     <em>\n      counsel does not have to inform a client of all of the legal and procedural knowledge which forms the basis of his professional advice\n     </em>\n     .\" (\n     <em>\n      Id\n     </em>\n     . at p. 1182, italics added.) Instead, what the\n     <em>\n      DeRobertis\n     </em>\n     court found significant was that counsel had advised his client to waive a jury trial, and that the defendant had followed that advice. (\n     <em>\n      Id\n     </em>\n     . at pp. 1180, 1182-1183.) While Daniels did not have counsel's advice, he was aware of the core aspects of\n     <em>\n      his choice\n     </em>\n     . It is also worth noting that counsel's absence resulted from Daniels's affirmative choice to represent himself as he was constitutionally entitled to do. (\n     <em>\n      Faretta v.

To the extent they suggest Daniels was cajoled into the idea, the record establishes otherwise. The actual exchange was as follows: \"THE COURT: The other question I might raise with you is do you intend to proceed in terms of the guilt phase, and if there is a penalty phase,\n     <em>\n      by way of jury trial or by way of court trial?\n     </em>\n     [\u00b6] MR. DANIELS: Court trial.\" (Italics added.) By advising the self-represented defendant of his options, the court in no way initiated a waiver, or intimated that Daniels should choose one option over the other.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-344\">\n     For this reason, it is beside the point that many Americans do not have even a basic understanding of civics.

Daniels was no neophyte to the workings of the criminal justice system. He received an individualized tutorial on the topic in San Francisco's Hall of Justice.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-345\">\n     Moreover, the relevant studies documenting this point are too generic to be illuminating. (Conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Liu, J.,\n     <em>\n      ante\n     </em>\n     , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 813-814, 400 P.3d at pp. 414-415.) The studies note such things as (1) 31 percent of Americans cannot name a single branch of government (Annenberg Public Policy Center,\n     <em>\n      Americans' Knowledge of the Branches of Government Is Declining\n     </em>\n     (Sept. 13, 2006) &lt; http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/americans-knowledge-of-the-branches-of-government-is-declining/&gt; [as of Aug. 31, 2017] ); (2) 75 percent of Americans do not know the function of the judicial branch (Greene,\n     <em>\n      Study: One in Three Americans Fails Naturalization Civics Test\n     </em>\n     (Apr. 30, 2012) U.S. News &amp; World Report &lt; https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2012/04/30/study-one-in-three-americans-fails-naturalization-civics-test&gt; [as of Aug. 31, 2017] ); and (3) 50 percent of high school seniors cannot state the function of the United States Supreme Court (Kahne et. al., Constitutional Rights Foundation, The California Survey of Civic Education (2005) p. 8).
