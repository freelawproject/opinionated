When the claim was denied, she commenced the instant action against defendant and defendants Does Nos. 2-20. She alleged that latent memories of the sexual abuse resurfaced in early 2012, when she was about 34 years old. As explained below, before suing a public entity, one must generally present a timely claim to that entity. The question before us whether the 2012 claim concerning abuse that allegedly occurred from 1993 to 1994 was timely. The Court of Appeal found the claim timely. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A similar issue was before us in\n   <em>\n    Shirk v.

In arguing the claim was timely, the plaintiff relied primarily on the legislation that had revived causes of action for childhood sexual molestation that were otherwise barred under the applicable statute of\n   limitations. ( Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 340.1 ( section 340.1 ).) As explained in greater detail in\n   <em>\n    Shirk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 42 Cal.4th at pages 207-208,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20210\">\n    64 Cal.Rptr.3d 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=164%20P.3d%20630\">\n    164 P.3d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , section 340.1 as it existed at the time of the molestation and as subsequently amended between 1990 and 2002 both expanded the statute of limitations for childhood sexual molestation and revived some causes of action that had already lapsed.

We held that section 340.1 did not affect that deadline. We focused on the language of section 340.1, subdivision (c), which revived certain claims for damages \"that would otherwise be barred as of January 1, 2003,\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired.\" (\n   <em>\n    Shirk\n   </em>\n   , at p. 211,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20210\">\n    64 Cal.Rptr.3d 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=164%20P.3d%20630\">\n    164 P.3d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting \u00a7 340.1, subd.

As explained earlier ... the government claim presentation deadline is not a statute of limitations. Had the Legislature intended to also revive in subdivision (c) the claim presentation deadline under the government claims statute, it could have easily said so. It did not.

Requiring a person\n   allegedly harmed by a public entity to first present a claim to the entity, before seeking redress in court, affords the entity an opportunity to promptly remedy the condition giving rise to the injury, thus minimizing the\n   risk of similar harm to others. [Citations.] The requisite timely claim presentation before commencing a lawsuit also permits the public entity to investigate while tangible evidence is still available, memories are fresh, and witnesses can be located. [Citations.] Fresh notice of a claim permits early assessment by the public entity, allows its governing board to settle meritorious disputes without incurring the added cost of litigation, and gives it time to engage in appropriate budgetary planning. [Citations.] The notice requirement under the government claims statute thus is based on a recognition of the special status of public entities, according them greater protections than nonpublic entity defendants, because unlike nonpublic defendants, public entities whose acts or omissions are alleged to have caused harm will incur costs that must ultimately be borne by the taxpayers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Shirk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 42 Cal.4th at p. 213,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20210\">\n    64 Cal.Rptr.3d 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=164%20P.3d%20630\">\n    164 P.3d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We have reiterated these policies more recently. \" 'The claims statutes also \"enable the public entity to engage in fiscal planning for potential liabilities and to avoid similar liabilities in the future.\" ' \" (\n   <em>\n    DiCampli-Mintz v.

The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   was exposed to asbestos from the early 1940s to 1963. He was diagnosed with asbestosis in 1979, but was not disabled. His conditioned worsened, and he filed suit against various asbestos manufacturers in 1993. In 1996, he was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a form of cancer that is also caused by exposure to asbestos. He then filed a second suit against the asbestos manufacturers. At issue was whether Code of Civil Procedure section 340.2, subdivision (a)'s statute of limitations barred the second suit. We held that the suit was not time-barred. We explained: \"Although section 340.2 applies only to actions for injury or illness arising from asbestos exposure, the statute does not make the limitations period run from the date of that injury or illness or its discovery, as similar statutes commonly provide.

This reasoning, in my view, reflects a misunderstanding of Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1 (hereafter section 340.1 ) and its relationship to the statutes that regulate the government-claims process ( Gov.

Two years earlier, the court in\n   <em>\n    DeRose\n   </em>\n   had held a claim based on sexual abuse accrued immediately based on a simplistic analogy to the law of assault, under which a touching \"perceived as unconsented to and offensive ... causes harm as a matter of law.\" (\n   <em>\n    DeRose\n   </em>\n   , at p. 1018,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=242%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20368\">\n    242 Cal.Rptr. 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n   <em>\n    DeRose\n   </em>\n   met with harsh criticism in the Legislature, which was informed that psychological evidence showed \"most victims of childhood sexual abuse either repress their memories of the abuse or are unable to appreciate\n   their injuries until well into their adult years.\" (Sen.

The arcane difference between tolling and delayed accrual makes little or no difference to plaintiffs who are suing private parties. But someone suing a public entity must present a claim within six months after his or her cause of action accrues or the claim is lost. ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 911.2, subd. (a).) By construing section 340.1 as a tolling statute, while at the same time applying\n   the deprecated rule that claims for childhood sexual abuse accrue at the time of the abuse (maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 765, 400 P.3d at pp. 375-376), the majority offers public entities the practical equivalent of immunity in the very set of cases that prompted the Legislature to amend section 340.1 -cases in which the psychological harm caused by childhood sexual abuse is first discovered in adulthood. This result cannot fairly be attributed to the Legislature, which amended section 340.1 over the strong objection of public school districts. (See Nancy Bourne, Breon, O'Donnell &amp; Miller, letter to Assembly Member Phillip Isenberg, Aug. 9, 1989 [\"The burden on a defendant such as a public school teacher to prove he/she did not commit child abuse 30 years after the fact is insurmountable.\"]; see also Nancy Bourne, Breon, O'Donnell, Miller, Brown &amp; Dannis, letter to all Assembly Members, May 2, 1990 [same].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Section 340.1 is most naturally read as delaying the accrual of claims for sexual abuse rather than tolling the statute of limitations. The section sets \"the time for commencement of the action\" by reference to \"the date the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered that psychological injury or illness occurring after the age of majority was caused by the sexual abuse....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , subd. (a).)

Multiple legislative committee reports explained the bill \"\n   <em>\n    would expressly provide for delayed discovery accrual\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 108,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at p. 2, as amended Feb. 6, 1989, italics added; see Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 108 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) March 31, 1989, p. 1 [same]; Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 108 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 20, 1990, p. 2 [same].) An enrolled bill report provided to the Governor before he signed the legislation also describes the proposed legislation as \"provid[ing] for delayed discovery accrual....\" (Cal. Off. of Crim. Justice Planning, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 108 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) prepared for Governor Deukmejian (Aug. 28, 1990) p. 1; see\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at p. 2 [same].) One may infer the Legislature appreciated the distinction between delayed accrual and tolling because the proposed legislation was described as \"expressly\n   provid[ing] for\n   <em>\n    delayed discovery accrual\n   </em>\n   ,\" while then-existing law ( Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 352 ) was described as \"\n   <em>\n    toll\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    ing\n   </em>\n   ] statutes of limitations during a plaintiff's minority.\" (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 108,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at p. 2, italics added.) In the entire legislative history, only a single sentence in a single report uses the language of tolling to describe the effect of the proposed amendment to section 340.1. (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. on Sen. Bill\n   No. 108 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 21, 1989, p. 6 [under the proposed amendment to section 340.1, \"the running of the statute of limitation could be tolled indefinitely\"].) But this report does not mention or reject the commonly expressed understanding that the amendment would in fact delay accrual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Various public policies affecting the government claims process play a strong role in the majority's analysis. (See maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 768-770, 400 P.3d at pp. 378-379; cf.\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 763-764, 400 P.3d at pp. 374-375.) Those policies logically inform our interpretation of the statutes that regulate the claims process. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 900 et seq. ) But the same policies do not logically or legitimately inform the interpretation of generally applicable statutes of limitations such as section 340.1. This is because the Legislature has declared that the date on which a claim accrues,\n   for purposes of the claims process, \"is the date upon which the cause of action would be deemed to have accrued within the meaning of the statute of limitations which would be applicable thereto\n   <em>\n    if there were no requirement that a claim be presented to and be acted upon by the public entity before an action could be commenced thereon\n   </em>\n   .\" ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 901, italics added.) To construe section 340.1 as tolling the statute of limitations instead of delaying its accrual-\n   <em>\n    in order to serve the policies underlying the claims process\n   </em>\n   -is inconsistent with the Legislature's decision to allow generally applicable law to determine the date of accrual. ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 901.) In other words, section 901 expressly disallows accrual rules that are specific to the government claims process, such as the majority's novel pronouncement that section 901 refers to accrual \" 'in the ripeness sense.' \" (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at p. 767, 400 P.3d at p. 377.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The majority makes the same mistake by invoking Government Code section 905, subdivision (m), as support for its interpretation of section 340.1. (See maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 768-770, 400 P.3d at pp. 378-379.) Section 905 categorically exempts plaintiffs who sue public entities for childhood sexual abuse from the need to submit claims. Because this law applies \"only to claims arising out of conduct occurring on or after January 1, 2009\" ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 905, subd. (m) ), the majority describes the amendment as showing a legislative concern about the financial impact on governmental entities of older claims like that of plaintiff Rubenstein. (See Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 768-769, 400 P.3d at pp. 378-379.) The Legislature is presumably always concerned with the public treasury. But despite that proper concern, the Legislature has not modified the statutory rule that claims accrue against public entities at the same time they would accrue as \"\n   <em>\n    if there were no requirement that a claim be presented\n   </em>\n   ....\" ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 901, italics added.) Accordingly, the only reasonable interpretation of section 905, subdivision (m), is that it does not affect the accrual of claims based on pre-1990 conduct. (See\n   <em>\n    City of Pasadena v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (2017)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513658\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/220/99/#p1352\">\n    12 Cal.App.5th 1340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1352,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513658\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/220/99/#p1352\">\n    220 Cal.Rptr.3d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"Nor did the Legislature address the date of accrual for such claims.\"].)

The court did not dispose of that argument by interpreting 340.1 as tolling, rather than delaying the accrual, of claims.

Instead, she argues she has a single claim for all injuries caused by sexual molestation, and that section 340.1 delayed its accrual.\n   The majority tries to find some guidance in\n   <em>\n    Quarry\n   </em>\n   's treatment of\n   <em>\n    Shirk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673325\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/42/201/\">\n    42 Cal.4th 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20210\">\n    64 Cal.Rptr.3d 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=164%20P.3d%20630\">\n    164 P.3d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In other words, while \"the filing of an action for asbestos-related injury may be said ... to be an 'admission' that the cause of action has accrued in the ripeness sense, it is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   an admission that the limitations period of section 340.2 has simultaneously begun.\" (\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   , at p. 1145,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20701\">\n    95 Cal.Rptr.2d 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=998%20P.2d%20403\">\n    998 P.2d 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The majority asserts that section 340.2 is similar to section 340.1.

The Legislature expressly limited the application of section 340.2\"\n   <em>\n    to those causes of action which accrued prior to the change in the law\n   </em>\n   \" brought about by the enactment of section 340.2.

To interpret the statute as delaying the accrual of those claims was not an option. In this critical respect, section 340.1 differs from section 340.2. In 1990, when the Legislature amended section 340.1 to set \"the time for commencement of the action\" by reference to \"the date the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered that psychological injury or illness occurring after the age of majority was caused by the sexual abuse\" (\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., subd. (a)), the Legislature did not limit the amended statute's application to claims that had already accrued, as it did with section 340.2. More importantly, as already discussed (\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 763-764, 400 P.3d at pp. 374-375), the Legislature understood the 1990 amendment \"\n   <em>\n    would expressly provide for delayed discovery accrual\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Sen.

Prior judicial decisions unduly restricting sexual abuse victims' access to the courts have repeatedly led the Legislature to amend both section 340.1 and the\n   claims statutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This case suggests section 340.1 may require further clarification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   For all of these reasons I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We Concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Liu, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Cu\u00e9llar, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    At the time of the alleged molestation, the limitation period for plaintiff's claim was eight years following the age of majority (i.e., to age 26) \"or within three years of the date the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered that psychological injury or illness occurring after the age of majority was caused by the sexual abuse, whichever occurs later.\" (Former \u00a7 340.1, subd. (a), as amended by Stats.1990, ch. 1578, \u00a7 1, p. 7550.) As of that time, a plaintiff could not bring an action against a third party such as defendant. But in 1998, section 340.1 was amended to permit an action against certain third parties. The 1998 amendment provided that the limitations period within section 340.1, subdivision (a), applied \"for any of the following actions: [\u00b6] (1) An action against any person for committing an act of childhood sexual abuse. [\u00b6] (2) An action for liability against any person or entity who owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, where a wrongful or negligent act by that person or entity was a legal cause of the childhood sexual abuse which resulted in injury to the plaintiff. [\u00b6] (3) An action for liability against any person or entity where an intentional act by that person or entity was a legal cause of the childhood sexual abuse with resulted in the injury to the plaintiff.\" (Former \u00a7 340.1, subd. (a), as amended by Stats.1998, ch. 1032, \u00a7 1, p. 7785.) The 1998 amendments also provided that no claim against a third party \"may be commenced on or after the plaintiff's 26th birthday.\" (Former \u00a7 340.1, subd. (b), added by Stats. 1998, ch. 1032, \u00a7 1, p. 7785.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The most recent change to section 340.1 came in 2002, when defendant was still under the age of 26 years. This time, the Legislature amended section 340.1, subdivision (b), to provide that a plaintiff may bring a claim against a third party even after the plaintiff's 26th birthday \"if the person or entity knew or had reason to know, or was otherwise on notice, of any unlawful sexual conduct by an employee, volunteer, representative, or agent, and failed to take reasonable steps, and to implement reasonable safeguards, to avoid acts of unlawful sexual conduct in the future by that person, including, but not limited to, preventing or avoiding placement of that person in a function or environment in which contact with children is an inherent part of that function or environment.\" (\u00a7 340.1, subd. (b)(2), as amended by Stats. 2002, ch. 149, \u00a7 1, pp. 752-753.) Plaintiff relies on this theory in her lawsuit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    In sum, whenever plaintiff's claim came close to expiring, the Legislature expanded the statute of limitations.
