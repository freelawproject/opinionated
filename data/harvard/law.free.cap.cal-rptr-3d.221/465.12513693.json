(Gen. Elec. (Nov. 8, 2016) \u00a7 1.) The measure's various provisions are intended to facilitate the enforcement of judgments and achieve cost savings in capital cases. Petitioner Ron Briggs seeks writ relief from this court, challenging the constitutionality of certain aspects of the proposition. Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr., Attorney General Xavier Becerra, and the Judicial Council of California oppose the petition as respondents. They are joined by intervener Californians to Mend, Not End, the Death Penalty, a campaign committee representing the proponents of the initiative. The issues raised are of sufficient public importance to justify the exercise of our original jurisdiction in the interest of a prompt resolution. (\n   <em>\n    Legislature v. Eu\n   </em>\n   (1991)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1946378\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/54/492/#p500\">\n    54 Cal.3d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 500,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=286%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20283\">\n    286 Cal.Rptr. 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=816%20P.2d%201309\">\n    816 P.2d 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Petitioner asserts four grounds for relief. He claims Proposition 66 (1) embraces more than one subject, as prohibited by the California Constitution;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (2) interferes with the jurisdiction of California courts to hear original petitions for habeas corpus relief; (3) violates equal protection principles by treating capital prisoners differently from other prisoners with respect to successive habeas corpus petitions; and (4) runs afoul of the separation of powers doctrine by materially impairing the courts' ability to resolve capital appeals and habeas corpus petitions, and to manage their dockets in general.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Petitioner's constitutional challenges do not warrant relief. However, we hold that in order to avoid serious separation of powers problems, provisions of Proposition 66 that appear to impose strict deadlines on the resolution of judicial proceedings must be deemed directive rather than mandatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   I. THE TERMS OF PROPOSITION 66\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Proposition 66 includes a series of findings and declarations to the effect that California's death penalty system is inefficient, wasteful, and subject to protracted delay, denying murder victims and their families justice and due process. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 8, 2016) \u00a7 2, p. 212 (Voter Guide).) The measure enacts a series of statutory reforms, which may be grouped into three general categories: (1) provisions to expedite review in capital appeals and habeas corpus proceedings; (2) provisions governing the confinement of prisoners sentenced to death and the administration of the death penalty; and (3) provisions pertaining to California's Habeas Corpus Resource Center. Petitioner does not directly challenge each one of the measure's provisions. We summarize them all, however, as context for his claim that Proposition 66 unconstitutionally addresses more than one subject. (See part II.A,\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   .)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Expedited Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Proposition 66 amends Penal Code section 190.6 to give the Judicial Council 18 months to adopt rules and standards for expediting appeals and state habeas corpus review in capital cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ( \u00a7 190.6, subd. (d).) \"Within\n   five years of the adoption of the initial rules or the entry of judgment, whichever is later, the state courts shall complete the state appeal and the initial state habeas corpus review in capital cases.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .) The Judicial Council is\n   directed to monitor the review process and amend the rules and standards as necessary to complete proceedings within the five-year period. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Section 190.6, subdivision (b), an existing provision, sets a seven-month limit on the filing of the opening brief in a capital appeal, except upon a showing of good cause or when the trial transcript exceeds 10,000 pages. Subdivision (e) of section 190.6 is amended by Proposition 66 to provide that \"[t]he failure of the parties or of a court to comply with the time limit in subdivision (b) shall not affect the validity of the judgment or require dismissal of an appeal or habeas corpus petition. If a court fails to comply without extraordinary and compelling reasons justifying the delay, either party or any victim of the offense may seek relief by petition for writ of mandate. The court in which the petition is filed shall act on it within 60 days of filing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Section 1239.1 declares it the duty of this court to expedite review in capital cases. We must appoint counsel for indigent appellants as soon as possible, and grant extensions of time for briefing only \"for compelling or extraordinary reasons.\" (\u00a7 1239.1, subd. (a).) Proposition 66 calls on us and the Judicial Council to reevaluate the competency standards for appointed counsel in death penalty appeals and habeas corpus proceedings. \"Experience requirements shall not be limited to defense experience.\" ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 68665, subd. (b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The initiative measure extensively revamps the procedures governing habeas corpus petitions in capital cases. Under current practice, habeas corpus proceedings are initiated in this court, which appoints counsel and provides for their compensation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the initiative measure, however, \"[a] petition filed in any court other than the court which imposed the sentence should be promptly transferred to that court unless good cause is shown for the petition to be heard by another court. A petition filed in or transferred to the court which imposed the sentence shall be assigned to the original trial judge unless that judge is unavailable or there is other good cause to assign the case to a different judge.\" (\u00a7 1509, subd. (a).) The superior court is made responsible for appointing counsel to represent indigent prisoners in capital cases. (\u00a7 1509, subd. (b);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Gov. Code, \u00a7 68662, as amended by Prop. 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The initial habeas corpus petition must be filed within a year of the appointment of counsel. (\u00a7 1509, subd. (c).) An untimely initial petition, and any \"successive\" petition, \"shall be dismissed unless the court finds, by the preponderance of all available evidence, whether or not admissible at trial,\n   that the defendant is actually innocent of the crime of which he or she was convicted or is ineligible for the sentence.\" (\u00a7 1509, subd. (d).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Habeas corpus proceedings \"shall be conducted as expeditiously as possible, consistent with a fair adjudication. The superior court shall resolve the initial petition within one year of filing unless the court finds that a delay is necessary to resolve a substantial claim of actual innocence, but in no instance shall the court take longer than two years to resolve the petition.\" (\u00a7 1509, subd. (f).) The court must \"issue a statement of decision explaining the factual and legal basis for its decision.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .) Petitions that are pending in this court \"may\" be transferred to the sentencing court. (\u00a7 1509, subd. (g).)\n   Under existing law, there is no right to appeal from a superior court's\n   <em>\n    denial\n   </em>\n   of habeas corpus relief. The petitioner may obtain review by filing a new petition in a higher court. (\n   <em>\n    In re Reed\n   </em>\n   (1983)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4636295\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/33/914/#p918\">\n    33 Cal.3d 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 918, fn. 2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=191%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20658\">\n    191 Cal.Rptr. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=663%20P.2d%20216\">\n    663 P.2d 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The People have a statutory right to appeal a\n   <em>\n    grant\n   </em>\n   of relief in a capital case directly to this court, under section 1506. Proposition 66 alters these procedures by permitting either party to take an appeal from a superior court's decision on an initial habeas corpus petition to the court of appeal, and by specifying that \"[a] successive petition shall not be used as a means of reviewing a denial of habeas relief.\" (\u00a7 1509.1, subd. (a).) The issues on appeal are limited to those raised below, and to claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel if habeas counsel's failure to raise such claims itself constituted ineffective assistance. (\u00a7 1509.1, subd. (b).) To pursue an appeal from a denial of relief on a successive petition, the petitioner must obtain a certificate of appealability from the superior court or the court of appeal based on a substantial claim for relief pertaining to actual innocence or ineligibility for the death sentence. (\u00a7 1509.1, subd. (c).) Appeals under section 1509.1, subdivision (c) \"shall have priority over all other matters and be decided as expeditiously as possible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Conditions of Confinement and Administration of the Death Penalty\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Proposition 66 requires that prisoners sentenced to death perform work in prison and pay 70 percent of their wages and other trust account funds toward restitution. (\u00a7 2700.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The measure amends section 3600 to allow the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (the Department) to house male prisoners under a sentence\n   of death in any California prison that the Department finds will \"provide a level of security sufficient for that inmate. The inmate shall be returned to the prison designated for execution of the death penalty after an execution date has been set.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Department\n   must \"maintain at all times the ability to execute\" a judgment of death. (\u00a7 3604, subd. (e).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Section 3604.1 provides an exemption from the Administrative Procedure Act ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 11340 et seq. ) for \"standards, procedures, or regulations\" governing administration of the death penalty. (\u00a7 3604.1, subd. (a).) It also permits execution by lethal injection to be carried out by means other than intravenous, \"if the warden determines that the condition of the inmate makes intravenous injection impractical.\" (\u00a7 3604.1, subd. (b).) The sentencing court is given exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to the method of execution. Such claims must be dismissed if delayed without good cause. If the method is found invalid, the court is to order the use of a valid method. If a federal court enjoins use of a method of execution, the Department must, within 90 days, adopt a method conforming to federal requirements. (\u00a7 3604.1, subd. (c).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Section 3604.3, subdivision (a) authorizes physicians to attend executions for the purposes of pronouncing death and assisting the Department in developing protocols. Physicians and other licensed health care professionals are protected against disciplinary proceedings for any actions authorized by section 3604.3. (\u00a7 3604.3, subd. (c).) The purchase of medical supplies and equipment used in executions is exempted from the provisions of the Pharmacy Law ( Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 4000 et seq. ). (\u00a7 3604.3, subd. (b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Habeas Corpus Resource Center\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Habeas Corpus Resource Center provides counsel, investigative staff, and experts for prisoners in capital habeas corpus proceedings. Currently the center is governed by a five-member board of directors chosen by the Appellate Projects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The board appoints an executive director, who is confirmed by the California Senate. (Gov. Code, former \u00a7 68664.) Proposition 66 modifies the\n   governance of the center \"to expedite the completion of state habeas corpus proceedings in capital cases, and to provide quality representation in state habeas corpus for inmates sentenced to death.\" ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 68660.5.)\n   The initiative measure abolishes the center's board of directors, and authorizes this court to appoint its executive director. ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 68664, subd. (b).) Salaries for the executive director and the center's attorneys are set at the levels of comparable positions at the office of the State Public Defender. ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 68664, subd. (e).) Government Code section 68661, subdivisions (g) and (h) are amended to specify that the center's role is limited to habeas corpus representation. It may not engage in other litigation or expend funds on any other form of advocacy. ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 68661.1, subd. (b).) Government Code section 68661, subdivision (\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ) is amended to require that the center's annual report list all cases in which it is providing representation. In cases that have been pending for more than a year, the center must state reasons for the delay and identify remedial actions. Government Code section 68661.1, subdivision (a) imposes limits on the center's representation in federal habeas corpus proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We consider only the objections raised by the amended and renewed petition before us. \"We have no occasion at\n   this time to consider other possible attacks,\" and \"except as necessary to resolve the basic questions before us, we do not consider in this case possible interpretive or analytical problems\" that might arise from the measure in the future.

VI, \u00a7 10.) Article VI, section 11 governs appellate jurisdiction. Generally, the courts of appeal have jurisdiction over appeals when the superior courts have original jurisdiction, with one exception: \"The Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction when judgment of death has been pronounced.\" ( Art. VI, \u00a7 11, subd. (a).) These provisions deal with jurisdiction in its most fundamental sense: the power of a court to hear and decide a case. (See 2 Witkin, Cal.

Petitioner also argues that section \u00a7 1509.1, subdivision (a) deprives this court of its exclusive appellate jurisdiction in capital cases under article VI, section 11, by requiring appeals in habeas corpus cases to be taken to the courts of appeal.

Under section 1509, subdivision (a), a habeas corpus petition filed in a court other than the sentencing court must be transferred to the sentencing court unless there is good cause for another court to hear it. Section 3604.1, subdivision (c) modifies this procedure in one respect: it precludes the transfer of habeas corpus claims regarding execution methods to a superior court other than the sentencing court.

The People, on the other hand, have a statutory right to appeal from a superior court's grant of relief on habeas corpus.

Such a characterization of the interest at stake is overly broad. The question is whether capital and noncapital prisoners are similarly situated for purposes of section 1509's\n   restrictions on the filing of successive petitions. Proponents point out that in California only capital prisoners are guaranteed postconviction counsel and funds for investigation, and thus they are better able than noncapital prisoners to present a comprehensive initial habeas corpus petition.

Accordingly,\n   the provisions of Proposition 66 imposing a duty on this court to \"expedite the review\" of capital cases, appoint counsel \"as soon as possible,\" and grant extensions of time for briefing only for \"compelling or extraordinary reasons\" (\u00a7 1239.1, subd. (a)) are within the ordinary range of legislative authority. The same is true for provisions that require superior courts to conduct habeas corpus proceedings \"as expeditiously as possible\" ( \u00a7 1509, subd. (f) ), and that declare it a purpose of the statutes governing the Habeas Corpus Resource Center \"to expedite the completion of state habeas corpus proceedings in capital cases\" ( Gov.

We conclude, therefore, that sections 595 and 1054.1 are unconstitutional to the extent they purport to be mandatory, and should continue to be treated as directory, subject to a trial court's discretion as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Thurmond\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Thus, our case law establishes that while the Legislature has broad authority to regulate procedure, the constitutional separation of powers does not permit statutory restrictions that would materially impair fair adjudication or unduly restrict the courts' ability to administer justice in an orderly fashion. Repeatedly, for over 80 years, California courts have held that statutes may not be given mandatory effect, despite mandatory phrasing, when strict enforcement would create constitutional problems. Section 190.6 raises similar concerns. The statute is framed in mandatory terms, and the voters were told in the ballot materials that the five-year limit on the posttrial review process would be binding and enforceable. On the other hand, both proponents and the Attorney General contended at oral argument that the five-year limit should not be given mandatory effect, but should instead be understood as largely aspirational. They urge that the limit may be seen as\n   providing a frame of reference for the initiative's specific reforms designed to expedite the review process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Petitioner disagrees. He contends the enforcement provisions of section 190.6, subdivision (e) show that the review limit was meant to be mandatory. In his view, a five-year limit on posttrial proceedings is not only impracticable, but also invades the courts' inherent authority to balance the matters before them in a way that is fair to all litigants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   On balance, we conclude it is best to accept the Attorney General's and intervener's concession that the five-year limit is not mandatory. We do so for two reasons. First, regardless of how the ballot materials characterized the five-year review limit, section 190.6, subdivision (e) provides no effective mechanism to enforce the limit. It states: \"The failure of the parties or of a court to comply with the time limit in subdivision (b) shall not affect the validity of the judgment or require dismissal of an appeal or habeas corpus petition. If a court fails to comply without extraordinary and compelling reasons justifying the delay, either party or any victim of the offense may seek relief by petition for writ of mandate. The court in which the petition is filed shall act on it within 60 days of filing. Paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 28 of Article I of the California Constitution, regarding standing to enforce victims' rights, applies to this subdivision and subdivision (d).\" ( \u00a7 190.6, subd. (e).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Notably, the time limit for which section 190.6, subdivision (e) authorizes a writ remedy is not the five-year limit on judicial review imposed by subdivision (d). It is the briefing time limit provided in section 190.6, subdivision (b), which states, as it long has, \"in all cases in which a sentence of death has been imposed on or after January 1, 1997, the opening appellate\n   brief in the appeal to the State Supreme Court shall be filed no later than seven months after the certification of the record for completeness ... or receipt by the appellant's counsel of the completed record, whichever is later, except for good cause.\" Proponents assert that section 190.6, subdivision (e)'s reference to subdivision (b) was a drafting error. They claim they meant to refer to subdivision (d). But it is not clear that the reference to subdivision (b) in subdivision (e) was merely a typographical error. Well before Proposition 66 was adopted, section 190.6 provided that the failure of the parties or the court to comply with the deadline for filing the opening brief in the automatic appeal shall not affect the validity of the judgment.

A party or victim would then be authorized to \"seek relief by petition for writ of mandate\" \"[i]f a court\n   fails to comply\" with the requirement that \"the state appeal and initial state habeas corpus review\" be completed within five years. ( \u00a7 190.6, subds. (d) &amp; (e).) However, serious problems would arise from such a provision. Section 190.6, subdivision (e) contemplates relief by petition for writ of mandate if \"\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   court fails to comply.\" (Italics added.) Yet no\n   <em>\n    single\n   </em>\n   court is in a position to comply with a comprehensive five-year limit on the resolution of all posttrial proceedings in capital cases. The review process includes both direct appeals to this court and habeas corpus proceedings that begin in the trial court and advance to the courts of appeal for appellate review. Meeting such a deadline requires the coordination of efforts by multiple courts and other actors. This court as well as the superior courts must appoint counsel. All three levels of the state courts must supervise briefing schedules and decide the legal issues presented to them. Counsel on both sides must meet their obligations to represent the interests of their clients in competent and timely fashion. The Legislature must provide funding sufficient for the superior courts to meet their greatly expanded responsibilities under Proposition 66, and for this court and the courts of appeal to expedite review in capital cases without neglecting the other matters before them.

Likewise here, section 190.6, subdivision (d) begins with a declaration that \"[t]he right of victims of crime to a prompt and final conclusion, as provided in paragraph\n   (9) of subdivision (b) of Section 28 of Article I of the California Constitution, includes the right to have judgments of death carried out\n   <em>\n    within a reasonable time\n   </em>\n   .\" ( \u00a7 190.6, subd. (d), italics added.) This language makes it clear that the electorate did not intend to impose an\n   <em>\n    unreasonable\n   </em>\n   limit. The five-year period may be understood to express the voters' view of what would ordinarily constitute \"a reasonable time\" for completing review proceedings. However, courts must make individualized decisions based on the circumstances of each case. They retain discretion over the time required to resolve particular matters, and over the management of their dockets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Similar considerations apply to section 1509, subdivision (f)'s time limits for superior court rulings on initial habeas corpus petitions. Petitioner offers little argument supporting his challenge to this provision, but the Habeas Corpus Resource Center, in an amicus curiae brief, contends the statute's one and two-year limits are too short for counsel and the courts to adequately perform their functions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again we observe that no issue is raised by this petition concerning the infringement of an individual prisoner's rights in a particular case. Such claims remain open. Here we consider only the effect of the time limits on judicial functions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The limits in section 1509, subdivision (f) are plainly directory, under\n   <em>\n    Garrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 32 Cal.2d at page 436,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"433\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=196%20P.2d%20884\">\n    196 P.2d 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No jurisdictional consequence\n   is provided if they are not met. Nor can these limits be deemed mandatory in any other sense, despite the unconditional language in which they are stated. There is no provision for their enforcement. The ballot materials did not portray them as rigid requirements. The Legislative Analyst explained that trial courts would \"generally ... have one year to make a decision on the petition.\" (Voter Guide,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , analysis of Prop. 66 by Legis. Analyst, p. 106.) The subject is not mentioned in the arguments for and against the measure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   We note that section 1509, subdivision (f) begins with a provision calling for proceedings to \"be conducted as expeditiously as possible,\n   <em>\n    consistent with a fair adjudication\n   </em>\n   .\" (Italics added.) As in\n   <em>\n    Engram\n   </em>\n   , \"the statute explicitly recognizes a court's fundamental and overriding obligation to administer the proceedings that are pending before it in a manner that is consistent with the ends of justice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Engram\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 50 Cal.4th at p. 1151,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"434\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20762\">\n    116 Cal.Rptr.3d 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"435\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=240%20P.3d%20237\">\n    240 P.3d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Therefore, \"the provision cannot properly be interpreted\n   as establishing an absolute or inflexible rule ... in total abrogation of a trial court's ultimate control or discretion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) If in a particular case the time limits imposed by section 1509, subdivision (f) are not \"consistent with a fair adjudication,\" as the statute requires, the voters signaled that the interest of fairness must prevail. Moreover, as with section 190.6, nothing in section 1509 suggests the voters contemplated that courts would neglect their other business in order to comply with the time limits. Proposition 66 presumes that the courts will have sufficient resources to manage their caseloads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Our conclusion that the time limits in sections 190.6, subdivision (d) and 1509, subdivision (f) are merely directive does not empty them of meaning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Legislated time limits can establish as a matter of policy that the proceedings they govern should be given \"as early a hearing and decision as orderly procedure ... will permit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Shafter-Wasco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 55 Cal.App.2d at p. 489,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"436\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20P.2d%20755\">\n    130 P.2d 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   They may serve as benchmarks to guide courts, if meeting the limits is reasonably possible. What is reasonably possible, however, will depend on a variety of factors, both structural and case-specific.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   It remains to be seen how effective the procedures enacted by Proposition 66 will be in expediting the capital posttrial review process. The time limits reflect the voters' will, which we respect. However, they were presented to the voters by the proponents of Proposition 66 without the benefit of hearings\n   or research exploring their feasibility or their impact on the rest of the courts' work. As the concurring opinion explains, these are issues of considerable complexity and difficulty. The implementation of Proposition 66 will necessarily be an ongoing process of exploration and adaptation. The Judicial Council is tasked with monitoring the review process established by the initiative. ( \u00a7 190.6, subd. (d).) Its supervision will shed light on the achievability and efficacy of the measure's extensive reforms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Much depends on the funding made available by the Legislature. What cannot be permitted is the material impairment of judicial functions by any statute. The superior courts must be allowed to exercise their \"ultimate control or discretion over the order in which the cases pending before [them] should be considered\" (\n   <em>\n    Engram\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 50 Cal.4th at p. 1151,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"437\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20762\">\n    116 Cal.Rptr.3d 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"438\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=240%20P.3d%20237\">\n    240 P.3d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and to give each case the time required for reasoned decision. The courts of appeal may not be thwarted in the exercise of their original jurisdiction to review superior court judgments in all the cases brought before them. ( Art. VI, \u00a7 11, subd. (a).) Nor may this court be deprived of the ability to balance its responsibilities in capital cases with the other important role we have performed since the creation of the intermediate appellate courts: \"[T]o supervise and control the opinions of the several district courts of appeal, each of which is acting concurrently and independently of the others, and by such supervision to endeavor to secure harmony and uniformity in the decisions, their conformity to the\n   settled rules and principles of law, a uniform rule of decision throughout the state, a correct and uniform construction of the constitution, statutes, and charters, and, in some instances, a final decision by the court of last resort of some doubtful or disputed question of law.\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

However, we stayed the implementation of the measure pending our resolution of this matter. The effective date is a question of some importance, particularly for the Judicial Council, which is tasked with developing rules and standards \"[w]ithin 18 months of the effective date.\" ( \u00a7 190.6, subd. (d).) We also deem it desirable for all parties affected by the initiative measure to be allowed to strive for compliance in an efficient manner, unencumbered by considerations of retroactive application upon the dissolution of our stay. We have in the past exercised our inherent\n   power of reformation to revise the effective date of stayed legislation in order to avoid problems of compliance with statutory deadlines.

All members of the court agree that this provision imposes no legally enforceable obligation. My colleagues disagree on how they reach this conclusion: The court holds that the five-year provision is \"directive\" and not mandatory (maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 501-502, 400 P.3d at p. 59), whereas Justice Cu\u00e9llar's concurring and dissenting opinion contends that the provision is mandatory and unconstitutionally intrudes on the prerogatives of the judicial branch (conc. &amp; dis. opn.,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , at p. 525, 400 P.3d at p. 79).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    I believe both positions are reasonable. Like Justice Cu\u00e9llar, I find it stunning that Proposition 66's proponents and the Attorney General claim that the voters intended the five-year limit to be nonbinding or aspirational when that claim is plainly belied by the ballot materials and advocacy campaign for Proposition 66. (Conc. &amp; dis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    opn.,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 513-514, 518-521, 400 P.3d at pp. 69-70, 73-76.) However, the electorate passed Proposition 66 against a backdrop of precedent construing similar mandates as nonmandatory when necessary to save their constitutionality (maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at pp. 493-498, 400 P.3d at pp. 52-57), and we presume the electorate is \" 'aware of existing laws and judicial construction thereof' \" (\n    <em>\n     People v.

Although I am unsure whether I would construe voter intent as flexibly as our decisions have, I acknowledge this is one way of enforcing the separation of powers and there is a lot of water over the dam in our case law. So, although no one really disagrees that \"the voters intended the five-year limit to be mandatory\" (maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at p. 500, 400 P.3d at p. 59), our precedent supports the court's approach of imputing to the voters a further intent not to unconstitutionally impair the judicial function (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at p. 501-502, 400 P.3d at p. 59). All members of the court agree\n    that if the five-year limit were mandatory, it \"would undermine the courts' authority as a separate branch of government.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at p. 501, 400 P.3d at p. 59; conc. &amp; dis. opn.,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , at p. 528, 400 P.3d at pp. 81-82.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    I write separately to highlight that whether the five-year limit is directive or unconstitutional, it does not and could not bind those charged with implementing Proposition 66. It is clear that a majority of the 2016 electorate voted \"to shorten the time that the legal challenges to death sentences take.\" (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 8, 2016), analysis of Prop. 66 by Legis. Analyst, p. 105 (2016 Voter Guide).) But Proposition 66 contains no plan to compress into five years a process that often takes two decades, and no entity-not this court, not the Judicial Council, not the Legislature-can simply wave a magic wand and make it so. Although there may be ways to streamline the process, realistic reforms must emanate from a clear understanding of the way the postconviction death penalty process works in California. As explained below, the five-year limit is not grounded in the realities of California's death penalty process or in the reasonable possibilities for reform. Thus, in addition to lacking strict enforceability, the five-year limit cannot serve as a realistic benchmark to guide courts or the Judicial Council as they implement Proposition 66. It is instead \"an exhortation to the parties and the courts to handle cases as expeditiously as is consistent with the fair and principled administration of justice.\" (Maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 501, 400 P.3d at p. 59.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    <strong>\n     I.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    Today there are nearly 750 prisoners on death row in California; they comprise roughly a quarter of all condemned inmates in the United States. The process for reviewing\n    death judgments is complex and multilayered, and the incidence of reversible error is significant.

The defendant is also entitled to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to assert violations of statutory or constitutional rights not apparent in the trial record.

(2016 Voter Guide,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , analysis of Prop. 66 by Legis. Analyst, p. 105.) About half of those waiting for appointment of habeas counsel have been waiting for over 10 years. (\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n    , at p. 1058.) The dearth of attorneys willing to take on these assignments is due in part to the sheer enormity of the undertaking.

State habeas review is completed on average more than 17 years after the death judgment. (\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n    , at p. 1059.) In April 2016, there were 337 direct appeals and 263 state habeas corpus petitions pending in this court. (2016 Voter Guide,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , analysis of Prop. 66 by Legis. Analyst, p. 105.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    As of 2014, only 81 inmates out of the more than 900 sentenced to death in California since 1978 have completed the postconviction review process in both state and federal court.

Of those 81, about half have received relief from their death sentences, 13 have been executed, and 17 have had their executions stayed. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at p. 1069.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    In 2008, the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice (Commission) studied the death penalty postconviction process. (Cal. Com. on the Fair Admin. of Justice, Final Report (2008) (Commission Report).) The Commission was chaired by former Attorney General and Los Angeles District Attorney John Van De Kamp, and it included law enforcement officials, prosecutors, public defenders, and academics. The Commission held hearings and gathered input from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at p. 113.) The Commission made several recommendations to expedite what was widely regarded as a dysfunctional process. Recognizing that difficulties in appointing appellate counsel were a major source of delay, the Commission concluded that \"[t]he most direct and efficient way to reduce the backlog of death row inmates awaiting appointment of appellate counsel would be to\n    again expand the Office of the State Public Defender.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at p. 132.) The\n    Commission recommended increasing the State Public Defender's budget by one-third. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at p. 133.) In the alternative, the Commission recommended increasing the compensation of private appellate attorneys who take death penalty cases. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at pp. 132-133.) To address the even greater delays in appointing habeas counsel, the Commission recommended expanding the Habeas Corpus Resource Center from 34 lawyers to 150 lawyers, which would have required a five-fold increase over the then-current $14.9 million annual budget. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at p. 135.) These recommendations were not implemented.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    The Commission also addressed the backlog of death penalty appeals pending in this court. This court decides 20 to 25 death penalty appeals each year and issues a published opinion in each case. It typically takes two to three years for this court to decide an appeal once it has been fully briefed. (Commission Report, at p. 147.) The Commission endorsed the proposal of then Chief Justice Ronald George to amend the state Constitution so that this court would have discretion to transfer fully briefed death penalty appeals to intermediate appellate courts, provided that the Commission's recommendations for appointing appellate and habeas counsel were also implemented. (Commission Report, at pp. 147-148.) This court also decides approximately 30 habeas corpus petitions each year; although we do not typically issue published opinions in these cases, our deliberative process includes the preparation of lengthy internal memoranda carefully examining each issue raised in each petition. The Commission endorsed a proposal to allow capital habeas corpus petitions to be filed in superior court, with a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at p. 148.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    In 2013, a coalition of law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and crime victims proposed a ballot initiative, called the Death Penalty Reform and Savings Act of 2014 (2014 Proposed Initiative), that was similar in many ways to Proposition 66. The 2014 Proposed Initiative did not incorporate the Commission's proposals to expand the Office of the State Public Defender or the Habeas Corpus Resource Center. But it did include some of the other Commission recommendations. One of the Proposed Initiative's key provisions was an amendment of article VI, section 11, subdivision (a) of the California Constitution to provide that Courts of Appeal have appellate jurisdiction over death penalty cases, just as they have over other cases. (2014 Proposed Initiative, \u00a7 4.) Further, the 2014 Proposed Initiative would have added a new section to article VI authorizing this court to review Court\n    of Appeal decisions in capital cases and to summarily affirm if there are no errors affecting the judgment and there is no need to secure uniformity of law or address an important question of law. (2014 Proposed Initiative, \u00a7 5.) Also consistent with the Commission's recommendations, the 2014 Proposed Initiative would have added section 1509, subdivision (a), requiring that all habeas corpus petitions be transferred to the court imposing the capital sentence unless good cause is shown. These changes were intended to address one of the findings of the Proposed Initiative: \"The California Supreme Court is overloaded with death penalty appeals, causing lengthy and unnecessary delays. Spreading these death penalty cases among the Courts of Appeal (like the federal courts do) will allow the defendants' claims to be heard sooner. The Supreme Court has suggested a similar change. Experts have concluded this change will save hundreds of millions of dollars.\" (2014 Proposed Initiative, \u00a7 2 (7).)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    Moreover, the 2014 Proposed Initiative would have amended article I, section 27 of the California Constitution to add a provision\n    substantially similar to section 190.6, subdivision (d) ( section 190.6(d) ) as amended by Proposition 66. It would have provided that \"[s]tate courts shall complete the state appeal and initial state habeas corpus review\" within five years after entry of judgment or after adoption of Judicial Council rules to expedite the capital appeal process. (2014 Proposed Initiative, \u00a7 3.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    After some signature gathering, the initiative proponents decided to postpone the effort until 2016. (Nirappili,\n    <em>\n     Coalition Delays Initiative to Reform State Executions\n    </em>\n    , Mercury\n    News (May 11, 2014) p. B4.) Proposition 66, the result of that delayed effort, retains many of the features of the 2014 Proposed Initiative. But the proponents abandoned any effort to amend the California Constitution. (See Cal. Const., art. II, \u00a7 8, subd. (b) [requiring signatures equal to 8 percent of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election to place an initiative amending the state Constitution on the ballot, but only 5 percent for a statutory initiative].) In particular, Proposition 66 omitted the proposal to amend the state Constitution to give Courts of Appeal jurisdiction over direct appeals in capital cases, and it placed the five-year limit in a statute ( section 190.6(d) ) rather than in article I of the Constitution. Proposition 66 also omitted the 2014 Proposed Initiative's finding that this court is overloaded with death penalty appeals, but it retained the provision in section 1509, subdivision (a) to authorize transfer of capital habeas petitions to the superior court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    Proposition 66 does not increase the availability of appellate and habeas attorneys, beyond requiring this court to compel certain criminal appellate attorneys to take death penalty appeals against their will. (\u00a7 1239.1, subd. (b).) It is unclear how effective this strategy will be in light of the shrinking and graying pool of private appellate attorneys. (See Miller,\n    <em>\n     Wanted: Appellate Lawyer. Pay:$70/hr.\n    </em>\n    , The Recorder (June 15, 2006).) Although it is possible that compelling appellate attorneys to take capital cases will increase the number of capital appellate attorneys, it is also possible that this obligation will result in fewer criminal appellate attorneys or will lead to the appointment of attorneys ill-suited for the arduous and lengthy commitment required for a capital appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    Further, the new provision that this court \"shall only grant extensions of time for briefing for compelling or extraordinary reasons\" (\u00a7 1239.1, subd. (a)) may accelerate the filing of appellate briefs. But there are reasons why capital briefs are lengthier-opening briefs of 300 to 500 pages, raising 30 to 40 claims, are common-and often take several years to complete. Capital cases involve a three-stage process in which the jury must determine (1) whether the defendant is guilty of first degree murder, (2) whether certain special circumstances are present, and (3) whether the defendant should receive the death penalty or a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. (\u00a7\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a), 190.3; see e.g.,\n    <em>\n     People v. Masters\n    </em>\n    (2016)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454534\" index=\"541\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/62/1019/#p1027\">\n     62 Cal.4th 1019\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1027-1041,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"542\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=199%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2085\">\n     199 Cal.Rptr.3d 85\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"543\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20P.3d%20861\">\n     365 P.3d 861\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) Each of these stages may give rise to claims of legal error, and a labyrinth of procedural default and forfeiture rules strongly incentivizes capital defendants to raise every conceivable claim of error. (See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     In re Robbins\n    </em>\n    (1998)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"344170\" index=\"544\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/18/770/\">\n     18 Cal.4th 770\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 780,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"545\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20153\">\n     77 Cal.Rptr.2d 153\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"546\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=959%20P.2d%20311\">\n     959 P.2d 311\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     In re Clark\n    </em>\n    (1993)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1998547\" index=\"547\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/5/750/\">\n     5 Cal.4th 750\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 767-768,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"548\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20509\">\n     21 Cal.Rptr.2d 509\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"549\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=855%20P.2d%20729\">\n     855 P.2d 729\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     In re Waltreus\n    </em>\n    (1965)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2334088\" index=\"550\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/62/218/#p225\">\n     62 Cal.2d 218\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 225,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"551\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20Cal.%20Rptr.%209\">\n     42 Cal.Rptr. 9\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"552\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=397%20P.2d%201001\">\n     397 P.2d 1001\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     In reDixon\n    </em>\n    (1953)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12136279\" index=\"553\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/41/756/#p759\">\n     41 Cal.2d 756\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 759,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"554\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=264%20P.2d%20513\">\n     264 P.2d 513\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <extracted-citation index=\"555\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1).) In addition, the record in capital cases is usually massive, often comprising more than 5,000 pages of trial transcript plus several thousand pages of exhibits, juror questionnaires, and\n    additional materials-all of which must be carefully reviewed. Moreover, the irrevocable nature of the death penalty heightens the stakes and prompts appellate attorneys to be as thorough and careful as possible in their briefing. Whatever the statutory standard for granting extensions of time, attorneys must be given sufficient time to complete their briefs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    Even if these measures do accelerate the filing of an appeal in this court, Proposition 66, unlike the 2014 Proposed Initiative, does not increase the number of courts hearing death penalty appeals. Because of the sheer scale of the briefing, the enormity of the record, and the number of claims typically raised by each defendant, this court devotes considerable time and attention to capital appeals. We could increase the number of such appeals we resolve each year, but only at the expense of noncapital cases. As the court today makes clear, Proposition 66 cannot override the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers and compel this court to alter its docket by deciding more capital cases and fewer noncapital ones. (Maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at p. 501-502, 400 P.3d at 59 [construing \u00a7 190.6(d)\"to maintain the courts'\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    discretionary control over the conduct of their business\"].)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    Although transfer of capital habeas corpus petitions to the superior court may expedite the adjudication of those petitions, superior courts asked to help reduce this court's substantial backlog of habeas corpus cases will likely require additional resources to address petitions that are often as lengthy and time consuming as direct appeals. (See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     In re James David Beck\n    </em>\n    (filed Nov. 28, 2012, S206945) [320-page petition for writ of habeas corpus with 12 claims, numerous subclaims, and 18 volumes of exhibits].) It is unclear whether the Legislature will appropriate funds for this purpose. Nor does Proposition 66 expedite the appointment of capital habeas attorneys. And the constitutionality of Proposition 66's restrictions on successive petitions ( \u00a7 1509, subd. (b) ) has yet to be fully tested. (Maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 492-493, 400 P.3d at pp. 51-52.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    To put the postconviction process into perspective, let us consider a real example. A case not far from the norm is that of Robert Mark Edwards. He was convicted of first degree murder with burglary-murder and torture-murder special circumstances, and he was sentenced to death in September 1998. Counsel was appointed four years later in October 2002. Counsel filed a record correction motion in October 2003. The record correction process was completed, and a record of appeal filed in this court, in February 2005. The record consists of 29 volumes of the clerk's transcript, with a total of 9,117 pages; this includes 6,597 pages of juror questionnaires. The reporter's transcript, i.e., the transcript of the trial, spans 39 volumes with a total of 5,957 pages. The opening brief (431 pages) was filed in December 2006; the Attorney General's brief (270 pages) was filed in February 2008, and the reply brief (140 pages) was filed in November 2008. Also in November 2008, counsel had to withdraw because he was being appointed to the superior court. New counsel was appointed in January 2009 and, after getting up to speed on the case, filed a 79-page supplemental brief in September 2010. A supplemental respondent's brief was filed in March 2011, and a supplemental reply brief was filed in April 2011. Additional supplemental briefing was ordered by this court in December 2012 to address recently decided cases of this court and the United States Supreme Court; this briefing was filed in January 2013. Altogether, the briefing raised some 38 issues. The case was argued in May 2013, and the judgment was affirmed in August 2013. (\n    <em>\n     People v. Edwards\n    </em>\n    (2013)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054158\" index=\"556\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/57/658/\">\n     57 Cal.4th 658\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"557\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=161%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20191\">\n     161 Cal.Rptr.3d 191\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"558\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20P.3d%201049\">\n     306 P.3d 1049\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) Meanwhile, habeas corpus counsel was not appointed until November 2010, 12 years after the death judgment. A 524-page habeas corpus petition was filed in November 2013. The Attorney General's 187-page informal response was filed in October 2014, and a 433-page reply to the informal response was filed in December 2015. The petition remains pending in this court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    In Edwards's case, 19 years have passed since the judgment of death. The direct appeal has been completed, the state habeas corpus petition has not been decided, and the case has not yet begun its lengthy sojourn in federal\n    court. It is not clear how Proposition 66 would have appreciably accelerated the appointment of appellate or habeas counsel, shortened the record correction process, abbreviated the multiple rounds of briefing addressing numerous issues drawn from a voluminous trial record, or reduced the amount of time the fully briefed case was pending in this court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    In sum, the protracted nature of the postconviction death penalty process is the product of several factors, including chronic delays in appointing appellate and habeas counsel, limitations on funding for the Office of the State Public Defender and Habeas Corpus Resource Center, the enormity of the record and the scale of the parties' briefing in light of the peculiar nature of the death penalty, and the fact that all appeals go to a single court, inevitably resulting in a bottleneck.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    <strong>\n     II.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    Section 190.6(d), as amended by Proposition 66, provides: \"The right of victims of crime to a prompt and final conclusion, as provided in paragraph (9) of subdivision (b) of Section 28 of Article I of the California Constitution, includes the right to have judgments of death carried out within a reasonable\n    time.

Within five years of the adoption of the initial rules or the entry of judgment, whichever is later, the state courts shall complete the state appeal and the initial state habeas corpus review in capital cases.

That determination is contextual. In some cases, as in\n    <em>\n     Thurmond\n    </em>\n    , the directive statute can serve as a default that constrains judicial discretion unless certain conditions apply.

And\n    <em>\n     Shafter-Wasco\n    </em>\n    , in interpreting a statutory deadline as a directive \"to give this appeal as early a hearing and decision as orderly procedure in this court will permit\" (\n    <em>\n     Shafter-Wasco\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 55 Cal.App.2d at p. 489,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"579\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20P.2d%20755\">\n     130 P.2d 755\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ), said it was ultimately up to the\n    court to determine a reasonable timeframe for deciding the appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    Directive statutes that set realistic time limits on judicial decisions may inform how quickly cases should be decided, although the issue is ultimately\n    left to judicial discretion. But when a time limit purports to dictate what is not \"reasonably possible\" to achieve (maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 503, 400 P.3d at pp. 60-61), it cannot serve as a meaningful benchmark. Such is the case with the five-year time limit in section 190.6(d). The realities of California's postconviction death penalty process mean that without a radical reorganization of this court's functions, a restructuring of the role of lower courts beyond what Proposition 66 provides, and a significant infusion of resources from the Legislature, the five-year time limit is not remotely close to realistic.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    This impracticality is underscored by the fact that section 190.6(d) says nothing about how the five-year limit should be met. And this deficiency is compounded by the fact that section 190.6(d) differs from\n    other statutory deadlines in terms of its scope: The five-year limit does not require one particular court to meet a particular deadline in one particular proceeding; it is directed at a complex judicial process involving multiple courts, multiple actors, and multiple proceedings. (Maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 498-499, 400 P.3d at p. 57.) The five-year deadline imposed on the entire state death penalty postconviction process is so sweeping in its objective yet so vague on the means of accomplishing the objective that it does not provide useful guidance for those charged with implementing Proposition 66.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    Section 190.6(d) purports to delegate the challenge of meeting the five-year limit to the Judicial Council, which is supposed to \"continuously monitor the timeliness of review of capital cases and ... amend the rules and standards as necessary to complete the state appeal and initial state habeas corpus proceedings within the five-year period provided in this subdivision.\" But how is the Judicial Council supposed to bring about the vast acceleration of the death penalty process necessary to meet the five-year deadline? The Judicial Council has no authority to direct the Legislature to appropriate more funds to expand the Office of the State Public Defender or the Habeas Corpus Resource Center. It has no authority to change the state Constitution to permit Courts of Appeal to hear death penalty appeals. And it has no authority to require this court or any other court to devote a greater proportion of its docket to death penalty cases at the expense of other cases that fall within its constitutional responsibilities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    The delegation of broad rulemaking power to the Judicial Council spared the voters (and the proponents of Proposition 66) from having to make difficult choices as to what should be sacrificed for the sake of dramatically expediting the death penalty. But these are precisely the choices that the lawmaking authority, whether the Legislature or the electorate, must make with clarity, transparency, and fidelity to separation-of-powers principles if it wishes to create a mandate that can lawfully and practically guide the Judicial Council's quasi-legislative rulemaking. Such a mandate is lacking here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-190\">\n    Of course, section 190.6(d) is only one part of Proposition 66; the proponents of Proposition 66 stated at oral argument that the five-year limit \"is not the centerpiece\" of the initiative. Proposition 66 prescribes several specific reforms, such as a new rule for granting extensions of time for briefing (\u00a7 1239.1, subd. (a)), new rules concerning appointment of counsel (\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    ., subd. (b)), and a requirement that initial habeas corpus petitions be filed in or transferred to the sentencing court absent good cause ( \u00a7 1509, subds. (a), (g) ) with either party having a right to take an appeal to the Court of Appeal (\u00a7 1509.1, subd. (a)). The Judicial Council may prescribe rules to effectuate these provisions, and the efficacy of these measures in expediting the death penalty process remains to be seen.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-191\">\n    But whether Proposition 66 actually speeds up (or slows down) the process will have nothing to do with section 190.6(d)'s unelaborated and unrealistic directive that state death penalty appellate and habeas corpus proceedings \"shall\" be completed within five years. The court properly acknowledges that this provision reflects the voters' desire\n    to shorten the postconviction death penalty process. But the five-year limit, construed as directive or simply unconstitutional, has no binding effect and provides no guidance for responsible actors charged with the fair and efficient administration of justice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    We Concur: Werdegar, J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    Kruger, J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    Hoch, J.\n    <footnotemark>\n     *\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION BY CU\u00c9LLAR, J.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    Cu\u00e9llar, J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    What voters most need so they can exercise their constitutionally protected franchise effectively is clarity and candor. Particularly at a time when public discourse dwells on foreign interference in our electoral process, social media bots, and manipulated Facebook news feeds, it is possible-perhaps even easy-to forget how millions of voters endeavor to familiarize themselves with the candidates and issues of the day, and to understand the consequences of their vote. Voters who sought to do so by studying Proposition 66, the Death Penalty Reform and Savings Act of 2016 (Proposition 66), would not recognize the initiative the majority purports to uphold today. What reasonable voters would have clearly recognized instead-based on the statutory text, the official description by the Legislative Analyst, and the arguments made by the initiative's proponents-is that Proposition 66 contained a genuine, enforceable, five-year deadline for completion of the state court appeal and resolution of the initial habeas corpus petition in death penalty cases. Candor requires us to be equally clear about whether such a deadline accords with our law: It does not. A statutory limit on the amount of time a court may spend deciding a case is an intrusion on quintessential judicial functions and violates the California Constitution's separation of powers provision. (See Cal. Const., art. III, \u00a7 3.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    Only by misconstruing this mandatory five-year time limit as nothing more than an \"exhortation\" for faster death penalty adjudication does the majority sidestep this outcome. (Maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 501-502, 400 P.3d at p. 59.) In doing so, the majority disregards the electorate's clear purpose in enacting Proposition 66 and fails to promote forthright deliberation. It distorts our statutory and constitutional jurisprudence, and-by insisting the mandate be treated as both a mere \"exhortation\" yet one \"not empty\" of legal meaning-leaves in its wake grave uncertainty about the rules and standards the Judicial Council is supposed to adopt to render meaningful that exhortation. (Maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 501-502, 502-503, 400 P.3d at pp. 59, 60.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    Proposition 66 further runs afoul of the California Constitution by purporting to authorize an appeal to\n    <em>\n     the Court of Appeal\n    </em>\n    from the decision of a superior court on an initial capital habeas corpus petition. (See \u00a7 1509.1.) The Constitution grants\n    <em>\n     this\n    </em>\n    court exclusive appellate jurisdiction \"when judgment of death has been pronounced.\" ( Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 11, subd. (a).) To the extent the majority finds otherwise, I dissent with respect.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-200\">\n    I.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-201\">\n    Our first task is to answer a question as simple as it is important: What kind of time limit did the voters enact? When voters face the often daunting process of considering a new statute or constitutional amendment at the ballot box, state law directs the Secretary of State to prepare a voter information guide. The guide must include a complete copy of each proposed measure, the arguments and rebuttals for and against, and an analysis prepared by the Legislative Analyst. ( Elec. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 9082, 88001.) Sometimes the guide runs hundreds of pages. But it is the primary\n    means by which voters inform themselves about the policy choices in an election, and this court considers it a key resource in determining the meaning and validity of the laws enacted by voter initiative. So when it falls to us to interpret and apply a voter-\n    enacted initiative-\"our primary goal\" being \"to determine and give effect to the underlying purpose of the law\" (\n    <em>\n     Goodman v. Lozano\n    </em>\n    (2010)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899552\" index=\"580\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/47/1327/#p1332\">\n     47 Cal.4th 1327\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1332,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"581\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20219\">\n     104 Cal.Rptr.3d 219\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"582\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=223%20P.3d%2077\">\n     223 P.3d 77\n    </extracted-citation>\n    )-we rely in particular on the analyses and arguments contained in the voter information guide, along with the text of the initiative, in identifying the statute's purpose and determining how it should be construed. (\n    <em>\n     People v. Morales\n    </em>\n    (2016)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456748\" index=\"583\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/63/399/#p406\">\n     63 Cal.4th 399\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 406,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"584\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20130\">\n     203 Cal.Rptr.3d 130\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"585\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=371%20P.3d%20592\">\n     371 P.3d 592\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-202\">\n    Now imagine a reasonable voter consulting the voter information guide to Proposition 66. What would the voter have gleaned-immediately-about the initiative's purpose? In the very first of its findings and declarations, the initiative stated that our \"death penalty system is ineffective because of waste, delays, and inefficiencies.\" (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 8,\n    2016) Prop. 66, \u00a7 2, subd. (1), p. 212 (Voter Guide).) The findings and declarations went on to lament that \"[f]amilies of murder victims should not have to wait decades for justice\" and that \"[h]undreds of killers have sat on death row for over 20 years.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    ., \u00a7 2, subd. (3), p. 213.) The findings and declarations concluded by promising that if enacted, \"[a] capital case can be fully and fairly reviewed by both the state and federal courts within ten years.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    ., \u00a7 2, subd. (10), p. 213.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-203\">\n    To fulfill that explicit promise, the initiative added and amended various provisions of the Penal Code to include several new procedures. One of them was a requirement that \"the state courts\n    <em>\n     shall\n    </em>\n    complete the state appeal and the initial state habeas corpus review in capital cases\" within five years of the entry of judgment. ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.6, subd. (d), italics added; all undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.) The ballot pamphlet told voters, in typeface as conspicuous as it was emphatic, that this provision \"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Requires Completion of Direct Appeal and Habeas Corpus Petition Process Within Five Years\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    .\" (Voter Guide,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , analysis of Prop. 66 by Legis. Analyst, p. 106; see generally Elec. Code, \u00a7 9087, subd. (b) [the Legis. Analyst must provide an analysis that is \"easily understood by the average voter,\" which \"may contain background information, including ... the effect of enacted legislation which will become effective if the measure is adopted\"].) In the event the process \"takes more than five years, victims or their attorneys could request a court order to address the delay.\" (Voter Guide,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , analysis of Prop. 66 by Legislative Analyst, p. 106; see Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.6, subd. (e) [\"If a court fails to comply without extraordinary and compelling reasons justifying the delay, either party or any victim of the offense may seek relief by petition for writ of mandate\"].) That's why proponents, in explaining \"WHAT PROPOSITION 66 DOES,\" assured voters that if enacted, all state appeals should henceforth \"be limited to 5 years.\" (Voter Guide,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , argument in favor of Prop. 66, p. 108.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    Then the 2016 general election took place. With the aforementioned provisions at the heart of the initiative-and no doubt influenced by promises made in the Voter Guide-voters narrowly enacted Proposition 66. Petitioner then immediately filed this petition for writ of mandate. In it, he advanced a separation of powers challenge to the provision requiring California courts to resolve the automatic appeal and initial habeas corpus petition in capital cases within five years. But here's the twist: At\n    oral argument, the initiative's proponents (intervener Californians to Mend, Not End, the Death Penalty) admitted that an actual five-year deadline would \"perhaps not\" be constitutional. The proponents instead let it slip that the initiative's five-year deadline is not a deadline after all, but just a \"goal\" that has no real consequence if it goes unmet. The Attorney General, also purportedly arguing in support of\n    Proposition 66, added that this five-year \"goal\" was not \"binding\" and is really just \"an invitation to take up the question of how long these appeals should take.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    This is what might be charitably described as a novel reinterpretation of the initiative's five-year deadline for resolution of the automatic appeal and initial capital habeas corpus petition. It is at odds-entirely-with what the initiative says, how it was designed to work, and how it was sold. Even more remarkably, the majority blithely accepts this neutering of what clearly appeared to the\n    voters to be a five-year deadline into a mere palaver on the processing of death penalty cases. And not just any palaver: By reimagining the initiative as nothing more than an earnest exhortation calling on courts to consider dialing up the speed of death penalty adjudication, the majority upholds something quite different from the initiative considered and enacted by the electorate, leaving in its wake uncertainty about how we interpret initiatives and whether the time limits included in Proposition 66 have any legal effect.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    A.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    Section 190.6, subdivision (d) provides: \"The right of victims of crime to a prompt and final conclusion, as provided in paragraph (9) of subdivision (b) of Section 28 of Article I of the California Constitution, includes the right to have judgments of death carried out within a reasonable time. Within 18 months of the effective date of this initiative, the Judicial Council shall adopt initial rules and standards of administration designed to expedite the processing of capital appeals and state habeas corpus review.\n    <em>\n     Within five years of the adoption of the initial rules or the entry of judgment, whichever is later, the state courts shall complete the state appeal and the initial state habeas corpus review in capital cases.\n    </em>\n    The Judicial Council shall continuously monitor the timeliness of review of capital cases and shall amend the rules and standards as necessary to complete the state appeal and initial state habeas corpus proceedings within the five-year period provided in this subdivision.\" (Italics added.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    Petitioner argues that a statute purporting to dictate when a court shall hear and determine a case would unconstitutionally interfere with the judiciary and violate the separation of powers. Both the Attorney General and intervener-proponents so concede. Little wonder: With but one exception, state supreme courts have unanimously concluded that the timing of a judicial decision is a core judicial function, protected from legislative encroachment.

But the responsibility we shoulder is to render constitutional rulings clear enough to foster meaningful deliberation rather than simply offering vague references to \"constitutional problems,\" and to construe statutes in a manner that preserves the integrity of the democratic process. A statute's purpose is paramount and may not be disregarded. Language is not putty. And it is not for us to declare, in gross, that a legislative body will never be understood as having enacted an unconstitutional law, for the question whether the enacting body had such a purpose will depend on the particular statutory text, structure, and legislative history. So it is one thing to declare a statute unconstitutional when it cannot be saved, yet quite another to pretend\n    a statute means what it does not simply so it can be saved. The latter course takes the court well beyond adoption of a saving construction when the statute reasonably allows it, into a realm straining the court's norms as well as its powers.

It is not a reasonable inference that the voters sought merely to echo such provisions' effect when they adopted statutory language providing \"Within five years of the adoption of the initial rules or the entry of judgment, whichever is later, the state courts shall complete the state appeal and the initial state habeas corpus review in capital cases.\" ( \u00a7 190.6, subd.

Accordingly, the separation of powers doctrine requires us to strike down this mandatory five-year deadline.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-225\">\n    B.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-226\">\n    The majority's efforts to avoid this conclusion are far from convincing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-227\">\n    The majority's misguided analysis begins, but does not end, with its reliance on an exceedingly narrow and unjustified reading of section 190.6, subdivision (e).\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    In the\n    majority's view, \"the delay\" that may be the subject of a petition for writ of mandate is limited to the delay in filing the opening appellate brief under subdivision (b). (See maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 498-499, 400 P.3d at p. 57.) But there is no such limitation in the part of subdivision (e) that authorizes the writ of mandate. There\n    <em>\n     is\n    </em>\n    such a limitation in the\n    <em>\n     first\n    </em>\n    sentence of subdivision (e)-which addresses the validity of the underlying judgment or the viability of the appeal-but it is quite obvious that this sentence and the writ of mandate sentence serve different purposes and thus have different scopes of operation. The first sentence of new subdivision (e) represents a slight modification of section 190.6, former subdivision (d), which provided: \"The failure of the parties or the Supreme Court to meet or comply with the time limit provided by this section shall not be a ground\n    for granting relief from a judgment of conviction or sentence of death.\" (Stats. 1996, ch. 1086,\n    \u00a7 1, p. 7656.) Because the only \"time limit provided by this section\" (\n    <em>\n     ibid\n    </em>\n    .) at that time was the briefing deadline in subdivision (b), it became necessary, once section 190.6 had been amended to include another time limit, to clarify that the first sentence of subdivision (e) applied only to the deadline in subdivision (b). But the second sentence in subdivision (e) is entirely new. It does not purport to create a remedy against a\n    <em>\n     party\n    </em>\n    -yet it is a party, after all, who does or does not comply with a briefing deadline. Rather, the second sentence creates a remedy against a\n    <em>\n     court\n    </em>\n    : \"\n    <em>\n     either\n    </em>\n    party\" or \"any victim\" may \"petition for writ of mandate\" against \"a court\" for \"the delay.\" ( \u00a7 190.6, subd. (e), italics added.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-228\">\n    Now consider the implication of inferring a restriction in the scope of this sentence, as the majority proposes. Doing so would mean that the \"party\" who had failed to submit a timely opening appellate brief would be able to seek relief from \"a court\" for \"the delay\" in the party's timely filing of\n    <em>\n     its own\n    </em>\n    brief-a remedy without a right if there ever was one. Given its context, the structure of the statute, and the\n    materials presented to the voters, we can safely conclude that what the second sentence in subdivision (e) means is precisely what it says: Either party, or any victim, may seek relief by petition for writ of mandate when a court fails to comply with a deadline set forth in section 190.6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-229\">\n    What's more, a reasonable member of the electorate would also have considered the concluding sentence of section 190.6, subdivision (e). This sentence expressly provides that a victim's right to enforcement of the Victims' Bill of Rights ( Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28 ) includes standing to enforce the rights set forth in section 190.6, subdivision (d) -i.e., the five-year deadline. Subdivision (d), in turn, explicitly links the five-year deadline to the constitutional \"right of victims of crime to a prompt and final conclusion, as provided in paragraph (9) of subdivision (b) of Section 28 of Article I of the California Constitution, includ[ing] the right to have judgments of death carried out within a reasonable time.\" The majority's reading-which denies victims standing to enforce the five-year deadline-simply makes the final sentence of subdivision (e) disappear.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-230\">\n    The majority says it must construe the five-year deadline as directory \"regardless of how the ballot materials characterized\" it because there is no \"workable\" means of enforcing the deadline. (Maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 498, 499-500, 400 P.3d at pp. 56-57, 58.) The majority cited no support for this conclusion because none exists, nor did it offer any compelling argument for why this approach makes sense. That the scheme is unworkable is both true and easily understood. Of course there's no tribunal in which a party could seek a writ of mandate directed to us. But even more important, compliance with the five-year deadline depends in large part on a series of discretionary determinations by superior courts,\n    the Court of Appeal, and this court-yet mandamus cannot be used to \" ' \"control the discretion of a court or judicial officer or to compel its exercise in a particular manner, except in those rare instances when under the facts it can be legally exercised in but one way [citations].\" ' \" (\n    <em>\n     City of Torrance v. Superior Court\n    </em>\n    (1976)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2295066\" index=\"685\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/16/195/#p201\">\n     16 Cal.3d 195\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 201-202,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"686\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20609\">\n     127 Cal.Rptr. 609\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"687\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=545%20P.2d%201313\">\n     545 P.2d 1313\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) So the majority is right to conclude that the mandate mechanism-no matter how it is interpreted-is a hollow promise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-231\">\n    Yet the question before us is not the workability of an arrangement involving a petition for writ of mandate to enforce the five-year deadline. It is instead whether a reasonable voter would have understood the\n    <em>\n     purpose\n    </em>\n    of the mandate mechanism to make the five-year deadline not merely an aspiration, but an enforceable reality. And subdivision (e) of section 190.6 is indeed a clear statement that the five-year deadline is mandatory, not directory. Everything before us-the text and structure of the initiative, its unambiguous purpose, the ballot materials, and the construction endorsed by all of the parties-would lead a reasonable voter to believe that this provision, which had attracted so much attention, constituted a real deadline, and one that could be enforced by a petition for writ of mandate. When the text of a voter initiative provides that government \"shall\" complete\n    some action within a specified period of time ( \u00a7 190.6, subd. (d) ), the analysis of the initiative in the ballot pamphlet confirms that the new law \"requires\" completion of some action within the specified period of time (Voter Guide,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , analysis of Prop. 66 by Legis. Analyst, pp. 106-107), and the proponents' argument there and in its general campaign promises that the new law \"will\" achieve that objective (see\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , fn. 3 and accompanying text), a reasonable voter would conclude that the initiative imposes an enforceable deadline. So, too, when the initiative goes\n    so far as to authorize aggrieved parties to obtain a judicial writ to enforce the time limit, a reasonable voter would feel confident that the new law enacts real, meaningful control over the judicial function.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-232\">\n    Moreover, nothing in our case law, the case law from any other jurisdiction, or in the inherent logic of constitutional or statutory interpretation makes the characterization of a statutory time limit for judicial processes turn on whether the enforcement mechanism would be \"workable.\" (Maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 499-500, 400 P.3d at p. 58.) It's doubtful that any mechanism to enforce a statutory deadline on the resolution of a case or motion could\n    <em>\n     ever\n    </em>\n    be entirely workable, since such a deadline (as the majority concedes) would necessarily interfere with the court's control over its docket and thus violate the separation of powers. (See maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at pp. 500-501, 400 P.3d at pp. 58-59.) The majority's interpretive move, in reality, is to declare that it would never recognize\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    deadline as mandatory. Our court has the power to take a \"different\" approach from that of every other court inside or outside of California (\n    <em>\n     ibid\n    </em>\n    .), but it is hard to see how this approach squares with our mission, when interpreting a statute, to construe it in a\n    manner that gives effect to the legislative purpose. (See\n    <em>\n     Goodman v. Lozano\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 47 Cal.4th at p. 1332,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"688\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20219\">\n     104 Cal.Rptr.3d 219\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"689\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=223%20P.3d%2077\">\n     223 P.3d 77\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-233\">\n    Equally unpersuasive is the majority's next justification for construing the clearly mandatory deadline as merely directory. According to the majority, it was not sufficient that the text, structure, context, and legislative history demonstrated that the deadline was mandatory. Rather, the ballot materials also needed to inform the voters about \"the details of an enforcement mechanism\" and \"how such an order could effectively result in compliance.\" (Maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 499-500, 400 P.3d at p. 58.) If such a requirement is to be plucked out of thin air-as I fear this one has been-then it needs a compelling substantive or institutional justification that the majority does not provide. To my knowledge, we have never required the voters to sit through a constitutional law lecture before we would be willing to interpret a law as it was written.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-234\">\n    Such a requirement strikes me as inconsistent with the very 83-year-old case the majority purports to be vindicating. Unlike this case,\n    <em>\n     Lorraine\n    </em>\n    did not even involve a constitutional challenge (\n    <em>\n     Lorraine\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 220 Cal. at p. 756,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"690\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20P.2d%20960\">\n     32 P.2d 960\n    </extracted-citation>\n    )-we instead considered only the mandatory/directory character of a statute providing that a court \" 'shall' \" postpone a trial or hearing for up to 30 days \" 'when all attorneys of record of parties who have appeared in the action agree to such postponement.' \" (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at p. 754,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"691\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20P.2d%20960\">\n     32 P.2d 960\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) Tellingly, we did not inquire whether the Legislature had sufficiently ruminated about \"the details\" of the rule's operation or what effect it would have on a court. Instead, in accordance with our longstanding rule that the mandatory/directory distinction \"is ultimately one of legislative intent\" (\n    <em>\n     Kabran\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 2 Cal.5th at p. 343 ), we focused on whether the Legislature had \"the intent to make the action of the parties compulsory upon the court in each instance.\" (\n    <em>\n     Lorraine\n    </em>\n    , at p. 757,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"692\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20P.2d%20960\">\n     32 P.2d 960\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; see also\n    <em>\n     Thurmond\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 66 Cal.2d at p. 839,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"693\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20273\">\n     59 Cal.Rptr. 273\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"694\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=427%20P.2d%20985\">\n     427 P.2d 985\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .)

In 1968, one year after\n    <em>\n     Thurmond\n    </em>\n    , the Legislature amended each of those statutes to add a new provision stating that a continuance or extension of time requested by a party or attorney who is a member of the Legislature then in session \"is mandatory,\" unless the court determined that the continuance or extension of time would defeat or abridge a right to relief in specified proceedings. ( Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 595, 1054.1, subd. (b).) In contrast to the majority's approach in this case, the\n    <em>\n     Verio\n    </em>\n    court recognized that the clearly mandatory provisions of the amended statutes rendered them distinguishable from the statutes we construed in\n    <em>\n     Lorraine\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Thurmond\n    </em>\n    , and\n    <em>\n     Engram\n    </em>\n    .

The invalid mandatory provisions were functionally severable, in that their removal would not affect or disrupt the operation of either statute. And the court could be sure that the Legislature would have maintained the pre-amended version of the statutes,\n    had it foreseen the invalidation of the 1968 amendments, because \" '[t]he legislative policy of granting continuances of court proceedings so as not to interfere with the functions of the Legislature ... has been the law since 1880.' \" (\n    <em>\n     Verio\n    </em>\n    , at p. 1326,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"709\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=208%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20436\">\n     208 Cal.Rptr.3d 436\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , quoting\n    <em>\n     Thurmond\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 66 Cal.2d at p. 840,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"710\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20273\">\n     59 Cal.Rptr. 273\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"711\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=427%20P.2d%20985\">\n     427 P.2d 985\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) These aspects of the case showcase why\n    <em>\n     Verio\n    </em>\n    did not interpret mandatory\n    language as directory. It instead\n    <em>\n     invalidated\n    </em>\n    the mandatory provisions.

Consequently,\n    <em>\n     Verio\n    </em>\n    declared that\n    <em>\n     those\n    </em>\n    statutes \"should\n    <em>\n     continue\n    </em>\n    to be treated as directory.\" (\n    <em>\n     Verio\n    </em>\n    , at p. 1330,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"712\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=208%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20436\">\n     208 Cal.Rptr.3d 436\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , italics added.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-239\">\n    Ironically, it is the part of\n    <em>\n     Verio\n    </em>\n    that is on point-the part declaring mandatory provisions unconstitutional-that the majority ignores. Instead the majority relies on the part of\n    <em>\n     Verio\n    </em>\n    that read directory language to be directory, but that part is of no assistance here. No one-not the majority, not the Attorney General, not the intervener-proponents-claims the five-year deadline is somehow severable from the mandatory aspects of the initiative. (See Katyal &amp; Schmidt,\n    <em>\n     Active Avoidance: The Modern Supreme Court and Legal Change\n    </em>\n    (2015)\n    <extracted-citation index=\"713\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%202109\">\n     128 Harv. L.Rev. 2109\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 2121, fn. 47 [\"When a court uses the rewriting power, it is, in effect, implicitly assuming the outcome of the severability analysis and acting with less candor and transparency than a court that does the analysis explicitly\"].) And nothing in the record suggests the voters would have preferred a directory interpretation of the five-year deadline to its invalidation. To the contrary: Several statutes already offered what the majority calls \"an exhortation to the parties and courts to handle cases as expeditiously as is consistent with the fair and principled administration of justice.\" (Maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 501, 400 P.3d at p. 59; see \u00a7\u00a7 190.6, subds. (a), (c), 1239.1, subd. (a).) There is no reason to think the voters, when they enacted Proposition 66, wanted merely to pile on. As a sister state supreme court explained nearly a century ago, \"[F]or us to merely hold the provisions of the act under consideration directory would afford poor consolation, for it was doubtless the intention of those sponsoring this measure to provide a method for a speedy disposition of such matters, and to hold the provisions of the measure merely directory would enable the courts to take as much time as they saw fit to dispose of the questions presented, which would be no improvement over the method provided by law as it existed before this measure was initiated.\" (\n    <em>\n     Long\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 251 P. at p. 490.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-240\">\n    Litigants and policymakers are unlikely to discover much improvement-or \"benefit\" (maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 495, fn. 28, 400 P.3d at p. 54, fn. 28)-in the majority's implausible construction of the five-year deadline, either. It would be exceptionally difficult, and potentially quite fraught, for the Judicial Council to implement whatever might allegedly remain of the five-year time limit while preserving\n    \"the courts' inherent authority over their dockets.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at p. 503-504, 400 P.3d at p. 61.) So I agree with Justice Liu: The Judicial Council is under no compulsion to\n    adopt rules or standards meant somehow to expedite judicial review of death penalty cases beyond those that implement the specific reforms enumerated in other parts of Proposition 66. (See \u00a7\u00a7 1239.1, subds. (a), (b), 1509, subds. (a), (g), 1509.1, subd. (a).) As he points out, section 190.6, subdivision (d)\"does not provide useful guidance for those charged with implementing Proposition 66\" regarding the acceleration of judicial review and therefore cannot \"lawfully and practically guide the Judicial Council's quasi-legislative rulemaking.\" (Conc. opn. of Liu, J.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at pp. 511-512, 400 P.3d at pp. 68-69.) To require more from the Judicial Council than rulemaking to implement the specific reforms above would amount to a risky bet that some other entity will swoop in to enforce the separation of powers, which is a bedrock of our constitutional republic and a dividing line\n    <em>\n     the courts\n    </em>\n    are charged with policing. Either the five-year deadline is unconstitutional (as I have argued) or it is of no legal effect (as Justice Liu contends). But any implication that the Judicial Council must also make rules aimed vaguely at accelerating the process, with no hint as to what such rules might be, brings to mind the guidance a European monarch is envisioned as offering to John Adams-stepping into the shoes of George Washington as our second president-in the musical \"Hamilton\": \"Good luck!\" (Miranda, Hamilton: An American Musical, act II, scene 10.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-241\">\n    \"Good luck\" might be in order as well for those who contemplate a challenge to the\n    constitutionality of other statutes and may now wonder whether this court will instead redraft laws to avoid \"constitutional problems.\" (Maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 498, 400 P.3d at pp. 56-57.) It is not judicial modesty that authorizes a court to distort the text of a statute in a way that subverts its purpose. Nor does judicial restraint justify a court deliberately reading a law to mean something other than what the voters enacted. When the majority says that it will construe statutes to be directory-despite their \"mandatory phrasing,\" despite what \"the voters were told,\" and despite what \"the voters intended\" as the statute's purpose (maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 498, 500, 400 P.3d at pp. 56-57, 58)-the act becomes precisely the opposite of judicial modesty. The court instead substitutes its own preferences, without justification, for those embodied in legislation. (See Manning,\n    <em>\n     The Nondelegation Doctrine as a Canon of Avoidance\n    </em>\n    (2000) Sup. Ct. Rev. 223, 255-256.) And while it may sometimes be possible for the legislative branch to correct a mistaken judicial construction of a statute it had duly enacted, that's an unlikely prospect here. Under the terms of the initiative, the newly minted five-year \"goal\" just announced by the majority and given some degree of legal weight by it can now be overturned only by a vote of three-fourths of the membership of each house of the Legislature, or by a whole new initiative. (See Voter Guide,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , Prop. 66, \u00a7 20, p. 218.) Because, practically speaking, our word will be the last word, we really ought to fairly construe the law the voters actually enacted.\n    When we construe Proposition 66, we find that nothing in the initiative or the record suggests that reasonable voters would have understood the initiative to enact merely a \"guideline[ ]\" or a \"goal.\" (Maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 495, fn. 28, 499-500, 400 P.3d at pp. 54, fn. 28, 58; cf.\n    <em>\n     Valencia\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 3 Cal.5th at p. 364,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513604\" index=\"714\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/220/230/#p357\">\n     397 P.3d 936\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [refusing to adopt a permissible construction that would \"be inconsistent with [the initiative]'s uncodified\n    findings, declarations, purpose, and intent\"].) Rather than redraft the initiative while casting aside its purpose, we should interpret the five-year deadline in section 190.6 to mean what it says, and analyze its constitutionality fairly and fully. Having undertaken that task, I would invalidate those portions of section 190.6, subdivision (d) that purport to impose a deadline for completion of \"the state appeal and the initial state habeas corpus review in capital cases\" and to charge the Judicial Council with promulgating rules and standards to ensure the completion of such review \"within the five-year period provided in this subdivision.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-242\">\n    II.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-243\">\n    The five-year deadline is not Proposition 66's only constitutional defect. The majority also errs in upholding new section 1509.1, subdivision (a), which purports to vest the Court of Appeal with appellate jurisdiction in capital habeas corpus proceedings: \"Either party may appeal the decision of a superior court on an initial petition under Section 1509 to the court of appeal.\" Under our state Constitution,\n    <em>\n     this\n    </em>\n    court has \"exclusive\" appellate jurisdiction \" 'in death penalty cases.' \" (\n    <em>\n     Thompson v.

(Maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at p. 482, 400 P.3d at p. 43.) But it is more than that: It is also unconstitutional. Unlike the majority, I would read the constitutional grant of appellate jurisdiction to this court ( Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 11, subd. (a)) in conjunction with related constitutional provisions, the Legislature's long-standing interpretation of our appellate jurisdiction, the purpose behind vesting this court with appellate jurisdiction in death penalty cases, and the virtually uniform practice of our sister states. When interpreted using our ordinary canons of construction, it is clear that our exclusive appellate jurisdiction encompasses an appeal from\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    attempt to attack the death judgment, including an appeal from a capital habeas corpus proceeding.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-245\">\n    Like most states that have retained the death penalty, California has entrusted appellate jurisdiction in death penalty cases to the state court of last resort. Under our state Constitution, \"[t]he Supreme Court has appellate\n    jurisdiction when judgment of death has been pronounced.\" (\n    Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 11, subd. (a).) Although this court generally has the power to transfer a case in its jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal (or to transfer a case from the Court of Appeal to itself), the Constitution explicitly withholds such authority when the case is \"an appeal involving a judgment of death.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    ., art. VI, \u00a7 12, subd. (d).) Certainly an appeal from a judgment granting or denying a habeas corpus petition attacking a death judgment is \"an appeal involving a judgment of death.\" (\n    <em>\n     Ibid\n    </em>\n    .)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-246\">\n    So it is the task of this court-and only this court-to exercise \"exclusive jurisdiction 'in death penalty cases' because of 'the extreme nature of the penalty.' \" (\n    <em>\n     Thompson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 25 Cal.4th at p. 124,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"718\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%2046\">\n     105 Cal.Rptr.2d 46\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"719\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20P.3d%201198\">\n     18 P.3d 1198\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , quoting Cal.

Even so, the sentence-\"Under Section 11, the direct appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is restricted to those cases in which judgment of death has been pronounced\" (Judicial Council of Cal., Ann. Rep. (1967) pt. 1, ch. 3, p. 76)-does not support the majority's idiosyncratic reading of the constitutional provision's actual text. What is important under article VI, section 11 is not that the appeal from a proceeding attacking the death judgment itself be an appeal\n    <em>\n     from\n    </em>\n    the judgment of death, but that a judgment of death has\n    <em>\n     actually\n    </em>\n    been pronounced. Over a century ago, we explained that our \"appellate jurisdiction 'in all criminal cases\n    <em>\n     where judgment of death has been rendered\n    </em>\n    ' \" excluded an appeal from an order, \"made before judgment,\" setting aside a charge of capital murder.

Consider the purpose underlying our exclusive appellate jurisdiction in death penalty cases, and the difference between review by appeal and review by a new original writ petition.

A system in which an appeal can be taken to the intermediate appellate court, by contrast, creates uncertainty. It allows for the possibility of conflicting rulings on a matter of ultimate concern: life, or death. An appeal triggers the right to present oral argument and an entitlement to a written opinion with reasons stated. (\n    <em>\n     People v.

The majority leaves intact this court's exclusive appellate jurisdiction when those claims are presented in the automatic appeal, and rightly so. Such claims go to the heart of our concerns over the evenhanded, rational, and consistent imposition of the death penalty. But that purpose would be completely undermined if (as the majority now holds) those same claims go instead to the Court of Appeal when a party is appealing from a capital habeas corpus proceeding.

Such a scheme would multiply the risk of conflicting rulings-even though the prospect of conflicting rulings on these issues was precisely the evil at which article VI, section 11 was directed. It is simply not reasonable to interpret the constitutional provision to countenance\n    such a result. Which is why I would find section 1509.1 unconstitutional insofar as it purports to direct an appeal to the Court of Appeal from a superior court ruling on a capital habeas corpus petition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-258\">\n    The remaining question is whether the provision barring the use of a \"successive petition\" (read \"new petition\" (maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 482-483, fn. 14, 400 P.3d at pp. 43-44, fn. 14)) \"as a means of reviewing a denial of habeas relief\" ( \u00a7 1509.1, subd.

As an inducement to support this initiative, voters were promised that state court review of death penalty\n    judgments could and would be completed within five years. That promise, as the majority concedes, was a sham. But the way to prevent similar swindles in the future is to be clear about what section 190.6, subdivision (d) says and why it is unconstitutional. What the majority offers instead-a \"saving construction\" to a clearly unconstitutional statute (maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 221 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 502-503, fn. 33, 400 P.3d at p. 60, fn. 33), accompanied by a \"caution\" against presenting the voters with \"statutory language that is inconsistent with constitutional norms\" (\n    <em>\n     ibid\n    </em>\n    .)-ill-serves the constitutional principles at stake, hinders forthright deliberation, and encourages initiative proponents to repeat the bait-and-switch in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-262\">\n    It is the voters' job to decide whether to enact laws by initiative.
