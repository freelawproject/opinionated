This demurrer of defendant was sustained by the trial court and plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed. From such judgment of dismissal appeal is prosecuted to this Court of Appeals upon questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">It is noted that on the face of the petition it is alleged that plaintiff\u2019s husband ceased his alleged gambling operations with the defendant on the 13th day of March, 1952. This action was not brought until January 30, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Defendant\u2019s demurrer admits that Samuel Johnson, Jr., did not commence any action against the defendant for six months next after March 13, 1952. During such six months period no one other than Samuel Johnson, Jr., was privileged to bring the action under the applicable provisions of \u00a75966 GC, now \u00a73763.02 R. C. The wife\u2019s cause of action accrued Sept. 13, 1952. The question which arises in this case is whether plaintiff\u2019s action is one for a penalty, such an action concededly being limited to one year from the date the cause of action arose. The plaintiff claims that her action is not one for penalty and that \u00a75966 GC, is a remedial statute rather than one for a forfeiture or penalty, and therefore is not barred until six years after the cause of action accrued as provided in \u00a72305.07 R. C., former \u00a711222 GC. It therefore appears that the sole question for determination is whether plaintiff\u2019s action is one for a penalty, as determined by the trial court. We believe this question has been settled by the Supreme Court of Ohio in the case of Cooper v. Rowley, 29 Oh St 547, wherein that Court interpreted the gaming statutes in effect at that time as authorizing or creating an action for the recovery of a penalty whereby the action must be brought within one year from the date the cause of action accrued. The present gaming statutes are in all material respects as they were in 1831 at the time of the decision in Cooper v. Rowley, supra. The decision in the cited case disposes of the claim of plaintiff that her action is one upon an implied contract rather than one for the enforcement of a penalty or forfeitures. Examining the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s petition and comparing the same with the date her action was instituted in the Common Pleas Court it is quite apparent that an otherwise valid action for recovery was commenced after the statute of limitations had tolled her right to bring such action, and that the Common Pleas Court was not in error in sustaining the demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s action and in dismissing the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>However much this Court may regret the inability of plaintiff to recover from the operator of a gambling game known as \u201cNumbers\u201d it must be understood that her failure is due entirely to the fact that her action was not timely brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Judgment of the Common Pleas Court affirmed.-</p>\n<judges id=\"b84-6\">MONTGOMERY, PJ, GRIFFITH, J, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
