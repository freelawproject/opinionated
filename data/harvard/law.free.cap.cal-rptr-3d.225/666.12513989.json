For reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On September 14, 2015, an amended information was filed charging defendant with the felony offense of forging and issuing a prescription for a narcotic drug in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11368 (count one) and the misdemeanor offense of burglary in violation of section 459 (count two). The amended information further alleged defendant had committed two prior strike offenses pursuant to sections 667, subdivisions (d) and (e), and 1170.12, subdivisions (b) and (c) -a 2006 conviction for vandalism committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang (\u00a7 594, subd. (a), \u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)), and a 2012 conviction for participation in a criminal street gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (a)). Finally, the amended information alleged defendant had served a prior prison term for the 2012 conviction within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   These charges stemmed from the following events on June 4, 2015. Defendant entered into a Walgreens store in Santa Rosa and presented the pharmacist with a prescription for a 16-ounce bottle of Phenergan Codeinecough syrup. Suspecting the prescription was fraudulent based upon its appearance, the pharmacist recorded defendant's identifying information and contacted the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Police officers responding to the call located defendant in the rear passenger seat of a vehicle parked at the pharmacy drive-up window. When confronted by the officers, defendant was cooperative and conceded the prescription was fraudulent. Defendant explained he had obtained the prescription from some acquaintances. He insisted that this was the first time that he had attempted to obtain codeine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 3, 2015, defendant was interviewed by a probation officer. Defendant stated that, just before the June 4 incident, he had been drinking cough syrup and had taken three or four Xanax, causing him to \"black [ ] out.\" Defendant insisted he did not recall entering Walgreens or receiving the prescription from acquaintances, and did not \"wak[e] up\" until he was being booked by police after his arrest. Defendant explained he had first ingested codeine and Xanax after being released from jail, and told the officer, \"I'll take responsibility for it. I just need help. I need help for my addiction. I need to stay clean and sober, get back to my job.\" Expressing the desire to \"live a sober life,\" defendant stated that his priorities were to receive substance abuse treatment for his addiction and to move away from Sonoma County to be free of \"negative influences.\" Consistent with these priorities, defendant was thereafter accepted to a six-month residential treatment program through the Treatment Alternative for Safer Communities (TASC) program after \"admitt[ing] to having a substance use disorder\" and \"express[ing] a desire for rehabilitation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 14, 2015, following the preliminary hearing, defendant made a motion pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivision (f), seeking to have count one, felony forging and issuing a prescription for a narcotic drug, reduced to a misdemeanor in accordance with Proposition 47, the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act of\n   2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the contested hearing on his motion, defense counsel argued that defendant, an individual who had attempted to obtain a single bottle of cough syrup for personal use, had assumed responsibility for his actions and obtained acceptance into a residential treatment program. Counsel further argued that, with respect to defendant's prior strikes, the first was a vandalism offense for gang-related graffiti that occurred when he was just 18 years old, and that second was a plea to a stand-alone gang charge, thus \"distinguishable from other types of violent strike felonies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 13, 2015, the trial court denied defendant's request for Proposition 47 relief, reasoning: \"While many of [defense counsel's] comments make sense to this Court regarding the actual underlying facts of the case, meeting some of the misdemeanor criteria that the Court has here, the Court cannot avoid looking at the prior strikes and the prior prison commitments listed on the complaint.\" Defendant then entered a no-contest plea in open court to count one, the felony medical prescription forgery count, and admitted the two prior strike offenses (for vandalism committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang in 2006 and participation in a criminal street gang in 2012). The remaining count and special allegation were then dismissed on the prosecution's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 4, 2015, prior to sentencing, defendant filed a new motion under section 17, subdivision (b), to reclassify the count one felony as a misdemeanor, as well as a motion pursuant to\n   <em>\n    People v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Romero\n   </em>\n   ) (1996)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1965926\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/13/497/\">\n    13 Cal.4th 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20789\">\n    53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=917%20P.2d%20628\">\n    917 P.2d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to strike the prior strike conviction allegations. At the November 24, 2015 sentencing hearing, after argument from counsel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court, denied defendant's motions and sentenced him to state prison for a middle term of four years in accordance with probation's recommendation. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant first contends the trial court erred by denying his petition for relief under Proposition 47. He reasons that \"forgery of a narcotic prescription ( Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11368 ) falls within the clear intent of the voters in enacting Proposition 47,\" and, as such, is an offense eligible for sentencing reduction under section 1170.18. Second, defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying his section 17, subdivision (b) motion to reduce the felony charge to a misdemeanor by failing to make an \"individualized consideration\" of relevant sentencing factors, including his character and attitude\n   toward the present offense and the nature and circumstances of his offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We begin with the relevant legal framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We review de novo questions of statutory or voter-initiative interpretation.

Is defendant's forgery offense eligible for reclassification under Proposition 47?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant contends his felony offense under Health and Safety Code section 11368 (hereinafter, section 11368 ) qualifies for purposes of Proposition 47 as \"petty theft\" (to wit, theft of one or more items not exceeding $950 in value) and, as such, is eligible to be reclassified by the court as a misdemeanor.

(b) [changing punishment for some forgery and counterfeiting offenses].) The initiative also created a resentencing procedure allowing offenders to petition for resentencing if they are \"currently serving a sentence for a conviction\" for committing a felony and \"would have been\n   guilty of a misdemeanor under\" the provisions added by Proposition 47. (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (a).)\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

The purpose of this and other similar changes was 'to ensure that prison spending is focused on violent and serious offenses [and] to maximize alternatives for nonserious, nonviolent crime.'

Specifically, section 1170.18, subdivision (a), authorizes a \"person [currently] serving a sentence for a conviction ... [to] petition for a recall of sentence before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to request resentencing in accordance with Sections 11350, 11357, or 11377 of the Health and Safety Code, or Section 459.5, 473, 476a, 490.2, 496, or 666 of the Penal Code, as those sections have been amended or added by this act.\" (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (a).) Subdivision (f), in turn, provides that \"[a] person who has completed his or her sentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under this act had this act been in effect at the time of the offense, may file an application before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to have the felony conviction or convictions designated as misdemeanors.\" (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (f).) Further, where the section 1170.18 applicant has satisfied the criteria in subdivision (f), the trial court \"shall designate the felony offense or offenses as a misdemeanor.\" (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (g).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As a threshold issue, the People contend that defendant's motion is procedurally defective because he filed it prior to sentencing, placing him outside the scope of section 1170.18, which, as reflected in the statutory language set forth above, is essentially a\n   <em>\n    resentencing\n   </em>\n   statute. (See \u00a7 1170.18, subds. (a), (f).) As the record reflects, defendant moved pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivision (f), when asking the trial court to reclassify his felony offense of forging and issuing a narcotic prescription ( \u00a7 11368 ) as a misdemeanor, even though he was not \"[a] person who has completed his or her sentence for a conviction....\" (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (f).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, defendant acknowledges his mistake in referencing section 1170.18, subdivision (f) as the basis for his motion given that he had not yet been sentenced, yet insists his motion should be viewed more broadly as a request for relief under Proposition 47 from the legal repercussions of classifying his offense as a felony. However, putting aside the issue of whether defendant's motion was procedurally defective and assuming for the sake of argument he is entitled to petition for reclassification of his offense under Proposition 47, a more serious concern is whether his\n   offense is one\n   <em>\n    eligible\n   </em>\n   for reclassification under Proposition 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   According to defendant, obtaining a narcotic drug though use of a false pretense, i.e., use of a false prescription, constitutes petty theft so long as the narcotic drug's value does not exceed $950. ( \u00a7 490.2, subd. (a) ; see also \u00a7 484, subd. (a) [\"Every person ... who shall knowingly and designedly, by any false or fraudulent representation or pretense, defraud any other person of money, labor or real or personal property, ... is guilty of theft.

Defendant insists, nonetheless, that his section 11368 offense may be designated a misdemeanor by the trial court because, as a forgery offense that is essentially a \"petty theft,\" his offense falls within the scope of Proposition 47 based upon the initiative's amendment of another statute-to wit, section 490.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Turning to section 490.2, the statutory text provides in relevant part, \"Notwithstanding Section 487 or any other provision of law defining grand theft, obtaining any property by theft where the value of the money, labor, real or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty\n   dollars ($950) shall be considered petty theft and shall be punished as a misdemeanor.\" ( \u00a7 490.2, subd. (a).) As our state Supreme Court recently clarified: \"What section 490.2 indicates is that after the passage of Proposition 47, 'obtaining any property by theft' constitutes petty theft if the stolen property is worth less than $ 950. [footnote omitted.] Of course, section 487, subdivision (a), already made it grand theft to steal property worth over $ 950. But various other theft provisions carved out separate categories of grand theft based on the type of property stolen, with either a lower value threshold or no value threshold at all. These are the provisions that Proposition 47 modified by inserting a $ 950 threshold. Or as the Legislative Analyst put it: 'This measure would limit when theft of property of $ 950 or less can be charged as grand theft. Specifically, such crimes would no longer be charged as grand theft\n   <em>\n    solely because of the property involved\n   </em>\n   ....' (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.

Thus, pointing out that, prior to Proposition 47, several statutes defined categories of grand theft based on the type of property stolen, the California Supreme Court concluded that, with enactment of section 490.2, this property-type categorization was eliminated to make theft of any type of property valued less than $950 a misdemeanor. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) The high court then concluded based on the record before it that, because section 484e, subdivision (e) defined access card theft as grand theft, it was among those statutes defining grand theft for which Proposition 47 reduced punishment.

In particular, the trial court based its decision on the following, relevant considerations that are firmly grounded in the record. First, the court referred to information in the presentence report regarding defendant's history of gang involvement, his criminality, including his multiple strike offenses, and his relatively recent failures on both probation or parole. In particular, the court noted defendant had been placed back on parole on June 14, 2015, a date \"very close\" to the date of the current offense (June 14, 2015). Thus, while defendant insists the court ignored key factors such as the non-violent nature of his offenses and his cooperativeness and willingness to take affirmative steps to address the addiction issue that led to his current offense, we decline to assume on this record that the court wholly disregarded these by-all-means relevant circumstances. It is well established \" '[t]he burden is on the party attacking the sentence to clearly show that the sentencing decision was irrational or arbitrary.

The fact that Health and Safety Code section 11368 is not mentioned in section 473, subdivision (b) does not reflect an intention to exclude it from offenses to which a reduced penalty applies, because violation of section 11368 is not \"forgery\" as defined in section 470.
