The plain language of the statutes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Neither section 69950 nor section 69954 distinguishes between court reporters employed by the superior court and privately retained court reporters. Section 69950 does not use the terms \"reporter,\" \"official reporter,\" or\n   \"official reporter pro tempore.\" The statute prescribes the fee for transcription of an original and subsequent copies of a transcript without reference as to what sort of court reporter-official, pro tempore, court employed, or privately retained-performs the transcription. ( \u00a7 69950.) Section 69954 refers only to a \"reporter\" generally, and does not use the terms \"official reporter\" or \"official reporter pro tempore.\" ( \u00a7 69954, subds. (a), (b), (d).) The plain language of the statutes indicates that the prescribed transcription fees are intended to apply to court reporters generally, and are not limited to court reporters employed by the superior court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

While acknowledging that \"the language of Article 9 is not perfectly consistent with an intention\n   not to regulate rates for all reporters who transcribe courtroom proceedings,\" the trial court nevertheless concluded that the statutory scheme prescribed fee limits that apply only to court reporters employed by the courts or by local governments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Statutes distinguishing between \"official reporters\" and \"official reporters pro tempore\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The trial court noted that within article 9, which governs \"Official Reporters Generally,\" six different sections distinguish between official reporters and official reporters pro tempore:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Section 69941 : \"A superior court may appoint as many competent phonographic reporters, to be known as\n   <strong>\n    official reporters\n   </strong>\n   of such court, and such\n   <strong>\n    official reporters pro tempore\n   </strong>\n   , as are deemed necessary ....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Section 69944: \"Until an\n   <strong>\n    official reporter\n   </strong>\n   of any court or\n   <strong>\n    official reporter pro tempore\n   </strong>\n   has fully completed and filed all transcriptions of the reporter's notes in any case on appeal which the reporter is required by law to transcribe, the reporter is not competent to act as\n   <strong>\n    official reporter\n   </strong>\n   in any court.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Section 69946: \"Before entering upon the duties of his office, the\n   <strong>\n    official reporter\n   </strong>\n   of any court or\n   <strong>\n    official reporter pro tempore\n   </strong>\n   shall take and subscribe the constitutional oath of office.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Section 69952, subdivision (b): \"When there is no\n   <strong>\n    official reporter\n   </strong>\n   in attendance and a\n   <strong>\n    reporter pro tempore\n   </strong>\n   is appointed, his or her reasonable expenses for traveling and detention shall be fixed and allowed by the court and paid in like manner.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Section 69955, subdivision (a): \"As used in this section, 'reporting notes' are the reporting notes of all court reporters employed to report in the courts of California, who may be known as\n   <strong>\n    official reporters\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    official reporters pro tempore\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Section 69957: \"If an\n   <strong>\n    official reporter\n   </strong>\n   or an\n   <strong>\n    official reporter pro tempore\n   </strong>\n   is unavailable ... the court may order that ... the action or proceeding be electronically recorded. ...\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The trial court concluded that the legislature intentionally used the term \"official reporter pro tempore\" in these statutes to distinguish between privately employed reporters appointed pro tempore and official reporters employed by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The trial court then noted that although sections 69950 and 69954 make no reference to official reporters and official reporters pro tempore, the scope of those statutes is delimited by section 69947, which states: \"Except in counties where a statute provides otherwise, the\n   <em>\n    official reporter\n   </em>\n   shall receive for his services the fees prescribed in this article.\" (Italics added.) The fact that section 69947 refers only to the \"official reporter\" is evidence, the trial court concluded, that the Legislature did not intend the fee provisions of article 9 to apply to private reporters acting as official reporters pro tempore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The trial court's construction of sections 69947, 69950, and 69954 is premised on the assumption that only official reporters are employees of the courts and that all official reporters pro tempore are privately retained by the parties. That assumption is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As discussed, both official reporters and official reporters pro tempore may be employees of the superior court. (See, e.g., \u00a7 70059.7 [setting rates of compensation for regular official reporters and official reporters pro tempore for court proceedings in Santa Barbara County];\n   <em>\n    Cramer v.

The statutory scheme recognizes that official court reporters pro\n   tempore may be employed by the courts (see \u00a7 70059.7), or they may be privately retained by a party. (\u00a7 68086, subd. (d)(2); rule 2.956(c).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The statutes in article 9 that refer to official reporters pro tempore do not distinguish between court reporters employed by the courts and those who are privately retained. (See \u00a7\u00a7 69941, 69946, 69952, subd. (b), 69955, subd. (c), 69957.) The trial court's reliance section 69947's reference to \"the official reporter\" as the basis for concluding that sections 69950 and 69954 apply only to court reporters employed by the superior court was therefore incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Section 68086 and rule 2.956\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Amicus California Court Reporters Association, Inc. (CCRA) acknowledges the trial court's error and concedes that official reporters pro tempore employed by the courts are subject to the statutory transcription fees prescribed by sections 69950 and 69954. CCRA contends, however, that privately retained reporters who act as official reporters pro tempore are not covered by sections 69950 and 69954. The arguments CCRA advances in support of this position are unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   CCRA argues that because section 68086, the statute authorizing privately retained official pro tempore reporters, was not enacted until 1992, the legislature could not have intended privately retained reporters to be subject to fee limitations in sections 69950 and 69954, which were enacted in 1953. To the contrary, the legislature is deemed to be aware of laws in effect at the time they enact new laws and are conclusively presumed to have enacted the new laws in light of existing laws having direct bearing upon them.

Neither section 68086 nor rule 2.956 exempts private reporters from the statutory transcription fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the legislature provided in section 68086 an express exemption from statutory court reporter attendance fees for parties who retain a private reporter to serve as an official reporter pro tempore, but provided no similar exemption from statutory transcription fees for private reporters serving as official reporters pro tempore. The absence of such an express exemption evinces an intent by the legislature to apply statutory transcription rates to official reporters pro tempore generally, whether employed by the court or privately retained by a party. (See\n   <em>\n    Wildlife Alive v. Chickering\n   </em>\n   (1976)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2286337\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/18/190/#p195\">\n    18 Cal.3d 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 195,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20377\">\n    132 Cal.Rptr. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=553%20P.2d%20537\">\n    553 P.2d 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [under rules of statutory construction, where exception to a general rule is specified by statute, other exceptions cannot be implied or presumed].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   CCRA next argues that court employed official reporters pro tempore are distinguishable from private reporters retained by a party to serve as official pro tempore reporters pursuant to section 68086, subdivision (d)(2). A court employed reporter, CCRA maintains, is appointed by the superior court pursuant to section 69941, whereas a privately retained reporter \"is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   appointed as anything.\" CCRA's position is incorrect. The Law Revision Commission comments following the 2002 amendment to section 69941 make clear that official reporters pro tempore appointed pursuant to section 69941 include both court employees and persons not employed by the court. (Cal. Law Revision Com. com. 2002 Amend., 36G West's Ann. Gov. Code,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   foll. \u00a7 69941, p. 332.) In the Los Angeles County Superior Court, a private reporter retained by a party to serve as an official reporter pro tempore pursuant to section 68086 and rule 2.956 must be appointed by a judicial officer in order to do so. (Los Angeles Superior Court Policy Regarding Normal Availability of Official Court Reporters and Privately Arranged Court Reporters.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Statutes setting court reporter fees in specified counties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The trial court concluded that its interpretation of sections 69950 and 69954 was supported by other provisions of the Government Code (specifically, tit. 8, ch. 5, art. 10-12) that apply article 9 fee provisions to court reporters in specified counties. The trial court reasoned: \"These provisions underscore the Legislature's intent to ensure that rates charged within each County were uniform. The need to establish uniform rates charged in each courtroom and to prevent salaried court reporters within the same courthouse or the same County from competing with one another by charging different rates explains the Legislature's decision to regulate rates charged by official court reporters. The same concerns are not present with respect to non-salaried official reporters pro tempore.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The statutory provisions referred to by the trial court contradict rather than support its interpretation. The statutes governing court reporter fees in Merced County (\u00a7 70045.4, subd. (c)), Nevada County (\u00a7 70045.75, subd. (c)), El Dorado County (\u00a7 70045.77, subd. (c)), Butte County (\u00a7 70045.8, subd. (d)), Tehama County (\u00a7 70045.10, subd. (c)), and Madera County (\u00a7 70045.12, subd. (d)), all provide that official reporters pro tempore \"shall be paid in accordance with the per diem, transcription, and other fee provisions of Article 9 (commencing with section 69941 ) of this chapter.\" Applying statutory rates to pro tempore reporters is consistent with the goal of establishing uniform rates within a given county and across county lines. That goal is more effectively achieved by applying the statutory rates to pro tempore reporters who receive only temporary appointments to serve as court reporters in civil proceedings and who are more likely to move from courthouse to courthouse within a given county or across county lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Court Reporters Board of California interpretation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The trial court's interpretation of sections 69950 and 69954 conflicts with that of Court Reporters Board of California, the agency statutorily authorized to license and discipline court reporters in California. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 8008, subd. (b) ; Gov. Code, \u00a7 69942.) Since at least 1999, the Board has interpreted sections 69950 and 699554 to apply to both official reporters and official reporters pro tempore. The Board confirmed this interpretation in a letter to court reporters dated May 14, 2012, stating: \"The fees set by statute that\n   a licensee may charge for acting as official or official pro tempore reporters have not changed since the issuance of the Board's interpretation in its letter dated December 7, 1999.\" The Board reaffirmed its interpretation in letters dated August 26, 2015, and November 25, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In a spring 2012 newsletter, the Board advised court reporters that \"there is no statutory exception for freelancers going in to court. If there is a privately-hired court reporter producing an official record, that reporter is considered a pro tempore and is the official court reporter of record for that proceeding, and statutory transcript rates would apply.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Board recognized that while statutory transcription fees apply to both court-employed and privately retained court reporters, privately retained reporters are not subject to limitations on appearance or per diem fees: \"The amount that a privately-hired court reporter may charge for an appearance fee to work in court is not set in statute, unlike the transcript rates which apply to every court proceeding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Board's interpretation, while not binding on this court, warrants consideration and some deference. (\n   <em>\n    Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. of Equalization\n   </em>\n   (1998)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1709348\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/19/1/#p7\">\n    19 Cal.4th 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7-8,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%201\">\n    78 Cal.Rptr.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=960%20P.2d%201031\">\n    960 P.2d 1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The Board's longstanding interpretation is consistent with the plain language of sections 69950 and 69954, which does not distinguish between privately retained and court-employed official court reporters pro tempore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. Public policy concerns\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The parties and amici advance various arguments as to whether imposition of statutory transcription fees on privately retained reporters serving as official reporters pro tempore promotes or undermines public policy. We address only two of these arguments-(1) whether imposing\n   statutory transcription rates on privately retained reporters pro tempore interferes with the constitutional right to freedom of contract, and (2) whether imposing statutory transcription rates on private reporters will result in a shortage of official reporters pro tempore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Freedom of contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Sections 69950 and 69954 regulate only transcription fees for proceedings in the superior court. The statutes do not prevent a private reporter from charging contract rates for court appearances and costs incurred while serving as an official reporter pro tempore or for producing deposition transcripts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendant and its amici acknowledge that freedom of contract is not absolute and unqualified, but is subject to a variety of restraints, including the exercise of legislative authority. (\n   <em>\n    In re Application of Alexander\n   </em>\n   (1933)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2248712\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app/128/651/#p654\">\n    128 Cal.App. 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 654,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20P.2d%20410\">\n    18 P.2d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Unless it is shown that the restraints imposed by the statutes at issue are unreasonable or unjustifiable, we must presume that the legislature determined them to be necessary for the general welfare of the people. (See\n   <em>\n    Lockheed Aircraft Corp. v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (1946)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2209257\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/28/481/#p486\">\n    28 Cal.2d 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 486,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=171%20P.2d%2021\">\n    171 P.2d 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Privately retained reporters who serve as official reporters pro tempore do so under appointment by the superior court. ( \u00a7\u00a7 69941, 70044.) By accepting that appointment, persons serving as official reporters pro tempore become ministerial\n   officers of the court and are subject to the jurisdiction of the court during the period of their appointment to the same extent as an official reporter. (See\n   <em>\n    Serrano v. Stefan Merli Plastering Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   (2008)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049454\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/162/1014/#p1038\">\n    162 Cal.App.4th 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1038-1039,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20559\">\n    76 Cal.Rptr.3d 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [noting that deposition reporters are ministerial officers of the court]; see also Los Angeles Superior Court \"Order Appointing Court Approved Reporter as Official Reporter Pro Tempore,\" LACIV 237 (Rev. 01/16), in which the reporter \"confirms and agrees ... to follow directions from the Court, and to be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court to the same extent as an official reporter\".)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Resulting shortage of official reporters pro tempore\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendant and its amici contend that application of sections 69950 and 69954 to private reporters will disincentivize private reporters from serving as official reporters pro tempore, resulting in a dearth of reporters willing to do so and adversely impacting the administration of justice. The plain language of sections 69950 and 69954 apply the statutory transcription rates to reporters serving as official reporters or as official reporters pro\n   tempore in the superior courts, regardless of whether they are employed by the court or privately retained by a party. If application of the statutes results in unintended adverse consequences, it is for the legislature, and not the courts to remedy the problem. (\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Workers' Comp.
