The Court held a hearing on the motion on March 16, 2018. The Court denied the motion, dismissed the indictment, and ordered Mr. Rangel released. This order memorializes and supplements the Court's oral ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant Efren Suarez Rangel is a citizen of Mexico present in the United States illegally. Mr. Rangel was indicted on charges of two counts of distribution of 50 grams or more of actual methamphetamine in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(b)(1)(A)(viii) and (b)(1)(B)(viiii). While in custody on these charges, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) placed a detainer on Mr. Rangel. Following a detention hearing, Magistrate Judge Dimke ordered Mr. Rangel released on bond subject to conditions imposed in her order of release pursuant to the Bail Reform Act (BRA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ICE took custody of Mr. Rangel upon his release from Department of Justice (DOJ) custody and transported him to Tacoma, where he was detained pending removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Although ICE elected to pursue immigration proceedings, the USAO did not dismiss the criminal indictment. As a result, on March 1, 2018, the Court held a pretrial conference in the criminal matter and Mr. Rangel failed to appear. Both parties acknowledged Mr. Rangel's absence was due to his detention in ICE custody. The Court issued a warrant for Mr. Rangel's arrest. When Mr. Rangel appeared on the arrest warrant, the USAO once again moved for Mr. Rangel's pretrial detention, giving rise to the instant proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the detention hearing, the USAO indicated that ICE intends to reassume custody of Mr. Rangel if he is once again released pending trial. Accordingly, in addition to reviewing Mr. Rangel's eligibility for pretrial release under the BRA, this\n   matter also requires the Court to resolve the conflict between the USAO and ICE in the execution of their respective statutory mandates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 10, 2018, Mr. Rangel was indicted on two counts of distribution of 50 grams or more of actual methamphetamine in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(b)(1)(A)(viii) and (b)(1)(B)(viiii).

The Court directed issuance of a no bail arrest warrant based on Mr. Rangel's failure to appear. ECF No. 38. The Court denied defense counsel's motion to continue because Mr. Rangel had not executed a speedy trial waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mr. Rangel was processed on the warrant on March 4, 2018, and transferred back into the custody of the United States Marshals Service.

Mr. Rangel is entitled to pretrial release under the BRA.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The magistrate court determined that Mr. Rangel was entitled to pretrial release subject to conditions pursuant to the BRA. The USAO did not appeal this decision. However, the matter of Mr. Rangel's detention is once again open for review following his appearance on the Court's arrest warrant following the pretrial conference. The USAO urges this Court to disregard the magistrate's previous order and grant its motion for pretrial detention. While the Court has undertaken an independent review of Mr. Rangel's eligibility for pretrial detention, it ultimately reaches the same conclusion as Magistrate Judge Dimke: Mr. Rangel is entitled to pretrial release because the USAO cannot meet its burden to show that no condition or set of conditions can reasonably ensure his appearance or the safety of the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The BRA dictates that a defendant is entitled to pretrial release unless a judicial officer judge finds that \"no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). To determine whether conditions of release could reasonably assure Defendant's appearance in court and the safety of the community, the Court considers four factors: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the weight of the evidence against the defendant; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger the defendant would present to the community if released.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3142(g). The weight to be accorded to each factor rests in the Court's discretion.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gentry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5171696\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/455/1018/#p1020\">\n    455 F.Supp.2d 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1020 (D. Ariz. 2006). However, the Ninth Circuit has directed that the weight of the evidence is the least important factor.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Motamedi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"349099\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/767/1403/#p1407\">\n    767 F.2d 1403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1407 (9th Cir. 1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The BRA provides for a rebuttable presumption of pretrial detention for defendants accused of committing certain offenses.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Because Mr. Rangel was indicted for violations of the Controlled Substances Act with a maximum sentence of greater than ten years, a rebuttable presumption of detention without bail applies in this case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3142(e). This presumption shifts a burden of production to Mr. Rangel, but the burden of persuasion remains with the USAO.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hir\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5871131\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/517/1081/#p1086\">\n    517 F.3d 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1086 (9th Cir. 2008). \"The presumption is not erased when a defendant proffers evidence to rebut it; rather the presumption 'remains in the case as an evidentiary finding militating against release, to be weighed along with other evidence relevant to the factors listed in \u00a7 3142(g).' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5871131\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/517/1081/#p1086\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The alleged offenses concern multiple transactions involving relatively significant amounts of methamphetamine. ECF No. 1. Although the least important factor in the analysis, the weight of the evidence alleged in this case appears to be fairly substantial. The USAO asserts that officers\n   recovered roughly six pounds of methamphetamine and approximately twenty-thousand dollars from Mr. Rangel's residence. ECF No. 50 at 9-10. The Court considers the presumption implicated under \u00a7 3142(e) as a further indication of the seriousness of the crimes alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The next factor, Mr. Rangel's personal history and characteristics, strongly favors pretrial release. Mr. Rangel has presented evidence of his ties to the community and demonstrated commitment to remaining in the area. Mr. Rangel originally came to the United States illegally in 1994 and has not returned to Mexico since. His parents, siblings, children, and wife all live in the Tri-Cities area. Mr. Rangel maintained a full time job as a farm equipment operator for the past seven years, and his employer submitted a letter in support of his release. Based on Mr. Rangel's very strong ties to the area and the fact that he has made no prior attempts to return to Mexico, the Court finds it is highly unlikely that he will flee if released pretrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   With respect to the last factor, the USAO has presented no evidence that Mr. Rangel poses an ongoing threat to any individual or the community. There are no allegations before the Court related to firearms, prior crimes of violence, or threats to other individuals. It is also notable that Mr. Rangel has no prior criminal record with the exception of an infraction over ten years ago for using a cell phone while driving. In recognition of this, the pretrial services report indicates release with standard and special conditions as a possibility for mitigating any remaining concerns regarding continued appearance or ongoing criminal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Having conducted an independent review of the factors outlined above, the Court finds that the balance of the factors weighs in favor of Mr. Rangel's pretrial release. Although the nature of the offense and the weight of the evidence favor continued detention, Mr. Rangel's personal history and characteristics combined with the relatively low threat he poses if released favor pretrial release. The BRA makes clear that \"[o]nly in rare cases should release be denied, and doubts regarding the propriety of pretrial release are to be resolved in favor of the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Santos-Flores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4286743\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/1088/#p1090\">\n    794 F.3d 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1090 (9th Cir. 2015) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Chavez\n   </em>\n   -Rivas,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669295\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/536/962/#p965\">\n    536 F.Supp.2d 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 965 (E.D. Wis. 2008) (observing that \"the court must resolve all doubts regarding the propriety of release in the defendant's favor\"). Accordingly, the Court finds that Mr. Rangel is entitled to pretrial release under the BRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Mr. Rangel's detention in ICE custody violates his right to pretrial release under the BRA.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At the detention hearing, the USAO explained that, if Mr. Rangel is again released pending trial, ICE intends to reassume custody of Mr. Rangel pending his removal. This is consistent with ICE's actions following Mr. Rangel's initial pretrial release. However, such pretrial detention violates Mr. Rangel's rights under the BRA, which requires the executive to elect removal in lieu of criminal prosecution or defer removal until after trial and sentencing are complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   If a defendant is entitled to pretrial release under the BRA, that defendant may not be detained in immigration custody while the criminal case is pending. As noted above, the BRA establishes a framework for the pretrial status of defendants evidencing a strong preference for pretrial release. Section 3142(a) provides judicial officers with four options for a defendant's pretrial status: release on recognizance, release on conditions, temporary detention to permit deportation/removal,\n   and detention. Section 3142(b) states that a defendant shall be released on personal recognizance unless no condition or set of conditions can reasonably assure the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community. Section 3142(c) lists the conditions of release that may be imposed if the defendant is not released under subsection (b) with the mandate that the court should impose the least restrictions necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Section 3142(d) makes the dichotomous nature of criminal and immigration proceedings clear. Under this section, if a judicial officer determines that (a) the defendant is not a citizen of the United States or lawfully admitted for permanent residence, and (b) he may flee or pose a danger to any other person or the community, then the judicial officer \"shall order the detention of such person for a period of not more than ten days.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). During this period of detention, ICE may elect to take the defendant into immigration custody to pursue immigration proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If, however, ICE \"fails or declines to take such person into custody during that period, such person shall be treated in accordance with the other provisions of this section, notwithstanding the applicability of other provisions of law governing release pending trial or deportation or exclusion proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The language in \u00a7 3142(d) thus makes clear that when a defendant is treated \"in accordance with the provisions of\" the BRA, \"other provisions of law governing release pending trial or deportation or exclusion proceedings\" do not apply. In other words, if the BRA applies, statutes governing detention related to immigration proceedings do not. The BRA applies whenever a defendant is brought before a judicial officer for having committed an offense against the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203141\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (referencing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203041\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The contrapositive of this statement instructs that if the rules governing deportation or immigration proceedings apply, the BRA does not. The upshot of this is simple: the BRA requires the Executive Branch to decide between pursuing a criminal prosecution or immigration proceedings. The Executive cannot pursue both at the same time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Section 3142(d)'s title reaffirms this interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Almendarez-Torres v.

The USAO argues that this distinction is significant because the criminal charge for illegal reentry and administrative consequence of removal are two paths to remedy the same conduct. However, the criminal conduct charged does not impact the statutory analysis under the BRA. Instead, each decision cited above turned on the fact that the BRA prohibits ICE from detaining a criminal defendant for any purpose other than deportation or removal. Thus, in each of the above-cited cases, the outcome was driven by the courts' assessment that the executive must elect whether to pursue immigration proceedings or criminal prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The conclusion that the BRA requires the executive branch to defer removal proceedings when DOJ elects to pursue criminal prosecution is also supported by other regulations authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Deportation control orders provide perhaps the most persuasive example.

The regulations further instruct ICE not to remove such a defendant without the prosecuting official's consent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20215\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These regulations indicate the Executive Branch's determination that criminal proceedings take priority over deportation or removal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trujillo-Alvarez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3803028\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/900/1167/#p1179\">\n    900 F.Supp.2d at 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, this reading of the BRA promotes judicial economy and the primacy of a defendant's constitutional rights when facing trial. As this case aptly demonstrates, permitting the executive to proceed concurrently with a criminal prosecution and removal proceedings would result in a substantial waste of government resources. In this case, both ICE and the United States Marshals Service have expended significant resources transporting Mr. Rangel between this district and the immigration detention center in Tacoma. The Court has held two separate detention hearings over the course of five days with respect to Mr. Rangel's detention pending trial. Likewise, Mr. Rangel's detention out of district has imposed substantial barriers to his ability to effectively consult with his court appointed counsel and present a defense to the charges he faces. Although Tacoma is not substantially farther than other areas court-appointed attorneys are expected to travel in this district, the fact remains that Mr. Rangel was detained out of district. Detaining criminal defendants out of district has the potential to disproportionately affect indigent defendants whose court-appointed attorneys do not have the time or resources to undertake out-of-district travel on a regular basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Dismissal of the indictment is the only remedy for the ongoing violation of Mr. Rangel's right to pretrial release under the BRA.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Because ICE cannot, or will not, work cooperatively with the USAO to provide for Mr. Rangel's criminal prosecution in compliance with the BRA, the Court must fashion an appropriate remedy. \"Dismissal is appropriate when the investigatory or prosecutorial process has\n   violated a federal constitutional or statutory right and no lesser remedial action is available.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Barrera-Moreno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525222\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/951/1089/#p1092\">\n    951 F.2d 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1092 (9th Cir. 1991).

In the past, the Ninth Circuit read\n   <em>\n    Hasting\n   </em>\n   as limiting the court's inherent powers to these \"three specific areas.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W.R. Grace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047655\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/526/499/\">\n    526 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   509 n.9. However, the court has since changed course and now recognizes that nothing in\n   <em>\n    Hasting\n   </em>\n   limits the court's supervisory powers to the three mentioned areas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047655\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/526/499/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In its supplemental briefing, the USAO suggests that the Court could issue a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum to secure custody of Mr. Rangel in the days leading up to and throughout trial. ECF No. 57 at 4. While this proposed remedy would ensure Mr. Rangel's physical presence in the district-a substantial improvement on conditions to date-it would not remedy the prejudice imposed on Mr. Rangel by his pretrial detention. First, a writ would not solve the ongoing violation of Mr. Rangel's statutory right to pretrial release under the BRA. A writ will transfer custody of Mr. Rangel from DHS to DOJ. However, this Court has already ordered that Mr. Rangel be released on bond pending trial. DOJ cannot detain Mr. Rangel pending trial and comply with the Court's order directing pretrial release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Speedy trial considerations also preclude alternative remedies. Trial in this matter is set for March 26, 2018. The Speedy Trial Act requires that the USAO try Mr. Rangel on or before March 29, 2018. Thus, on the date of the detention hearing, Mr. Rangel had only one business week to consult with his attorney and prepare for trial. If the Court allowed the prosecution to proceed, Mr. Rangel would be effectively forced to choose between his Sixth Amendment right to consult with counsel to prepare an effective defense and his right to a speedy trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Likewise, the remedy imposed by other courts facing similar violations is not viable in this case. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Trujillo-Alvarez\n   </em>\n   , for example, the district court provided the executive a period of time to elect whether to pursue immigration proceedings or to proceed with the criminal prosecution. This remedy is once again ineffective given the Speedy Trial Act deadlines in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Because the Court finds no lesser remedy available, dismissal of the indictment is appropriate under the Court's supervisory powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n   USAO's Motion for Pretrial Detention,\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 41\n   </strong>\n   , is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n   The Indictment, ECF No. 1, is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n   Defendant Efren Suarez Rangel is ordered\n   <strong>\n    RELEASED\n   </strong>\n   from custody.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n   The Clerk's Office is directed to enter this Order and provide copies to all counsel, Magistrate Judge Dimke, and the United States Marshals Service.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
