This is an especially difficult duty when the machinery of the judicial system itself appears to have played a role in the claimant's mistaken view of the applicable legal requirements. The somber circumstances of the instant case present one such scenario: Plaintiff Asfaneh Azadeh has sued the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran (\"Iran\") and the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution (\"Islamic Revolutionary Guard\" or collectively \"Defendants\") for the uncontested and inhumane atrocities she suffered during the three months she spent wrongfully imprisoned in an Iranian jail, but she cannot\n   obtain the judgment she seeks and may well deserve, without strict adherence to the procedural requirements of the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act (\"FSIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Azadeh undertook to satisfy the FSIA's personal-jurisdiction prescriptions by serving her complaint on Iran pursuant to Title 28 sections 1330(b) and 1608 of the United States Code, in conjunction with guidance on the subject that appeared on the United States District Court for District of Columbia's website; however, in so doing, Azadeh effected service under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   attempting service under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3), which the law does not permit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barot v.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 18, 2016, Azadeh filed a civil complaint against Iran and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard in this Court, bringing various tort claims under federal and state law arising from the torture she allegedly experienced during a three-month detention in Evin Prison. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 51-81.) Among other things, Azadeh was repeatedly \"subjected to mock executions ... [and] hours-long interrogations during which she was beaten, whipped, threatened, and intimidated.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.) She was also \"poisoned and forced to take 'truth pills' on a daily bas is[,] ... [and she] lived in\" an unsanitary \"cell that was a mere six feet wide\" without lighting, windows, or a bed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Azadeh's captors regularly woke her in the middle of the night (Decl. of Asfaneh Azadeh, ECF No. 12-2, \u00b6 24); denied her necessary medical treatment (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 32); [redacted]; subjected her to extreme psychological abuse (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-29, 37, 39); [redacted]. Thus, Azadeh's lawsuit brings claims against Iran and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard for torture, assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and false imprisonment. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-81), and seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   (Prayer for Relief) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 4, 2016, Azadeh attempted to serve her complaint on Iran and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4), by having the clerk of the court send two copies of the summons, complaint, notice of suit, and a translation of those documents to the Director of Special Consular Services within the State Department, who was to transmit one copy of these documents to Defendants through\n   diplomatic channels. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aff. Requesting Foreign Mailing, ECF No. 5, at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Azadeh attempted service in this manner first-rather than starting with service by mail under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) -largely due to a statement contained in \"the\n   <em>\n    Attorney Manual for Service of Process on a Foreign Defendant\n   </em>\n   , issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia[,]\" which appeared to authorize this course of action. (Pl.'s Resp. to Order to Show Cause, ECF No. 20, at 2-3.) At the time that Azadeh consulted it, the\n   <em>\n    Manual\n   </em>\n   stated in relevant part that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [t]he countries of Iran and Iraq have not objected to service by mail. However, many attempts at service by mail or courier are unsuccessful. Therefore, it is okay for an attorney to request service directly through diplomatic channels (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) ) without attempting service under any other provision first.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Azadeh made such a request for diplomatic services, as mentioned, and the clerk of the court complied. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Certificate of Clerk, ECF No. 6, at 1.) Then, on February 1, 2017, the State Department indicated that it had transmitted Azadeh's documents through diplomatic channels to the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 17, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Return of Service and Aff., ECF No. 8, at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Believing that she had properly served Iran, and knowing that neither Iran nor the Islamic Revolutionary Guard had responded to her complaint, Azadeh petitioned the clerk for an entry of default on March 22, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aff. for Default, ECF No. 10.) The clerk of the court entered the requested default the very next day. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Entry of Default, ECF No. 11.) Azadeh subsequently moved for a default judgment against Defendants (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. for Default J. (\"Pl.'s Mot.\"), ECF No. 13, at 1), after which this Court referred the entire matter to Magistrate Judge Harvey for full case management (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   October 10, 2017 Minute Entry).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 13, 2018, Magistrate Judge Harvey issued a fifty-three page R &amp; R recommending that Plaintiff Azadeh's motion for a default judgment be granted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at 2.) Magistrate Judge Harvey addressed various legal issues in reaching this conclusion, and ultimately determined that (1) the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over the instant dispute under the FSIA (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    at 20-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ); (2) the Court may properly exercise personal jurisdiction over Defendants consistent with the FSIA (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    at 27-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ); (3) Defendants are in fact liable to Azadeh for an array of tortious actions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    at 33-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ); and (4) Azadeh is entitled to damages consisting of $13,028,889 for her pain and suffering, $5,176,733 in economic damages, and a punitive damages award of $18,205,622 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    at 38-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Moreover, as relevant here, Magistrate Judge Harvey specifically grappled with the issue of what steps are required to serve a foreign sovereign under the FSIA, and, prior to reaching his conclusions regarding personal jurisdiction, he expressly required Azadeh to effect service by mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To be specific, on April 23, 2018, Magistrate Judge Harvey expressed to Azadeh his concern that she had only attempted to serve the defendants through diplomatic channels under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4), and was thus seeking a default judgment without having attempted to serve Iran or the Islamic Revolutionary Guard under section 1608(a)(3). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order to Show Cause, ECF No. 17, at 1-2 (explaining that \"recent decisions from this Court have held that service on Iran may not be perfected solely via diplomatic channels pursuant to section 1608(a)(4)\"; rather, \"service [must]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   be attempted first via a form of mail requiring a signed receipt pursuant to section 1608(a)(3)\").) Azadeh responded to Magistrate Judge Harvey's order by claiming,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that \"[i]t is highly prejudicial to Ms. Azadeh to inform her, well over a year after service was made under (a)(4), that she first should have attempted service under (a)(3), despite what the [c]ourt's own Attorney Manual provides and despite the [c]ourt's practice in other cases\" (Pl.'s Resp. to Order to Show Cause at 14), and she further argued that \"the Court should not require service to be made again\" under section 1608(a)(4) (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the meantime, on May 4, 2018, Azadeh asked the clerk of the court to mail one copy of the summons, complaint, and a translation of each to Iran's ministry of affairs, pursuant to the procedure laid out in section 1608(a)(3). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Affs. Requesting Foreign Mailing, ECF Nos. 21 &amp; 22.) On May 29, 2018, Azadeh reported that this service by mail \"was attempted and refused on May 20, 2018[,]\" and she thereby established that service could not be made under section 1608(a)(3) in the instant case. (Pl.'s 2d Status Report, ECF No. 25, at 2.) Azadeh also insisted that \"the [c]ourt should not require Plaintiff to again serve through diplomatic channels under [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) ].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Magistrate Judge Harvey agreed that Azadeh's service should be considered sufficient at that point, and issued the aforementioned R &amp; R on June 13, 2018. In regard to the FSIA's personal jurisdiction requirements, the R &amp; R asserts that \"Plaintiff's efforts at service to date [should] be deemed sufficient under section 1608(a) for entry of a default judgment against Defendants\" (R &amp; R at 32), for a number of reasons. First, the R &amp; R reasons that section 1608(a) can be interpreted as setting forth service requirements that appear in \" 'descending order of\n   <em>\n    preference\n   </em>\n   ,' not obligation[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Barot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183426,4222387\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/26/\">\n    785 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   27 ).) In addition, the R &amp; R contends that, given Azadeh's prior compliance with the diplomatic channels requirement (to which defendants did not respond), there was \"no reason to believe the outcome\" of such service \"would be any different\" the second time around, and no \"conceivable purpose\" existed for making Azadeh go through such an \"empty gesture[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The R &amp; R also emphasized that Azadeh had only undertaken good-faith efforts to serve Defendants (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33), and that she had done so partly based on the erroneous districtwide guidance laid out in the\n   <em>\n    Attorney Manual for Service of Process on a Foreign Defendant\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183426,4222387\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/26/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Moreover, the R &amp; R observed that Azadeh would likely suffer severe prejudice if she was required to proceed to serve defendants again under section 1608(a)(4) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183426,4222387\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/26/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183426,4222387\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/26/\">\n    at 32-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), because embarking upon any such effort would mean that she would likely miss the predetermined September 2018 deadline to submit her claim (accompanied by a judgment in her favor in this matter) to the United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund for payment (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183426,4222387\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/26/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183426,4222387\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/26/\">\n    at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Taken together, these significant considerations persuaded the Magistrate Judge that the equities \"weighed in favor of finding Plaintiff's service on Defendants sufficient[,]\" and thus, he recommended that \"this Court find that it has personal jurisdiction under the FSIA over Defendants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.) To this day, neither Iran nor the Islamic Revolutionary Guard has appeared in the instant matter, and their fourteen-day window to object to the Magistrate Judge's R &amp; R has now passed. This Court is also unaware of any additional effort by Azadeh to effect service through diplomatic channels under section 1608(a)(4), after the unsuccessful mailing of her documents to Iran and the Islamic\n   Revolutionary Guard under section 1608(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

But this fact is unavailing, because courts in this district have long recognized that the\n   <em>\n    Manual\n   </em>\n   's advice is wrong in this regard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Karcher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274274\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/249/557/#p560\">\n    249 F.Supp.3d at 558-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the\n   <em>\n    Attorney Manual\n   </em>\n   wrongly suggests that a plaintiff need not attempt service under section 1608(a)(3) when suing Iran);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Estate of Hirshfeld\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268035\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/235/45/#p47\">\n    235 F.Supp.3d at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same);\n   <em>\n    Revlas\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-cv-01752, (D.D.C.

Even more important, the\n   <em>\n    Manual\n   </em>\n   's misleading advice has resulted in a lack of personal jurisdiction over Iran that is not a waivable or otherwise excusable defect in this context.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowles v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at 32.) To date, Azadeh has not successfully re-served Defendants under section 1608(a)(4), and because the prior diplomatic service was invalid due to her failure to undertake first service by mail under section 1608(a)(3), as far as the statutory scheme is concerned, Azadeh has yet to complete the final method of service-the diplomatic route that section 1608(a)(4) prescribes. It is clear that Congress meant for section 1608(a) to establish a relative\n   <em>\n    hierarchy\n   </em>\n   of service methods-in \"descending order of preference[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Barot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183426,4222387\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/26/\">\n    785 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   27 -and that alone suggests that a plaintiff may not opt to serve a foreign defendant\n   <em>\n    out of order, i.e.\n   </em>\n   , by pursuing a\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   preferred method first, in contravention of the express language of the statute. Indeed, shortly after stating that section 1608(a)\"provides four methods of service in descending order of preference,\" the D.C. Circuit specifically asserts that a plaintiff can only pursue service under section 1608(a)(4)\"\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   none of the first three methods works.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183426,4222387\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/26/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, contrary to the R &amp; R's reasoning, the availability of service under section 1608(a)(4) is expressly conditioned upon a plaintiff's failed efforts to serve a foreign sovereign under the other three prior subsections of section 1608(a) -which is precisely what the statutory text states and what the D.C. Circuit's prior pronouncements establish.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Angellino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3498333,5869991\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/688/771/\">\n    688 F.3d at 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The R &amp; R also proffers several additional reasons that \"Plaintiff's efforts at service to date [should] be deemed sufficient[,]\" none of which are sufficient to yield that result. (R &amp; R at 32.) For example, the R &amp; R observes that Azadeh \"successfully served the summons and complaint on Defendants in January 2017 via diplomatic channels under \u00a7 1608(a)(4),\" and asserts that \"no conceivable purpose-or interest of Defendants-would be served by requiring her\" to undertake the process laid out in section 1608(a)(4) once again. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But the D.C. Circuit has explicitly foreclosed such reasoning. First in\n   <em>\n    Transaero\n   </em>\n   and then again in\n   <em>\n    Barot\n   </em>\n   , the Circuit made clear that neither a plaintiff's \"substantial compliance\" with the requirements of section 1608(a) nor a defendant's \"actual notice\" of the pertinent lawsuit obviates the need to strictly adhere to section 1608(a)'s mandates.\n   <em>\n    Barot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183426,4222387\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/26/\">\n    785 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   27 ;\n   <em>\n    Transaero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3613963,10523486\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/30/148/\">\n    30 F.3d at 153-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, it does not matter that Azadeh\n   <em>\n    almost\n   </em>\n   complied with the service requirements laid out in section 1608(a), or that Iran and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard are aware of this lawsuit by virtue of her prior success in providing notice through diplomatic channels; unfortunately, with respect to serving a foreign state under section 1608(a), a near miss is still a miss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Hirshfeld\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268035\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/235/45/#p47\">\n    235 F.Supp.3d at 47-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (refusing to find effective service given that the plaintiff successfully served the foreign state under section 1608(a)(4) before ever attempting service under section 1608(a)(3) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Transaero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3613963,10523486\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/30/148/\">\n    30 F.3d at 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[L]eniency ... would disorder the statutory scheme.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The R &amp; R likewise laments the prejudice that Azadeh will suffer if she\n   must once again attempt to serve Iran and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard through diplomatic channels. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at 31 (noting that requiring Azadeh to \"serve Defendants again via diplomatic channels ... would in all likelihood result in Plaintiff missing\" the pertinent claims deadline for the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, thus \"denying her the most realistic path for recovery on any judgment\").) Magistrate Judge Harvey may well be right that such prejudice is especially undeserved in this case, because Azadeh \"fairly read\" the district court's\n   <em>\n    Attorney Manual\n   </em>\n   to suggest that a plaintiff need not attempt to serve Iran under section 1608(a)(3) before proceeding to serve Iran under section 1608(a)(4). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.) But as this Court reads the law, the regrettable and even potentially unfair prejudice to Azadeh under these circumstances cannot excuse her failure to follow the FSIA's prescriptions. This Court simply cannot exercise personal jurisdiction that it does not have, even if equity would warrant doing so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573311\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/205/#p214\">\n    551 U.S. at 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573311\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/205/#p214\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At most, the Court can take this opportunity to emphasize that Azadeh has proceeded in good faith at all relevant times, and that her mistakes of service are ones in which the U.S. district court itself has played a \"prominent role[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Barot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183426,4222387\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/26/\">\n    785 F.3d at 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in the hope that such considerations will spur the Special Master who administers the Fund to grant Azadeh \"a reasonable extension of [the] deadline\" to file her claim, if necessary,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020144\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(B). And, if the Special Master does so, the prejudice to Azadeh from having to once again undertake service of process under section 1608(a)(4) will be greatly reduced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For the reasons explained above, Azadeh's service upon Iran and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard was defective, and this Court cannot yet exercise personal jurisdiction over Defendants pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201330\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Again, Azadeh has proceeded at all times in good faith and the risk of substantial prejudice to her if she proceeds to re-serve Defendants under section 1608(a)(4) is apparent. Once Azadeh has effected service upon Defendants through that section, this Court will move with the greatest possible haste to address any subsequent motion for a default judgment, which should provide grounds for the Special Master to consider, and grant, any necessary application by Azadeh for an extension of time to file her claims with the Fund.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
