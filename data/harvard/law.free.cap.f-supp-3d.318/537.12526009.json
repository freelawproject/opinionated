The movants are Aurelius Investment, LLC, Aurelius Opportunities Fund, LLC, and Lex Claims, LLC (collectively, \"Aurelius\").

Aurelius argues that the requirements of Title III are not satisfied in this case because the Oversight Board, as currently constituted, is itself an unlawful entity.

The Appointments Clause distinguishes between \"principal officers,\" who must be nominated by President with advice and consent of the Senate, and \"inferior officers,\" who may be appointed by the \"President alone, Courts of Law, or Heads of Departments.\" U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Aurelius argues principally that the Appointments Clause procedures were mandatory notwithstanding PROMESA's statutory appointment provisions because the members of the Oversight Board are either (i) principal \"Officers of the United States\" who could only be validly appointed\n   through presidential nomination and Senate confirmation or, in the alternative, (ii) inferior officers of the United States whose appointment was improperly delegated to the President. (Mot. to Dismiss at 13.) Aurelius requests that the Court dismiss the Title III Petition and terminate this proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The United States, which has exercised its statutory authority to intervene in these proceedings to defend PROMESA's constitutionality (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202403\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ), argues that PROMESA's appointment mechanism is not subject to the Appointments Clause because (i) the Oversight Board members are territorial officers rather than \"Officers of the United States,\" and (ii) the Appointments Clause does not govern the appointment of such territorial officers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   U.S. Mem. of Law.) In support of its position, the United States cites historical practice and argues that Congress's plenary power over the territories is not subject to the distribution of powers provisions that regulate the federal government. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-15.) The Oversight Board primarily raises the same argument. (Docket Entry No. 1622, the \"FOMB Opposition,\" at 7-21.) In addition, the Oversight Board contends that (i) the Appointments Clause does not constitute a \"fundamental\" constitutional provision and, as such, it does not apply to Puerto Rico, and (ii) even if the Appointments Clause is applicable, the Oversight Board members were properly appointed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-31.) The other opponents raise substantially similar arguments to those advanced by the United States and the Oversight Board. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   , Docket Entry Nos. 1610, 1629, 1631, 1634, 1638, 1640.) The Oversight Board, the Committee and AAFAF further argue that the Court should hold the Oversight Board's past actions\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facto\n   </em>\n   valid in the event that the Court finds the Oversight Board's appointment unconstitutional.

If such compliance was required, the Court must examine whether the process that was undertaken pursuant to PROMESA was sufficient to meet the constitutional requirement and, if the process was not compliant, whether the Petition must be dismissed as noncompliant with PROMESA. The Court turns now to the principal question. Because Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States, rather than a state, or part of the federal government, and because Congress identified the Constitution's Territories Clause as the source of its authority in enacting PROMESA, the Court looks first to the text and historical interpretation and application of the Territories Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Congress's Power Under the Territories Clause\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Territories Clause of Article IV of the Constitution vests Congress with the \"[p]ower to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.\" U.S. Const., Art.

Aurelius argues, nonetheless, that the appointment of Oversight Board members is governed by Article II of the Constitution which, according to Aurelius, requires unfettered nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate of Oversight Board members as principal officers of the United States. Aurelius urges this proposition on the basis of (i) the federal (as opposed to territorial) authority of the appointing institution, (ii) what Aurelius characterizes as federal control and supervision of the Oversight Board's operations, and (iii) Oversight Board authority that Aurelius contends extends beyond local territorial matters. (Mot. to Dismiss at 18.) The United States, the Oversight Board, and other opponents point to similar factors in arguing that the Oversight Board is territorial and its members lawfully appointed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   While neither the parties nor the Court's own research has identified a definitive set of factors relevant to the determination of whether an entity is territorial or federal, many of the factors argued by the parties have been considered in connection with controversies over whether congressionally created entities are private or governmental.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Having examined the factors argued by the parties, the Court finds that Congress's invocation of the Territories Clause is consistent with the entity it purported to create, that the method of selection that Congress fashioned for the membership of the Oversight Board is consistent with the exercise of plenary congressional power under that Clause, and that neither Presidential nomination nor Senate confirmation\n   of the appointees to the Oversight Board is necessary as a constitutional matter to legitimize the exercise of the Oversight Board's powers under PROMESA because the members of the Oversight Board are not \"Officers of the United States\" subject to the Appointments Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    a.

Can Congress Create an Entity that Is Not Inherently Federal?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Aurelius argues that a fundamental distinction exists between officials appointed by the federal government and those who take their office by virtue of local, territorial authority. (Mot. to Dismiss at 18.) Specifically, Aurelius contends that individuals appointed to their office by the federal government are federal officers, regardless of whether or not the office has federal or national responsibilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) Under the premise advanced by Aurelius, Congress is incapable of both creating and filling a territorial office or entity. Rather, the only officers who may be considered \"territorial\" are those who are popularly elected by the residents of a federal territory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Aurelius' argument that only Puerto Rico itself could have created an entity that was not effectively part of the federal government is unavailing because it ignores both the plenary nature of congressional power under Article IV and the well-rooted jurisprudence, discussed above, that establishes that any powers of\n   self-governance exercised by territorial governments are exercised by virtue of congressional delegation rather than inherent local sovereignty. Thus, creation of an entity such as the Oversight Board through popular election would not change the Oversight Board's ultimate source of authority from a constitutional perspective. Aurelius' argument is therefore meritless. Popular elective authority in territories of the United States derives from Congress, which explicitly states in PROMESA that it has exercised its own power to create a territorial entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Aurelius relies principally on two decisions and historical practice in support of its argument. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19.) It cites\n   <em>\n    Wise v. Withers\n   </em>\n   , in which the Supreme Court concluded that a justice of the peace in the District of Columbia was an \"Officer of the United States\" for purposes of a statute exempting such officers from military service. 7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 331, 335-37,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1427702\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/7/331/\">\n    2 L.Ed. 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1806). The Court did not, however, analyze whether the justice of the peace was an \"Officer of United States\" for constitutional purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, to the extent\n   <em>\n    Wise\n   </em>\n   can be read as establishing that presidential appointment or congressional creation of an office renders the appointee or the institution to which the person is appointed federal, the Supreme Court has deviated from this view in subsequent decisions.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Englebrecht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1134195\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/80/434/\">\n    80 U.S. at 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (presidential appointment of territorial judges does not render their courts \"courts of the United States\" within the meaning of the Constitution). Aurelius also relies on\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hartwell\n   </em>\n   , where the Supreme Court considered whether a clerk employed in the federal Treasury Department was an \"officer\" of the federal government for purposes of federal bank fidelity and embezzlement statutes.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3455321\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/73/385/#p397\">\n    73 U.S. 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 397,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3455321\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/73/385/#p397\">\n    6 Wall. 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3455321\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/73/385/#p397\">\n    18 L.Ed. 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1867). Although the\n   <em>\n    Hartwell\n   </em>\n   Court noted that the defendant had been appointed by \"the head of a department within the meaning of the constitutional provision upon the subject of the appointing power,\" the Court's focus was on the language of the statute and on the general nature of government office, rather than on the Constitutional status of the office held by the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3455321\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/73/385/#p397\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3455321\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/73/385/#p397\">\n    at 393-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No issue was presented as to whether the defendant could have been an officer of any government other than that of the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Turning to historical practice, Aurelius points to territorial offices that were established during the early years of the country's history, including positions with authority over the Northwest Territory. (Mot. to Dismiss at 19.) In the instances Aurelius cites, Congress provided for the government positions and required that the appointees be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Aurelius argues that these historical examples evidence an \"established\" practice and general understanding that federally appointed positions are inherently federal offices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Aurelius further argues that historical practice also indicates that officials who are elected by the people of a territory (or who are appointed by popularly elected representatives) are not officers\n   of the federal government. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Oversight Board, and various parties in interest, fundamentally disagree with Aurelius' position and, instead, argue that the source of an official's appointment is irrelevant in determining whether the office is territorial or federal. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FOMB Opp. at 18.) Noting that \"there is no evidence ... that Congress believed advice and consent was constitutionally required\" in the past instances where Congress decided to require that certain territorial offices be filled through advice and consent (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11), the Oversight Board contends that Aurelius putative distinction between a federally appointed and a popularly elected official is baseless because a territorial \"official's authority\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   derives from Congress.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19 (emphasis in original) (citing\n   <em>\n    Sanchez Valle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172942\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1863/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[Behind] the Puerto Rican people and their Constitution, the 'ultimate' source of prosecutorial power remains the U.S. Congress.\") ).)

The Oversight Board argues,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , that these qualities are not determinative of whether the office is territorial or federal, because federal appointment and removal have historically been common attributes of territorial offices due to Congress's unique role in structuring local governance for federal territories. (FOMB Opp. at 20.) In fact, the United States contends that \"the nature of degree of the Federal Government's supervision of the Oversight Board is consistent with the Oversight's Board territorial character.\" (U.S. Mem. of Law at 23.) These points are well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Furthermore, Aurelius reads excessive significance into the provisions of PROMESA upon which it relies. Although Section 208 of PROMESA does require the \"[Oversight] Board [to make] reports to the President and Congress\" (Mot. to Dismiss at 22), such reports must simultaneously go to the Governor and Legislature.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202148\">\n    48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West 2017). They are no more indicative of supervision by federal authorities than of supervision by the territorial authorities. Indeed, PROMESA's express prohibition of the exercise of control over the Oversight Board by the Governor and Legislature (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202148\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2128(a) ) suggests that the reporting requirement is not an instrument of control or supervision at all. Notably, the statute provides that the Oversight Board may use the reporting mechanism as an opportunity to provide \"recommendations to the President and Congress on changes to [PROMESA] or other Federal laws ... that would assist [Puerto Rico] in complying with any certified Fiscal Plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202148\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2148(a)(3).

Some mechanism for removal was obviously necessary as a practical matter. Provision for removal by the territorial Governor or Legislature would have undermined the express statutory preclusion of the exercise of control by those authorities over the Oversight Board. Removal by act of Congress would have raised practical impediments to swift action when necessary. Delegating removal authority to the President, the most powerful executive officer in the nation, and limiting such removal to circumstances where there is cause, appears to ensure that the power will not be used lightly and is thus consistent with the intended independence of the Oversight Board. The Court finds no basis for interpretation of the removal provision as an indicator of federal control that would render the board members officers of the United States rather than territorial officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Aurelius is correct in asserting that the Oversight Board exercises authority that was \"conferred by a federal statute\" and that the nature of its work often requires the Oversight Board to turn to the requirements specified in a federal statute. That is not, however, remarkable, since the Oversight Board was created as an instrumentality of a territory that is under the sovereign control of the federal government. Congress is capable of operating only through the enactment of legislation. As detailed above, Congress has established the structure of Puerto Rico's local governance on numerous instances and, in each instance, it has done so through the enactment of legislation. Territorial governments are \"the creations, exclusively, of the legislative department\" and the local governance within a federal territory is necessarily derived from Congress.\n   <em>\n    Benner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3353794\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/50/235/#p242\">\n    50 U.S. at 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, the Commonwealth's own constitution was subject to congressional approval prior to becoming effective. The facts that the Oversight Board's authority was conferred upon it by a federal statute and that the statute delineates its duties do not of themselves render the Oversight Board a federal entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    d. Oversight Board's Statutory Objectives and Scope of Authority\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The parties generally agree that the Court should examine the objectives and authority of the Oversight Board to determine whether they are targeted towards purely local matters. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mot. to Dismiss at 18; FOMB Opp. at 14.) The plain language of the statute indicates that the Oversight Board's objectives and authority are centered on Puerto Rico. PROMESA is specifically directed towards federal territories and the purpose of the Oversight Board is confined to an express territorial objective: \"provid[ing] a method for [Puerto Rico] to achieve fiscal responsibility and access to the capital markets.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202121\">\n    48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (West 2017).

The Oversight Board acts as Puerto Rico's representative in invoking the debt adjustment authority of the federal government, just as a private debtor, trustee, or debtor in possession would do in settling an estate or pursuing a reorganization under the federal Bankruptcy Code. Puerto Rican law, as opposed to federal law, prescribes the Oversight Board's investigative authority.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202121\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2124(f). PROMESA's express declaration that the Oversight Board is not a federal agency exempts the Board from numerous federal laws that apply to federal agencies (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") and the Administrative Procedure Act (the \"APA\") ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20551\">\n    5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(c), 552(f) (2017) (FOIA applies to \"each authority of the Government of the United States,\" but not \"the governments of the territories\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(c) (2017) (regarding the APA and providing the same exclusion). While it is true that Congress has chosen to apply federal ethics rules and requirements to the Oversight Board, the invocation of that body of law does not change the substantive focus or nature of the exercise of authority of the Oversight Board to purposes extraneous to Puerto Rico's economic health and future prospects, nor does it expand PROMESA's reach beyond the affairs of covered territories.

Selection Mechanism\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Given that the Oversight Board is a territorial entity and its members are territorial officers, Congress had broad discretion to determine the manner of selection for members of the Oversight Board. Congress exercised that discretion in empowering the President with the ability to both appoint and remove members from the Oversight Board.

Nor does the manner of selection constitute an improper delegation of power\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   or encroachment\n   on the President's general appointment authority, because Congress used its Article IV powers and did not attempt to allow the President to appoint the Board as a federal entity within the Executive Branch.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brewer v.

Since the alleged defect in the appointment method is the only ground upon which Aurelius argues that the Commonwealth's Title III Petition fails to comport with the requirements of PROMESA, Aurelius' motion to dismiss the Petition is denied. In light of the foregoing determinations, it is unnecessary to address the parties' remaining arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

At the Hearing, counsel for Aurelius stated that Aurelius filed the Lift Stay Motion as a precaution to ensure that it could obtain full scope injunctive relief if it were to prevail on its Appointments Clause challenge. (Tr. P. 36, 16-24.) For the reasons detailed above, Aurelius has failed to demonstrate any prospect of entitlement to injunctive relief.

(Docket Entry Nos. 3494, 3495, 3500.) In its submission, Aurelius cites the Supreme Court's June 22, 2018 decision in\n    <em>\n     Ortiz v.

(Docket Entry No. 3451 at 5.) The\n    <em>\n     Ortiz\n    </em>\n    Court's focus has no such implications, however. The Court was examining the question of whether the military court rulings before it were within its appellate jurisdiction. It cited past examples of judicial proceedings in state, military and territorial courts from which it had entertained appeals, emphasizing the judicial review, as opposed to executive action or original determination, aspects of the matter that was before it in\n    <em>\n     Ortiz\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Ortiz\n    </em>\n    does not speak to the question of whether Congress can create a territorial court or any other entity that is not a court of the United States and is not subject to the Appointments Clause. The\n    <em>\n     Ortiz\n    </em>\n    Court's treatment of the Appointments Clause is similarly inapposite, as the Court held that Congress was empowered to permit the challenged military officer to perform in the job in question and the appellant's Appointments Clause argument (which the Court rejected) concerned whether a single person could be both a principal and an inferior officer of the United States, an issue that is not raised here.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ortiz\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612885\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2165/\">\n     138 S.Ct. at 2183-84\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

In that case, an Act of Congress authorized the transfer of operating control of two airports from the Department of Transportation to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (the \"Authority\"). The Authority was created pursuant to a compact between the state of Virginia and the District of Columbia. The Act of Congress also authorized the creation of a board of review (the \"Review Board\"), consisting solely of congressional members and vested with the authority to veto decisions made by the Authority's board of directors. The Supreme Court held that the Review Board was unconstitutional on separation of powers grounds, notwithstanding the fact that Congress was acting pursuant to the Property Clause.\n    <em>\n     MWAA\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107720\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/252/\">\n     501 U.S. at 270-71\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107720\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/252/\">\n     111 S.Ct. 2298\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Importantly, the Court's holding was premised on a finding that the Review Board was a federal entity wielding federal power.
