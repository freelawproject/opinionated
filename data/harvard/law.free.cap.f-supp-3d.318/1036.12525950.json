Courts and the STB have recognized two broad categories of state and local actions that are categorically preempted regardless of the context of the action: (1) any form of state or local permitting or preclearance that, by its nature, could be used to deny a railroad the ability to conduct some part of its operations or to proceed with activities that the Board has authorized and (2) state or local regulation of matters directly regulated by the Board - such as the construction, operation, and abandonment of rail lines; railroad mergers, line acquisitions, and other forms of consolidation; and railroad rates and services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, those state actions that do not fall into one of these categories may be preempted as applied: For state or local actions that are not facially preempted, the section 10501(b) preemption analysis requires a factual assessment of whether that action would have the effect of preventing or unreasonably interfering with railroad transportation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5741934\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/533/#p539\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5741934\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/533/#p539\">\n    at 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations, quotation marks, and emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In this case, the injunction at issue is a form of regulation with \"the effect of managing or governing rail transportation\" that the Termination Act categorically preempts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5741934\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/533/#p539\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5741934\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/533/#p539\">\n    at 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The STB's exclusive jurisdiction over \"rail transportation\" extends to a \"yard\" and \"equipment of any kind related to the movement of passengers or property, or both, by rail[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010102\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9)(A). And the allegations in plaintiffs' complaint establish that the injunction would effectively regulate defendant's operations of a rail \"yard\" (the Moorman Yard) and, as well, \"equipment\" related to movement by rail that is in place at the yard (the retarders).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   According to plaintiffs, the retarders at the Moorman Yard are a critical component of Norfolk Southern's operations. In 2015, Norfolk Southern invested $160,000,000 to \"double\" the Moorman Yard's \"daily sorting capacity from 1,8000 freight cars to 3,6000.\" (Doc. 30 at 3, \u00b6 8). As part of the expansion, Norfolk Southern \"installed the new retarders\" that are the object of plaintiffs' suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs allege that the retarders are in use \"24 hours a day, nearly every day of the year.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The requested injunction would therefore \"manage\" or \"govern\" Norfolk Southern's use of retarders at the Moorman Yard by requiring Norfolk Southern either to implement another means of decelerating trains or to install noise-reducing technology to ameliorate the noise levels the retarders currently generate. For that reason, the Termination Act categorically preempts their request, and I cannot engage in the \"as-applied\" analysis under which, plaintiffs contend, their proposed\n   injunction would not unreasonably interfere with railroad operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   My conclusion is consistent with three cases where federal courts have held that the Termination Act categorically preempted a nuisance suit targeting railroad-related noise pollution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Pace v.

It also forbids any state or local regulation of noise emissions that are inconsistent with - i.e., more stringent than - the federal standards.
