Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint against KINSALE (\"FAC\") (Dkt. 1-4) asserts claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. KINSALE contends that the KINSALE Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy at issue contains a comprehensive Intellectual Property Exclusion (the \"IP Exclusion\") which clearly and unambiguously precludes coverage for the entire\n   <em>\n    SSR\n   </em>\n   ACTION.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court finds that based on the admissible evidence presented, there never was even the potential coverage for the\n   <em>\n    SSR\n   </em>\n   Action. The\n   <em>\n    SSR\n   </em>\n   Action alleges statutory and common law trademark and trade dress infringement and dilution of trademark, all of which are Intellectual Property torts. It also alleges statutory and common law false advertising and unfair competition under the Lanham Act and its California equivalent. KINSALE's IP Exclusion expressly applies to all of these claims, broadly eliminating from coverage (1) \"infringement of ... trademark, service mark ... slogan, trade dress, trade secret or other intellectual property\n   rights,\" (2) \"false advertising, false designation of origin, product disparagement, trade libel, or other causes of action arising out of unfair competition\"; and (3) \"violations of the Lanham Act or other unfair competition statutes.\" Because the IP Exclusion eliminated even the\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   for coverage, there was no duty to defend. Since there was no duty to defend, there was no breach of KINSALE's insurance contract, and no breach of the implied covenant. KINSALE is therefore entitled to Judgment in its favor as a matter of law. The Court therefore GRANTS KINSALE's Motion for Summary Judgment and DENIES the SECARD PARTIES Motion for Summary Judgment as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 21, 2014, SSR sued the SECARD PARTIES in\n   <em>\n    Solar Sun Rings, Inc. v.

KINSALE's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts (\"SUF\") No. 1. The Complaint in the\n   <em>\n    SSR\n   </em>\n   Action alleged the following Claims for Relief: (1) Federal Trademark Infringement (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) ); (2) Federal Trade Dress Infringement (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ); (3) False Designation of Origin/False Advertising/Unfair Competition (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A) ); (4) Federal Trademark Dilution (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ); (5) Trademark Infringement and Unfair Competition (Common Law and California State Law); and (6) Unfair Business Practices ( California Business &amp; Professions Code \u00a7 17200 ). SUF Nos. 13-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   KINSALE issued Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy No. 0100022495-0 to Secard Pools, effective August 28, 2014 to August 28, 2015 (the \"KINSALE POLICY\"). (SUF No. 20). It included coverage for \"Bodily injury and Property damage Liability\" (Coverage A) and \"Personal and advertising injury Liability\" (Coverage B) on a \"Claims Made\" basis. The SECARD PARTIES have not challenged KINSALE's conclusion that coverage for the Claims in the\n   <em>\n    SSR\n   </em>\n   Action would have existed, if at all, only under Coverage B. SUF No. 21. Under Coverage B, KINSALE promised to \"pay those sums that the insured is legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'personal and advertising injury' to which this insurance applies.\" SUF No. 22. The Policy affords KINSALE the right and duty to defend, but no duty to defend a suit to which the Policy does not apply. SUF No. 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The KINSALE POLICY defines \"Personal and advertising injury\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   14. \"Personal and advertising injury\" means injury, including consequential \"bodily injury\", arising out of one or more of the following offenses:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   f.

Infringing upon another's copyright, trade dress or slogan in your \"advertisement.\" (SUF No. 24).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While the basic Policy form had an exclusion (Exclusion\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ) for infringement of copyright, patent, trademark or trade secrets, with an exception for some advertisements,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that exclusion was replaced by endorsement with a broader IP Exclusion entitled \"EXCLUSION -INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\" which provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"This insurance does not apply to any claim or 'suit' arising out of any:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   1. actual or alleged infringement of copyright, patent, trademark, service mark, right of publicity, slogan, trade dress, trade secret or other intellectual property rights;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   2. actual or alleged false advertising, false designation of origin, product disparagement, trade libel, or other Claims for Relief arising out of unfair competition; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   3. products or goods manufactured, sold, handled or distributed or work completed by the insured or others operating under the direction or control of the insured in violation of any law, statute or ordinance of any federal, state or municipal government, or any agencies thereof, including violations of the Lanham Act or other unfair competition statutes.\" (SUF 27-28).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The SECARD PARTIES tendered their defense to KINSALE on December 1, 2014. SUF No. 29. On December 4, 2014, KINSALE wrote to the SECARD PARTIES and informed them that, based primarily on the IP Exclusion, there was no coverage for the\n   <em>\n    SSR\n   </em>\n   Action under the KINSALE POLICY.

JUDICIAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Summary judgment is proper if the court determines that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). A moving party may prove the lack of a genuine dispute by (a) citing to the record, pleadings, depositions, documents, electronically stored information, answers to interrogatories, and admissions, together with the declarations and stipulations submitted by the parties, or other materials, or (b) showing that the materials cited in a motion for summary judgment do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.

The only Claim for Relief in the\n   <em>\n    SSR\n   </em>\n   Action that directly falls within these definitions is the Second Claim for Relief for Federal Trade Dress Infringement. There is no separate, express coverage grant for \"False Advertising.\" SSR's other claims fall within the Insuring Agreement only to the extent that they can be described as \"the use of another's advertising idea in your 'advertisement.' \" However, the IP Exclusion expressly removes each of these risks from coverage under the KINSALE POLICY.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the KINSALE Policy, the standard IP Exclusion (Exclusion\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ) was replaced by an endorsement with a more expansive exclusion, titled \"Exclusion-Intellectual Property\" (the \"IP Exclusion\"). Prong 1. of the IP Exclusion therefore expands Exclusion\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   and eliminates the exceptions for most advertising injuries, removing definition 14.g. under \"Personal and advertising injury\" from coverage entirely. Prong 2. of the IP Exclusion goes on to expressly remove from coverage claims arising out of \"false advertising, false designation of origin, product disparagement, trade libel or other [Claims for Relief] arising out of unfair competition,\" eliminating any vestige of \"Personal and advertising injury\" to the extent it might otherwise be covered under definition 14.f (\"The use of another's advertising idea in your 'advertisement' \"). Prong 3. precludes coverage for products which violate the Lanham Act or \"other unfair competition statutes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Citing this endorsement, KINSALE correctly concluded in its December 4, 2014 letter that the KINSALE Policy excluded all of the Claims for Relief in the\n   <em>\n    SSR\n   </em>\n   Action because all of the allegations arose out of alleged trademark violations, false advertising, violation of the Lanham Act, and unfair business practices. Each of the first five Claims for Relief in the\n   <em>\n    SSR\n   </em>\n   Action falls under the IP Exclusion, which reaches infringement of trademark, trade dress, service mark, \"other intellectual property rights,\" false designation of origin, product disparagement, trade libel, false advertising or other Claims for Relief arising out of unfair competition and violations of the Lanham Act. The Sixth Claim for Relief, for unfair business practices under Bus. &amp; Profs. Code \u00a7 17200\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   simply incorporates the preceding claims, and therefore is excluded as well. Further, this claim is pled as a violation of Bus. &amp; Profs. Code \u00a7 17200\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , which, in the context of the\n   <em>\n    SSR\n   </em>\n   Action, includes Bus. &amp; Profs. Code \u00a7 17500, which expressly proscribes \"false or misleading advertising\" in California, just like the Lanham Act. It also \"arises out of\" the other claims pled by SSR which are clearly excluded by the IP Exclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Infinity Micro Computer, Inc. v. Continental Cas.

But there is no express coverage grant for the tort of \"False Advertising,\" whether pled under the Lanham Act or common law. Rather, the only coverage that even arguably applies to \"False Advertising\" is found at definition 14.f, for \"the use of another's advertising idea in your 'advertisement.' \" The very essence of the second prong of the IP Exclusion is to eliminate coverage for various business torts falling within the rubric of \"false advertising,\" both under Federal (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   the Lanham Act) and State (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   Bus. &amp; Profs. Code \u00a7 17200\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ) law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The IP Exclusion's use of the term \"false advertising\" rather than \"false or misleading advertising\" does not lend itself to an ambiguity. The term \"false advertising\" under both the Lanham Act and California's statutory prohibition on \"false advertising\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Bus. &amp; Profs. Code \u00a7 17500) includes\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   false\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   misleading advertising. The Court finds that the IP Exclusion's broad reference to \"false advertising\" unambiguously refers to both \"false\" and \"misleading\" advertising as those terms are used under Federal and California statutory and common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court notes that the IP Exclusion precludes coverage not only for \"false advertising\" but also claims\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     arising out of\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \"false advertising.\" Under both California state and Federal law, use of the words \"arising out of\" in an exclusion are meant to broaden it.\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

The Court finds that \"misleading\" advertising is at least a subset of \"false\" advertising, and therefore that the IP Exclusion, which precludes coverage for claims \"arising out of\" false advertising, is broad enough to encompass \"misleading\" advertising as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.

LEXIS 101029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Cal. 2008) (\"In order for a policy to be deemed illusory, it must afford no coverage whatsoever.\") Thus, the mere\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   of\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   coverage is enough. That is sufficient to defeat Plaintiffs' argument. While the IP Exclusion\n   eliminates coverage under definitions 14f. and 14g., that does not exclude\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   coverage under Coverage B, because it leaves intact various \"advertising injury\" offenses found under other subparagraphs of the definition of \"Personal and advertising liability.\" For example, definition 14.d would cover a defamatory remark made by the SECARD PARTIES about a person in an \"advertisement.\" The fact that the\n   <em>\n    SSR\n   </em>\n   Action is not covered does not make coverage illusory. Therefore, Plaintiffs have not met their burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Prong 3 Broadly Eliminates All Lanham Act Claims.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Paragraph 3 of the IP Exclusion states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   This insurance does not apply to any claim or \"suit\"\n   <em>\n    arising out of\n   </em>\n   any:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   3.

SSR's \"False Advertising\" claims (\n   <em>\n    see SSR\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 148-174) all arise out of the SECARD PARTIES' manufacture and promotion of products bearing confusingly similar trademarks and trade dress. The SECARD PARTIES' \"advertisement\" merely relates to the use of the offending marks, color scheme and trade dress on the products themselves and as displayed on various websites. It is the infringing products themselves, and not the \"advertisement,\" that SSR complains of. The acts complained of are markings that appear on the product/packaging that fall directly within the purview of the IP Exclusion.\n   <em>\n    Infinity Micro Computer, Inc. v. Continental Cas.

In granting Summary Judgment for the insurer, the court held that such conduct did not even fall within the coverage grant under definition 14.g (\"the use of another's advertising idea in your 'advertisement.\") In addition, the Court went on to apply Exclusion\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   and determined that because the \"false advertising\" claim\n   <em>\n    arose from\n   </em>\n   the alleged violation of Cisco's trademark, even if it fell within definition 14.g, it was excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Here, the Court has at its disposal an even\n   <em>\n    broader\n   </em>\n   IP Exclusion which expressly precludes\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   violations of the Lanham Act \"arising from\" \"products or goods manufactured, sold, handled or distributed or work completed by the insured.\" There are no allegations of \"false advertising\" which could exist independent of the use of SSR's mark and trade dress on SECARD's Solar Sun Squares product itself.

The exclusion unambiguously applies to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   intellectual property exposures and\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   \"unfair competition\" claims arising therefrom. Based upon the uncontroverted facts presented in KINSALE's motion, all of which are established (SUF Nos 1-32). KINSALE has met its burden to show that the IP Exclusion is clear, conspicuous and plain, and that the plain meaning of the IP Exclusion precludes insurance coverage for the underlying\n   <em>\n    SSR\n   </em>\n   Action. The SECARD PARTIES have not met their burden to show that the IP Exclusion is capable of more than one meaning, or that the meaning they ascribe to it comports with the objectively reasonable expectations of an insured under the KINSALE Policy. Accordingly, the Court finds that there are no genuine issues of material fact to be adjudicated at trial and therefore GRANTS KINSALE's Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court denies the SECARD PARTIES Motion for Summary Judgment as moot.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The original Exclusion\n    <em>\n     i\n    </em>\n    excluded \" 'Personal and advertising injury' arising out of the infringement of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property rights.
