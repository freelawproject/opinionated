Mehta, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case is born out of two student loans issued by Defendant HSBC Bank, one to Plaintiff Dewaine Quick and the other to Plaintiff Lynn Davis, as co-signer for her niece. Although the two loans are unrelated, Plaintiffs' stories are much the same. After each loan went into default, Defendant EduCap, represented by Defendant Weinstock, Friedman &amp; Friedman, filed a collection action against each Plaintiff in D.C. Superior Court. In those cases, EduCap sought the balance of the loan, unpaid interest, and attorneys' fees. Quick never appeared, and eventually the D.C. Superior Court entered a default judgment against him. Davis, on the other hand, appeared and agreed to entry of a consent judgment against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Approximately two years later, Plaintiffs filed this case as a class action, alleging that EduCap, Weinstock, and HSBC (collectively, \"Defendants\") violated state and federal law through their joint debt-collection activities. Plaintiffs' suit centers on a single alleged transgression: that EduCap falsely misrepresented in the collection actions that EduCap, as opposed to HSBC, had entered into the loan agreements with Plaintiffs. That falsehood, Plaintiffs maintain, enabled EduCap to foreclose on their defaulted loans when it had no right to do so. EduCap repeated this unfair debt collection practice, according to Plaintiffs, in state courts throughout the country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This matter is before the court on Defendants' motions to dismiss and Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend their complaint. Defendants argue that this suit must be dismissed for two primary reasons: (1) the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine divests the court of subject-matter jurisdiction; and (2) the doctrine of res judicata precludes Plaintiffs' claims. Additionally, Defendants move to dismiss all causes of action for failure to state a claim and a subset of them for lack of standing. For the reasons that follow, Defendants' motions to dismiss are granted, and Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend their complaint is denied as futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Quick took out a student loan from HSBC for $16,200 on July 30, 2007. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-20. The loan agreement obligated Quick to repay the amount of the loan with interest to HSBC,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-20, and identified EduCap as the loan servicer,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. C, ECF No. 12-4 (copy of Verified Complaint against Quick) [hereinafter Quick Compl.].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When Plaintiffs obtained these loans, EduCap, HSBC, and other private lenders were part of a \"partnership\" created for the purpose of disbursing student loans, which Plaintiffs refer to as the \"L2L\" partnership. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 59. At the same time, EduCap sponsored a trust entity known as the L2L Education Loan Trust 2006-1 (\"the L2L Trust\"), which was an asset-backed security that held a pool of direct-to-consumer student loans originated by various private banks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60. The L2L Trust operated in the following manner: HSBC sold to EduCap student loans that it had originated, and EduCap in turn conveyed legal title to those loans to the L2L Trust.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. The Trust then issued securities that were backed by the future receivables on the underlying student debt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This arrangement allowed the L2L Trust's creators-which included HSBC and EduCap-\"to convert future receivables on [student] loans into immediate cash while, at the same time, insulating HSBC and EduCap from potential risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. Under this arrangement, HSBC would receive money when it sold its student loans to EduCap, EduCap would receive money when it transferred title to the L2L Trust, and the L2L Trust would receive money from investors, whose return was based on the expected future stream of student loan repayment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The financial crisis of 2007, however, changed everything. At that point, according to Plaintiffs, \"the Defendants' plan began to unravel in a failure of colossal proportions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68. Market conditions rendered EduCap \"unable\" to buy student loans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69. To \"avoid financial collapse,\" HSBC bought some of its loans back from EduCap, and it retained, sold, or securitized other loans, \"thereby generating millions of dollars to improve its balance sheet and financial performance ratios.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Eventually Quick defaulted on his student loan, leading EduCap to file a debt collection action in D.C. Superior Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21-22. Defendant Weinstock, Friedman &amp; Friedman (\"Weinstock\"), the law\n   firm that filed the complaint, identified \"EDUCAP Inc.\" as the plaintiff,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22, even though EduCap was neither the loan originator nor a party to the promissory note,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-41;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Quick Compl. The complaint against Quick sought repayment of the loan balance and pre-judgment interest. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 23; Quick Compl. \u00b6 2. It also demanded payment of an additional $2,263.01, as a \"15% contingency-based attorney's fee\" based on the balance of the loan,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , even though the terms of Quick's promissory note did not allow for the collection of such fees,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Davis's story is much the same. After the primary borrower defaulted, Weinstock filed a debt collection action against Davis in D.C. Superior Court on December 4, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28-29;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Davis Compl. As in the action against Quick, the Davis lawsuit incorrectly listed \"EDUCAP Inc.\" as the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 29;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-41. And, as with the debt collection action against Quick, Weinstock's lawsuit against Davis sought a 15 percent contingency-based attorney's fee, amounting to $785.50, even though that fee was not authorized by the terms of the promissory note.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31; Davis Compl. \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that these debt collection actions were premised on a lie: that EduCap had power to bring them. To establish EduCap's standing, Weinstock attached to both the Quick and Davis complaints a sworn affidavit from EduCap employee Marcus Maiorca. The Maiorca Affidavit falsely stated that Quick and Davis had \"entered into a written promissory note with\n   <em>\n    EduCap\n   </em>\n   ,\" when in fact HSBC had issued the loans and EduCap did not own the loans at the time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35, 40-41; Quick Compl. at 4; Davis Comp. at 4. This affidavit, filed in thousands of other debt collection actions brought by EduCap, was used to \"trick courts and consumers across the country into believing that EduCap [was] the actual creditor, or ha[d] authority to sue on behalf of HSBC.\" Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 55. At the time of the actions against Quick and Davis, Weinstock \"only represented EduCap\"; it had no attorney-client or employment relationship with HSBC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants' deceitful conduct continued during the pendency of the collection actions, as Weinstock repeatedly sought to change the named plaintiff. In 2015, Weinstock moved to change the plaintiff in the case against Quick from \"EduCap\" to \"EduCap, Inc. on behalf of HSBC Bank USA, N.A.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. The Superior Court entered a default judgment against Quick two weeks later.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. But in 2017 Weinstock once again asked permission to change the named plaintiff in Quick's case-this time, to \"HSBC Bank, USA, N.A\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. As for Davis, she agreed to entry of a consent judgment on July 16, 2015, whereby she promised to pay $5 each month directly to Weinstock.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. Davis has paid Weinstock $5 a month ever since.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   In 2017, Weinstock successfully moved to change the named plaintiff against Davis to \"HSBC Bank USA, N.A.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Take Plaintiffs' RICO claims, Counts I and II. They allege that Defendants engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity that included \"obtaining unlawful judgments\" and \"receiving, investing and reinvesting income derived from unlawful L2L debt collection lawsuits.\" Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 87-88. Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants' unlawful acts, including securing the allegedly unlawful judgments, proximately caused them harm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90. They seek \"judgment in their favor ... for treble damages suffered by them as a result of the Defendants' predicate acts and violations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91. If Plaintiffs' RICO allegations are proven true, it would mean that\n   the state court judgments against Plaintiffs are \"unlawful\" and would result in an award of damages that would be tied directly to payments made to satisfy the judgments, e.g., the $5 monthly paid by Davis to Weinstock,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. Therefore, as pleaded, Plaintiffs' RICO claims \"invite[ ] district court review and rejection\" of the Superior Court judgments, a consequence barred by\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Exxon Mobil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920496\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/280/#p284\">\n    544 U.S. at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920496\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/280/#p284\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same outcome would result if Plaintiffs were to prevail on their claims for unjust enrichment, Count III, and abuse of process, Count VI. In those claims, Plaintiffs assert, respectively, that \"it would be inequitable for the Defendants to retain any amounts obtained from Plaintiffs without returning the value thereof in that such amounts are not owed to the Defendants,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100, and that Defendants' ulterior motive in misusing the legal process was to, among other things, \"obtain[ ] unlawful judgments\" and secure \"payments for unlawful amounts,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 135, 137.

Plaintiffs offer no reason why the alleged falsehood contained in the Maiorca Affidavit prevented them from challenging EduCap's standing to collect on their debts. As Plaintiffs admit, Quick and Davis both took out loans that originated with HSBC that, per the terms of the loan documents, obligated them to repay HSBC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-20; 25-27.

The actual loan documents, copies of which were attached to each of the complaints against Quick and Davis, confirm these allegations. First, the Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement for both Plaintiffs identifies the \"LENDER\" as HSBC and provides that the borrower \"promise[s] to pay HSBC Bank USA, N.A. the loan Amount with interest at a Variable Rate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Quick Compl. at 21-22; Davis Compl. at 22-23.

Finally, Davis's relative's loan disbursement check was issued by \"HSBC Bank USA, N.A.\" Davis Compl. at 26. Thus, even if the Maiorca Affidavit falsely represented that Plaintiffs had entered into written promissory notes with EduCap, the documents attached to the complaints informed them that HSBC was their original lender and provided Plaintiffs ample fodder with which to challenge EduCap's standing to bring suit. Therefore, the fraud alleged in this case is not \"extrinsic\" and falls outside the bounds of the fraud exception to the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In sum, the court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction under the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine to hear Plaintiffs' RICO, unjust enrichment, and abuse-of-process claims.

Defendants argue the current litigation is barred because Plaintiffs could have challenged EduCap's standing, the validity of Maiorca's affidavit, and the terms of the loan, in the D.C. Superior Court actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HSBC's Mem. at 18-19; EduCap &amp; Weinstock's Mem. at 13-14. Plaintiffs, meanwhile, contend that res judicata is no bar here because the earlier cases concerned \"the enforceability of the promissory notes,\" not as in this case compliance with federal and District of Columbia law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 18-19;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Reply at 3 (characterizing their federal action as one \"concern[ing] the Defendants' conduct in collecting the debts, not the validity of the underlying loans or judgments\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendants have the better argument. The core matter to which Plaintiffs now object-that EduCap fraudulently established its standing in the debt collection actions through filing of the false Maiorca Affidavit-could have been litigated before the D.C. Superior Court. Standing is an essential element of any claim, and the lack of standing is hardly an obscure defense. As detailed above, Plaintiffs had ample opportunity and information to make that challenge against EduCap in the collection actions. Plaintiffs themselves knew that HSBC had issued the student loans, as their loan documents make clear. And, even if they had forgotten that fact at the time of the litigation, the loan documents attached to the debt-collection complaints put Plaintiffs on notice that they had not, as Maiorca attested, \"entered into a written promissory note with EduCap,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Quick Compl. at 4; Davis Compl. at 4, but rather had with HSBC. Thus, Plaintiffs could have contested EduCap's standing to bring the actions simply by pointing to the records attached to the complaints, which identified HSBC as the loans' issuer. Thus, the cases recited by Plaintiff that stand for the principle that an unlawful debt collection practice and the debt itself do not share a common nucleus of facts,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 14 n.102, have no bearing here. Because this case and the collection actions involve the \"same nucleus of facts,\" res judicata precludes Plaintiffs from bringing their claims.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gerstenfeld\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7934317\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/514/1172/#p1179\">\n    514 A.2d at 1179-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that res judicata applied to preclude home owners' suit to enjoin foreclosure where they had the opportunity but failed to challenge the validity of the debt in bankruptcy proceedings).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs offer additional arguments for why res judicata does not apply, but none are persuasive. Plaintiffs assert that res judicata cannot apply here because, as courts have consistently held, FDCPA lawsuits are not compulsory counterclaims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 15. There are two problems with this line of argument. First, as noted previously, the focus of claim preclusion is not on a particular legal theory or claim, but rather on facts of the transaction or occurrence at issue. Thus, the fact that an FDCPA claim may not be a compulsory counterclaim is not dispositive. Second, under District of Columbia law, claim preclusion reaches more than compulsory counterclaims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Capitol Hill Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048216,3542323,4094640\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/485/\">\n    569 F.3d at 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It also reaches permissible counterclaims \"when the relationship between the counterclaim and the plaintiff's claim is such that the successful prosecution of the second action would nullify the initial judgment or impair the rights established in the initial action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048216,3542323,4094640\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/485/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, if Plaintiffs were to prove that EduCap obtained standing in the D.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Superior Court matters through fraud, that would effectively prevent EduCap, and perhaps others, from enforcing those D.C. Superior Court judgments. No court would allow EduCap to collect on a judgment determined to have been unlawfully obtained. So, even if Plaintiffs' claims are permissible counterclaims, they are barred by res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiffs insist that the \"fraudulent concealment\" exception to res judicata applies here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 15. It does not. Fraudulent concealment is a recognized exception to res judicata,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pierce v.

Cir. 2015), but not every alleged fraud qualifies. \"Fraud by a party will not undermine the conclusiveness of a judgment unless the fraud was extrinsic, that is, it deprived the opposing party of the opportunity to appear and present the party's case.\" 46 Am. Jur. 2d, Judgments \u00a7 516 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Laufer v.

In\n   <em>\n    Laufer\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the D.C. Court of Appeals rejected the party's claim that the fraud exception applied \"because the issue of [the opposing party's] alleged fraud was one which might have been litigated in the original action.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9044727\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/532/130/#p133\">\n    532 A.2d at 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So it is here. The fraud that Plaintiffs allege is not extrinsic. The alleged misrepresentation contained in the Mairoca Affidavit did not prevent Plaintiffs from contesting EduCap's standing in the debt collection actions, as explained above. The fraudulent concealment exception therefore does not save Plaintiffs from the res judicata effect of the adverse D.C. Superior Court judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    2. Failure to State Any Claim Against HSBC\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the same reasons Plaintiffs have failed to allege that their claimed injuries are \"fairly traceable\" to HSBC, they have failed to allege sufficient factual matter to support a plausible claim against HSBC. Once more, the Second Amended Complaint contains no facts connecting HSBC to the alleged scheme to defraud defaulted borrowers by misrepresenting EduCap's standing to bring collection actions. Accordingly, the court also dismisses all claims against HSBC for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    3. Failure to State Cognizable Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendants also argue that all of Plaintiffs' claims must be dismissed for failure to state cognizable claims. The court agrees that Plaintiffs' pleading of their RICO and FDCPA claims is fatally deficient.
