SMITH, Chief Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this action in state court to rescind what they consider a faulty foreclosure. (Compl., ECF No. 1-1.) After the case was filed, but not before the state court entered a default against Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC, (\"Ocwen Loan\"), Defendants removed it to this Court. (Notice of Removal, ECF No. 1.) Pending now are Plaintiffs' Motion to Remand (ECF No. 8) and Ocwen Loan's Motion to Vacate Entry of Default (ECF No. 5). Also pending is the parties' Joint Motion to Rescind Foreclosure (ECF No. 15). The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion, remanding the case to state court and rendering the two later-filed Motions moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case started with Plaintiffs filing their complaint in Rhode Island Superior\n   Court on December 13, 2017. (Defs.' Mem. of Law in Supp. of Obj. to Pls.' Mot. to Remand 2, ECF No. 9-1.) The complaint alleges-and it is undisputed for purposes of Plaintiffs' Motion-that US Bank, N.A., (\"US Bank\") was the last to hold and Ocwen Loan the last to service Plaintiffs' mortgage. (Compl. \u00b6 6.) The (previously) mortgaged property is located at 176-178 Grove Street in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, (\"Property\"), and was Plaintiffs' primary residence before US Bank bought it at a foreclosure sale. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5, 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that Defendants unlawfully foreclosed on the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.) They ask the Court to rescind the foreclosure sale and to award an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys' fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1[a]-5[a].) Notably, Plaintiffs do not ask that the mortgage and note be invalidated. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Pls.' Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Remand 2-3, ECF No. 8-1 (\"Pls.' Mem.\").) Nor do they ask that Defendants be prevented from foreclosing on the mortgage. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1[a]-5[a]; Pls.' Mem. 2-3.) What they ask is that the status quo ante be restored, so that if Defendants foreclose, they do so in accordance with the law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1[a]-5[a]; Pls.' Mem. 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties agree that they are completely diverse. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-4; Notice of Removal 1-2.) Plaintiffs argue, however, that Defendants cannot remove this case under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) because the amount in controversy does not exceed $75,000 as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). (Pls.' Mem. 2.) Plaintiffs did not demand a specific amount in their complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1[a]-5[a].) But Defendants averred in their Notice of Removal that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, as evidenced by the mortgage's size ($279,000) and the Property's current value ($139,800).
