Ill. July 11, 2016) (motion to dismiss operative complaint). The Court reiterates the basic facts and will discuss in more detail in the analysis as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Act II Jewelry, LLC was in the jewelry sales industry. (Defs.' Resp. to Pls.' Facts, Dkt. No. 307, \u00b6 4.) It marketed and sold jewelry by having a network of sales representatives hold parties in customers' homes, commonly known as the \"party plan\" business model. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ann Wooten was employed as Vice President of Product Development by Act II for approximately three and a half years from July 2011 to February 9, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As Vice President of Product Development, Wooten, and her team, selected, developed, and designed Act II's line of jewelry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 1, 2014, Act II announced it would be winding down its direct-selling, party plan jewelry business in the United States and Canada and its sales advisors would be selling its Fall/Winter 2014 collection at discounted prices through December 31, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) To ensure an orderly wind down process, Act II entered into a Key Employee Incentive Bonus Agreement (the \"Incentive Agreement\") with several employees, including Wooten.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Incentive Agreement provided financial incentives for Wooten to remain employed with Act II and work diligently during the wind down period. (Dkt. No. 307, \u00b6 8.) The Incentive Agreement included a reaffirmation of a previously agreed to Non-Disclosure Agreement stating that all trade secrets Wooten obtained during her employment were to be held in confidence solely in connection with and for the purposes of employment with Act II. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) The Incentive Agreement also specifically allowed Wooten to continue working in the jewelry field, stating that nothing in the agreement would prevent Wooten from \"continuing her work as a jewelry designer, as long as [Wooten] does not infringe on any intellectual property belonging to the Company.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Finally, the Incentive Agreement entitled Wooten to severance and bonus pay if she acted in accordance with the agreement so long as she was not terminated for cause. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Act II terminated its normal business at the end of December 2014, and ceased all operations as of March 7, 2015. (Pls.' Resp. to Defs.' Facts, Dkt. No. 294, \u00b6 47.) Act II has not engaged in any business since March 7, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When Act II decided to close shop, Wooten decided to open her own business in the same industry. The crux of the dispute between the parties here is the propriety of Wooten's activities from the fall of 2014 to her termination date with Act II on February 9, 2015. The parties tell very different stories of what occurred during this period. The Court outlines each parties' rendition in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to Act II, Wooten used Act II's proprietary information to launch her new business, Adornable-U. While she was still employed by Act II, Wooten covertly directed Act II designers Bonnie Jaekel and Abbey Johnson to spend Act II work time to develop designs for Adornable-U. (Dkt. No. 307, \u00b6 12.) She also coached Act II supplier La Radiant in its negotiations against Act II and secretly took Act II's jewelry styles, including pieces from the unreleased collection she and her team developed in 2014, and used them for Adornable-U. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Wooten also took proprietary information from Act II prior to her termination. She forwarded numerous e-mails and attachments from her Act II business account to her personal email account including proprietary information regarding the Spring/Summer 2015 collection, sales trends for Act II styles, and other topics clearly related to the launch of her new business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While still employed and under contract with Act II, Wooten began operating Adornable-U's business by marketing Adornable-U to the public: she published Adornable-U's catalog online, registered and/or employed sales representatives to hold parties and take customer orders, and sold and distributed starter kits (containing actual product). (Dkt. No. 307, \u00b6 13; Defs.' Reply to Pls.' Add'l Facts, Dkt. No. 334, \u00b6 76.) In short, in Act II's view, Wooten stopped working in the best interests of Act II and further took Act II's proprietary information to benefit her new business. All of these activities, according to Act II, were undertaken without Act II's knowledge. While Act II had been generally aware of Wooten's intention to start her own direct-sales jewelry business after Act II shuttered its doors, Act II expected that Wooten would not take any of its proprietary information and would not begin operating prior to concluding her work with Act II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Wooten tells a very different story. According to Wooten, she was always up front with Act II and its owners about her plans to continue in the business after Act II shut down. In September 2014, Wooten disclosed to Act II that, in light of the fact that Act II was going out of business, she wished to start her own company and enter into the direct-sales jewelry business. Wooten spoke with Act II personnel about her new business plans several times over the course of the next two months. Act II's owners expressed support and said they had no objection to Wooten starting her own direct-sales jewelry company and working with former Act II Sales Advisors. With Act II's blessing, Wooten incorporated Adornable-U, a direct-selling jewelry business on October 30, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to Wooten, at no point during Act II's winding down process did she ever use or misappropriate any of Act II's trade secret information for the design or sourcing of Adornable-U's 2015 or its subsequent jewelry lines. (Dkt. No. 294, \u00b6 33.) Wooten did not refer to or in any way use Act II's Spring/Summer 2015 \"collection\" in the selection or development of Adornable-U's jewelry lines or catalogs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) To the contrary, Wooten selected and developed Adornable-U's 2015 and subsequent jewelry lines independently, using only information regarding those jewelry products and designs obtained from third-party vendors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 20, 2015, things went awry. Wooten posted Adornable-U's first product catalog online. (Dkt. No. 307, \u00b6 15.) According to Act II, Adornable-U's product catalog contained Act II's work product because it included many \"carryover\" jewelry items in Act II's Fall/Winter 2014 and prior jewelry collections, as well as items that Act II's designers had been designing in the fall of 2014, but that had not yet appeared in an Act II published collection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) After Adornable-U's catalog was published, the parties attempted to negotiate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Those negotiations were unsuccessful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 9, 2015, Act II notified Wooten that her employment was terminated for cause. (Dkt. No. 334, \u00b6 81; Dkt. No. 307, \u00b6 24.) On March 6, 2015, Adornable-U started selling jewelry. (Dkt. No. 307, \u00b6 30.) From 2015 through 2017, Adornable-U sold 755 styles of jewelry. (Dkt. No. 334, \u00b6 93.) Only 62 of those styles are at issue in this suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Act II filed suit against Wooten and Adornable-U in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois on March 20, 2015, which was subsequently removed to federal court. (Dkt. No. 307, \u00b6 32.) From March 2015 to August 2015, Act II sent four letters to individuals associated with Adornable-U, including actual and potential sale agents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-39.) The letters advised the recipients of the pending lawsuit, summarized the claims in the suit, and advised the recipients of potential future discovery obligations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-39.) The letters stated that \"this lawsuit does not seek to block Ms. Wooten from operating a direct selling jewelry company\" and that Act II and KEC were \"not seeking to block [the letter's recipients] from representing [Adornable-U].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) Act II contends these letters were necessary to assert its rights and advise the recipients of a litigation hold. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-39.) Adornable-U disagrees, arguing that the letters were sent as a campaign explicitly and implicitly to threaten Adornable-U's actual and potential sales agents with a lawsuit if they continue working with Adornable-U. (Pls.' Resp. to Defs.' Add'l Facts, Dkt. No. 330, \u00b6 19.) Additionally, Act II served 314 third-party subpoenas, many to Adornable-U sales agents, for documents and/or deposition testimony in this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Adornable-U argues that Act II used the guise of discovery to threaten Adornable-U sales agents with suit if they continue working for Adornable-U.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before the Court are Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment.

Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Act II moves for summary judgment on its claim that Wooten breached her fiduciary duties to Act II. To succeed, Act II must show that Wooten was a \"key managerial employee\" or agent of Act II and that she breached her fiduciary duties to Act II.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sci. Accessories Corp. v. Summagraphics Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7993803\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/425/957/#p962\">\n    425 A.2d 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 962 (Del. 1980) (Under Delaware law, key managerial employees and agents owe fiduciary\n   duties to employer). Act II succeeds as to the former, but not the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Wooten was a \"key managerial employee\" and agent of Act II during the relevant time period. Act II provides the following evidence through documents and deposition testimony: Wooten was in the \"executive group\" directly below the President; she ran the \"Global Product Development and Merchandising\" department; she regularly attended and presented at board meetings; she was privy to executive-level financial reports; she was the lead person in charge of selecting, designing and curating Act II's entire product line and interacted with Act II's vendors and suppliers; and she managed the pricing and costing of the jewelry. (Pls.' Facts, Dkt. No. 273, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6; Ex. AA, Dkt. No. 281 (Wooten's job description); Ex. KK, Dkt. No. 281 (Act II's organizational chart).) These facts satisfy Act II's burden as the movant and shifts the burden to Adornable-U. Adornable-U disputes these facts, citing Wooten's affidavit. (Dkt. No. 307, \u00b6 5 (citing Wooten's Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-5).) Wooten avers that she was not a \"key employee\" at Act II, she was not a member of the executive management team as she reported the Executive Vice President, Keith Maib, rather than the CEO, Victor Kiam, she had no knowledge or access to sensitive financial information, and she did not \"design\" jewelry for Act II. Wooten's statement that she was not a key employee is conclusory and will be disregarded. And even taking the other statements as true, Wooten would still be a \"key managerial employee\" of Act II as a matter of law. She does not dispute that she was a Vice President and ran the \"Global Product Development and Merchandising\" department, that she presented at board meetings occasionally, and that she was the lead person in charge of selecting and curating Act II's entire product line and interacted with Act II's vendors and suppliers and managed the pricing and costing of the jewelry. Even accepting that she was not a jewelry designer or the sole person responsible for managing the pricing and cost of jewelry, her role as Vice President of the \"Global Product Development and Merchandising\" department and its attendant responsibilities are sufficient to establish Wooten as a \"key managerial employee.\"\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sci. Accessories Corp. v. Summagraphics Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7993803\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/425/957/#p962\">\n    425 A.2d 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 962 (Del. 1980). Thus, no material dispute exists to preclude a finding that Wooten is in fact a \"key managerial employee.\" Furthermore, Wooten puts forth no evidence to dispute her agency relationship with Act II. Thus, Wooten was a \"key managerial employee\" and an agent of Act II during the relevant time period. Accordingly, Wooten owed Act II fiduciary duties.\n   <em>\n    See,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7993803\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/425/957/#p962\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   However, summary judgment as to whether Wooten breached those duties is not warranted because issues of material fact abound. Wooten disputes nearly every material fact Act II cites on this score. This Court will not canvas the litany of disputed facts, but will offer a sufficient example. Act II claims that Wooten breached her fiduciary duties when she directed Act II designers Bonnie Jaekel and Abbey Johnson to spend Act II work time to prepare designs for Adornable-U and used those designs, along with Act II's trade secrets and resources for her new business. (Dkt. No. 273, \u00b6 12.) She also used multiple Act II jewelry styles in Adornable-U's catalog, including pieces from the unreleased collection she and her Act II team developed in 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Adornable-U disputes each contention, citing assertions to the contrary contained in Wooten's affidavit and deposition. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 307, \u00b6 12 (citing Wooten's Decl. \u00b6 29);\n   <em>\n    Kaba v. Stepp,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3386198\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/458/678/#p681\">\n    458 F.3d 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 681 (7th Cir. 2006) (\"Sworn affidavits, particularly those that are detailed, specific, and based\n   on personal knowledge are 'competent evidence to rebut [a] motion for summary judgment.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dale v. Lappin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9375236\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/652/#p655\">\n    376 F.3d 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 655 (7th Cir. 2004) ) ).) In short, Wooten, Jaekel, and Johnson tell striking different stories about whether Wooten's work during Act's winding down process was for the benefit of Act II or Adornable-U. This dispute is material to the breach of fiduciary claim, and the jury will need to make a credibility determination between this presumably conflicting testimony. Another key disputed fact is whether any of Act II's work was taken and used by Wooten for Adornable-U. Act II presents evidence that Wooten emailed key documents to her personal account. (Dkt. No. 273, \u00b6 13.) Although this gives rise to an inference in Act II's favor, the depositions and affidavits conflict as to whether those documents were used as part of Wooten's work for Act II or for her work for Adornable-U. (\n   <em>\n    Compare,\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 273, \u00b6 13\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 307; Wooten's Decl. \u00b6 29.) The Court has no discretion to resolve disputed factual issues on a summary judgment motion.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2728, Wright &amp; Miller, 10A Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc.

Thus, the Court finds that Adornable-U's evidence on summary judgment simply cannot establish a basis upon which damages can be calculated to a reasonable degree of certainty.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TAS Distrib.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3469766\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/491/625/#p633\">\n    491 F.3d at 635-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Meads and Eckels' Tortious Interference Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   There exists a separate, independent basis to grant summary judgment as to Mead and Eckles' Tortious Interference Claims. Although these claims fail for the reasons stated above, they also fail because Mead and Eckles are unable to establish that they had contracts with any agents. In response to summary judgment, Mead and Eckels cite two sources: Adornable-U's Counterclaim and their own declarations. As to the Counterclaim, a party cannot cite to allegations in its own pleading to escape summary judgment; summary judgment requires proof, not mere allegations. As to the declarations, both Meads and Eckels simply assert: \"I entered into verbal contractual agreements with other independent contractors.\" (Exs. G, H to Dkt. No. 306.) These statements do not offer names or any documentary evidence to support these assertions.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buie v.

Because these declarations are without factual support, they are insufficient to withstand summary judgment. Further, Adornable-U has admitted that agents do not enter into contracts with other agents. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Agents did not enter into agreements with other agents.\") ) Accordingly, since agents do not enter into contracts with other agents, Mead and Eckels had no contractual relationship or any prospect for future contracts that could have been tortiously interfered with by Act II's conduct. For those reasons, summary judgment is granted to Act II as to all of Mead and Eckels' tortious interference claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court need not reach any of Act II's other arguments as to the tortious interference claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

Adornable-U contends the mass mailings were sent throughout the industry and marketplace, but cites no evidence supporting that fact. Instead, the evidence indicates the four letters and subpoenas were sent to specific actual or potential Adornable-U sales agents. Adornable-U argues that consumer protection concerns are implicated by these communications, which Adornable-U characterizes as efforts to put Adornable-U out of business, but that argument miscomprehends the nature of \"consumer protection concerns\" in this context.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conditioned Ocular Enhancement, Inc. v.

Finally, Adornable-U's argument that their agents often buy Adornable-U product and thus are also consumers does not preclude summary judgment. None of the communications were addressed to the agents in their capacity as potential consumers, but rather purely in their capacities as Adornable-U's sales agents. (Exs. O, P to Compl.; Exs. 2-3 to Counterclaims.) The Court awards summary judgment to Act II on the Consumer Fraud Act claim because the facts do not establish that the communications at issue were sent to consumers in the market generally or that they implicate consumer protection concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act and Breach of Key Employee Incentive Bonus Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Act II claims that summary judgment in its favor as to Wooten's breach of fiduciary duty also resolves Adornable-U's Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act (\"IWPCA\") and breach of the Incentive Agreement claims in Act II's favor. Act II argues that a finding that Wooten breached her fiduciary duties justifies her termination for cause under the Key Employee Incentive Bonus Agreement and thus provides no basis for a claim under the Incentive Agreement or the IWPCA. It is true that these claims likely fail if Wooten breached her fiduciary duties to Act II. However, as discussed above, issues of material fact exist as to whether she breached her fiduciary duties and thus, the factual predicate for summary judgment as to these claims is not present. Summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Trade Secret Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In Illinois, a trade secret claim is a statutory claim governed by the Illinois Trade Secrets Act (\"ITSA\"), 765 ILCS 1065/1\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . The elements of a trade secret claim follow: (1) a\n   trade secret existed; (2) the secret was misappropriated through improper acquisition, disclosure, or use; and (3) the owner of the trade secret was damaged by the misappropriation.\n   <em>\n    Learning Curve Toys, Inc. v.

ITSA defines a trade secret as: \"information, including but not limited to, technical or non-technical data, a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, drawing, process, financial data, or list of actual or potential customers or suppliers, that: (1) is sufficiently secret to derive economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy or confidentiality.\" 765 ILCS 1065/2(d).

(Dkt. No. 294, \u00b6 14.) Adornable-U complains that Act II's interrogatories \"identified\" its trade secrets by referring to 9,825 pages of documents, including many documents that were not confidential and held no proprietary information. (Dkt. No. 294, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 30-31.) Such a pile of documents are unlikely to meet the specificity requirements under the ITSA.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Composite Marine Propellers, Inc. v. Van Der Woude\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525041\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/962/1263/#p1266\">\n    962 F.2d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1266 (7th Cir. 1992) (\"[P]laintiff must show concrete secrets.\"). However, Act II has done more here. Act II lays out in detail 74 alleged trade secrets in its fact response. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 294, \u00b6 14;\n   <em>\n    see also,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peerless Industries, Inc. v.

Ill. Mar. 17, 2015) (finding plaintiff sufficiently identified its claimed trade secrets).) The Court need not go through all of the trade secrets but will use some as illustrations. Act II identifies its curated Spring/Summer 2015 Collection (the \"SS15 Collection\") and specifically identifies the name of each unreleased and modified carryover style for which it claims protection. (Dkt. No. 294, \u00b6 14.) Act II also specifically identifies documents that Wooten downloaded from her work computer and/or emailed to her personal account containing proprietary information. (Dkt. No. 294, \u00b6 14.) The documents themselves have been specifically identified (Dkt. Nos. 317-318, Exs. A-64-A-74) and include information concerning design standards, strategic plans, jewelry supplier data and cost information, carryover supplier information, selling trends, jewelry raw costs, vendor contact information, customer information, and hostess program comparison (a key component of the direct sales model). (Dkt. No. 294, \u00b6 14.) Thus, Act II sufficiently identified its trade secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Adornable-U next argues that the SS15 Collection cannot constitute a trade secret because the SS15 Collection is merely a combination of products that are bought on the open market and are thus generally known to the public. Certainly, products purchased from commercial vendors cannot constitute trade secrets by themselves.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Gypsum Co. v. LaFarge N.

Ill. July 18, 2007). However, Act II does not claim that jewelry products bought on the market are trade secrets. Rather, Act II claims that it modified and curated these products and that the combination of modifications culminating in a curated collection created value and thus constitutes a trade secret. (Dkt. No. 294, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 33, 36; Dkt. Nos. \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.) Adornable-U contests this fact, claiming that the 2015 line was composed of \"open line\" products, which means products that were available for sale to anyone internationally. (Dkt. No. 268, \u00b6 10, 33.) This factual dispute only highlights that summary judgment in not warranted in Adornable-U's favor. Furthermore, even if Adornable-U was correct in its assertion that each product individually could not be a trade secret that would not preclude the existence of a trade secret in the compilation of the collection:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [A] trade secret can exist in a combination of characteristics and components, each of which, by itself, is in the public domain, but the unified process, design and operation of which, in unique combination, affords a competitive advantage and is a protectable secret.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Syntex Ophthalmics, Inc. v.

The time and expense Act II invested in its SS15 Collection supports its status as a trade secret.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As for the confidentiality requirement, Adornable-U argues that Act II failed to take reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of the SS15 Collection. Act II provides evidence that its employees who developed or had access to the jewelry collections were required to sign confidentiality, non-disclosure and developments agreements and other internal policies to maintain secrecy of its jewelry designs and to use password-protected, restricted access computer systems. (Dkt. No. 294, \u00b6 62.) Adornable-U disputes all of this. (Dkt. No. 334, \u00b6 62.) These factual disputes are material and will be left for the jury.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Motorola v.

Ill. Jan. 10, 2012) (\"[T]he Seventh Circuit [has a] clearly stated preference for resolution by a fact-finder of disputed trade secret issues, particularly the question of efforts to maintain secrecy.\"). Adornable-U also argues that Act II cannot establish that the information was secret where the information's value lies only in the eventual publication of that information. Certainly, once the SS15 Collection was published, it would have lost its trade secret status through public disclosure. However, it cannot be the rule that any product or information that will eventually be disclosed has no protection while it is in development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   To the next element: Adornable-U argues that Act II cannot establish\n   misappropriation because Adornable-U never used any trade secret information in the design or sourcing of Adornable-U's 2015 or subsequent jewelry lines. (Dkt. No. 268, 33-39.) However, this fact is heavily disputed and more importantly, the law does not require \"use\" to prove misappropriation. \"While proving unauthorized 'use' of a trade secret is one means of establishing liability under the ITSA, it is not the only means; liability also attaches for improper 'acquisition' or 'disclosure' of a trade secret.\"\n   <em>\n    Lane v.

(Dkt. No. 294, \u00b6 14;\n   <em>\n    see,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    First Fin. Bank, N.A. v. Bauknecht,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4211373\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/71/819/#p846\">\n    71 F.Supp.3d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 846 (C.D. Ill. 2014) (finding suspicious timing of emails could allow a reasonable jury to conclude defendant misappropriated customer lists).) Act II also shows that materials on the development of the lia sophia Spring/Summer 2015 catalog were deleted from Act II's computer files as well. (Dkt. No. 294, \u00b6 14.) Additionally, Act II provides evidence that the jewelry produced for Adornable-U is materially identical to Act II's jewelry, from which a jury could infer misappropriation. (Dkt. No. 294, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 76, 74-77, 83.) Act II also offers testimony that Wooten instructed her employees to use Act II's jewelry to create Adornable-U's jewelry collections. (Dkt. No. 294, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 37). Adornable-U disputes these facts. (Dkt. No. 334, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 37, 74-77, 83.) As such, whether Defendants misappropriated Act II information and whether that information was used in the production of Adornable-U's collection are questions of disputed fact for the jury to determine. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Act II, the Court concludes that Act II has demonstrated a genuine dispute of material fact. Act II's trade secrets claim against Adornable-U and Wooten is appropriate for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Adornable-U's trade secret argument is on firmer footing as to three other Defendants, Mead, Eckels, and Daun. Adornable-U points out that these Defendants did not have access to any of the material disclosing the Spring/Summer 2015 collection nor to Act II's sensitive documents, and Act II does not present evidence to the contrary. (Dkt. No. \u00b6 38, 32, 41, 43-44.) Act II's contention that these three Defendants were given copies of the collection upon being served with the Complaint does not go to show that any of these Defendants misappropriated the material from Act II while it was still in business. (Dkt. No. 294, \u00b6\u00b6 38, 44.) Although Act II argues that Mead, Eckels, and Daun must have known they were using misappropriated trade secrets, Act II cites no admissible evidence indicating that any of them had such knowledge. Finding no reasonable jury could find in Act II's favor against Mead, Eckels, and Daun based on the evidence presented, the Court grants summary judgment as to the trade secrets claim as to those three Defendants. The trade secrets claim against Wooten and Adornable-U remains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Lastly, Adornable-U argues that none of the Plaintiffs can assert a trade secret claim against Adornable-U because none of them satisfy Rule 17's real-party-in-interest requirement. This argument creates an absurd result. If this proposition were true, even assuming the claim was meritorious, no party could bring the claim here. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(a)(1) states that \"an action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 17(a)(1). \"[T]o be a real party in interest, the person must be the\n   holder of the right or claim at issue.\" FED. R. CIV. P. , advisory committee note YEAR. \"There may be multiple real parties in interest for a given claim. For example, when a party partially assigns the rights to a claim, 'the assignor and the assignee each retain an interest in the claim and are both real parties in interest.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4211373\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/71/819/#p846\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the facts indicate that the trade secret claims have been partially assigned, and thus Act II retains an interest in the claim, along with the entities that received the transferred assets. (Dkt. No. 334, \u00b6\u00b6 87-90.) Furthermore, the two purposes served by Rule 17-protecting defendants from subsequent claimants and ensuring preclusive effect of the judgment-do not counsel a different result here.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   1 FED. R. CIV. P ., Rules and Commentary Rule 17.

Breach of Key Employee Incentive Bonus Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Adornable-U moves for summary judgment on Act II's claim that Wooten breached the Key Employee Incentive Bonus Agreement. Adornable-U argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because that Agreement is unenforceable as Act II has no legitimate business interest in the contract's enforcement now that it is out of business. \"A restrictive covenant, assuming it is ancillary to a valid employment relationship, is reasonable only if the covenant: (1) is no greater than is required for the protection of a legitimate business interest of the employer-promisee; (2) does not impose undue hardship on the employee-promisor, and (3) is not injurious to the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Reliable Fire Equip.

Act II argues that\n   <em>\n    Reliable Fire\n   </em>\n   and the standard it espouses is restricted to non-compete provisions and thus does not apply.

However, Adornable-U argues that Act II fails this requirement here because, as it has closed its jewelry-selling shutters, it no longer has an operating business to protect. True, Act II has not engaged in business since March 7, 2015, but the alleged breach occurred prior to that date. (Dkt. No. 294, \u00b6\u00b6 47, 74, 83, 85). Act II is not litigating whether the Agreement is currently in effect, but rather a claim for damages based on Wooten's breach of the Agreement while Act II was still in business and winding up its affairs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=965%20N.E.2d%20393\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Act II legitimately may seek to protect the financial outcome of its wind-up process and the value of its assets which it was in the midst of selling. Furthermore, Act II transferred its assets to KEC, which is still operating, and KEC has a legitimate business interest in protecting its alleged trade secrets. The Release and Waiver attached to the Incentive Agreement required Wooten to \"refrain ... from disclosing any trade secret of [KEC] or Act II or other confidential and proprietary business information and material.\" (Dkt. No. 294, \u00b6 61.) Thus, KEC may enforce any breach under the Incentive Agreement, because Act II's rights were assigned and the agreement specifically contemplated protecting KEC's assets as well.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=965%20N.E.2d%20393\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Memorandum and Opinion Order, Dkt. No. 90 at 17 (rejecting argument that agreement was unenforceable where agreement specifically contemplated Act II winding down).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Second, Adornable-U argues that the contract is unenforceable because it is overly broad and would impose undue hardships on Wooten. Adornable-U maintains that the Restrictive Covenants, if enforced, would essentially preclude Wooten from engaging in the jewelry business. This argument falls flat. As Adornable-U itself points out, the Incentive Agreement specifically provides that nothing in that Agreement or the Restrictive Covenants \"shall prevent Employee from continuing her work as a jewelry designer, as long as employee does not infringe on any of intellectual property belonging to the Company.\" (Facts \u00b6 51.) Regardless of Act II's construction, the Incentive Agreement speaks for itself. It precludes Wooten from using Act II's trade secrets and confidential information in her continued work as a jewelry designer. It does not pretend to limit Wooten from continuing in her chosen field. Merely preventing a former employee from using their former employer's confidential information is not overly broad or unduly burdensome, and especially not here, in light of the carve out that allows Wooten to continue working in her chosen field.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Wooten's Motion for Summary Judgment on Act II's claim that she breached the Incentive Agreement claim is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, Adornable-U's Motion for Summary Judgment and Act II's Motion for Summary Judgment are granted in part and denied in part.
