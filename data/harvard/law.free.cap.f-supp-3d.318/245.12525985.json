For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant the motion in part and deny it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   McIver categorizes her factual allegations and counts into two classes: those related to her employment with the Pentagon Force Protection Agency and those related to her employment with the Navy Yard. Both are agencies within the Department of Defense. The Court will recount the facts described in the amended complaint, though it is at times difficult to follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In early 2014, McIver became a police officer recruit with the Pentagon Force Protection Agency. Am. Compl. \u00b6 14, Dkt. 18. One of McIver's supervisors, Erik McVicker, told her that she would need to attend a training program in July 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. In June, however, McIver informed her superiors that she would be unable to attend the training because she needed to care for her disabled mother.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-25. She submitted a request for an alternative work schedule, but it was denied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The complaint states that McIver then \"invoked her [Family and Medical Leave Act] rights\" to seek another accommodation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. When McVicker ordered McIver to attend the training program, McIver responded that she could not because she needed to care for her mother.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. McVicker then submitted McIver's accommodation request and asked her to resign.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. McIver was subsequently placed on AWOL status and McVicker stated that he would remove her from federal service if she did not attend the training.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27-28. McIver alleges that a white male who was hired as a police officer recruit with her did not have to attend the training.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Around July 20, 2014, McIver underwent emergency surgery for a ruptured ulcer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. She subsequently requested an accommodation for light-duty work, but on August 28, McVicker instead began to remove her as an officer recruit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. McIver alleges that she was never accommodated and instead had to use excessive amounts of leave time from July 2014 to January 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. On August 29, 2014, McIver filed an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) complaint for race and sex discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34; Dkt. 25-6 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In March 2015, one of McIver's supervisors placed her on AWOL status on the grounds that she had used excessive medical leave and was negatively impacting employee morale.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-36. In April 2015, McIver sought accommodation for an \"alternate course of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. This was denied in May 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   McIver filed another EEO charge against the Pentagon Force Protection Agency, this time for retaliation, on July 20, 2015. Dkt. 25-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Around June 2015, the Navy Yard hired McIver as a police officer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. Because of her ruptured ulcer, however, McIver's capabilities were limited.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. On September 21, she gave her supervisor a medical letter indicating that her protective gear was causing complications and requested to work without the gear.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-48. Her supervisors denied the request the next day and informed her that she was relieved of \"duty status.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. On September 24, one of the supervisors rejected her requests for a light-duty status.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50-51. On October 1, McIver requested a different holster and presented another medical letter, but her request was denied the next day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. McIver alleges that a similarly situated employee was allowed to work without protective gear or a holster.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. McIver filed another EEO complaint, this time against the Navy Yard for sex and disability discrimination, on March 7, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54; Dkt. 20-12 at 8-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   McIver sued the Secretary in July 2016. In February 2017, following an initial round of briefing on the Secretary's motion for partial summary judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c), McIver filed an amended complaint. Dkt. 18. Thereafter, the Secretary filed the instant motion. The case was reassigned to the undersigned judge on December 5, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Two are Title VII claims, and the Secretary does not seek to dismiss those. The other four are Rehabilitation Act claims. Two of the Rehabilitation Act claims allege that the Pentagon Force Protection Agency discriminated against her on the basis of disability. One alleges that Pentagon Force Protection Agency unlawfully retaliated against her. And the other alleges that the Navy Yard discriminated against her on the basis of disability. The Secretary moves to dismiss the Rehabilitation Act counts related to the Pentagon Force Protection Agency and moves for partial dismissal of the Rehabilitation Act count related to the Navy Yard. Sec'y Mem. at 1-2, Dkt. 20-1. For each of these counts, the Secretary's challenge rests at least in part on the argument that McIver failed to adequately exhaust administrative remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Rehabilitation Act requires a person alleging a violation to exhaust administrative remedies by filing an administrative charge before bringing a civil suit. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crawford v.

Count 2 against the Pentagon Force Protection Agency (retaliation under the Rehabilitation Act) survives insofar as (1) it alleges retaliation against McIver for her August 2014 and April 2015 requests for accommodation; and (2) the denial of McIver's May and June 2015 requests form the basis of that retaliation or are reasonably related to the retaliation. The count against the Navy Yard (disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation\n   Act) is limited to allegations of events occurring no more than forty-five days before November 10, 2015. The other counts survive in full. A separate order consistent with this decision accompanies this memorandum opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Ashton B.
