Following a four-week trial, the jury returned guilty verdicts on five counts. Pending before the Court are the following motions: (1) Mr. Bowser's motion for a judgment of acquittal following the close of the government's evidence; (2) Mr. Bowser's motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of all evidence; Mr. Bowser's motion for a judgment of acquittal notwithstanding the verdict; and (4) the government's motion to dismiss Count Two of the Indictment.

The government completed its case-in-chief on March 13, 2018. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29, Mr. Bowser orally moved for a judgment of acquittal as to Counts One through Seven at the close of the government's case. Mr. Bowser subsequently filed a written motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 72, which was fully briefed by March 18, 2018,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 82 and 85. The Court reserved judgment on the motion, and Mr. Bowser presented his defense. The defense completed its case-in-chief on March 19, 2018. The government did not present rebuttal evidence. Mr. Bowser orally renewed his motion for a judgment of acquittal and filed a second written motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 86. The Court reserved judgment on that motion until after the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 23, 2018, the jury returned guilty verdicts on Counts One, Three, Four, Seven, and Eight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jury Verdict, ECF No. 100.

At that point, the government stated that \"it would be appropriate to declare a mistrial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.

On that same day, the government filed a notice of its intention not to seek retrial on Count Two and asked that Count Two be dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 48(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 118 and 119. Mr. Bowser requested the Court to reserve its ruling on the government's request to dismiss Count Two until after it had ruled on his motions for acquittal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 120. The Court subsequently ordered the government to show cause why Count Two should not be dismissed with prejudice in view of the government's decision not to seek retrial on that count.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order of June 15, 2018 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Although the government is correct that the OCE was created to operate\n    <em>\n     within\n    </em>\n    the House, it is not the \"House\" itself. Article 1, section 2 of the Constitution makes clear that the House \"shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States.\" The OCE is indisputably not composed of \"members elected by the people,\" and therefore it cannot be \"the House\" as defined by the Constitution. To the contrary, a member of Congress is expressly ineligible to be on the board of the OCE.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    H. Res. 895 \u00a7 1(b)(4)(B)(i)(V).

Rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives establishes a number of standing committees and sets forth their jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Rules of the House of Representatives, available at http://clerk.house.gov/legislative/house-rules.pdf (last visited July 5, 2018). Although the House Committee on Ethics is established through those Rules as having jurisdiction over matters covered by the Code of Official Conduct,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Rule X \u00a7 1(g), the OCE is not established as a separate committee. Indeed, the OCE was designed to \"advise\" the Committee on Ethics regarding purported ethical violations, but it was never intended to supplant the work of that committee. Task Force Rep. at 10 (further explaining that the OCE would \"enhance and supplement the House ethics process\"). Moreover, at trial, Mr. Morgan squarely testified that the OCE is not a \"committee\" or a \"joint committee\":\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    Q: [T]he OCE is not a committee of the House?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n    A.

Thus, there is no evidence in the record to support the conclusion that the OCE is a committee or a joint committee of Congress.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The government strains to analogize the OCE to a congressional subcommittee that has been established by a House committee to conduct a specific investigation. Gov't MJOA Opp'n, ECF No. 82 at 8 n.6. The government posits that the OCE serves \"as an extension of the House Ethics Committee\" by conducting \"preliminary investigations\" of matters that are then referred to the Ethics Committee.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    To be sure, if the OCE were, in fact, a subcommittee, it would likely fall into the scope of section 1505.

Moreover, the OCE's investigations are not directly undertaken on behalf of the Committee on Ethics, and indeed, the connection between the OCE and the Ethics Committee is more tenuous than that between a subcommittee and a committee. For example, as Mr. Morgan explained:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    So one of the things that distinguishes the OCE from the House Ethics Committee is that the OCE can receive allegations from any source, and that was - it was intended, when the OCE was created, that there would be more avenues for allegations to be reviewed.

There is no evidence, however, that the OCE's investigation was undertaken at the behest of the House, the House Committee on Ethics, or any other congressional committee of the House or joint committee of the Congress. This conclusion is further buttressed by the fact that the Committee on Ethics did not take any final action in response to the OCE's investigation of Congressman Broun. On July 25, 2014, the OCE board issued its report recommending that the Committee on Ethics \"further review\" the allegations because there was a \"substantial reason\" to believe that House rules and federal laws were violated.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    OCE Report, Review No. 14-2533, available at https://ethics.house.gov/sites/ethics.house.gov/files/Rep.% 20Broun% 20OCE% 20Report% 20% 26% 20Findings.pdf (last visited July 5, 2018). Although the Committee on Ethics released the OCE's report and noted that the Committee was continuing to review the allegations, it did not take any action before January 3, 2015. At that point Representative Broun was no longer a member of the House and therefore was not subject to the Committee's jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Press Release, Committee on Ethics, Statement of the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Ethics Regarding Representative Paul Broun (Oct. 29, 2014), https://ethics.house.gov/press-release/statement-chairman-and-ranking-member-committee-ethics-regarding-representative-paul-0 (last accessed July 5, 2018). As such, there is no evidence to suggest that Mr. Bowser's obstructive actions somehow directly impeded the Committee on Ethics' investigation into a matter within its jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Such a showing in no way depends on whether Mr. O'Donnell's salary was reimbursable from congressional funds or any other interpretation of the \"primary purpose\" rule. To the contrary, even if the government conceded that the primary purpose of Mr. O'Donnell's work was official, Mr. Bowser could still be found to have lied to the OCE if a jury concluded that Mr. Bowser intended for some portion of Mr. O'Donnell's work to be \"political\" or \"on the political side.\" Accordingly, the Court declines to dismiss Counts Four and Seven as non-justiciable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    <strong>\n     2. There Is Sufficient Evidence Of Mens Rea To Sustain A Conviction On Counts Four And Seven\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Mr. Bowser also argues that his convictions on Counts Four and Seven fail because there is insufficient evidence of mens rea to sustain his conviction. Specifically, he argues that if he believed in good faith that Mr. O'Donnell was employed to provide official, rather than campaign, services to Congressman Broun, he lacked the necessary mens rea to make a false statement within the scope of section 1001. Def.'s Mot. for J. of Acquittal Notwithstanding the Verdict, ECF No. 117 at 10-16. In support of these arguments, Mr. Bowser reiterates the same arguments he advanced at trial, namely:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n    \u2022 Congressman Broun did not need campaign assistance when he hired Mr. O'Donnell in 2012 because Congressman Broun was the overwhelming favorite to win the primary and faced no opposition in the general election.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n    \u2022 Mr. O'Donnell was hired \"as a communications and messaging consultant\" for the \"official side\" of Congressman Broun's office, and Mr. O'Donnell's contract reflected this fact.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n    \u2022 Mr. O'Donnell volunteered his services to Congressman Broun's campaigns, as was \"commonplace\" among staff in the House.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n    \u2022 Mr. O'Donnell complained about not being paid for his services to Congressman Broun's Senate campaign and requested to be reimbursed from the campaign, which suggests that Mr. O'Donnell was not, in fact, being paid for his campaign work.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20192\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Mr. Bowser argues that, based on the facts adduced at trial, no reasonable jury could conclude that \"Mr. Bowser knew from the outset that the employment arrangement with O'Donnell was impermissible and that he deliberately lied to OCE about that arrangement.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 16.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    In considering a defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence, the Court \"must view the evidence in the light\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      most favorable\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    to the Government, giving full play to the right of the jury to determine credibility, weigh evidence and draw justifiable inferences of fact.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Mr. Allen testified that, based on his meeting with Mr. Bowser and Congressman Broun, it was initially his understanding that they were seeking a consultant who would be able to provide \"campaign services.\" 2/27/18 Trial Tr. p.m., ECF No. 103 at 32-33. Mr. Allen further testified that, after a subsequent meeting with Congressman Broun, it was his understanding that the Congressman \"was on a crusade and wanted to go around the country talking about conservative causes.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 113.

He stated that, although it was his understanding that he would primarily be providing official services to the congressman, he was also asked to assist the congressman in preparing for campaign activities within days of being hired. Trial Tr. 3/1/18 a.m. 132-139. As he continued to work for Congressman Broun, Mr. O'Donnell testified that he routinely consulted with the congressman on campaign messaging and strategy.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , 3/5/18 Trial Tr. a.m. 34, 36-37, 39-40. For example, in the course of discussing an email regarding Mr. O'Donnell's availability to prepare Congressman Broun for a campaign interview, Mr. O'Donnell confirmed that he prepared the congressman for a number of campaign events:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n    Q. Other than this particular example, were there other occasions where you would meet or speak with the Congressman to prepare him for upcoming campaign events?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n    A. There are.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n    Q. Okay. And we're going to talk about debates in a moment, but what other - what are campaign\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n    A. Speeches, media interviews that might be focused on the campaign, those kinds of events.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    3/5/18 Trial Tr. a.m. 81-82. Mr. O'Donnell even spoke with Congressman Broun's wife on a number of occasions about \"direction on messaging for the campaign\" and \"how to stay on message.\" 3/5/18 Trial Tr. a.m. 31. Furthermore, Mr. O'Donnell testified that he spent an increasing proportion of his time providing services to Congressman Broun's campaign over the course of 2013 and into 2014.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n    A. In early 2013, I would say I was doing 60 percent official work, 40 percent campaign work. By the end of 2013, that was easily 80 percent campaign work, 20 percent official work.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n    Q. During the same period - and, again, we're referring to December of '13 to March of '14 - were you in communication with the defendant?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n    A. I was.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n    Q. Approximately how often?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n    A. Maybe even daily via e-mail, at least a couple of times by phone, and then in and out of the office a time or two a week.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n    ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n    Q. And how is it that you would describe the substance of your conversations with the defendant during this period?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n    A. Most of them centered around campaign messaging, strategy, debates, things that were happening on the campaign side.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n    Q. Could you give the jury some examples or a sampling of what kind of discussions you were having with the defendant during that time?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n    A. Yes. We might have been discussing an upcoming debate and what needed to be done to prepare the candidate for that debate, what our overall message in the debate would be, logistics for the debate, the format of the debate, so we might talk about a range of things relative to that one particular event or we could be talking about how the campaign was going, generally. Particularly on the messaging side we might talk about specific media interviews that he had done or was going to do. So there were a variety of discussions that could have occurred.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n    Q. How about your communications with Congressman Broun during this period?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n    A. Mostly centered on the campaign. There would be some time for official work, if there was a press release going out from the office or things that were happening on the official side that we would message to, but mainly relative to the campaign; meetings in and out of the office, whether they were in the official office or down at Jamestown Associates when we were preparing for debates, would center around the campaign and what was happening relative to him or his competitors in the race.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n    Q. I asked you earlier about who it was that set the agenda for the work that you were doing, whether it be official or campaign. You had mentioned Mr. Bowser; is that right?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n    A. Correct.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n    Q. Same true during this period, or someone else?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n    A. Absolutely, Mr. Bowser, with input from Christine in terms of some of the tactical considerations that we needed to review. But primarily David Bowser would set the agenda for what I should be working with on Dr. Broun.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    3/5/18 Trial Tr. a.m. 101-103. Based on this testimony, the Court concludes that a reasonable jury could conclude that the government met its burden of proving mens rea sufficient to support a conviction under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Good faith is a complete defense to all of the charges in this case. A statement made with good faith belief in\n    its accuracy does not amount to a false statement and is not a crime. The burden of establishing lack of good faith and criminal intent rests on the government. A defendant is under no burden to prove his good faith; rather, the government must prove bad faith or knowledge of falsity beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    Jury Instructions, ECF No. 87 at 16. After receiving the evidence and hearing this instructions, a reasonable jury could find that, both at the time of the hiring decision and continuing through 2014, Mr. Bowser contemplated that Mr. O'Donnell would provide some services on the \"political side\" in his work for Congressman Broun. Accordingly, the Court denies Mr. Bowser's motions as to Counts Four and Seven.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.

The Court also\n    <strong>\n     GRANTS\n    </strong>\n    the government's motion to dismiss Count Two and dismisses that count with prejudice. Finally, the Court\n    <strong>\n     DENIES\n    </strong>\n    Mr. Bowser's motions with respect to Counts Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, and Seven.

In addition, Mr. Bowser does not challenge the government's case or his conviction on Count Eight, which charged him with making a false statement when he signed the Request for Information Certification verifying he had not withheld any information during the course of the OCE investigation.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-154\">\n     The parties stipulated to the following at trial: \"The House rules do not permit [Members' Representational Allowance] funds to be used to pay for campaign expenses or campaign-related political party expenses.

MRA funds may be spent to perform what are primarily official duties that are not campaign related but that have a side effect that has political or campaign-related benefits. For example, a congressional employee, whose salary is paid for with MRA funds, can write a bill that the Member introduces and then the Member can later talk about that bill at a campaign event as a reason why he or she should be elected.\" Tr.
