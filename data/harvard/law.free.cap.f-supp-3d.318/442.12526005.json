INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal from the Bankruptcy Court deals with whether the Appellants Stephen J. Kuzma (\"Kuzma\"), The Law Offices of Russo &amp; Minchoff (\"Russo &amp; Minchoff\"), and India L. Minchoff (\"Minchoff\" and collectively, the \"Lawyer Creditors\"), are able\n   to obtain interest on the legal fees they were awarded in binding arbitration, and, if so, what the appropriate interest rate ought be from the Debtor and Appellee, Savvas V. Gianasmidis (\"Gianasmidis\"). Although interest generally stops accruing when a debtor files for bankruptcy,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) provides for an exception. Section 506(b) grants over-secured creditors a right to earn interest in the period between the filing of the bankruptcy petition and confirmation of the bankruptcy plan (\"pendency interest\"). It is not contested that the Appellants were over-secured creditors since they had various liens attached to real property, the value of which exceeded their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Due to the protracted procedural history described below, the Appellants also argue on appeal that the Bankruptcy Court erred in not granting them interest on their claims prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition (\"prepetition interest\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Bankruptcy Court granted the Lawyer Creditors a stay to allow them to defend against the appeal pending in the state court. R. No. 47. The Massachusetts Appeals Court vacated the default judgment, concluding that despite a lengthy delay on the part of Gianasmidis, the Fee Agreement evinced a clear intent to arbitrate. R. No. 402-1 at 4. Accordingly, it reversed and remanded the Superior Court's denial of the motion to compel arbitration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Bankruptcy Court disagreed with the Lawyer Creditors that it needed to wait for the Superior Court to do anything on remand and ordered the parties to arbitrate.

Proceedings at the Bankruptcy Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Although the Fee Agreements do not prescribe an interest rate, the Lawyer Creditors argued before the Bankruptcy Court that as contracts they are covered by Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 231, section 6C, which provides in relevant part that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   In all actions based on contractual obligations, upon a verdict, finding or order for judgment for pecuniary damages, interest shall be added by the clerk of the court to the amount of damages, at the contract rate, if established, or at the rate of twelve per cent per annum from the date of the breach or demand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. No. 480 at 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, \u00a7 6C. Thus, the Lawyer Creditors claimed, they were entitled to a 12% annual increase on the contingency fee from the date\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Fee Agreements were breached until Gianasmidis filed a bankruptcy petition (the prepetition interest). R. No. 480 at 9-14. Additionally, the Lawyer Creditors asserted they are entitled to post-petition interest, or pendency interest, because their claim was over-secured -- a point the Bankruptcy Court noted was not in dispute because the value of the properties attached (either under the judicial lien or the attorney's lien) greatly exceeded the Lawyer Creditors' claim. Bankruptcy Ct. Tr. July 12, 2017 (\"Bankr. Hr'g &amp; Order\") 38, ECF No. 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Lawyer Creditors' pendency interest claim is based on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), which provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   To the extent that an allowed secured claim is secured by property the value of which, ... is greater than the amount of such claim,\n   <strong>\n    there shall be allowed\n   </strong>\n   to the holder of such claim, interest on such claim, and any reasonable fees, costs, or charges provided for under the agreement or State statute under which such claim arose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (emphasis added). Arguing that the relevant \"State statute\" was again Massachusetts' Chapter 231, Section 6(c), the Lawyer Creditors contended the pendency interest rate should also have been 12% per annum from the date Gianasmidis filed the bankruptcy petition (May 28, 2015) until any reorganization plan was confirmed. R. No. 480 at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Gianasmidis opposed the motion primarily on the basis that the LFAB had not included interest in its award and that the Bankruptcy Court was not permitted to \"look behind\" the arbitration award. Bankr. Hr'g &amp; Order 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court rejected Gianasmidis's argument that the LFAB's failure to include interest in its arbitration award precluded the Bankruptcy Court from assessing interest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It gave two reasons why it was not precluded from assigning interest: (1) the LFAB's rules \"make clear that the arbitrator only decides the amount of the fee\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Section 506(b) is the relevant \"statutory credit predicate,\" and it authorizes the Bankruptcy Court to assign interest if permitted under state law or per the terms of the agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court further concluded that the Chapter 231, Section 6(c) of the Massachusetts General Laws did not apply because it requires a \"verdict\" or \"judgment\" and the Massachusetts Appeals Court had vacated the Superior Court's judgment without any \"conditions or restrictions on the vacator.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    at 40-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Gianasmidis argues that this calculation was within the Bankruptcy Court's discretion and is therefore subject to the abuse of discretion review. Appellee's Br. 15-16. The Lawyer Creditors allege the Bankruptcy Court committed \"clear error\" in its calculation. Appellants' Br. 12-14. As discussed below, the plain reading of section 506(b), when read in context with section 502, requires that pendency \"shall be allowed\" as of the date of the filing of the petition.

Temporarily setting aside the appropriate\n   <strong>\n    rate\n   </strong>\n   (discussed below in subsection D), the Lawyer Creditors argue that because they were over-secured creditors during the entirety of this protracted litigation, they are entitled under section 506(b) to pendency interest accruing from the\n   <strong>\n    petition date\n   </strong>\n   (May 28, 2015), as opposed to the date of the arbitration award (January 20, 2017.

It is true that section 506(b) does not state when the pendency interest begins to accrue; its only condition is that the creditor be over-secured. As noted above, however, section 506(b) modifies the baseline rule established in section 502 and cannot be read in isolation. The text of section 502(b)(2) reads in relevant part, \"[e]xcept as provided in subsection[ ] (e)(2) ... the court, after notice and a hearing, shall determine the amount of such claim ...\n   <strong>\n    as of the date of the filing of the petition\n   </strong>\n   , and shall allow such claim in such amount, except to the extent that ... such claim is for unmatured interest\" (emphasis added). The exception noted in section 502(b)(2), sub-section (e)(2), further defines how the court ought treat the claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A claim for reimbursement or contribution of [an entity that is liable with the debtor on or has secured the claim of a creditor] that becomes fixed after the commencement of the case shall be determined, and shall be allowed under [ \u00a7 502(b)(2) ] ... the same as if such claim had become fixed before the date of the filing of the petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In other words, although Gianasmidis objected to the Lawyer Creditors' claim of proof and the claim was therefore not \"determined\" at the time of the petition, the claim, once determined, is not to be treated any differently than it would be were it determined at the time the petition was filed. To treat section 506(b) motions for pendency interest as accruing from the time the claim is determined would violate the spirit of section 502(e)(2) by disadvantaging claims that were not determined at the time the bankruptcy petition was filed. Thus, the plain meaning of section 506(b) mandates that an over-secured creditor's claim shall be allowed interest from the date of the petition (provided of course that the creditor is over-secured at the time of the petition).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This intuitively makes sense since the amount to which an over-secured creditor is entitled often is not settled until the plan confirmation proceeding. An alternative reading would inappropriately incentivize debtors to oppose determination of over-secured creditors' claims solely in order to delay accrual of pendency interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The United States Supreme Court and numerous other courts have likewise held that for creditors who are over-secured at the time of the petition, interest pursuant to section 506(b) begins as of the date of the petition filing.\n   <em>\n    Rake\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12038\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/464/#p471\">\n    508 U.S. 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 471,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6525493,12038\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/113/2187/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12038\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/464/#p471\">\n    124 L.Ed.2d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993)\n   <em>\n    superseded by statute on other grounds\n   </em>\n   (\"Under \u00a7 506(b) the holder of an oversecured claim is allowed interest on\n   his claim to the extent of the value of the collateral....
