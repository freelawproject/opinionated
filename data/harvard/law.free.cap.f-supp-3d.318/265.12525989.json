(\"CSMI\") brings suit against Defendant VESTA Corporation (\"Vesta\") for: (1) intentional interference with business relations; and (2) tortious interference with a reasonable expectation of prospective economic advantage. CSMI alleges that Vesta interfered with its contract to manage an apartment property in the District of Columbia, causing CSMI to lose the contract. Pending before the Court is Vesta's motion to dismiss the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 6. Upon consideration of the motion, the response and reply thereto, and the relevant law, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Vesta's motion and\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES\n   </strong>\n   CSMI's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   CSMI is a property management corporation located in the District of Columbia. Compl., ECF No. 1 \u00b6 3. Vesta is a property management corporation located in Connecticut.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. At different times, both corporations managed the Park Southern Apartments, an apartment property located in Southeast District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 8, 9. This property was owned by the Park Southern Neighborhood Corporation (\"PSNC\") under a Deed of Trust with the District of Columbia, \"acting by and through DHCD [the District of Columbia Department of Housing and Community Development].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. The Deed of Trust stated that PSNC was indebted to the District of Columbia for over three million dollars.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. The Deed of Trust required PSNC to repay the debt with interest and perform certain duties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   PSNC contracted with Vesta to manage the Park Southern Apartments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. However, on March 17, 2014, PSNC terminated the contract because it was \"not satisfied\" with Vesta's services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The same day, PSNC entered into an \"exclusive\" management agreement with CSMI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10. Pursuant to that agreement, CSMI was to manage the Park Southern Apartment for a year with the option to continue the contract on a year-to-year basis thereafter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. If the contract was terminated without cause within the first year, CSMI would be entitled to the compensation owed for the time remaining under the contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Less than a month after PSNC entered into the management contract with CSMI, DHCD sent PSNC a \"notice of default\" and gave PSNC a month to cure the default.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. When PSNC did not cure the default by May 2, 2014, DHCD \"implemented the default process.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. The same day, DHCD entered into an \"emergency contract\" with Vesta to manage the Park Southern Apartments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. The emergency contract \"authorized Vesta to take over the management of the Park Southern Apartments on May 3, 2014 without any notice of termination to CSMI.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   CSMI alleges that Vesta knew about its business relationship and contractual expectancy, yet interfered with its management agreement.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-51. CSMI alleges that Vesta had been in frequent communication with DHCD regarding DHCD's \"intention to default\" PSNC and remove CSMI as property manager.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-25. According to CSMI, Vesta told DHCD that it \"was going to continue to manage the property and to provide (DHCD) whatever assistance we need with respect to the ongoing condition of the property,\" despite having been terminated by PSNC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 41. CSMI alleges that \"its relationship with PSNC was broken and CSMI lost any income it should have received for its management services\" as a \"direct and proximate result of Vesta performing the management contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. CSMI requests $100,000 in compensatory and economic damages, as well as punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45, 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Vesta moves to dismiss CSMI's complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot., ECF No. 6. It makes three arguments: (1) CSMI's complaint must be dismissed as time-barred; (2) CSMI is collaterally estopped from bringing its case against Vesta because the same issues were already litigated against the District of Columbia in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) CSMI's complaint must be dismissed because it fails to state claims\n   of tortious interference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the Court agrees that CSMI's complaint is time-barred, it need not consider Vesta's additional arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. CSMI's Claims are Time-Barred\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Vesta argues that CSMI was aware of its alleged tortious actions on May 3, 2014-the date that DHCD took control of the Park Southern Apartments and contracted with Vesta, thereby terminating CSMI's contract. Def.'s Mot., ECF No. 6 at 5-7. Because the statute of limitations for tortious interference claims is three years under District of Columbia law, Vesta contends that CSMI's complaint-filed on August 28, 2017-is time-barred.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (citing D.C. Code. \u00a7 12-301(8) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   It is undisputed that CSMI's claims are subject to a three-year statute of limitations pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012-301\">\n    D.C.

At issue, then, is when the three-year statute of limitations began to run. CSMI contends that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until it had \"actual notice\" of Vesta's offending conduct, which did not occur until July 14, 2016.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012-301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012-301\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A, ECF No. 6-1 \u00b6 18.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to CSMI, DHCD terminated\n   CSMI's contract in order to award the emergency management contract to Vesta \"because of political and personal connections on the pretense of an 'emergency contract' award.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11871184\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/705/656/#p661\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   CSMI also alleged that the District of Columbia conspired with \"non-government private parties\" by entering into an agreement to \"sabotage [CSMI's] contract and/or business relationship and opportunities in an unlawful manner.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. Such allegations regarding Vesta's and DHCD's tortious collaboration were made well before CSMI had access to the 2016 discovery.\n   <em>\n    Compare id., with\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 9 at 5 (arguing that CSMI required discovery to uncover Vesta's alleged wrongdoing and as such, CSMI \"did not have notice of the cause ... [or] actual evidence of Vesta's actionable conduct until July 14, 2016\"). CSMI does not address its 2014 allegations that Vesta had collaborated with DHCD to interfere with CSMI's management contract, nor does it address that it made such allegations well before receiving discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court finds that CSMI knew or had reason to know about Vesta's alleged tortious conduct more than three years before it filed its claim in this Court. The Court therefore denies CSMI's request for \"limited discovery on the narrow issue of when CSMI knew or should have known about Vesta's tortious conduct.\" Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 9 at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion and Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court finds that CSMI had reason to know of Vesta's alleged tortious conduct in May 2014. Because it is undisputed that the applicable statute of limitations is three years and CSMI did not file its claim until August 2017, the Court must\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Vesta's motion to dismiss and\n   <strong>\n    DISMISS\n   </strong>\n   CSMI's claims as time-barred. This is a final, appealable Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    It is unclear why PSNC \"defaulted\" or what the \"default process\" entailed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    CSMI sued the District of Columbia in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia, claiming breach of contract, a breach of the covenant of good faith, tortious interference with contractual relations, and tortious interference with a business opportunity.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Ex. A, ECF No. 6-1 (Civil Case Number 2014-cv-4551). Judge Mott granted the District of Columbia's motion for summary judgment, finding that the District of Columbia was entitled to sovereign immunity.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Ex. B, ECF No. 6-1 at 22 (Civil Case Number 2014-cv-4551). Judge Mott also found that \"CSMI cannot establish a\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    case of tortious interference with contractual or business relationship\" because \"no evidence exists that the District of Columbia actually interfered with CSMI's contract\" because \"CSMI voluntarily decided not to enforce its claimed rights under the Management Agreement after DHCD entered the property.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    CSMI argues that Judge Mott's findings related to its tortious interference claim are\n    <em>\n     dicta\n    </em>\n    . Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 9 at 7-8. Because the Court finds that CSMI's complaint is time-barred, it need not resolve the significance of Judge Mott's second finding.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    When citing electronic filings throughout this Opinion, the Court cites to the ECF page number, not the page number of the filed document.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The Court may take judicial notice of public records on a motion to dismiss.\n    <em>\n     Kaempe v.
