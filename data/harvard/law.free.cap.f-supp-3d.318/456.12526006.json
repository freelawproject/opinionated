Specifically, Lawrence Watson (\"plaintiff\" or \"Watson\") alleges that defendants Justice Angela Ordonez, Justice Paula Carey, Attorney Whitney Duvall and Commissioner Michael Heffernan (collectively \"defendants\"), in their individual and official capacity, violated his civil rights by failing to compel court employees to comply with state statutes regarding the waiver of court fees for indigent parties and by attempting to enforce child support payments through a civil contempt proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before this Court are (1) plaintiff's motion for injunctive relief and second motion for injunctive relief (Docket Nos. 2 and 28), (2) defendants' motion to dismiss (Docket No. 15) and (3) plaintiff's motion for a criminal complaint of perjury against Judicial Case Manager Daniel Gibson (Docket No. 24). For the reasons that follow, defendants' motion to dismiss will be allowed and plaintiffs' motions for injunctive relief and for a criminal complaint will be denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In September, 2017, Watson initiated this action which relates directly to proceedings in the Suffolk County Probate and Family Court (\"Suffolk Family Court\"). He had previously filed a complaint in that court against Sherry Walker, the mother of his only child, in April 2003 for visitation and custody rights. In July, 2003, Watson was ordered to make weekly child support payments to Ms. Walker. Watson claims that his unemployment benefits expired in May, 2004 and thereafter he did not \"willingly\" make child support payments. That same year the Department of Revenue (\"DOR\") purportedly ordered the Registry of Motor Vehicles to suspend Watson's license without hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants are all affiliated, in one way or another, with the Suffolk Family Court and the Department of Revenue. Michael Heffernan (\"Heffernan\") is the former Commissioner of the Department of Revenue and was responsible for supervising DOR employees, including Attorney Whitney Duvall (\"Attorney Duvall\"), who acted as counsel for the DOR. Justices Angela Ordonez (\"Justice Ordonez\") and Paula Carey (\"Justice Carey\") are judges who presided over sessions in the Suffolk Family Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Watson alleges that he wrote to Justice Carey 11 times between September, 2008 and February, 2014 to inform her that employees of the Suffolk Family Court had failed to comply M.G.L. c. 261 \u00a7\u00a7 27A - 27D by refusing to accept affidavits of indigency from Watson seeking fee waivers in his proceeding. He claims that he subsequently informed Justice Ordonez of the conduct of the employees on two occasions in 2014. Watson asserts that neither judicial officer took action to compel compliance with the state statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In April, 2016, Attorney Duvall, acting as counsel for the DOR, filed a civil contempt action against Watson to enforce child support payment obligations. Watson alleges that Attorney Duvall held herself out as representing Ms. Walker, rather than the DOR or the Commonwealth, in violation of M.G.L. c. 119A \u00a7 3. He claims that he informed Commissioner Heffernan that Attorney Duvall purported to represent Ms. Walker in October, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The proceedings in Suffolk Family Court are ongoing.\n   <em>\n    Lawrence B.

Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Watson moves for injunctive relief to prevent Judges Ordonez and Carey from allowing their subordinates to avoid compliance with purported relevant statutory provisions on fee waivers for indigent parties. The defendants oppose that motion and move to dismiss the case on the grounds that (1)\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention applies, (2) the claims against the defendants in their official capacities are barred by the Eleventh Amendment, (3) there is no private cause of action under the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, (4) Justices Ordonez and Carey are entitled to judicial immunity, (5) claims against them are barred by the statute of limitations, (6) Attorney Duvall is entitled to absolute immunity and (7) Watson fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This Court finds that the three prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   test are met and that therefore this Court must abstain from reaching the merits of plaintiff's claims. The threshold question of whether Watson's action in this Court interferes with a state judicial proceeding is easily answered in the affirmative. The injunctive relief sought by him directly obstructs the ongoing proceeding in the Suffolk Family Court. If granted, that relief would force the Suffolk Family Court to reconsider its decision with respect to Watson's fee waiver request and preclude Attorney Duvall from pursuing the contempt proceeding on\n   behalf of the DOR to enforce child support obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The state court proceedings involve the enforcement of child support which touches on a core concern of state government. Specifically, plaintiff seeks injunctive relief that would interfere with orders of the Suffolk Family Court related to child support payments and the suspension of plaintiff's driver's license as a result of arrearages in those payments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tyler\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4026116\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/981/92/#p96\">\n    981 F.Supp.2d 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96-97 (D.
