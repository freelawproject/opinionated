D.E. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs are The National Association of the Deaf (\"NAD\") and an individual named Eddie Sierra.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12. NAD is an organization comprising individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Sierra is a member of NAD and is deaf.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   They have sued several state entities and officials under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 for failing to put closed captions on live and archived videos of Florida legislative sessions. Specifically, Plaintiffs have sued: the state of Florida, the Florida Senate, Joe Negron in his official capacity as President of the Senate, the Florida House of Representatives, Richard Corcoran in his official capacity as Speaker of the House, the Florida State University Board of Trustees (\"FSU\"), and John Thrasher in his official capacity as President of FSU.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-22, 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Senate and House live stream their legislative proceedings through their websites and maintain archives of those videos.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23, 24, 26. FSU also owns or operates a website (through its public broadcasting station, WFSU) that live streams\n   legislative proceedings and maintains archived recordings of such videos.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. These videos are not captioned.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants have also posted uncaptioned videos on social media.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. Because Sierra is deaf, these videos are inaccessible to him without captions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. The same goes for NAD's other hearing-impaired members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs allege that by not providing captions on these videos, Defendants have intentionally discriminated against them and denied them the ability to meaningfully participate in the democratic process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67, 68.

Defendants have not responded to his letter or provided captions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. NAD filed a complaint against the Senate and House with the Federal Communications Commission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.

D.E. 1, Ex. 1. The response explained that TFC produces a 24-hour television programming feed that is closed captioned.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Any segments of legislative videos aired on that program, therefore, are captioned.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   TFC also live streams legislative proceedings, and this live streaming is separate from the 24-hour television program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These live streamed videos, which come from a different source than the captioned videos that are played on the 24-hour television program, are put up on the internet and made available to the public, but they do not include captions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on these allegations, Plaintiffs bring two causes of action against all Defendants: one for violating Title II of the ADA, and another for violating section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44, 57.
