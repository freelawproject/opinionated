Baca made that oral motion on Friday February 23, 2018-at the close of Plaintiff United States of America's case in chief-and he argued that the uncontroverted evidence indicates that Romero did not actually suffer a serious bodily injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Draft Trial Transcript\n   (held February 23, 2018) at 327:24-329:16 (Lowry)(\"Tr.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 328:13-15 (Lowry)(commenting that \"we just heard Agent Acee testify that not even the prosecution could find a doctor or doctors that would agree that there was series bodily harm inflicted\"). The United States orally replied that the Romero conspirators intended to inflict serious bodily injury to Romero-or perhaps to kill him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 329:17-330:15 (Castellano).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 330:10-12 (Castellano)(commenting that \"it's clear that the conspiracy was there and we don't need to prove the underlying injuries or the resultant injuries\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   One week later, the United States filed a written response to Baca's rule 29 motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   United States' Response to Defendant Baca's Rule 29 Motion Regarding Count 8 at 1, filed March 2, 2018 (Doc. 1848)(\"Response\"). In the Response, the United States argues that the Court should not grant Baca's rule 29 motion, because \"[t]he evidence at trial established that Defendant Baca conspired to murder J.R.,\" so \"the intended harm would create a high probability of death or result in serious disfigurement,\" such that a reasonable jury could infer that Baca \"conspired to commit the crime charged in Count 8.\" Response at 4. Notably absent from that Response is any argument that the trial evidence indicates that Romero suffered a serious bodily injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 4. Indeed, Agent Bryan Acee testified that the medical professionals who treated Romero did not believe that he sustained a serious bodily injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   298:23-25 (Acee).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 299:2-4 (Acee)(\"And I needed a medical professional to testify to that. And they did not consider it serious bodily injury.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Baca subsequently filed a written reply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Anthony Ray Baca's Reply in Support of His Rule 29 Motion to Dismiss Count 8 at 1, filed March 2, 2018 (Doc. 1852)(\"Reply\"). In the Reply, Baca argues that \"any purported conspiracy to assault Julian Romero did not result in serious bodily injury to him, and the United States does not make any claim that it did.\" Reply at 3. Baca also argues that \"it was [Lupe] Urquizo that wanted to kill Julian Romero, not Defendant Baca.\" Reply at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Committing and conspiring to commit assault with intent to inflict serious bodily injury do not violate\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"VICAR\").

While one can commit a conspiracy offense without accomplishing the conspiracy's objective, as a practical matter, it is impossible to determine whether an agreed assault has a result-as opposed to an intended result-constituting serious bodily injury if the assault does not actually occur. That practical difficulty is a necessary consequence of the way Congress chose to structure VICAR and the Court will not-under the guise of applying VICAR's conspiracy provision-rewrite \"conspiracy to commit assault resulting in serious bodily injury\" into \"conspiracy to assault with intent to inflict serious bodily injury.\" The United States correctly notes that the trial evidence would support a VICAR conspiracy to murder charge based on the Romero assault.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 4. Count 8 of the grand jury's indictment does not charge that offense, however, and the Court is not free to redraft the indictment by substituting murder for assault\n   resulting in serious bodily injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter v.
