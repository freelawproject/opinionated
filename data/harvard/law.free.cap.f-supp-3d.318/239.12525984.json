The Court dismissed Ms. Menoken's \"medical inquiries\" claim because it found that her complaint included no allegation\n   that the EEOC made unlawful inquiries into her medical history and did not identify any provision of the Rehab Act authorizing suit for lawful inquiries.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524302\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/175/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524302\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/175/\">\n    at 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the current motion, Ms. Menoken now states that her Amended Complaint was not clear and that she intended the medical inquires and confidentiality claims to be separate from her reasonable accommodation Rehab Act claim. That was not her position in briefing the motion to dismiss.

Additionally, the Court found that \"the very accommodation requested was to\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   perform the necessary functions of her position for so long as her EEO charges were pending, which is the exact opposite of showing that she was qualified to perform her job with an accommodation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524302\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/175/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524302\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/175/\">\n    at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Menoken in Supp. of Am. Compl. [Dkt. 10-1] \u00b6 3. However, the Amended Complaint specifically mentions Ms. Menoken's September 11, 2012 request to EEOC to discuss her need for a reasonable accommodation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 92.

Ms. Menoken alleges that COO Withers unlawfully arranged for processing of her accommodation request to be delayed and offered to settle by approving Ms. Menoken's reasonable accommodation request if she absolved EEOC of liability with respect to any claims arising from her employment. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 94, 96;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mem. at 4. However, this Court has determined that Ms. Menoken's requested accommodation was not reasonable. An employer and employee determine a reasonable accommodation best \"through a flexible, interactive process.\"\n   <em>\n    Pantazes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8976700\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/366/57/#p70\">\n    366 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   70 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201630.2\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (o)(3) ). The \"interference\" Ms. Menoken alleges is simply part of this interactive process after requesting an accommodation that was not reasonable; it is not an adverse action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Not only is the sufficiency of the process of determining a reasonable accommodation not challengeable under the Rehab Act, but even if Ms. Menoken's claim were construed under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012203\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case could not be established because she cannot show a materially adverse action by her employer.
