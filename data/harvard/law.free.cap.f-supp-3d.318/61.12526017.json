INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This suit arises from a fraught lending relationship between Plaintiff &amp; Counter-Defendant Presidential Bank, FSB (\"Presidential\") and Defendants &amp; Counter-Claimants Kevin Green and six LLC that he owns (\"Defendants\"). Between 2006 and 2010, Presidential made a series of loans to Defendants secured with real property that Defendants owned. Beginning in 2014, Defendants struggled to make payments in compliance with their agreements with Presidential, and ultimately defaulted on their loans. The parties entered into several modifications to the lending agreements. One such modification was a forbearance agreement, whereby Presidential agreed not to collect the money Defendants owed it until April 2017 in exchange for, among other things, receiving significant control over Defendants' rental income. When Defendants defaulted again, Presidential demanded that Defendants pay all of the money they owed under the Forbearance Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Presidential pursued two avenues of relief against Defendants: first, it filed a claim for a confessed judgment in Maryland state court, and second, it filed suit in D.C. Superior Court for conversion of the funds it should have had access to pursuant to a lockbox agreement contained in the Forbearance Agreement. The D.C. suit also sought the appointment of a receiver to operate, manage, and control Defendants' properties. Defendants subsequently removed the case to this Court. Defendants responded to Presidential's claims with twelve affirmative defenses and nine counterclaims against Presidential. Since then, the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Maryland has entered a confessed judgment against Defendants, and the Maryland Court of Special Appeals has denied Defendants' motion to vacate it for lack of personal jurisdiction. Based on the Court of Special Appeals's ruling, Presidential has moved to strike the jury demand contained in Defendants' Answer and Counterclaim, and for partial summary\n   judgment on eleven of Defendants' twelve affirmative defenses and on its first claim for relief in its counterclaim. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants both of Presidential's motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants in this suit are six District of Columbia limited liability companies and Kevin Green, the sole management-member of the six LLCs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Affirmative Defenses, Answers &amp; Counter-Claims (\"Answer\") at 19-20, ECF No. 12. Between 2006 and 2010, Plaintiff Presidential Bank made several loans to each of the LLCs, secured by deeds of trust and with each Defendant-LLC-owned apartment building serving as collateral on the loans.

However, in June 2015, Defendants again defaulted on the Global Loan Modification Agreement when they failed to make each of their loans current by January 15, 2015. Compl. \u00b6 11; Answer at 23. To cure this default, Defendants and Presidential entered into a forbearance agreement in August 2015. Defs.' Answer at 25;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 12; Forbearance Agreement, ECF No. 17-2. Under the terms of the Forbearance Agreement, Presidential agreed to delay collecting the amount due under the loans until April 1, 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Forbearance Agreement at 5, and in exchange, Defendants entered into a contract that contained a confessed judgment provision, a lockbox agreement, and a waiver of the right to a jury trial in any dispute arising out of the Forbearance Agreement or the underlying loans. Answer at 24; Forbearance Agreement at 5, 9. The confessed judgment provision allowed Presidential's attorneys, upon any subsequent default by Defendants, to obtain a judgment in Presidential's favor from the Circuit Court in Montgomery County, Maryland for \"the amount of the unpaid principal balance of the notes together with any accrued and unpaid interest, late charges and attorneys' fees and costs incurred by the lender, together with all other costs and expenses incurred or accrued and unpaid under this agreement.\" Forbearance Agreement at 9. Under the lockbox agreement, Defendants agreed to \"continue to deposit all deposits in their possession, including but not limited to rents, relating to the Collateral Properties directly into\" operating accounts controlled by Presidential.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. The lockbox agreement also set the priorities for how those funds would be spent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6; Answer at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In May 2016, Defendants defaulted on the Forbearance Agreement. Compl. \u00b6 13; Answer at 28-29. Defendants were given until June 6, 2016, to cure their default. Compl. \u00b6 14. When Defendants did not cure their default, Presidential declared all of Defendants' debt from the Forbearance Agreement, notes, guaranty, and deeds of trust due.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Around that time, Defendants stopped depositing money into the operating accounts in alleged violation of the lockbox agreement. Compl. \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following this deterioration in the lending relationship, Presidential sought the confessed judgment specified in the Forbearance Agreement, and was awarded $3,314,295.63 by the Montgomery County Circuit Court on June 27, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Confessed Judgment, ECF No. 48-3. It also filed suit in D.C. Superior Court on July 18, 2016, seeking damages for conversion of the money it believed Defendants should have still been depositing in the operating account pursuant to the lockbox agreement, as well as the appointment of a receiver.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl. In December 2016, Defendants removed the case to\n   this Court based on the diversity of citizenship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal, ECF No. 1. Once the case had been removed, Defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the impending foreclosure sale of its properties or, in the alternative, for a temporary restraining order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Emergency Mot. Stay, ECF No. 8. The Court denied Defendants' motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, ECF No. 11. Defendants subsequently answered Presidential's complaint with twelve affirmative defenses and nine counterclaims.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Answer. Defendants' Answer also requested that the Court \"[f]ind the Forbearance Agreement referenced herein unconscionable and void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   .\" Answer at 47. Defendants informed the Court that following its denial of Defendants' motion to stay, Defendants' properties were sold on January 26, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   These two suits-one in Maryland state court and one in D.C. federal court-proceeded concurrently for more than a year. Following the entry of the confessed judgment, Defendants moved to vacate it, arguing \"primarily that judgments by confession are disfavored in Maryland, and [that] the circuit court lacked personal jurisdiction over them because neither Mr. Green nor any of the LLCs had sufficient ties to Montgomery County.\" Mot. Strike Ex. 14 (\"Md. Op.\") at 3, ECF No. 47-16. The circuit court judge was unpersuaded, given that the confessed judgment provision in the Forbearance Agreement included a forum-selection clause, and declined to vacate the judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. He further explained that he \"searched in vain for the allegation of a potentially meritorious defense\" to the confessed judgment, but \"never heard, never read in any of the documents that were submitted, what this meritorious defense to the note might be.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants appealed, but the Maryland Court of Special Appeals affirmed the lower court's refusal to vacate the confessed judgment in February 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. The Court of Special Appeals highlighted that \"absent fraud, duress, or mutual mistake, 'a party who signs a contract is presumed to have read and understood its terms and ... the party will be bound by them when that document is executed.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dashiell v.

It explained that \"[a]lthough Mr. Green contended, at oral argument, that the forum selection clause was not freely negotiated, he did not make that assertion before the circuit court or in his brief, and he submitted no evidence in support of that claim. Because the contention was not made below, it [wa]s not before [the Court of Special Appeals] for appellate review.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3517942\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/396/149/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 8 n. 5. All in all, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that \"the borrowers are bound [by] the terms of the forbearance agreement, including the clause consenting to personal jurisdiction by the circuit court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   While the Maryland Court of Special Appeals's decision was pending, Defendants' filed a motion to stay these proceedings, which was granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Stay, ECF No. 36; Minute Order (Aug. 23, 2017). Now that the Court of Special Appeals has affirmed the lower court's ruling and the stay has been lifted, Presidential has moved for summary judgment on eleven of Defendants' twelve affirmative defenses, as well as its first request for relief, on the grounds that these defenses and the request are precluded by the Maryland state court judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Renewed Mot. Partial Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Mot.\"), ECF No. 48. It has also moved to strike Defendants' demand for a jury trial in its Answer, arguing that Defendants voluntarily waived that right in the Forbearance Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. Strike, ECF No. 47. Defendants argue in response that the Maryland court judgment has no preclusive effect on its affirmative defenses or its\n   demand for a jury trial because neither Defendants' arguments in favor of its jury demand nor any of its affirmative defenses \"rest on the nexus of unconscionability and 'confessed judgment.' \" Defs.'

MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Presidential now seeks to avail itself of any preclusive effect its success in obtaining the confessed judgment in Maryland might have on this case. As such, it has filed a motion for summary judgment on eleven of Defendants' twelve affirmative defenses-all but breach of contract-as well as Defendants' request that this Court void the entire Forbearance Agreement, on the theory that Defendants missed their chance to proffer these defenses and this request when they did not raise them in Maryland.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Upon the Maryland Court of Special Appeals's affirmance of the Circuit Court's denial of Defendants' motion to vacate the confessed judgment, Presidential moved for partial summary judgment on eleven of Defendants' twelve affirmative defenses, as well as their first request for relief-that the Court \"[f]ind the Forbearance Agreement ... unconscionable and void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   .\" Pl.'s Mem. P. &amp; A. Supp. Pl.'s Renewed Mot. Partial Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Mem.\") at 1, ECF No. 48-1. Presidential argues that \"Defendants' efforts to challenge the enforceability of the forbearance agreement in this Court ignores the fact that the Montgomery County Circuit Court (the \"Circuit Court\") has already held that the forbearance agreement is enforceable,\" thereby precluding Defendants from raising defenses and requests stemming from that contention that could have been raised in the prior proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.

However, Defendants do concede that \"should an affirmative defense rest on the nexus of unconscionability and [the] 'confessed judgment,' that defens[ ]e should be stricken.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. As explained below, the Court finds that Defendants' first request for relief-that the Forbearance Agreement be found unconscionable and void-is precluded by res judicata.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Patel v. HealthPlus, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Maryland Court of Special Appeals found that a plaintiff doctor's fee disputes with a Health Maintenance Organization with which he had contracted were precluded by an earlier suit with fee claims based in the same contract because \"ample means existed for all of the fee disputes to have been tried as a single case.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2347755\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/112/251/\">\n    112 Md.App. 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2347755\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/112/251/\">\n    684 A.2d 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 918 (Md.

Even though the basis of both suits was a single lease, and therefore, the cases' \"facts [were] related in time, space, [and] origin,\" and even though it would have been convenient to try both cases together, the Court found that, because the landlord's claim for contract damages could not have been properly joined procedurally with his summary ejectment case, the first suit did not preclude the landlord from bringing the second.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89303\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/317/49/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under the Forbearance Agreement, the confessed judgment clause applied only to \"the amount of the unpaid principle balance of the notes together with any accrued and unpaid interest, late charges\n   and attorneys' fees and costs incurred by the lender, together with all other costs and expenses incurred or accrued and unpaid under the agreement.\" Forbearance Agreement at 9. The lockbox agreement at issue in this case was provided for in a separate part of the contract, and was not enforceable through a confessed judgment. However, the lockbox agreement was necessarily related to the confessed judgment provision, because the money placed in the operating accounts pursuant to the lockbox agreement were designated to be used to pay off Defendants' debt to Presidential.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Forbearance Agreement at 5-6.

First, the Court cannot void the entire Forbearance Agreement without nullifying the confessed judgment in Maryland, which was derived from the Forbearance Agreement. Under Maryland law, if the original defendant's permissive counterclaim would \"nullify\" the prior judgment or impair the rights the prior judgment created, then claim preclusion bars the subsequent raising of the counterclaim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mostofi v.

As Maryland courts have yet to explicitly recognize offensive res judicata, this principle has not yet been applied to affirmative defenses that, should they be proven, would nullify a prior court judgment. However, because the effect of a finding of duress in this case would have the same effect of nullifying the Maryland Court of Special Appeals's implicit finding that the Forbearance Agreement was not entered into under duress as any counterclaim challenging the validity of the Forbearance Agreement, the same principal that Maryland courts have applied to nullifying counterclaims should be applied to nullifying affirmative defenses as well. If Defendants had wanted to challenge the confessed judgment because they believed they had entered into the Forbearance Agreement under duress, they had ample opportunity to move to vacate the confessed judgment on that basis. And, if their motion based on duress was successful, they would have had the opportunity to fully litigate the question of whether the confessed judgment provision, and even the entire Forbearance Agreement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   should be voided on\n   that basis. For this reason, the Court finds that Defendants' first affirmative defense, duress, is barred by res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants' second affirmative defense, undue influence, similarly could have been raised as a defense once the confessed judgment had been vacated and the case had proceeded to trial, though undue influence would not have on its own served as a ground to vacate the confessed judgment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nils, LCC v.

They generally do so out of financial exigency, but if the act of executing the promissory note is a voluntary one, Rule 2-611(c) does not require us to look behind it.\") Because Defendants have not alleged that Presidential pursued a separate attempt to unduly influence Defendants into signing the lockbox agreement as opposed to the confessed judgment portion of the Forbearance Agreement, a finding of undue influence in this case would directly conflict with the finding of the Maryland Circuit Court when it entered the confessed judgment.

Defendants allege that \"Presidential is not entitled to obtain any equitable remedies because Presidential is acting unethically and has acted in bad faith by lying and concealing the fact that Borrowers had sufficient funds controlled by Presidential to timely pay mortgages and insurance.\" Answer at 3. In effect, Defendants are accusing Presidential of lying and causing them to default on the Forbearance Agreement, leading to the confessed judgment. As such, this defense stems from Defendants' allegedly fraudulent conduct after the signing of the Forbearance Agreement, rather than before. However, it is clear that the \"unclean\" conduct at issue in Defendants' Answer affects both the confessed judgment clause and the lockbox agreement.

It is clear both from Presidential's timeline and the fact\n   that Defendants do not distinguish between the \"unclean\" conduct as it relates to the confessed judgment provision and the lockbox agreement, that the basis for Defendants' unclean hands defense is the same basis for the unclean hands defense it could have raised in Maryland. Because the Maryland courts, by refusing to vacate the confessed judgment, have implicitly found that no \"unclean\" conduct caused Defendants' to default on their loans, thereby entitling Presidential to the confessed judgment, the Court is precluded from allowing the defense to go forward here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Next the Court turns to Defendants' fourth, sixth, and seventh affirmative defenses-misrepresentation, fraudulent misrepresentation, and negligent misrepresentation, respectively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer at 3-5. These defenses are based on Defendants' assertion that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Presidential made the false material statement to Borrowers that if Borrowers signed the forbearance agreement that Presidential would not foreclose on borrowers' properties and would help borrowers manage their properties and insure that borrowers' mortgages, insurance and other property business expenses were paid on time.

However, as explained above, Defendants had the opportunity, when challenging the Maryland confessed judgment, to raise additional defenses challenging the validity of the confessed judgment or the entire Forbearance Agreement.

As explained above, Defendants have provided no explanation as to how they were induced to sign the lockbox portion of the Forbearance Agreement through misrepresentation, when they have already been found, implicitly, by the Maryland courts, to have not been subjected to the same sort of misrepresentation when they signed the confessed judgment portion of the agreement. Because these defenses would have served as defenses against the entire Forbearance Agreement if they had been raised before the Maryland courts, Defendants are precluded from raising them now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendants' fifth affirmative defense is breach of fiduciary duty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer at 4.

Defendants believe that due to this relationship of trust, \"it was important for Presidential as a fiduciary to disclose all facts which could be considered material even if not expressly asked about,\" including \"that the agreement had confession judgment provisions, waiver of borrower's rights provisions and\n   gave Presidential total control of borrowers' business, business affairs and business income.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4379680\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/83/66/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, according to Defendants, this relationship \"arguably created a potential and/or actual conflict of interest with the borrowers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4379680\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/83/66/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This affirmative defense seems to more squarely counter the validity of the lockbox agreement than the validity of the confessed judgment. It was through the lockbox agreement that Presidential created the purported fiduciary relationship with Defendants, by gaining control over Defendants' rents to use to pay off its debt. However, this defense could also have been used to challenge the confessed judgment once it had been vacated. After all, it was this alleged breach of fiduciary relationship that Defendants claim caused it to default on the Forbearance Agreement, allowing Presidential to procure the confessed judgment against them. Because this defense could have been raised during the Maryland litigation, Defendants are precluded from asserting here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendants' eighth defense is unconscionable dealing and conduct.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As mentioned above, Presidential has put forth two major arguments in support of its motion to strike. First, it argues that every ground on which Defendants' could challenge the enforceability of the jury waiver are barred by res judicata. Second, it argues that Defendants' long history of signing away their right to a jury trial demonstrates that they entered into this jury waiver knowingly and voluntarily. While the question of whether the jury waiver was knowingly and voluntarily entered into is more complex than Presidential argues it is, Presidential is correct that Defendants' demand for a jury trial cannot be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   While duress and fraud, which Defendants are now barred from raising due to res judicata,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section IV.A, are possible grounds upon which courts may invalidate contractual jury waivers, courts must take other factors, which would not have been properly raised in a challenge to the confessed judgment provision, into consideration as well. For example, examining the Forbearance Agreement, the Court notes that the jury waiver clause is printed in bolded text, and is placed next to one of the most important clauses in the contract, the confessed judgment clause, which itself is printed in bold with all capital letters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Forbearance Agreement at 9. Additionally, the jury waiver states in plain, easily understandable language that by signing the Forbearance Agreement, Defendants would be waiving their right to a trial by jury in any litigation arising out of the Forbearance Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Even if Defendants were not represented by an attorney at the time-although the Forbearance Agreement itself indicates that they were supposed to be,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-Defendants have provided no explanation as to why this jury waiver, when compared to the dozen other jury waivers they signed, was any more incomprehensible to Mr. Green than the others, or why, given Mr. Green's long history of signing away his right to a jury trial should a dispute regarding his loans from Presidential arise, this jury waiver agreement should be considered any less knowing or voluntary. Because Presidential has demonstrated, by virtue of its successful res judicata argument and by highlighting of Defendants' long history of waiving their right to a jury trial, that the jury waiver provision in the Forbearance Agreement was entered into knowingly and voluntarily, Presidential's Motion to Strike Defendants' Jury Demand is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's Renewed Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 48) and Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Jury Demand (ECF No. 47) are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .

Indeed, Defendants' eleventh affirmative defense, contract of adhesion, was asserted on the grounds that \"Presidential gave borrowers a standard form, take-it-or-leave[-it] forbearance and lockbox contract of adhesion, where the terms and conditions of the contracts were set by Presidential, and borrowers had little or no ability to negotiate more favorable terms.\" Answer at 8. These allegations imply that the entire contract was procured through one process, and no one clause was treated differently than any other.
