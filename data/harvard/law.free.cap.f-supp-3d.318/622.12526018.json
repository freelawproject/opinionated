No. 67), NYU Hospitals Center (\"NYU\") brings claims for (1) unlawful agreement in restraint of trade, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 1, against all defendants (Count I); (2) violation of Section 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act (the \"LMRA\"), 29 U.S.C. Section 187, against the 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East (the \"Union\") (Count II); and (3) restitution for excessive fund contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. Section 1001 et seq., against the 1199SEIU National Benefit Fund for Health and Human Service Employees (the \"Fund\") (Count III). Defendants the League of Voluntary Hospitals and Homes of New York (the \"League\"), the Fund, the Union, and the Mount Sinai Hospital, Montefiore Health System, Inc., the New York and Presbyterian Hospital, and Long Island Jewish Medical Center (collectively, the \"Hospital Defendants,\" and together with the League, the Fund, and the Union, \"Defendants\"), filed motions to dismiss. For the reasons discussed below, the motions are granted as to Count I of the Amended Complaint, and denied as to Counts II and III of the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In its Amended Complaint, NYU alleges that it was, for many years, a member of the League, which negotiated collective bargaining agreements on behalf of NYU and its competitors with the Union, which in turn represents healthcare workers in the metropolitan area. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 2.) NYU voluntarily withdrew from the League on March 28, 2016, but agreed to continue to abide by the collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") then in effect-a 2009 CBA that was modified by a memorandum of agreement (\"MOA\") in July 2014, and later by a letter agreement in October 2014-until it terminates on September 30, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 26, 38.) Following the adoption of the MOA, the Fund, the Union, and the League requested that the actuarial firm of Milliman, Inc. (\"Milliman\") propose contribution rate methodologies for League member hospitals. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) In addition to proposing such a methodology, the final actuarial report (the \"Milliman Report\") also proposed a contribution rate for non-League employers that would go into effect the first full month after an employer withdraws from the League. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35, 37.) NYU argues that the higher, \"non-League\" contribution rates it has been paying since October 2016 constitute a penalty that is the result of anticompetitive concerted action by the League, the Fund, the Union, and the Hospital Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In its second claim for relief, NYU asserts that the Union's imposition of the higher, non-League contribution rates on NYU violated Section 303 of the LMRA, 29 U.S.C. Section 187, which makes it unlawful for a labor organization to threaten, coerce, or restrain any person where an objective thereof is to force or require any employer to join an employer organization in violation of Section 8 (b) (4) (ii) (A) of the National Labor Relations Act (\"NLRA\"), 29 U.S.C. Section 158 (b) (4) (ii) (A). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75, 77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   NYU's third cause of action is for restitution of excessive fund contributions against the Fund. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 83-89.) In particular, NYU alleges that the Fund's denial of NYU's request to reject the Union's instruction to impose the higher, non-League contribution rates on NYU after its withdrawal from the League constituted a \"mistake of law and/or fact\" which caused harm redressable under ERISA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    DEFENDANTS' PRE-MOTION LETTERS TO DISMISS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By letters dated August 23, 2017, Defendants notified the Court of their intention to move to dismiss the complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 38-41.) These letters respond to the original complaint, first filed on June 14, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \"Complaint,\" Dkt. No. 1), and superseded by the Amended Complaint filed on December 19, 2017. As outlined in more detail below, some of the arguments pressed by Defendants overlap while some are unique to each defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its August 23, 2017 letter, the League first moves to dismiss NYU's Sherman Act claim on the basis that the non-statutory labor exemption to the antitrust laws bars any such challenge. In particular, the League argues that the conduct at issue falls within the exemption from antitrust scrutiny for collective bargaining agreements between a multiemployer bargaining unit and a union where the agreement is so \"intimately related\" to wages, hours, and working conditions that the union's successful attempt to obtain the agreement through bona fide, arm's length bargaining in pursuit of its own labor union policies, and not at the behest of or in combination with non-labor groups, falls within the protection of the national labor policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 39 at 2-3.) Indeed, the League argues that NYU concedes that it is bound by the 2009 CBA, as amended in 2014, and that the CBA itself required the Fund, working with actuaries, to develop a contribution rate methodology to be implemented if approved by the Fund's trustees. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to the League, these rates were in fact developed by the actuaries, approved by the trustees, and subsequently ratified by the Union and the League. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Thus, the League argues, NYU's lawsuit merely challenges the Fund's implementation of CBA terms, and so falls squarely within the non-statutory labor exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Second, the League asserts that NYU fails to state a plausible antitrust claim because: (1) there is no allegation that the League or its member hospitals participated in an antitrust conspiracy-merely that the Hospital Defendants \"encouraged and acquiesced\" in conduct by the Union and the Fund, and that a League executive was \"aware of and copied on\" correspondence between the Union and the Fund; (2) the conduct complained of was expressly contemplated by the CBA between the parties; and (3) NYU has not adequately alleged antitrust standing because there is no allegation that the asserted conduct injured competition in the allegedly restrained market. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In their August 23, 2017 letter, the Hospital Defendants move to dismiss the Complaint on the bases that (1) this dispute falls squarely within the non-statutory labor\n   exemption; (2) the Complaint does not adequately allege any unlawful agreement involving the Hospital Defendants because there is no allegation that the Hospital Defendants had a role in the decision made by the Fund concerning NYU's contributions after it exited the League; (3) the Complaint does not adequately allege harm to competition because NYU has failed to plead conduct that is \"per se\" unlawful and NYU does not adequately plead a \"rule of reason\" claim; and (4) the Complaint does not plausibly allege antitrust injury because NYU's alleged injuries did not result from any restraint on competition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 38 at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In its August 23, 2017 letter, the Fund moves to dismiss the Complaint on two grounds. First, the Fund argues that NYU fails to state a claim against the Fund for unlawful agreement in restraint of trade because (1) NYU's allegations are merely conclusory, and (2) as an employee benefit fund affiliated with a union, which can use its assets only for the benefit of employees, the Fund is exempt from the antitrust laws. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 40 at 1-2.) Second, the Fund argues that NYU's claim for restitution of excessive fund contributions is not yet ripe because it depends on a contingent future event that may not happen-namely, that the trustees of the Fund would decide not to reimburse NYU if they were presented with a determination that the contributions were made by a mistake of law or fact. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its August 23, 2017 letter, the Union first moves to dismiss the Complaint on the ground that NYU has failed to plausibly allege an antitrust conspiracy. In particular, the Union argues that the only allegedly conspiratorial conduct by the Union was a letter sent to the Fund, instructing it to recalculate NYU's contribution rate using the non-League methodology proposed by the Fund's actuaries, and that the Union's alleged encouragement of and acquiescence in the Fund's determination does not amount to an antitrust conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 41 at 2-3.) Second, the Union argues that its conduct is protected by the non-statutory labor exemption. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) Relatedly, the Union asserts that the question of whether NYU's purported withdrawal from the League was lawful under federal labor law is currently pending before the National Labor Relations Board (\"NLRB\"), and that resolution of that question could moot the relief requested by NYU here. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 n.1.) Third, the Union argues that NYU has failed to adequately plead that the alleged conduct harms competition. In particular, the Union argues that competition can be harmed only if total, market-wide investments decrease materially, and while NYU pleads in general terms that competition has been harmed because NYU has $25 million less to invest in new facilities, technology, and services, NYU fails to plead allegations suggesting that total investments in healthcare improvements in the market will decrease materially, or at all. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    NYU'S OPPOSITION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   By letters dated September 22, 2017, NYU submitted the proposed Amended Complaint and responded to Defendants' motion to dismiss arguments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In response to the Union, NYU argues that (1) it has properly alleged an unlawful agreement (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3); (2) the Union's conduct is not protected by the non-statutory labor exemption\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3); and (3) NYU has properly alleged harm to competition because it has alleged a per se violation of the antitrust laws (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   NYU also asserts that the Amended Complaint adequately pleads competitive harm. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In response to the Hospital Defendants, NYU first argues that it has properly alleged an unlawful agreement, and that the Hospital Defendants are liable for the League's actions because they authorized the League to act as their agent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.) Second, NYU argues that it has properly alleged harm to competition and antitrust injury because it has alleged a per se violation of the antitrust laws. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In response to the League, NYU argues that the Defendants' conduct is not covered by the non-statutory labor exemption. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-40.) First, NYU argues that the challenged conduct is not \"intimately related\" to wages, hours, and working conditions, nor is it within the scope of traditionally mandatory subjects of collective bargaining; according to NYU, the withdrawal provision \"serves no purpose other than to coerce hospital members to remain in the League and to punish those that withdraw.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.) Second, NYU argues that the withdrawal provision serves as a \"direct restraint on a business market\" by severely impacting NYU's ability to compete in the market for hospital services, by limiting the ability of other League members to withdraw, and by restricting NYU's ability to pursue investments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In response to the Fund, NYU argues that (1) it has stated an antitrust claim against the Fund because the non-statutory labor exemption does not apply to conspiracies between labor groups and non-labor groups (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 47); (2) NYU's restitution claim properly alleges mistakes of fact and law by the Fund in that the withdrawal provision was never incorporated into the CBA between the parties and thus NYU should never have been treated as \"[n]on-League\" for purposes of the CBA now in force (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 48-49); and (3) NYU's ERISA claim is ripe for review because NYU has adequately pled that the Fund considered and rejected its request for restitution. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    DEFENDANTS' REPLIES\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   By letter dated September 29, 2017, the League replied to NYU, arguing that the December 2014 \"agreement\" among the Defendants that NYU challenges was a document describing the collectively bargained health care rate calculations to which the parties had already agreed in the July 2014 MOA as modified by a collectively bargained amendment in October 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64 at 1.) The League maintains that the challenged benefit rate terms are protected by the non-statutory labor exemption, and if NYU has a remedy, it is under labor not antitrust law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) Finally, the League asserts that, like its original Complaint, NYU's Amended Complaint (1) fails to allege that Defendants joined an unlawful agreement, and (2) fails to allege facts sufficient to establish antitrust standing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   By letter dated October 1, 2017, the Union responded to NYU. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 51.) First, the Union argues that the Amended Complaint, like NYU's original Complaint, fails to allege a conspiracy. In particular, the Union argues that there is no reason why the Fund would seek agreement from the League for a rule relating to the contributions due from any institution leaving or joining the League during the term of the MOA when the Fund was in fact authorized by the MOA to develop and implement such a methodology. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Moreover, the Union argues, the Amended Complaint is internally inconsistent in that, for example, the change in NYU's contribution rate cannot both be in reaction to NYU's withdrawal from the League and the result of an alleged agreement\n   reached over a year before NYU's withdrawal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) Furthermore, the Union maintains that its conduct is protected by the non-statutory labor exemption. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Second, the Union argues that NYU fails to adequately allege harm to competition in the market at large. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, the Union contends, NYU's claim, new in its Amended Complaint, against the Union under Section 303 of the LMRA fails because NYU's \"displeasure\" with the application of the Fund's rules regarding contribution rates does not amount to \"coercion\" or \"restraint.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   By letter dated October 2, 2017, the Hospital Defendants responded to NYU. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 63.) First, the Hospital Defendants argue that NYU's Amended Complaint fails to plead that the Hospital Defendants entered into an unlawful agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) In particular, the Hospital Defendants maintain that neither their receipt of emails concerning the calculation of Fund contribution rates nor their alleged acquiescence in the Fund's decision to alter NYU's contribution rate is sufficient to establish unlawful agreement in violation of the Sherman Act. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) Second, the Hospital Defendants argue that they cannot be held liable under an agency theory for the Fund's conduct because the Fund was authorized to act as agent only for the purpose of entering into a collective bargaining agreement, and thus any separate agreement outside the scope of the CBA between the parties would exceed the League's authority. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Third, the Hospital Defendants assert that any agreement between the Union and the League (or the Hospital Defendants) is protected by the non-statutory labor exemption. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, the Hospital Defendants argue that the Amended Complaint does not adequately allege harm to competition or antitrust injury. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   By letter dated October 11, 2017, the Fund responded to NYU. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 62.) First, the Fund argues that NYU fails to state an antitrust claim against it because NYU's obligation to contribute to the Fund resulted from collective bargaining-to which NYU was a party-and not from any alleged conspiracy in restraint of trade. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-3.) Indeed, the Fund argues, NYU was made aware of the Milliman Report's contribution methodology for employers changing from League to non-League status as early as December 2014 and it did not then bring any challenge in labor arbitration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) Second, the Fund argues that NYU has still failed to show that its claim for restitution is ripe. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) More specifically, the Fund asserts that under ERISA, the Fund's trustees have a fiduciary duty to collect and hold NYU's contributions, and there is no basis for them to conclude that any have been made pursuant to a mistake of law or fact unless and until NYU prevails in this litigation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    TELEPHONE CONFERENCE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court held a telephone conference on December 11, 2017 during which it heard arguments from the parties and advised the parties that the Amended Complaint does not appear to state an antitrust claim sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Minute entry for 12/11/2017.) The Court permitted the Fund and the Union to make a joint submission on the LMRA and ERISA claims raised in Counts II and III of the Amended Complaint, and permitted NYU to respond to that submission. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEFING ON ERISA AND LMRA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   By letter dated December 15, 2017 (the \"December 15 Letter\"), the Fund and the Union opposed NYU's ERISA and LMRA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 65.) With respect to the ERISA claim, the Fund argues that Section 403 (c) (2) permits, but does not require, an ERISA plan's trustees to reimburse employer contributions when those contributions are made by reason of a mistake of law or fact. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) The Fund contends that NYU has not sufficiently alleged a mistake of law or fact because it is clear from the Amended Complaint that NYU's contributions at the non-League rates were not a mistake, but rather were \"intentional and in accordance with the CBA.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   With respect to the LMRA claim, the Union argues that Section 8 (b) (4) of the NLRA applies only to coercion or restraint directed at a \"neutral/secondary employer (an employer with whom a union does not have a labor dispute) in order to coerce the neutral employer to pressure the primary employer ... to resolve the primary labor dispute.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Because the Amended Complaint does not allege that the Union is pressuring a secondary employer, the Union argues that there is no basis for a Section 303 claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Union also argues that even if there were a basis for a Section 303 claim, there is no \"coercion\" or \"restraint\": NYU's payment of the non-League contribution rate is merely the application of the required contribution rate under the CBA to which NYU does not dispute that it is a party. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   By letter dated January 2, 2018 (the \"January 2 Letter\"), NYU responded to the Fund and the Union's submission on the ERISA and LMRA claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 69.) First, NYU reargues that its Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges violations of federal antitrust law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-6.) NYU largely reiterates its arguments from its September 22, 2017 submission (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Section 1, against all Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 56-72.) NYU asserts that it voluntarily withdrew from the League on March 28, 2016, but agreed to continue to abide by the CBA then in effect (a 2009 CBA that was modified twice in 2014) until it terminates on September 30, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) NYU concedes that it agreed to the July 21, 2014 MOA modifying the CBA, and to the October 24, 2014 letter agreement (the \"2014 Letter Agreement\") between the League and the Union that modified the MOA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   January 2 Letter at 4.) NYU also asserts that Section 6, Paragraph C of the MOA states that the \"Fund administration, together with the actuaries, shall develop a practicable contribution methodology, subject to the approval of the Trustees that effectuates\" the two schedules listed in the MOA that contained required contribution rates and caps for both League hospitals and League nursing homes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   But NYU asserts that the exercise of \"incorporating\" the Milliman Report into the CBA and then imposing the non-League contribution rate on NYU did not comply with the applicable collective bargaining process and was therefore inappropriate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   January 2 Letter at 4.) In particular, NYU alleges that while it signed the 2014 Letter Agreement, there was no mention in the 2014 Letter Agreement of incorporating the Milliman Report in its entirety into the CBA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) Nonetheless, NYU asserts, the Union and the League created a new version of the CBA that purported to incorporate the entire Milliman Report-a version that was allegedly neither shared with NYU nor ratified in accordance with the League's rules. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As outlined in more detail above, the League disputes the sufficiency of NYU's antitrust allegations on the basis that Fund contribution rates are a mandatory subject of collective bargaining, and therefore exempt from antitrust scrutiny under the non-statutory labor exemption. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 39 &amp; 64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Union urges dismissal of the Amended Complaint because the Union's encouragement of and acquiescence in the Fund's determination to change NYU's contribution rate does not amount to an antitrust conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 41 &amp; 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Likewise, the Fund argues that NYU fails to state an antitrust claim because NYU's obligation to contribute to the Fund resulted from collective bargaining-to which NYU was a party-and not from any alleged conspiracy in restraint of trade. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 40 &amp; 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Hospital Defendants argue that the Amended Complaint does not adequately allege any unlawful agreement involving the Hospital Defendants because there is no allegation that they had a role in the decision made by the Fund to adjust NYU's contributions after it exited the League. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 38 &amp; 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Antitrust Allegations Against the Hospital Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As a threshold matter, NYU's antitrust claim against the Hospital Defendants is dismissed because the claim is not supported by specific factual averments of participation in the alleged conspiracy. As the Hospital Defendants note, NYU fails to plead non-conclusory allegations sufficient to state a claim to antitrust relief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 38 at 3.) The Amended Complaint says nothing about who at the Hospital Defendants participated in the alleged agreement. Moreover, there is no allegation that the Hospital Defendants had a role in the decision made by the Fund to change NYU's contribution rate after NYU withdrew from the League. Indeed, there is no allegation as to why the Hospital Defendants' assent would even be necessary for the Union and the Fund to alter NYU's contribution rate. The decision to move NYU to the non-League contribution rate was clearly made without NYU's consent, and there is no allegation as to why the other employer hospitals were at that time differently situated to affect NYU's contribution rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The only allegations specifically tying the Hospital Defendants to the alleged conspiracy are that they received two separate communications from the Fund in December 2014 which made reference to the Milliman Report's proposal to adjust the contribution rate for League employers who moved to non-League status, and that the Hospital Defendants did not then raise any objection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39-40.) On the basis of these facts, NYU alleges in general terms that all Defendants \"reached a meeting of the minds at around that time that penalty payments should be imposed on withdrawing Hospital League members, although this was never made a formal part of the collective bargaining agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   's plausibility standard, however, requires more than a \"sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. at 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).
