The instant case implicates these fundamental principles, for it relates to the power of the Judiciary to hear cases and controversies that pertain to federal labor-management relations; the power of the President to issue executive orders that regulate the conduct of federal employees in regard to collective bargaining; and the extent to which Congress has made policy choices about federal collective bargaining rights that supersede any presidential pronouncements or priorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On May 25, 2018, President Donald J. Trump issued three executive orders relating to the administration of the federal civil service and the rights of federal employees to engage in collective bargaining.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exec.

Reg. 25343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (May 25, 2018) (collectively, \"the Orders\"). Among other things, these Orders seek to regulate both the collective bargaining negotiations that federal agencies enter into with public-sector unions and the matters that these parties negotiate. The Orders place limits on the activities that federal employees may engage in when acting as labor representatives; guide agencies toward particular negotiating positions during the collective bargaining process; and address the approaches agencies shall follow when disciplining or evaluating employees working within the civil service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Between May 30, 2018, and June 18, 2018, numerous federal employee unions (\"the Unions\" or \"Plaintiffs\") filed the instant consolidated cases against President Trump, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (\"OPM\"), and the Director of OPM (collectively, \"Defendants\"), challenging the validity of the President's executive orders in various respects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Unions contend that the Orders conflict with the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (\"the FSLMRS\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207101\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 7135 -and therefore constitute\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   and unconstitutional actions on the part of the President-and also that the Orders impinge upon the constitutional rights of federal employees. Several union plaintiffs initially insisted that the Orders amounted to such an egregious violation of presidential power, and worked such an immediate harm to the collective bargaining rights of federal employees, that a preliminary injunction was warranted. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl. AFGE's Mot. for a Prelim. Injunction, ECF No. 10.) However, the parties subsequently agreed to proceed straight to the merits of the Unions' challenges by having this Court resolve the instant dispute on cross-motions for summary judgment, handled in an expedited\n   fashion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order, ECF No. 16, at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Before this Court at present are Plaintiffs' and Defendants' ripe cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court held a lengthy hearing on these motions on July 25, 2018, and since then, it has worked diligently to sort out, and resolve, the myriad complicated and contentious issues that the parties' arguments raise. For example, each of the four motions for summary judgment that the Unions have filed assails various provisions in the Orders (a total of twenty provisions are targeted), and each motion makes different claims regarding the validity of the challenged provisions. By and large, this Court has treated the Unions' four motions as one. Generally speaking, the Unions collectively contend that: (1) the President has no statutory or constitutional authority to issue executive orders pertaining to the field of federal labor relations; (2) the challenged provisions conflict with particular sections of the FSLMRS in a manner that abrogates the Unions' statutory right to bargain collectively; and (3) certain provisions of the Orders transgress Article II's Take Care Clause, and also, in one instance, the First Amendment's right to freedom of association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For its part, the summary judgment motion that has been filed on behalf of Defendants raises two threshold issues: that this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the instant dispute due to the channeling effect of the FSLMRS's administrative review scheme, and that some of the Unions' claims are insufficiently concrete to be prudentially ripe for judicial decision. On the merits, Defendants' summary judgment motion maintains that the President has ample statutory and constitutional authority to issue executive orders in the field of federal labor relations, and that the Orders do not, in fact, conflict with the FSLMRS's complicated statutory regime, either because the challenged provisions only constitute \"guidance\" to federal agencies or because a section of the FSLMRS specifically authorizes the President to reduce the scope of collective bargaining through the issuance of \"government-wide rules or regulations.\" Defendants further assert that the Take Care Clause claim is nonjusticiable, and that the First Amendment freedom-of-association claim is baseless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   For the reasons explained at length below, this Court has decided that the Unions have the better of this argument. With respect to Defendants' threshold concerns, the Court concludes that it has subject-matter\n   jurisdiction over the instant claims because, even though most disputes concerning federal labor-management relations must be channeled through the administrative review scheme that Congress has prescribed, this matter is different in kind than the disputes that Congress intended the FSLMRS's channeling provisions to cover. The Court further finds that the Unions' legal claims are generally fit for judicial resolution, and therefore, the prudential ripeness doctrine poses no bar to this Court's consideration of these challenges now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As to the merits of the Unions' contentions, while past precedents and pertinent statutory language indicate that the President has the authority to issue executive orders that carry the force of law with respect to federal labor relations, it is undisputed that no such orders can operate to eviscerate the right to bargain collectively as envisioned in the FSLMRS. In this Court's view, the challenged provisions of the executive orders at issue have that cumulative effect. Stated succinctly, by enacting the FSLMRS, Congress undertook to guarantee federal employees the statutory right to engage in good-faith collective bargaining with agencies and executive branch officials, and the pronouncements that the FSLMRS makes are clearly based upon Congress's stated opinion that \"the right of employees\" to \"bargain collectively ... safeguards the public interest, contributes to the effective conduct of public business, and facilitates and encourages the amicable settlements of disputes\" in regard to the \"conditions of [federal] employment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207101\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Viewed collectively, the challenged executive orders\n   <em>\n    reflect a decidedly different policy choice\n   </em>\n   ; namely, the President's stated view that federal employees' right to engage in collective bargaining over the conditions of their employment is not apropos of an \"effective and efficient Government[,]\" Exec. Order No. 13,836 \u00a7 1(b), and should be rendered subordinate to the agencies' interest \"in developing efficient, effective, and cost-reducing collective bargaining agreements[,]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (preamble);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Exec. Order No. 13,837 (preamble); Exec. Order No. 13,839 (preamble).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Certain provisions of the Orders plainly further the President's intention to restrict the scope and effectiveness of federal employees' right to collective bargaining vis-\u00e0-vis the agencies (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , those directives that stunt negotiations by narrowing the terms that the agency can entertain related to significant matters, such as access to government office space for union business and the amount of official time that can be allotted to negotiations and counseling),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Exec. Order No. 13,836 \u00a7 5(e), 6; Exec. Order No. 13,837 \u00a7\u00a7 4(a), 4(b); Exec. Order No. 13,839 \u00a7\u00a7 4(a), 4(c), or clearly constrain agency negotiators' ability to conduct collective bargaining negotiations in good faith (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , those mandates that direct agency representatives to pursue specific positions \"whenever possible,\" such as limiting the annual aggregate official time awarded amount to one hour per employed union member per year),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Exec. Order No. 13,836 \u00a7\u00a7 5(a), 5(e); Exec. Order No. 13,837 \u00a7\u00a7 3(a); Exec. Order No. 13,839 \u00a7\u00a7 3. Therefore, this Court finds that these provisions conflict with congressional intent in a manner that cannot be sustained. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part IV.D,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .) What remains of the Orders are those provisions that the Unions have not opted to challenge, and the few challenged provisions described in Part IV.E.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exec. Order No. 13,836 \u00a7 5(c); Exec. Order No. 13,837 \u00a7\u00a7 2(j), 4(c); Exec. Order No. 13, 839 \u00a7\u00a7 2(b), 2(c), 4(b)(iii), 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   This all means that, ultimately, both sides' motions for summary judgment must be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   , and this Court will enjoin\n   the President's subordinates within the Executive Branch to disregard: sections 5(a), 5(e), and 6 of Executive Order 13,836 ; sections 3(a), 4(a), and 4(b) of Executive Order 13,837 ; and sections 3, 4(a), and 4(c) of Executive Order 13,839. In this Court's view, these directives undermine federal employees' right to bargain collectively as protected by the FSLMRS, and as a result, the President must be deemed to have exceeded his authority in issuing them.

Thus, when assessing whether the President has acted beyond the bounds of his legal authority, a court may at times have to consider both the authority that congressional statutes have conferred upon him and the inherent authority that the Constitution assigns to the President.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dames &amp; Moore v.

The inquiries that are required to determine the extent of the President's statutory and constitutional authority differ substantially, but it is worth noting that a court need not assess the scope of the President's constitutional authority to take a particular action unless the President has specifically asserted that authority in the context of the given dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

It must take these three steps because there are two independent ways that the President may exceed the scope of his statutory authority in issuing these orders.

The lengthy analysis below begins with the threshold issues concerning this Court's subject-matter jurisdiction and the ripeness of the Unions' claims, and the Court concludes that the claims at issue here are not the types of claims that Congress intended to be funneled to the FLRA through the FSLMRS's administrative review scheme, nor are they unfit for judicial review at this time.

Order No. 13,839 \u00a7 4(a), dramatically\n   decrease the scope of the right to bargain collectively, because, in the FSLMRS, Congress clearly intended for agencies and unions to engage in a broad and meaningful negotiation over nearly every \"condition of employment.\" Likewise, certain of the Orders' requirements, such as the directive that agencies should \"ordinarily\" seek to conclude collective bargaining negotiations within five to seven months, Exec. Order No. 13,836 \u00a7 5(a), and should limit the applicability of grievance procedures \"[w]henever reasonable[,]\" Exec. Order No. 13,839 \u00a7 3, effectively instruct federal agencies and executive departments to approach collective bargaining in a manner that clearly runs counter to the FSLMRS's expectation of good-faith conduct on the part of negotiating parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In this Court's considered judgment, the President is without statutory authority to promulgate directives that reduce the scope of the statutory right to bargain collectively that Congress enacted in the FSLMRS; and, indeed, there appears to be no dispute that the President does not have the constitutional authority to override Congress's policy choices (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Second, the challenge to the regulations at issue in\n   <em>\n    National Mining\n   </em>\n   \"require[d] analysis of 'all of the regulations together as well as the entire rulemaking process' \" and \"such an analysis 'would not be feasible in individual adjudications dealing with particular regulatory provisions.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699976,9417966\" index=\"364\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/292/849/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699976,9417966\" index=\"364\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/292/849/\">\n    at 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Mining\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699976,9417966\" index=\"365\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/292/849/\">\n    292 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   858-59 ).

But counsel held fast to the assertion that certain claims that the Unions have made should be deemed prudentially unripe: (1) those claims that challenge the President's announcement of a new collective bargaining policy if the executive order provision contains a directive to OPM to issue regulations about the matter (Defs.' Mem. at 39-40; Hr'g Tr. at 28:6-18)-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , section 4 of the Official Time Order, which both prohibits the use of official time for a variety of matters, and requires OPM to identify and change regulations that are inconsistent with this mandate,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Exec. Order No. 13,837 \u00a7 4-and (2) those claims that challenge provisions within the Orders that purport to set \"aspirational objectives\" and thus \"leave room for negotiation\" (Defs' Mem. at 41), such as section 5(a) of the Collective Bargaining Procedures Order, which states that \"ordinarily\" \"a negotiation period of 6 weeks or less to achieve ground rules, and a negotiating period of between 4 and 6 months for a [collective bargaining agreement]\" should suffice, Exec. Order No. 13,836 \u00a7 5(a). Defendants argue that this Court should defer its consideration of Plaintiffs' challenges to these kinds of provisions in the Orders, either because further clarification by OPM and other agency heads will permit helpful administrative determinations regarding \"the interplay of the Orders with 'applicable law' \" (Defs.' Mem. at 40), or because the Order provisions that merely \"set goals for the outcome of agencies' negotiations and advise agencies on policy considerations while bargaining with individual unions\" are too fact-bound to be fit for judicial review (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 41). As demonstrated below, Defendants' ripeness contentions misconstrue either the nature of the President's orders, or the claims that the Unions are making about those orders-or both-and thus are not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Take the first category first: with respect to the Unions' purportedly unripe challenges to those executive order provisions that authorize further 'clarification' by OPM and the like,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Exec. Order No. 13,837 \u00a7 4(c) (ordering rulemaking to \"clarify and assist agencies in implementing these rules\"), it is clear to this Court that any future clarification by OPM or other agencies will be of limited scope, because the anticipated future regulations will necessarily pertain to the clear and concrete policy change that the President has made regarding how federal agencies or federal employees must act going forward with respect to collective bargaining negotiations, and this Court has no doubt that the President's orders will be received as such, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AFGE's Reply at 20-21; NFFE's Reply at 13; NTEU's Reply at 16 -17.) In other words, as far as subsequent 'clarifications' are concerned, there is really not much left to be done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   For example, section 4 of Executive Order No. 13,837 announces that \"[e]mployees may not engage in lobbying activities during paid time, except in their official capacities as an employee.\" Exec. Order No. 13,837 \u00a7 4(a)(i). Similarly, section 4 of Executive Order No. 13,839 states that agencies shall not \"subject to grievance procedures or binding arbitration disputes concerning (i) the assignment o f ratings of record; or (ii) the award of any form of incentive pay[.]\" Exec. Order No. 13,839 \u00a7 4(a);\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Exec. Order No. 13,837 \u00a7\u00a7 4(a)(ii)-(v), 4(b); Exec. Order No. 13,839 \u00a7\u00a7 2(b), 2(c), 4(b)(iii). Agencies are presently interpreting and actively implementing these challenged prescriptions, and others (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pls.' Stmt. of Material Facts as to Which There Is No Genuine Dispute (\"NFFE's Stmt. of Facts\"), ECF No. 26-1, \u00b6\u00b6 39, 51, 66, 73-74; Pl.

J., ECF No. 30-4, \u00b6\u00b6 13-15), presumably without confusion about what the President has ordered them to do. The fact that OPM might eventually provide additional practical guidance about how agencies can best implement these unequivocal mandates poses no impediment to this Court's consideration of the Unions' current contention that the President's new policies are contrary to the labor rights that the FSLMRS guarantees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Home Ass'n of Home Builders v.

Section 5(a) of the Collective Bargaining Procedures Order, section 3(a) of the Official Time Order, and section 3 of the Removal Procedures Order prescribe goals that agencies should \"ordinarily\" negotiate toward, Exec. Order No. 13,836 \u00a7 5(a); Exec. Order No. 13,837 \u00a7 3(a), and/or steps that an agency should take as part of labor negotiations \"[w]henever reasonable[,]\" Exec. Order No. 13,839 \u00a7 3. Given the literal language of these Order provisions, there is no question that agencies retain a measure of discretion that will necessarily result in \"a factual outcome\" that is \"sure to vary by agency and bargaining unit[.]\" (Defs.' Mem. at 41.) But the question of whether these Order provisions themselves are\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   does not turn on these variable outcomes; rather, the Unions have suggested, among other things, that the President cannot prescribe these types of aspirational goals because, in doing so, he has constrained agency officials' bargaining discretion in a manner that violates the statute. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , NTEU's Mem. at 24 (\"Section 3 does not allow for any\n   <em>\n    real bargaining\n   </em>\n   on amounts of official time[.]\" (emphasis added) ); AFSCME's Reply at 18 (\"[T]he clear effect of Section 5(a) is to set an unreasonable baseline by decree rather than to approach negotiations in good faith and with an open mind[.]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Properly understood, then, the Unions' 'conflict' contentions are not necessarily about the reasonableness of the particular\n   presumptive period of negotiation that appears in Executive Order 13,836 (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   4 months, versus 6 months, versus some longer period), or whether allowing only one hour of 'official time' per bargaining-unit member, as Executive Order 13,837 suggests, is in the public interest; with those kinds of claims, perhaps a wait-and-see approach might be warranted. Instead, a consistent theme within the Unions' consolidated complaints is that it transgresses the statutorily-prescribed duty of good faith in the context of collective bargaining for the President to prescribe\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   presumptive timeframes or\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   procedural steps for the agency to shoot for as it bargains. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NTEU's Compl. \u00b6 106 (\"Section 3 would cause agencies to seek to impose a formulaic annual aggregate on official time ... [and] would preclude the type of good faith negotiations on official time that Congress's scheme requires[.]\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AFSCME's Compl. \u00b6 55.) And the issue that such a contention raises-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether and to what extent the FSLMRS requires federal agencies to enter into collective bargaining negotiations with an open mind about various aspects of bargaining (including the scope and length of the negotiations) and without pre-established constraints related to terms that Congress has identified as up for discussion-is a\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   one that needs no further factual development.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Treasury Emps.

The President Has The Statutory And Constitutional Authority To Issue Executive Orders That Pertain To Federal Labor-Management Relations, So Long As His Orders Do Not Conflict With The Will Of Congress\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   With Defendants' threshold arguments out of the way, the merits of the Unions' claims take center stage. As has repeatedly been mentioned, the Unions have made a variety of claims in the four consolidated actions that are now before this Court; for the purpose of this Memorandum Opinion, the Court first addresses the Unions' assertion that the President of the United States cannot issue executive orders that carry the force of law in the field of federal labor-management relations, because he lacks the statutory and/or constitutional authority to do so. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NFFE's Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 82-95; AFSCME's Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 102-03.) As explained below, this Court finds that binding precedent and the history of presidential action in this arena compels the conclusion that both section 7301 of Title 5 of the United States Code and the President's inherent constitutional power as head of the Executive Branch authorizes him to act in the field of federal labor-management relations (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part IV.C.1,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ), and furthermore, the Unions have largely overstated the extent to which Congress sought to divest the President of any such authority with its enactment of the FSLMRS/CSRA (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part IV.C.2,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ). But there is no serious dispute that any orders a President issues in this area must be consistent with the will of Congress (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part IV.C.3,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ), and ultimately,\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   is the principle that\n   guides this Court's conclusions regarding the merits of the Unions' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Before The Enactment Of The FSLMRS And CSRA, Presidents Had The Authority To Issue Executive Orders Regulating Federal Labor-Management Relations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   As this Court mentioned at the outset, both President Kennedy and President Nixon utilized executive orders to regulate federal labor-management relations in a manner that afforded significant protections to federal workers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part II.A,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .)\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Exec. Order No. 11,491 ; Exec. Order No. 10,988. With their\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   arguments, NFFE and AFSCME have strongly suggested that there has never been statutory authority for presidents to issue any such orders with respect to federal labor relations. (NFFE's Reply at 21-23; AFSCME's Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 102-03.) For their part, Defendants maintain that \"the Supreme Court has held that the President is authorized by both Article II of the Constitution and congressional statute to issue executive orders regulating labor relations in the federal government [.]\" (Defs.' Reply at 29.) This dispute is material to the Unions' overall attack on the source of the President's authority to act in this arena, and, as defense counsel suggests, this Court does not pen its analysis on an entirely blank slate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Old Dominion Branch No. 496, National Association of Letter Carriers v.

Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Old Dominion\n   </em>\n   Court had \"no difficulty\" in announcing the validity of an executive order that established an entire universe of federal labor-management relations, both in light of the statutory authority that Congress had conferred upon the President in section 7301, and also on the basis of the inherent constitutional authority that the President enjoys with respect to the management of the federal administrative workforce.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172714\" index=\"450\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/264/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   <em>\n    Old Dominion\n   </em>\n   can only be read to support the conclusion that the President of the United States possesses the authority to issue executive orders regarding federal labor-management relationships, at least in the pre-FSLMRS world.

For example, NFFE emphatically argues that while section 7301 gives the President express authority to \"prescribe regulations for the\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   of employees in the executive branch[,]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"477\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207301\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added), \"[u]nion official time is not a\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   issue\" (NFFE's Reply at 21 (emphasis added) ).

It is also manifestly logical to consider the express grant of statutory authority to the President to regulate employee \"conduct\" under section 7301 to include the power to speak to how an employee spends her time at work.\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   . Black's Law Dictionary 358 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"conduct\" as \"[p]ersonal behavior,\" \"the manner in which a person behaves[,]\" or \"collectively, a person's deeds\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The FSLMRS And CSRA Did Not Divest The President Of Any Authority In This Field\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Several of the union plaintiffs insist, in the alternative, that even if past presidents had the statutory and constitutional authority to issue executive orders regarding the federal labor-management relationship, Congress unquestionably intended to\n   <em>\n    foreclose\n   </em>\n   any such action in 1978, when it enacted the FSLMRS and CSRA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NFFE's Mem. at 28 (\"Congress wrested the power to regulate federal labor-management relations away from the Executive Branch with the passage of the [FSLMRS.]\"); NFFE's Reply at 20 (\"[T]he overall purpose of the Statute was to\n   <em>\n    divest\n   </em>\n   the President of authority to regulate federal sector labor relations through executive orders.\" (emphasis in original) ).) The first (and, frankly, most imposing) hurdle that the Unions have to face in sustaining this argument is the language of the FSLMRS itself. The codified provisions of that statute mention the President expressly in only three respects. First, in section 7103(b) of Title 5 of the United States Code, Congress provides \"[t]he President\" with the authority to \"issue an order excluding any agency or subdivision thereof from coverage under [the FSLMRS]\" for reasons pertaining to national security.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"482\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207103\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Second, the FSLMRS allows \"the President\" to appoint the members of the FLRA and its General Counsel, with the advice and consent of the Senate,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"483\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207103\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7104(b), (f)(1), as well as the members of the Federal Services Impasse Board, the other independent agency that the FSLMRS creates,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"484\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207103\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7119(c)(2). And, third, the\n   FSLMRS affirms that the \"[p]olicies, regulations, and procedures established under and decisions issued under\" prior executive orders \"shall remain in full force and effect until revised or revoked by the President, or unless superseded by specific provisions of [the FSLMRS] or by regulations or decisions issued pursuant to [the FSLMRS].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"485\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207103\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7135. The provisions of the FSLMRS do not mention the President at any other point-and, unfortunately for the Unions, that statute does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   say, as one might rightly expect it to, something to the effect of: 'the President is hereby precluded from issuing executive orders in this arena as he has done in the past.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   This omission is crucial. Congress clearly\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   that Presidents had previously dabbled in regulating federal labor relations by executive order,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"486\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207103\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; in fact, it appears that the Legislature entered this arena\n   <em>\n    precisely because\n   </em>\n   it wanted to codify the gains that federal workers had made by virtue of certain executive orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 95-1403 at 12 (1978) (\"The committee agrees that the time has come to establish\n   <em>\n    by statute\n   </em>\n   a labor-management relations system for Federal employees[.]\" (emphasis added) ); President Carter's Statement on Signing the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, 14 Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 1765 (Oct. 13, 1978) (explaining that Title VII of the CSRA \"move[d] Federal labor relations from Executive order to statute\"). The Unions read this history as firm support for the contention that Congress intended \"to\n   <em>\n    stop\n   </em>\n   regulation of employees by executive order.\" (NFFE's Reply at 22 (emphasis added).) But the statute does not say that. And given the widely-known sweeping exercise of presidential prerogative to regulate federal labor-management relations that preceded the FSLMRS, Congress' silence on the issue of the President's authority to\n   <em>\n    continue\n   </em>\n   to act in this arena speaks volumes about whether it actually intended to oust the President entirely from this sphere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   What is more, in their briefing and during the motions hearing, Defendants pointed to language in the original Public Law that appears so definitive that it can only be understood as closing the case with respect to this investigation into Congress's intent. At the tail end of the document that became the CSRA, Congress included the heading-\"POWERS OF PRESIDENT UNAFFECTED EXCEPT BY EXPRESS PROVISIONS\"-and then inserted the following statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   SEC. 904. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, no provision of this Act shall be construed to[:] (1) limit, curtail, abolish, or terminate any function of, or authority available to, the President which the President had immediately before the effective date of this Act; or (2) to limit, curtail, or terminate the President's authority to delegate, redelegate, or terminate any delegation of functions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95-454, \u00a7 904,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"487\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Stat.%201111\">\n    92 Stat. 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1224. If there exists more explicit language about the extent to which an Act of Congress should be viewed as leaving the power of the President intact, this Court has not seen it. The Unions themselves have provided no argument as to why this provision doesn't settle the issue, and none of the eight separate briefs that they have filed in this matter does anything to blunt the sheer force of this clear statement of Congress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   This is not to say that the Unions are entirely wrong to observe that Congress enacted a \"specific statute in 1978 comprehensively governing Federal sector labor relations\" (NFFE's Reply at 23), or to note that the FSLMRS \"reached every aspect\" of that relationship (AFGE's Mem. at 9).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 95-1403 at 38 (explaining that the FSLMRS represents\n   \"a new framework for the conduct of Federal labor-management relations\"). Where they veer off course is with the suggestion that Congress's enactment of the FSLMRS, standing alone, is sufficient to justify the inference that Congress intended to prevent future Presidents from taking any action in this area. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , NFFE's Reply at 20.)

In other words, because Congress has specifically determined the scope of the right to collective bargaining in the federal civil service, (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , what matters can, must, and need not be negotiated), as well as the required nature of any such negotiations (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a sincere attempt to reach agreement), in order to act consistently with that statute, agency management must not remove covered matters from the bargaining table indiscriminately, and must proceed to collective bargaining discussions ready to listen and consider what the workers are proposing, with an open mind and with every intention of coming to a mutually acceptable result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   In regard to what agencies can and cannot do,\n   <em>\n    National Treasury Employees Union v.

In that case, OPM and the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") attempted to implement a provision of the Homeland Security Act that authorized them to create the DHS human resources system, but the final regulations that DHS issued drastically reduced the matters that were subject to collective bargaining such that, in essence, only those \"that might be seen as personal employee grievances\" remained.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3454996,3329607\" index=\"551\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/839/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3454996,3329607\" index=\"551\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/839/\">\n    at 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And, the D.C.

First, it establishes that the linchpin of identifying agency conduct that impermissibly undermines the right to bargain is whether the agency's actions strike at the \"core element[s]\" of collective bargaining as defined by statute. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part IV.D.1(a), (b),\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .)\n   <em>\n    Chertoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3454996,3329607\" index=\"556\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/839/\">\n    452 F.3d at 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, with respect to the scope of bargaining under the FSLMRS, an agency's reduction of the matters that would otherwise be subject to negotiation between agencies and federal employees (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , taking matters off the table) can deprive the employees and their union representatives of the right to bargain collectively, and can thereby violate the statute.\n   <em>\n    Chertoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3454996,3329607\" index=\"557\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/839/\">\n    452 F.3d at 844, 861-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is, even without imposing limitations that specifically and directly conflict with individual statutory prescriptions, there can come a point at which an agency (or in this case the President) diminishes the scope of bargaining such that the only acceptable conclusion is that the agency's conduct violates the FSLMRS's requirement that the parties \"bargain in a good-faith effort to reach agreement with respect to the conditions of employment affecting such employees[,]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"558\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207103\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(12). Third, an attempt to limit the negotiability of the\n   areas of bargaining that the FSLMRS deems permissive (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , those over which the agency has discretion to bargain under section 7106(b)(1) ) is not merely an innocuous exercise of management prerogatives; rather, it eviscerates the statutory right of employees to have an opportunity to discuss certain matters, and also seemingly sheds light on the agency's motivations for slashing otherwise potentially negotiable topics, and as such, is cause for great concern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chertoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3454996,3329607\" index=\"559\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/839/\">\n    452 F.3d at 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (calling the fact that the agency had removed the \"permissive\" areas of bargaining from the scope of bargaining \"critical\" with respect to a determination of whether the scope of bargaining was impermissibly reduced).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Not surprisingly, Defendants read\n   <em>\n    Chertoff\n   </em>\n   differently. They argue, for example, that the hallmark of an impermissible reduction in the scope of bargaining under\n   <em>\n    Chertoff\n   </em>\n   is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   whether the agency has acted to remove from the collective bargaining table topics that Congress has specifically identified as negotiable, but whether what is\n   <em>\n    left\n   </em>\n   on the table is sufficient to constitute collective bargaining within the meaning of statute. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' Mem. at 73 (\"[T]he HR system struck down by the D.C.

But\n   <em>\n    Chertoff's\n   </em>\n   analysis does not demand this result. To be sure, in that case the D.C.

Indeed, one could argue that the executive order provisions that restrict and limit official time have an even bigger impact on the scope of bargaining that the FSLMRS protects. By prohibiting union members from using official time for lobbying efforts or for the pursuit of other employees' grievances, the Official Time Order has eliminated what the Unions say are two indisputably central activities of labor organizations: attempting to preserve and expand (through lobbying) the statutory protections for workers and the right to collective bargaining (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , NFFE's Stmt. of Facts \u00b6 58; Decl. of Kenneth Moffett, Jr., Ex. 1 to Pl.

Under these challenged provisions of the Official Time Order, however, the Unions' right to bargain for the official time and financial support that contributes to parity in collective bargaining negotiations is significantly diminished, because union representatives cannot negotiate for the financial support that management receives, nor can they barter for arrangements that would permit union representatives to devote the necessary time to become specialists in labor-management issues.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exec.

Section 5(a) of the Collective Bargaining Procedures Order, for example, provides that \"ordinarily\" agencies shall only devote a certain amount of time to negotiating the ground rules for a collective bargaining process (no more than six weeks) or to hammering out the terms of a final collective bargaining agreement (between four to six months). Exec. Order No. 13,836 \u00a7 5(a). Section 3(a) of the Official Time Order similarly prescribes that agencies should \"ordinarily\" not agree to provide unions with more than one hour of official time per union member employed with the bargaining agency, in the aggregate. Exec. Order No. 13,837 \u00a7 3(a). And section 3 of the Removal Procedures Order instructs agencies that they should, \"[w]henever reasonable[,]\" endeavor to exclude\n   from the negotiated grievance procedures any issues relating to an employee's removal for misconduct or unacceptable performance. Exec. Order No. 13,839 \u00a7 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Given the rights that the FSLMRS confers, such preconceived notions of the 'ordinary' length of negotiations or the standard amount of official time to be authorized, are unwarranted, and ultimately unduly restrictive, because there is no such thing as a typical collective bargaining agreement with respect to each of these terms-\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of these matters concern negotiable conditions of employment or negotiated procedures for collective bargaining, as the FLRA has recognized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dep't of the Air Force Eglin Air Force Base, Fla.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"624\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203548040\">\n    2016 WL 3548040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *13 (amount of official time);\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv., Wash, D.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"625\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20F.L.R.A.%20426\">\n    64 F.L.R.A. 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 432 (2010) (timelines);\n   <em>\n    Vt.

Mem. at 41), into an impermeable straightjacket. In this regard, each Order first announces the\n   <em>\n    endpoint\n   </em>\n   that the agency must strive to achieve in the \"ordinar[y]\" course of things, or whenever it is \"reasonable\" for the agency to do so. Exec. Order No. 13,836 \u00a7 5(a); Exec. Order No. 13,837 \u00a7 3(a); Exec. Order No. 13,839 \u00a7 3. Then, across the board, these provisions indicate that \"[a]gencies shall commit the time and resources necessary\" to achieve these objectives. Exec. Order No. 13,836 \u00a7 5(a); Exec. Order No. 13,837 \u00a7 3(a); Exec. Order No. 13,839 \u00a7 3. And, in the unlikely event that the agency somehow fails to bring all of its resources to bear upon the assigned task of browbeating the union into accepting the stated term in the context of any negotiation, the agency must either bring the matter to mediation and then to the Federal Impasse Panel,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Exec. Order No. 13,836 \u00a7 5(a) (regarding ground-rule negotiations), or must explain to the \"President [of the United States] through the Director of the Office of Personnel Management\" why it relented, and thereby, shamefully, failed to achieve the goal, Exec.

In effect, agency negotiators are told that they must enter into the negotiating arena wielding predetermined goals, and must be prepared to fight to the death on these prescribed issues, in a manner that, in this Court's view, is not meaningfully susceptible to the open \"give and take\" negotiating process that the duty to bargain in good faith anticipates.\n   <em>\n    Fed.

However, even a mere \"request\" to conduct collective bargaining negotiations entirely on paper (and especially pursuant to changed agency rules requiring this result) risks altering the fundamental nature of the fair and flexible bargaining process that the FSLMRS guarantees, for collective bargaining negotiations are supposed to involve flexible exchanges between knowledgeable institutional actors who meet regularly to try to come to an agreement.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"631\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207114\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4). A robotic exchange of written proposals suggests that the kind of direct and personal contact that has to occur when negotiators are seated around a metaphorical table, discussing workplace conditions, is not welcomed; moreover, it surely discourages the type of \"give and take\" among equals that the negotiating process of the FSLMRS demands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fed.

A plain, compelling, and entirely reasonable alternative explanation for the statute's language carving-out \"Government-wide rule[s] or regulations\" is that government-wide standards sometimes relate to various terms and conditions of employment in the civil service.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Fed'n of Fed.

And section 7117 merely clarifies that any such requirement naturally has to be applied to federal workers, so, as a result, such government-wide rules must be excluded from the scope of collective bargaining.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"635\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207117\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n   <em>\n    This\n   </em>\n   is the simplest, narrowest, and most straightforward reading of the plain text of the section 7117(a)(1) exemption from bargaining. By contrast, Defendants employ an analysis that is akin to verbal jujitsu: their first move is to contend that the President can certainly issue executive orders that qualify as \"government-wide rules\" (Defs.' Reply at 20-21); then, they confidently maintain that the President has the authority to opt to make such government-wide rules apply to federal-sector labor relations \"in a specific way\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23 (internal quotation marks, italics, and citation omitted). For the grand finale, they reason that\n   <em>\n    clearly\n   </em>\n   Congress\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   have intended for the President to employ this power to impact federal sector labor relations by taking select matters off the collective bargaining table nationwide per the language of section 7117, because that provision plainly states that \"matters which are the subject of any rule of regulation\" that qualifies as \"a [g]overnment-wide rule or regulation\" (read: any executive order the President wishes to craft) are necessarily exempted from good-faith bargaining (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   In so arguing, Defendants have (\n   <em>\n    voila\n   </em>\n   !) made a distracting shiny object out of an otherwise entirely unremarkable statutory exemption. But this Court has kept its focus on Congress's stated \"findings and purposes,\" which provide clear context for the statute in which section 7117 is nestled. As has by now been said repeatedly, Congress enacted the FSLMRS to protect and preserve collective bargaining rights, not to destroy them. Thus, what Defendants' section 7117 analysis has not answered-and cannot answer-is\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   an exception to collective bargaining principles that allows the President (or any other agency official, for that matter) to pick off any of the mandatory or permissive topics of negotiation that Congress took care to delineate in the FSLMRS, and put it into the management rights (non-negotiable) bundle, would\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   be inserted in this statute? Defendants attempt to distract from this fundamental unanswered inquiry by providing a detailed discussion of the reason why the scope of its favored interpretation is actually less expansive than its implications might suggest.

Even if such provisions are \"deliberately flexible[,]\" and even if nothing \"precludes [agencies] from\" deviating from the \"objectives\" within these provisions (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), such directives can violate the duty to bargain in good faith that the FSLMRS prescribes nevertheless, and for the reasons laid out in Part IV.D.3,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , they do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   Defendants' argument fails to appreciate that the conflict at issue with respect to these provisions is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   an identifiable tension with a\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   substantive requirement over which agencies and unions must bargain (as is the case with the right to bargain transgressions (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part IV.D.2,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ).)

In other words, with respect to these types of provisions, the\n   <em>\n    nature\n   </em>\n   of the President's order (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether he seeks to give guidance as opposed to laying down a hard-and-fast rule) makes no difference; instead, the key question is whether these suggestions impair the ability of agency officials to keep an open mind, and to participate fully in give-and-take discussions, during collective bargaining negotiations.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"652\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207114\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Steelworkers of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3810713,11643614\" index=\"653\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/983/240/\">\n    983 F.2d at 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining the duty of good faith).

That command does not abate the conflict, for, as Part IV.D.3 explains, prescribing specified goals and suggesting fixed outcomes, while simultaneously flashing the coercive implement of mandatory reporting requirements, wreaks a kind of damage with respect to the negotiating mindset of agency officials that a subsequent,\n   generalized 'follow the law' directive simply can't undo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   As the D.C.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part IV.D.3,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .) Having essentially demanded that agency representatives seek specific ends, and use specific means, in a manner that prevents full and open collective bargaining negotiation, the Orders cannot be saved due to their clever (albeit internally inconsistent) directive that, notwithstanding these ardent suggestions, an agency negotiator should nevertheless act in the manner that the FSLMRS requires.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cap Santa Vue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2251194\" index=\"655\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/424/883/#p889\">\n    424 F.2d at 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[B]ad faith is prohibited though done with sophistication and finesse.\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

Here, the Court reaches the clear conclusion that not each and every provision that the Unions challenge within the Orders runs afoul of a right protected within the FSLMRS or within the CSRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   For example, with respect to the Unions' claim that section 5(c) of the Collective Bargaining Procedures Order is an unauthorized exercise of presidential power (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AFSCME's Mem. at 28-29), the Court discerns no conflict with the FSLMRS. This is because Section 5(c) merely provides that, if union representatives delay or impede negotiations in bad faith, federal agency representatives shall only \"consider\" filing an unfair labor practice or unilaterally implementing a proposal. Exec. Order No. 13,836 \u00a7 5(c). The FSLMRS plainly authorizes such filings in appropriate situations, and nothing in the Order requires agencies to take steps incompatible with that statutory authorization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"656\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207116\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5) ;\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of the Justice, Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"657\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20F.L.R.A.%20892\">\n    55 F.L.R.A. 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 904 (1999) (explaining that an agency may implement changes unilaterally if \"implementation is necessary for the functioning of the agency\"). Thus, contrary to the Unions' suggestion (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AFSCME's Mem. at 28-29), this Order provision does not contradict the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   Nor do section 2(j) of the Official Time Order or section 2(c) of the Removal Procedures Order (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   NTEU's Mem. at 31-34; AFGE's Mem. at 20-21), present statutory conflicts.

In addition, the FLRA has considered such a policy prescription, and has determined that a proposal that requires an agency \"to administer discipline in, among other things, a progressive and consistent manner\" need not be bargained over, because \"[r]estrictions on an agency's ability to choose the specific penalty to impose in disciplinary actions directly interfere with management's right to discipline employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the [FSLMRS].\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

As a result, and due to the\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference the FLRA receives, the Unions' challenges to this provision (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AFSCME's Mem. at 19; NFFE's Mem. at 36), have no merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   The Unions' challenges to section 4(c) of the Official Time Order and section 7 of the Removal Procedures Order are similarly deficient.

This Court has already explained that the President himself has the authority to issue executive orders within the sphere of federal labor-management relations (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part IV.C.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ), and he also has the undisputed authority to \"empower the head of any department or agency[,]\" including OPM, to perform \"any function which is vested in the President by law,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"669\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20301\">\n    3 U.S.C. \u00a7 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, given the multiple wellsprings of authority that OPM enjoys in this area, OPM can surely receive directions from the President to promulgate regulations that are consistent with the rights and duties that the FSLMRS or CSRA prescribe, and setting aside the invalidity of some of the underlying substantive mandates,\n   OPM's implementation of the Orders themselves appears to be all that section 4(c) of the Official Time Order and section 7 of the Removal Procedures Order require.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   Finally, one of the Unions has raised a constitutional Take Care Clause claim against Defendants; at this point, the contention seems to be that, even if the Court finds that the remaining executive order provisions do not create statutory conflicts with the FSLMRS, these provisions, too, must be enjoined as a violation of the President's duty to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\" (AFSCME's Mem. at 10 (\"This clause commands that the President shall execute this duty with 'care' and 'faithfully'; this duty is therefore one of\n   <em>\n    good faith\n   </em>\n   towards Congressional statutes[.]\").) At bottom, this argument suggests that the manner in which the President has interpreted and enforced the FSLMRS and the CSRA has not been in good faith, and thus, his act of issuing these Orders violates the Constitution's Take Care Clause. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"670\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20301\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"670\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20301\">\n    at 10-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   As an initial matter, it is not at all clear that a claim under the Take Care Clause presents a justiciable claim for this Court's resolution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Wash. v.

AFSCME merely alleges that the President cannot \"dispense with the requirement of good faith negotiations\" and must \"act in good faith in executing the statute himself[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AFSCME's Mem. at 16 - 17.) But the instant record contains no evidence of intentional bad-faith decisionmaking on the part of the President in executing the challenged Orders. And absent such evidence (or at least some indication that the Orders issued here exceed the statutory authority of the President in a manner that clearly implicates the constitutional duties and prerogatives that AFSCME says apply)-this Court will decline to hold that there has been a Take Care Clause violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dalton\n   </em>\n   , 511 U.S. at 472,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147367\" index=\"673\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/462/#p472\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Our cases do not support the proposition that every action by the President, or by another executive official, in excess of his statutory authority is\n   <em>\n    ipso facto\n   </em>\n   in violation of the Constitution.

As explained in Part IV.D of this Memorandum Opinion, many of the challenged provisions of the President's Orders constitute an improper exercise of his statutory authority to regulate federal employee labor relations, because they conflict with the right to good-faith collective bargaining that the FSLMRS seeks to protect. The Orders that the President issued on May 25, 2018, and that have been evaluated extensively in this Opinion, will not be invalidated\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   , however, given the President's clear intent that any invalid provisions within these orders should be severed from the rest.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Exec. Order No. 13,837 \u00a7 9(f); Exec. Order No. 13,839 \u00a7 8(e);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ass'n of Am. R.R. v.

Cir. 2018) (\"[T]he remedy should be no more severe than necessary to cure the disease.\"). Furthermore, the Court has concluded that the challenged provisions of the Orders that are addressed herein in Part IV.E are not invalid. Thus, along with the unchallenged\n   parts of the Orders, these provisions remain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   In their cross-motion for summary judgment, Defendants assert that the fact \"that the President's policy choices about how best to guide the conduct of employees in the Executive Branch do not align with Plaintiffs' own policy preferences is not a proper basis for seeking judicial review.\" (Defs.' Mem. at 71.) This is undoubtedly true. But the core claim that the Unions make in the context of the instant case is that the President's policy choices as reflected in the challenged executive orders do not align\n   <em>\n    with the policy preferences of Congress\n   </em>\n   , and in this Court's view,\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   contention is undoubtedly true as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   In short, there is no dispute that the principle mission of the FSLMRS is to protect the collective bargaining rights of federal workers, based on Congress's clear and unequivocal finding that \"labor organizations and collective bargaining in the civil service are in the public interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"675\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207101\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Congress did not intend for union challenges to the validity of executive orders that threaten such collective bargaining rights to be funneled to the FLRA. And upon exercising its subject-matter jurisdiction over the ripe claims that the Unions bring here, this Court has concluded that, although the President has the authority to issue executive orders in the realm of federal labor relations, many of the challenged provisions of the Orders at issue here effectively reduce the scope of the right to bargain collectively as Congress has crafted it, or impair the ability of agency officials to bargain in good faith as Congress has directed, and therefore cannot be sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   As a result, and as set forth in the accompanying Order, this Court will declare the following provisions invalid, and will enjoin the President's subordinates from implementing or giving effect to: Executive Order 13,836 \u00a7\u00a7 5(a), 5(e), 6; Executive Order 13,837 \u00a7\u00a7 3(a), 4(a), 4(b); and Executive Order 13,839 \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4(a), 4(c). What remains- Executive Order 13,836 \u00a7 5(c); Executive Order 13,837 \u00a7\u00a7 2(j), 4(c); and Executive Order 13,839 \u00a7\u00a7 2(b), 2(c), 4(b)(iii), 7-are the few challenged directives that have neither reduced the scope of protected collective bargaining rights nor hampered good faith bargaining, and, thus, cannot be said to conflict with the FSLMRS.

Order No. 13839 \u00a7 4(b)(iii). As explained in Part IV.E, this directive does not conflict with the scope of bargaining protected by the FSLMRS, because the FLRA has already determined that such matters are within the sole discretion of agency management under section 7106(a), and the opinion of this expert agency is entitled to\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    deference.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-299\">\n    As an aside, each of these Orders puts way too much stock in the FSLMRS's statements about an \"effective\" and \"efficient\" government, as a general matter. It is certainly true that that goal reflects one key aspect of the careful balance that Congress was attempting to strike between management and labor.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"694\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207101\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2) (suggesting that \"the public interest demands the highest standards of employee performance\").

Moreover, far from being propelled by some abstract conviction that the scope of the right of collective bargaining needs to be reduced in order to achieve an effective and efficient federal workforce (as these Orders suggest), in the FSLMRS, Congress stated plainly what the statute\n    <em>\n     means\n    </em>\n    when it references \"the requirement of an effective and efficient Government.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"696\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207101\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 7101(b). Section 7101(a)(1)(B) explains that \"the statutory protection of the right of employees to organize, bargain collectively, and participate through labor organizations of their own choosing in decisions which affect them\"\n    <em>\n     itself\n    </em>\n    \"contributes to the\n    <em>\n     effective\n    </em>\n    conduct of public business,\" and section 7101(a)(2) indicates that \"the continued development and implementation of modern and progressive work practices\"\n    <em>\n     through collective bargaining\n    </em>\n    \"facilitate[s] and improve[s] employee performance and the efficient accomplishment of the operations of the Government.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"697\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207101\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 7101(a)(1)(B), (2) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-300\">\n    The parties to collective bargaining negotiations can still conceivably bargain over the circumstances under which official time might be appropriately granted (except for lobbying and grievances), and can include such circumstances in their agreements, under the Official Time Order's provision, but, as noted, the Order directs agencies to secure the power to grant or deny \"authorization\" for the requested use of official time for any reason, which will affect how official-time agreements are actually implemented. Exec. Order No. 13,837 \u00a7 4(b). Thus, agencies can turn any bargain regarding the scope of official time into a meaningless exercise, and according to the D.C. Circuit,\n    <em>\n     that\n    </em>\n    circumstance conflicts with the will of Congress, because \"[n]one of the major statutory frameworks for collective bargaining allows a party to unilaterally abrogate a lawfully executed agreement.\"\n    <em>\n     Chertoff\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3454996,3329607\" index=\"698\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/839/\">\n     452 F.3d at 860\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In other words, by giving management the unilateral power to determine whether or not this bargained-for term will be actually implemented, the government has effectively conferred upon itself the power to nullify any bargained-for agreement to the use of official time.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-301\">\n    Because the above analysis invalidates section 4(a)(v) of the Official Time Order, which is the only Order provision to which the Unions' First Amendment claim related, it is unnecessary for this Court to consider the Unions' claims that section 4(a)(v) of the Official Time Order violates the Unions' First Amendment right to freely associate.
