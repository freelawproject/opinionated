The First Criminal Sexual Encounter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 24, 2015, minor female number 1 (\"MF 1\")'s mother dropped her off at school, where MF 1 attended the eighth grade.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket No. 168 at p. 20.) At approximately 8:00 AM, MF 1 and MF 2 met Mel\u00e9ndez and Montijo at a food truck adjacent to their middle school; Melendez and Montijo had arrived in a car that Montijo drove.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 22. MF 1 and MF 2 then entered the car that Montijo was driving \"to go for a ride.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 23. According to MF 1, \"[she] did not know where it was that [she] was going.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   With MF 1 and MF2 in the car, Montijo first drove to the Zorrilla public housing project, and \"asked if [the girls] wanted to smoke or drink anything.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Montijo subsequently drove MF 1 and MF 2 to the Jackeline Motel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 26. The Jackeline Motel is located approximately 1,500 feet from its main entrance \"[b]ecause in olden times, like years ago, these businesses were not placed on the road itself. It was more private.\" (Docket No. 167 at pp. 121-122.) Hedges and a concrete wall provide additional privacy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 123. To rent a room at the Jackeline Motel, guests pull into a garage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The garage door closes with a push of a button, at which point guests place $20 in a service drawer to occupy a room for six-hours with an option to extend their stay for an additional fee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 123-124. Jackeline Motel employees record the license plate numbers of vehicles belonging to guests, the time guests arrive and depart from the motel, and the room numbers assigned.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Guests may leave at their discretion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Indeed, guests need not disclose their personal information, and are not required to interact with Jackeline Motel employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to MF 1, the only individuals she observed at the Jackeline Motel on November 24, 2015 were MF 2, Mel\u00e9ndez, and Montijo. (Docket No. 168 at p. 27.) Mel\u00e9ndez and MF 2 retreated to one room, and Montijo and MF 1 occupied another\n   room.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 28. Once in the room, Montijo informed MF 1 that she \"didn't have to do anything [she] didn't want to do,\" and complimented her appearance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 28-29. On this occasion, Montijo and MF 1 had no physical contact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mel\u00e9ndez and MF 2, however, had sexual intercourse. (Docket No. 167 at p. 159.) Subsequently, Mel\u00e9ndez and Montijo returned MF 1 and MF 2 to the \"entrance before the school,\" according to MF 2, \"so [their classmates and teachers] wouldn't see [them].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 161.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the days following their first trip to the Jackeline Motel, Montijo communicated with MF 1 via KIK, a social media application. (Docket No. 168 at p. 31.) Montijo and MF 1 \"didn't talk about anything specific.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 32. Montijo, however, conveyed that \"he wanted to see [MF 1] again.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, MF 1, Montijo and Mel\u00e9ndez formed a group chat on KIK.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mel\u00e9ndez requested MF 1 \"to bring in another person.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 33. MF 1 complied, inviting an eighth grade student, minor female number 3 (\"MF 3\"), to the group chat.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The group planned another \"ride\" to the Jackeline Motel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 33-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Second Criminal Sexual Encounter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On the morning of November 30, 2015, Mel\u00e9ndez and Montijo returned to the same location they had previously met MF 1 and MF 2.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 165. MF 2 observed MF 1 and MF 3 walk towards the defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   MF 3 looked at MF 2 \"as though she didn't want to go\" with Mel\u00e9ndez and Montijo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   MF 2 remained at the school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   MF 1 and MF 3 waited until 8:00 AM to join the defendants in the car Montijo drove because at that time \"there was no risk that the teachers would catch [them].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 35. On the day of the second incident, MF 1 and MF 3 wore their school uniforms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   MF 1 and MF 3 spoke to each other in the back seat of the car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 37. MF 3 asked MF 1 \"what did she have to do, and [MF 1] told her that she didn't have to do anything [MF 3] didn't want to do.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mel\u00e9ndez and Montijo transported MF 1 and MF 3 to the Jackeline Motel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 38. The defendants again separated the minor females.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mel\u00e9ndez and MF 3 occupied one room.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Montijo and MF 1 shared another room, where they had sexual intercourse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Subsequently, MF 1 removed a notebook from her backpack.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Montijo questioned MF 1 about her age, and MF 1 answered that she was thirteen years old.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 39. Montijo stated to MF 1 that \"he wouldn't have done it\" if he knew MF 1 was thirteen years old.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 56. Montijo claimed, however, that \"he was going to be with [MF 1] always, that he was going to look after [MF 1], that he was going to wait for [MF 1] to come out from high school, and that he was going to take care of [MF 1].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After MF 1's conversation with Montijo, she visited Mel\u00e9ndez and MF 3's room, where she observed that Mel\u00e9ndez and MF 3 were lying in bed without clothes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 39. MF 1 returned to her room with Mel\u00e9ndez's phone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A classmate from her school called Mel\u00e9ndez's phone to alert MF 1 and MF 3 that they \"had to go to school, that the police was at school, that they had already caught [them].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 40. While Mel\u00e9ndez and MF 3 dressed, MF 1 informed Montijo that her parents were at the middle school with the police.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mel\u00e9ndez and Montijo later departed from the Jackeline Motel with MF 1 and MF 3. Montijo drove MF 1 and MF 3 to a Burger King Restaurant \"so [they] could say that they had been eating.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During the drive to the Burger King, Montijo\n   appeared \"anxious,\" as though \"something bad [was] going to happen.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After transporting them to the Burger King, Montijo drove MF 1 and MF 3 to the middle school, where MF 3's father waited for his daughter's return.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   MF 3's father observed Montijo's car located in front of the middle school, where \"[Mel\u00e9ndez and Montijo] let go of [his] girl and just sped off.\" (Docket No. 167 at p. 109.) MF 1 attempted to exit the car, but \"[MF 3's] father went off chasing [them], so [she] didn't have any time.\" (Docket No. 168 at p. 43.) Montijo fled from the middle school with Mel\u00e9ndez and MF 1 in the car.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket No. 167 at p. 110.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Montijo subsequently drove MF 1 to a house in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. (Docket No. 168 at p. 44.) After Montijo told MF 1 to remain calm, a man drove the defendants and MF 1 to the Zorrilla public housing project in a van.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 45. Mel\u00e9ndez and Montijo \"wait[ed] for things to calm down.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 46. A second man drove MF 1 and Montijo to a location near the school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Once at this location, MF 1 exited the second man's car, and walked back to the school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 46-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Rule 29 Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A court may set aside the jury's guilty verdict and enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. In reviewing a motion for judgment of acquittal, courts must consider the evidence \"in the light most favorable to the prosecution\" and determine whether the \"body of proof, as a whole, has sufficient bite to ground a reasoned conclusion that the government proved each of the elements of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In sum, while the sufficiency of the evidence is at the heart of the Rule 29 inquiry, deference to the jury's verdict informs the Court's analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court need only satisfy itself that the guilty verdict \"finds support in a plausible rendition of the record.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Montijo challenges his conviction on three fronts. First, Montijo argues that the evidence introduced at trial failed to prove that he communicated with MF 1 via KIK, or that these communications served to \"persuade, induce, entice, and coerce\" MF 1 within the meaning of section 2422. (Docket No. 173 at pp. 4-11.) Second, Montijo contends that the United States failed to prove the predicate offense underlying the section 2422 violation because he had no knowledge that MF 1 was less than sixteen years old.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 12-14. Finally, Montijo maintains that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he transported MF 2 and MF 3 with the intent that each minor female engage in unlawful sexual activity with Mel\u00e9ndez.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 15-17. The Court addresses each of Montijo's arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Montijo's Communication with MF 1 on KIK\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Montijo asserts that because \"no evidence, other than [MF 1's] testimony\" established that \"Montijo used KIK to chat with her,\" judgment of acquittal is appropriate. (Docket No. 173 at p. 4.) The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   MF 1 testified that after her first meeting with Montijo on November 24, 2017, the two communicated via KIK. (Docket No. 168 at p. 31.) She specified that KIK \"is an application that you can communicate with a person through text.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 32. Montijo sent MF 1 text messages on KIK indicating that he \"wanted to see [her] again.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, Montijo, Mel\u00e9ndez, and MF 1 planned the November 30, 2017 trip to the Jackeline Motel during the course of a KIK group chat.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Construing the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict compels the Court to conclude that MF 1's testimony reasonably supports a finding that Montijo used KIK to entice a minor in violation of section 2422 notwithstanding the fact that the United States did not introduce the actual communications.

The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Laureys\n   </em>\n   communicated in an online chatroom with a law enforcement officer posing as a child molester, offering the defendant access to a twelve-year old female.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3822347,3766590\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/653/27/\">\n    653 F.3d at 28-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The dissenting opinion on which Montijo relies challenges the affirmance of the defendant's conviction, concluding that the defendant's attempt \"to persuade an\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     adult\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to grant him access to a minor\" cannot serve as a basis for a conviction pursuant to section 2422.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3822347,3766590\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/653/27/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Laureys\n   </em>\n   , Montijo did not attempt to persuade an adult to persuade a child to engage in sexual activity with him. Rather, Montijo communicated directly with MF 1 both in person and via KIK.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   More importantly, ample evidence exists in the record to sustain a finding that Montijo persuaded, induced, enticed or coerced MF 1 to have sexual intercourse with him. MF 1 traveled to the Jackeline Motel on November 30, 2015 only because she and Montijo planned the \"\n   <em>\n    vuelta\n   </em>\n   ,\" or \"ride\" on KIK. (Docket No. 168 at p. 34.) Montijo drove on both occasions, transporting minor females who normally relied on their parents for rides to middle school. MF 1 and Montijo had no physical contact during the first encounter, but had sexual intercourse during the second encounter after the two communicated via KIK. That MF 1 engaged in sexual activity with Montijo only after exchanging text messages on KIK supports the inference that the Montijo's communications persuaded MF 1 to have sexual intercourse. Consequently, a rational jury could conclude that MF 1 assented to Montijo's request to travel with him from Manat\u00ed to the Motel Jackeline in Barceloneta to engage in criminal sexual activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Montijo rooted his theory of the case on a \"blind date\" gone awry. (Docket No. 167 at p. 79.) Montijo presented himself as the victim of Mel\u00e9ndez's deceit: \"[Mel\u00e9ndez] tricked his own friend,\" because he \"needed a wingman, needed somebody to go with him because maybe [MF 2] or [MF 3] would not go by herself.\" (Docket No. 169 at p. 41.) Montijo merely accompanied Mel\u00e9ndez because Mel\u00e9ndez \"promised him a good time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202423\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202423\">\n    at p. 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Docket No. 167 at p. 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, the Court concludes that there is sufficient evidence to sustain a finding that Montijo was aware that MF 1 was a minor. Indeed, the appearance of the minor females, the location of the food truck adjacent to the middle school, the school uniforms that the minor females wore on November 30, 2015, and the extent to which Montijo attempted to conceal his movements with MF 1 on November 30, 2015 support a finding that Montijo was not mistaken about MF 1's age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Montijo Transported Minor Females with the Intent to Engage in Criminal Sexual Activity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The third argument Montijo sets forth in support of his Rule 29 motion pertains to counts four and six, which charge Montijo and Mel\u00e9ndez with transporting MF 2 and MF 3, respectively, within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity in violation of section 2423. (Docket No. 28 at pp. 3-5.) Montijo contends that the United States \"was unable to provide any evidence that Mr. Montijo's intent was that MF 2 and MF 3 were to have sex with [Mel\u00e9ndez].\" (Docket No. 173 at p. 16.) The United States failed to provide sufficient proof of intent, Montijo argues, because he was not in the motel room with Mel\u00e9ndez and MF 2 during the first sexual encounter, or MF 3 during the second sexual encounter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202423\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202423\">\n    at p. 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   MF 2 testified that she had sexual intercourse with Mel\u00e9ndez on November 24, 2015. (Docket No. 167 at p. 159.) Additionally, MF 1 testified that she observed MF 3 and Mel\u00e9ndez in bed without clothes on November 30, 2015. (Docket No. 168 at p. 39.) Moreover, as the United States asserted in its opposition to Montijo's Rule 29 motion, the testimony presented at trial \"describing the [Jackeline] motel, where it was located, how it operated and the contents of its room\" permitted the jury to infer that \"the main purpose of anyone going there was to engage in illicit sexual\n   intercourse.\" (Docket No. 177 at p. 8.) That some of the evidence may be subject to an interpretation that is inconsistent with a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is no reason for the Court to disturb the jury's verdict. This is so because the government need not \"[e]liminate every possible theory consistent with the defendant's innocence.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

(Docket No. 149.) At Mel\u00e9ndez's sentencing hearing, he moved to withdraw his guilty plea. (Docket No. 192.) In support of Mel\u00e9ndez's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, he stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   I looked at those papers, and the truth is-I know I am guilty of what I did. I am not saying that I am not, and I am here to try to restart my life, to be resurrected, sort to speak, but 22 years, I just think that it's not fair, what I signed, and that's why I want to change my plea from guilty to not guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 6. The Court denied Mel\u00e9ndez's motion to withdraw his guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Mel\u00e9ndez, vacatur of judgment is warranted because \"the court lacked jurisdiction to Sentence him, since he did indicate on the record, prior to being sentenced by the court that he wished to be tried by and [sic] jury.\" (Docket No. 149 at p. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Mel\u00e9ndez's Rule 34 motion is untimely. Pursuant to Rule 34, the Court shall arrest judgment \"if the court does not have jurisdiction of the charged offense.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 34(a). Defendants seeking an arrest of judgment must move for relief \"within 14 days after the court accepts a verdict or finding of guilty, or after a plea of guilty or\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Mel\u00e9ndez entered a plea of guilty on August 30, 2017. (Docket No. 72.) Seven months after Mel\u00e9ndez's change of plea hearing, he moved for arrest of judgment. (Docket No. 149.) The Court need not address the merits of Mel\u00e9ndez's motion for arrest of judgment because he failed to file his Rule 34 motion within the fourteen-day period of limitations.

The Court granted Montijo's motion for an extension of time to file post-trial motions, allowing Montijo until April 30, 2018 to file the Rule 29 motion. (Docket No. 161.) Montijo moved for a judgment of acquittal on April 30, 2018. (Docket No. 173.)
