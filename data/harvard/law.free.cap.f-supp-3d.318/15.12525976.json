On October 24, Jones moved to file an amended complaint that (1) added a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress and (2) joined Meredith McMahon, his wife, as an additional plaintiff with respect to all three tort claims levied against Defendant. ECF No. 10. The Court granted the motion, but <em>sua sponte</em> dismissed McMahon's claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because she had not satisfied the FTCA's exhaustion requirement. ECF No. 12. On February 7, 2018, Defendant moved to dismiss the remaining claims in Jones' amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground they are precluded by the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (\"FECA\"), <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%208101\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8101</extracted-citation>, <em>et seq.</em> <em>See</em> MTD; ECF No. 15 (\"Opp.\"); ECF No. 16.

Motion to Amend</strong></p><p id=\"p-28\">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2), if a party may no longer amend his pleading as of right, then he \"may amend [his] pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave,\" and \"[t]he court should freely give leave when justice so requires.\" However, \"[c]ourts may deny a motion to amend a complaint as futile ... if the proposed claim would not survive a motion to dismiss.\" <em>Williams v.

Cir. 2016) (second alteration in original) (quoting <em>James Madison Ltd. ex rel. Hecht v. Ludwig</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7646576,3693676\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/82/1085/\">82 F.3d 1085</extracted-citation>, 1099 (D.C. Cir. 1996) ).</p><p id=\"p-29\">Here, Jones seeks to file a second amended complaint adding his wife, McMahon, as an additional party-presumably with respect to all three tort claims. <em>See</em> Mot. to Amend at 11; ECF No. 17-4 (proposed second amended complaint). The Court finds that Jones' motion must be denied on futility grounds for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Indeed, FECA's exclusivity provision precludes McMahon's proposed FTCA claims based on her husband's injuries. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%208116\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8116</extracted-citation>(c) (liability under FECA is \"exclusive and instead of all other liability of the United States ... to the employee, [and] his ... <em>spouse</em> ...\" (emphasis added) ). McMahon's proposed claims all appear to stem from Jones' injuries, and nothing in Jones' filings suggests otherwise. The Court finds that all three of McMahon's proposed claims, including the IIED claim, are precluded for reasons already discussed. Thus, the Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over them.</p><p id=\"p-30\"><strong>IV. Conclusion</strong></p><p id=\"p-31\">For all of the above reasons, Defendant's motion to dismiss, ECF No. 14, will be granted and Jones' motion to file a second amended complaint, ECF No. 17, will be denied. This action will be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, in a separate order.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
