Describing his action as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and challenge under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , he brings suit to contest the April 28, 2016 decision of the United States Parole Commission (\"the Commission\") to deny him parole until at least April 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 1 at 1, 27, 54. Morton alleges that when considering whether to grant him parole, the Commission unlawfully (and surreptitiously) applied guidelines first promulgated in 2000, rather than the regulations issued in 1987 and a policy guideline issued in 1991 that the parties agree should have governed the determination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is currently before the Court on Morton's motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 13, and the Commission's cross-motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, to transfer, Dkt. 14. The Commission argues that Morton has brought a habeas petition and that the Court lacks jurisdiction over such a petition because Morton is currently incarcerated in Beaumont, Texas. Dkt. 14-1 at 6. It asserts, moreover, that dismissal rather than transfer is appropriate because Morton's habeas action is unlikely to succeed on the merits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To the extent Morton's action can be characterized as seeking his release from prison through the writ, that aspect of this matter is fairly straightforward: the Court agrees with the Commission. Morton appears, however, to request a new parole hearing and that the hearing be conducted according to the procedures the parties agree govern his release. Dkt. 1 at 26-27. Whether framed as a \u00a7 1983 claim, a freestanding challenge under the Ex Post Facto Clause, or as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, this aspect of Morton's suit presents a more complicated question. For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that Morton has failed to state a \u00a7 1983 or Ex Post Facto Clause claim, that the Court lacks jurisdiction over any habeas petition he seeks to bring, and that transferring the case would not be in the interest of justice. The Court will, accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   in part Defendants' motion and will\n   <strong>\n    DISMISS\n   </strong>\n   on its own motion the remainder of the complaint. The Court will also\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   Morton's motion for summary judgment because it fails to overcome the threshold issues raised by Defendants' motion to dismiss or transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Dkt. 1 at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The examiner also made other findings related to Morton's post-incarceration behavior that further influenced his decision to recommend continuing the parole hearing for a year. In concluding that it was\n   appropriate to override Morton's point score, the examiner found that Morton \"need[ed] additional programming to remain crime-free once released to the community.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31. He then explained that Morton had incurred eleven disciplinary infractions while in custody, most recently in 2014, that Morton had completed only a \"moderate\" level of programming while in prison, and that he had not participated in classes \"concerning victims of crimes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. In light of this history, the examiner concluded that Morton \"need[ed] to engage in a victim impact program and ... need[ed] a sustained period of clear conduct\" before being released on parole.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The hearing officer's recommendation was then submitted to an executive reviewer, who recommended that the Commission reject the hearing officer's conclusions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36. The reviewer found that the examiner had inadequately justified the application of the unusual cruelty aggravating factor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, he concluded that Morton's actions were not \"any more cruel than needed to sustain a conviction for second degree murder.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37. Although the reviewer recognized that post-incarceration behavior had also factored into the decision to recommend denying parole, he noted that the \"primary reason\" was the unusual cruelty determination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37-38. The Commission, however, ultimately sided with the examiner, denied parole, and set a rehearing date for January 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40. At the request of Morton's attorney, the Commission moved the hearing date up to August 2016, which was a year from his last hearing rather than a year from his eligibility date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-43. That date was then further advanced to April 7, 2016, to accommodate victim impact statements from the sisters of the man Morton murdered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47; Dkt. 19 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At that second hearing, the examiner again determined that Morton's numerical score under the 1987 Guidelines indicated that parole should be granted, but, again, declined to recommend release.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49. Specifically, the examiner found that Morton had committed a disciplinary infraction on December 9, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48. On that date, at least one sharpened piece of metal was found wedged behind a locker in Morton's cell.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Morton denied that the weapon was his and presented evidence corroborating his account, but \"acknowledged ... that someone has to be held responsible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The examiner recommended denying parole because \"the seriousness and recent occurrence of [Morton's] serious negative institutional behavior, including [his] pattern of possessing dangerous weapons, is evidence [Morton] [was] not ready to remain crime-free in the community and [his] continued incarceration ... [was] necessary to protect the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Morton's attorney raised several objections, including that the victim's family had been allowed to speak at the hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50. In response, the examiner clarified his findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   I advised [Morton's attorney that] my recommendation was not even based on the testimony of the victims. Rather, it was entirely based on the fact that, in the 8 months since his last hearing, he has incurred a very serious disciplinary infraction of possessing dangerous weapons. I told him I found the subject's claim of innocence lacked credibility as\n   this is now the third time the subject has been found guilty for possessing weapons. When you couple that with the Stalking infraction of 2014 and prior infractions for Threats, Insolence, and Refusing to Obey Orders, I found it sufficient evidence he is not ready to remain crime-free in the community. I also advised of my finding a new term of incarceration beyond the ordinary rehearing guideline was necessary to protect the public due to the recentness and severity of the weapons infraction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On April 28, 2016, the Commission adopted that recommendation in full, reiterating that earlier disciplinary infractions for possession of weapons in 2003 and 2004 meant that Morton's denials \"lack[ed] credibility,\" and noting that other disciplinary infractions that had occurred prior to Morton's initial hearing supported denying parole.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Later that year, the corrections officer who originally reported Morton for possession of the weapon in 2015 formally requested that the disciplinary incident be expunged from Morton's record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63. The officer stated that Morton \"was wrongfully charged with the possession of a dangerous weapon\" because further searches behind lockers elsewhere in the prison had uncovered vast quantities of similar weapons in identical locations, suggesting that the weapons had accumulated over time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Morton's lawyer requested that the Commission reopen his hearing on the basis of this new information. Dkt. 14-2 at 3. The Commission then contacted the prison where Morton was being held, which relayed that the Disciplinary Hearing Officer who found Morton guilty \"ha[d] no intention of expunging the incident report based upon the [staff member's] recommendation.\" Dkt. 14-5 at 3. Instead, the only way to have the disciplinary infraction expunged was through an administrative appeals process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Morton had in fact already attempted to utilize that procedure, but his appeal was denied prior to the investigator's request that the Bureau of Prisons expunge the disciplinary incident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After the investigator's recommendation, Morton once more sought administrative expungement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That request was, again, denied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Because the Commission's policy is that an adverse finding under prison disciplinary procedures \"is considered conclusive evidence of guilt,\" the result of Morton's administrative appeals led the Parole Commission hearing examiner to recommend against reopening Morton's parole hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The examiner further noted that he was \"not swayed by\" the corrections officer's request for expungement, concluding \"that the subject's history of possessing weapons makes him a risk to the community.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Commission concurred in that recommendation on December 16, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Shortly thereafter, Morton commenced this action. Dkt. 1 at 27. His next parole rehearing is scheduled for April 2019.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court begins by clarifying exactly what kind of lawsuit Morton filed. The handwritten initial pleading asserts that Morton is both a \"Petitioner for Writ of Habeas Corpus\" and a \"Plaintiff\" seeking relief under \" 42 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 1983.\" Dkt. 1 at 1. He asks the Court to \"grant him a rehearing,\" concedes that the sovereign immunity of the Commission bars any money damages, and requests that the Court \"grant his [p]etition[ ] [for a writ] of [h]abeas [corpus for] a[n] Ex[ ]Post[ ]Facto violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27. Morton's opposition to Defendants' motion to dismiss does little to clarify the issue, stating that he \"did indeed file a petition for writ of habeas corpus,\" Dkt. 19 at 6, and focusing on the Commission's alleged violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-13. But he\n   also cites to\n   <em>\n    Sellmon v.

Morton argues, however, that the Commission nevertheless erred when it\n   applied those guidelines. He notes that the guidelines provide, in part, that when \"one or more aggravating factors [is] present,\" the Commission may \"schedule a reconsideration date later than the prescribed set-off.\" Dkt. 23 at 13. Those aggravating factors \"include but are not limited to\" the presence of \"repeated or extremely serious negative institutional behavior\" and the determination that \"[t]he offender poses a serious threat to ... others and adequate resources are not available in the community.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14. Here, the Commission based the extended set-off in large part on the 2015 weapons infraction, which it characterized as \"serious negative institutional behavior\" demonstrating that Morton was \"not ready to remain crime-free in the community.\" Dkt. 13 at 41; Dkt. 14-5 at 2; Dkt. 1 at 54. As Morton notes, however, the 1991 Policy Guideline defines the factor \"repeated or extremely serious negative institutional behavior\" in a way that (as the Court explains further below) likely precluded the Commission from concluding that Morton's institutional record constituted such behavior. Dkt. 22-1 at 35. But whether or not the Commission\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have properly found an aggravating factor under this particular provision-given that the list is explicitly nonexclusive, Dkt. 23 at 13-the Commission retains substantial discretion under both the governing statute, D.C. Code. \u00a7 24-204(a),\n   <em>\n    superseded by\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 24-404(a) (2009);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277680,6785577\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/127/\">\n    793 F.3d at 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the relevant guidelines, Dkt. 22-1 at 8; 28 DCMR \u00a7 104.11 (\"Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Board may order a parole reconsideration date it determines to be appropriate.\"), to depart from the standard set-off for reasons unrelated to these aggravating factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Although the Commission's conclusions are not a model of clarity, the Court concludes that the Commission did in fact invoke the discretion allowed by the statute and governing guidelines in effect at the time Morton committed the offense for which he remains incarcerated, rather than determining that Morton's institutional record constituted \"repeated or extremely serious negative institutional behavior\" under the 1991 Policy Guideline. Notably, the Commission concluded that \"[a] departure from the[ ] guidelines\" with respect to the length of his set-off was \"warranted\" because \"the seriousness and recent occurrence of [his] serious negative institutional behavior ... [constituted] evidence [that Morton] was not ready to remain crime-free in the community and [that his] continued incarceration\" for at least thirty-six more months was \"necessary to protect the public.\" Dkt. 1 at 54. This finding comports with the guideline for determining non-standard set-offs, 28 DCMR \u00a7 104.11, and mirrors the language in the relevant D.C. Code provision, which provides that the Commission may grant parole only upon a finding \"that there is a reasonable probability that a prisoner will live and remain at liberty without violating the law\" and \"that his release is not incompatible with the welfare of society,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2024-204\">\n    D.C.

First,\n   Morton argues that the Commission improperly relied on his 2015 weapons infraction. He identifies two purported defects in the consideration of this asserted infraction. As an initial matter, he states that because the disciplinary infraction had by then been called into question, Dkt. 1 at 63, it was arbitrary and capricious for the Commission to rely on the incident in December 2016, when it denied his request to reopen his case in advance of his April 2019 rehearing date, Dkt. 14-5 at 3. The Court disagrees. As the hearing examiner noted, the Bureau of Prisons ultimately decided not to follow the recommendation for expungement cited by Morton.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20F.3d%201184\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to the Commission's policies, that finding by the Bureau of Prisons was \"considered conclusive evidence of guilt\" in the eyes of the Commission.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20F.3d%201184\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because of the additional facts and expertise available to the Bureau of Prisons when considering disciplinary incidents occurring in federal facilities, the Commission's deference was not irrational. After reviewing the investigator's report recommending expungement, moreover, the Commission independently concluded that the report provided insufficient grounds to reverse its earlier conclusion that Morton's record of weapons possession \"makes him a risk to the community\" sufficient to deny parole for an additional thirty-six months.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20F.3d%201184\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That conclusion, even if it the Court\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   reach a different one reviewing the evidence de novo, was rational.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Morton also challenges the Commission's reliance on the 2015 weapons infraction on the ground that, if it occurred, it was insufficiently serious to deviate from the presumption of release resulting from his \"total point score of 2 under the 1987 Board guidelines for D.C. Code offenders.\" Dkt. 1 at 49. The Court is unconvinced that the decision to deviate from the numerical guidelines was irrational. Under the 1987 Guidelines, the Commission has the discretion to depart from the presumption of release resulting from a prisoner's numerical score, so long as it \"specif[ies] in writing those factors which it used to depart from the strict application of the provisions of this chapter.\" Dkt. 22-1 at 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277680,6785577\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/127/\">\n    793 F.3d at 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The guidelines do not limit the Commission's authority to depart from the presumption of release based on the \"seriousness\" of the infraction. And, more importantly, given the Commission and Bureau of Prisons' view of the seriousness of the weapons infraction, reliance on the incident to deviate from the score in this case was not irrational.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Morton responds that, under the 1991 Policy Guideline, to overcome a numerical score recommending parole on the basis of \"negative institutional behavior,\" the Commission must conclude that such behavior was \"repeated or extremely serious.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 22-1 at 35. In the context of a parole reconsideration hearing, the 1991 Policy Guideline defines \"repeated or extremely serious negative institutional behavior\" as the commission of \"\n   <em>\n    [t]wo or more\n   </em>\n   \" offenses similar in severity to Morton's weapons possession infraction \"\n   <em>\n    since the preceding release consideration on the sentence.\n   </em>\n   \" Dkt. 22-1 at 35 (emphasis added). As Morton correctly observes, the only disciplinary offense relied on by the Commission that occurred between his 2015 and 2016 hearings was the 2015 weapons possession infraction. Dkt. 1 at 49, 54. His argument nevertheless fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As noted above, the 1987 Guidelines clearly specify that the Commission retains the discretion to deviate from the recommendation produced by a prisoner's numerical score so long as the Commission specifies its reasons, whatever they may be, in writing. The 1991 Policy Guideline expounds upon certain terms in the 1987 Guidelines, but does not supersede them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277680,6785577\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/127/\">\n    793 F.3d at 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In 1991, in an effort to facilitate consistency in Guideline application, the Board also issued an unpublished policy guideline that provided definitions of criteria, parameters, and terms used in the 1987 Guidelines.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ). The 1987 Guidelines and 1991 Policy Guideline, moreover, \"never constrained the discretion of the\" D.C. Parole Board or the Commission.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277680,6785577\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/127/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277680,6785577\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/127/\">\n    at 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The first of these concerns the Commission's decision in 2016 to utilize a thirty-six month set-off rather than the typical twelve month set-off. Dkt. 1 at 54. As discussed in the course of the Court's analysis of Morton's ex post facto claim, the Commission both applied the proper guidelines and statutory provisions and made the finding called for by that framework to justify an extended set-off. Morton's recent weapons infraction supplied a rational basis for the decision. Morton's final challenge to the Commission's\n   2016 decision to deny him parole rests on its references to disciplinary infractions that occurred in 2003, 2004, and 2014. Dkt. 1 at 49, 54. Those disciplinary infractions occurred prior to his 2015 hearing, and under the 1991 Policy Guideline, it appears they should not have been considered when determining whether he had exhibited negative institutional behavior sufficient to overcome the recommendation produced by his numerical score. But, as noted above, under the 1987 Guidelines and controlling D.C. Circuit precedent, the Commission has retained substantial discretion to override a prisoner's numerical score even after its adoption of the 1991 Policy Guideline. It must, of course, explain its reason for doing so, and that explanation must pass the rational basis test, but the Commission did so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   That leaves only the question of whether the Commission's finding that Morton's negative institutional record created \"a reasonable probability that [he] would not obey the law if released and [his] release would endanger the public safety,\" Dkt. 1 at 54, was itself rational. Given the content of Morton's institutional record, the Court cannot conclude that the Commission's determination was irrational.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Having thus identified some of the difficulties Morton's claim would face if it were to be construed as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the Court returns to the procedural posture of the present case. To the extent such a petition would provide Morton a cause of action to seek review of the Commission's decision, the Court lacks jurisdiction over his claim because Morton is incarcerated outside of this district.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chatman-Bey v.

Because the Court concludes that the 2016 decision to deny Morton parole complied with the Constitution's prohibition on ex post facto laws, the Court only discusses Morton's arguments relating to his most recent hearing and subsequent request to reopen the proceedings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The guidelines addressing rehearing set-offs were adopted in 1992, Dkt. 22-1 at 57, and 1988, 28 DCMR \u00a7\u00a7 104.1-11, and are distinct from the 1987, 1991, and 2000 guidelines at issue in much of this case. Because Morton's underlying offense conduct occurred in 1995, Dkt. 1 at 31, and he was sentenced in 1996, Dkt. 1 at 2, this distinction is of no moment; the\n    <em>\n     application\n    </em>\n    in 2016 of guidelines\n    <em>\n     adopted\n    </em>\n    in 1992 or 1988 to someone\n    <em>\n     sentenced\n    </em>\n    in 1996 for crimes\n    <em>\n     committed\n    </em>\n    in 1995 poses no ex post facto problem.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The \"decision\" as relevant here proceeded in several steps. First, on April 7, 2016, a hearing examiner conducted an in-person parole hearing and produced a recommendation that parole be denied. Dkt. 1 at 47-50 (Hearing Examiner Report and Recommendation). Then, a sufficient number of Parole Commissioners approved the recommendation in late April.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 51-52. The Commissioners' approval resulted in the April 28, 2016 Notice of Action, which adopted the reasoning of the examiner's report.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 54-55. Finally, Morton sought to reopen his hearing after he received notice that the Bureau of Prisons investigator had recommended the 2015 weapons infraction be expunged from his record. Dkt. 14-2 at 2-3. The Commission denied that request on December 16, 2016. Dkt. 14-5 at 2-4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Whether a prisoner has \"committed serious disciplinary infractions\" is also relevant to the calculation of the numerical score that creates a presumption of parole or continued confinement. Dkt. 22-1 at 11. At issue here, however, is the Commission's practice of designating certain disciplinary infractions as \"factors countervailing\" a presumption of parole that has been generated by the numerical score.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 33.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The nonbinding nature of the 1987 Guidelines and 1991 Policy Guideline occasionally leads to incongruous results in cases such as this one.
