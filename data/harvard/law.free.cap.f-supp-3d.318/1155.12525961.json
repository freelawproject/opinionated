The Cedar Fire began on August 16, 2016 and burned over 29,000 acres of mixed conifer and white fir forest, most of which was in the Sequoia National Forest. BR 168.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The USFS is working to abate the hazards associated with this burned area of forest, including through the \"Bull Run\" project, which is planned to involve felling dead and dying trees along 50.2 miles of road along the east side of the Greenhorn Mountains, outside the Giant Sequoia National Monument. This project would treat up to 3,500 of the 29,000 acres in the Cedar Fire burn area. ECF No. 22-1, Declaration of Kevin B. Elliott \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Much of the USFS's reasoning regarding regulatory issues related to the Bull Run project is set forth in a Revised Decision Memo, which outlines the proposed project as one designed to \"mitigate the hazards to public safety posed by the dead and dying trees along approximately 50.2 miles of road in the project area,\" which consists of approximately 3,500 acres on the border of Tulare and Kern Counties, roughly 30 miles southeast of Porterville, CA. BR 1. The project will abate hazard trees within 300 feet of each side of the road.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hazard trees will be identified using Forest Service guidelines and will be felled if they \"could potentially strike within the road's clearing width, or could roll or slide into the clearing after they fall.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Dead, dying, or damaged trees unlikely to fall into the road will not be felled unless they present a hazard to workers, and the memo is clear that the project \"is not authorizing a 'clearcut' within 300 feet of road edges.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   BR 208 (standing dead trees within the 300-foot buffer of the road \"incapable of hitting the road prism would be left standing\"). Felled trees will be removed if they \"represent an\n   obstruction to use and maintenance within the road's clearing width,\" if leaving the tree in place will increase fuel loading, or if removal is needed for the reforestation process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Felled logs may be chipped or burned, and logs \"considered to have commercial value may be sold as saw timber, cull logs, firewood, chips, posts, and poles,\" and branches and limbs may also be sold.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Some logs \"will be left in place for habitat\" and to meet the standard under the 2004 Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment for down woody material retention.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the project will include activities to restore organic ground cover and to reforest the habitat, including planting seedlings, scattering seeds, and increasing organic ground cover by scattering limbs, branches, and chips.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pursuant to NEPA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the USFS undertook an analysis of the Bull Run project's potential effects on wildlife in an 86-page Biological Evaluation (\"BE\"), BR 157, and a 30-page Biological Assessment, BR 127. It also consulted with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which produced a 22-page Biological Opinion concerning the potential impacts of the project on species listed under the Endangered Species Act). BR 72. Under NEPA, proposed agency action need not be subject to further analysis through an Environmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\") or EA \"if there are no extraordinary circumstances related to the proposed action\" and the action fits into a categorical exclusion (\"CE\"), a category of action that the agency has determined does not have significant effects on the environment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20220.6\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The USFS determined that the project fit into three CEs, for road repair and maintenance (CE-4), timber stand and/or wildlife habitat improvement activities (CE-6), and post-fire rehabilitation activities (CE-11).

Before approving a project under an agency-adopted CE, an agency must examine whether a particular project presents \"extraordinary circumstances in which a normally excluded action may have a significant environmental effect.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.4\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The agency is directed to examine \"the degree of the potential effect of a proposed action on\" things such as \"Federally listed threatened or endangered species\" or \"Forest Service sensitive species.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20220.6\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The USFS did not find that the Bull Run project would have significant adverse impacts to the Pacific fisher or California spotted owl (\"CSO\") that would require the project to undergo further NEPA analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Pacific fisher is a \"sensitive species\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   but is not endangered or threatened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   BR 161. There are \"no [fisher] den sites in the project analysis area,\" BR 204, and research in the Sierra National Forest has shown that fishers do not use \"high severity burn areas\" at least in the immediate aftermath of a fire, though there is \"some evidence of limited foraging occurring along the burn edge.\" BR 210. Fishers appear to favor \"landscapes with more contiguous, unfrequented forests and less human activity\" and are negatively associated with road density. BR 203. Fisher are forest-interior species, and habitat near roads represents \"represent lower habitat quality due to disturbance related influences, habitat fragmentation, edge effects and collisions.\" BR 210. The existence of roads has already affected the canopy cover in the area, BR 208, and the project \"focuses its efforts to encompass areas of highest burn severity where low canopy cover and structural attributes needed for resting and denning activity are no longer present.\" BR 210. The BE determined that the fire reduced \"large woody debris\" in many areas and that the project's features to retain large woody debris would increase high-quality habitat to \"improve complexity and structure at the forest floor\" and promote a diversity of prey for the fisher. BR 209-10. \"Dead or dying trees can provide resting and denning habitat for fisher.\" BR 210. While acknowledging that the removal of some hazard trees \"could remove a den or rest tree for the fisher,\" the project would retain over 200,000 conifer-dominated snags greater than 15 inches DBH\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the project area, a figure that includes snags in untreated areas \"as well as an average of four snags per acre retained in treated areas according to the design criteria.\" BR 210.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition to the comments they submitted during the comment period, BR 385, Plaintiffs submitted supplemental comments concerning the potential effects on fisher habitat connectivity, BR 320. Plaintiffs argued that the Bull Run project is similar to the Rancheria project, where the USFS ordered a supplemental NEPA analysis in light of concerns about \"habitat fragmentation and loss of connectivity caused by the Cedar Fire.\" BR 323. They contended that the USFS undertook no supplemental analysis to ensure that the fisher population in the Southern Greenhorn Mountains was not isolated in the wake of the fire.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20220.6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Like the Pacific fisher, the CSO is sensitive but not endangered or threatened. BR 161. Also like the Pacific fisher, the CSO is a forest-interior species that is less likely to nest near roads. BR 210. The USFS undertook an analysis of the potential effects on the CSO, examining metrics including total available habitat and acres treated; estimated changes in structural characteristics of the habitat, such as canopy, snags, and large woody debris; disturbance effects; and the number of acres treated of certain habitat types and changes in percentage of relative habitat. BR 207. Field surveys conducted in the last three years identified\n   four CSO territories near the project area. Two of the four CSO territories near the project area have minimal overlap with the planned area, BR 182-83, a third has likely been abandoned, BR 184-85, 212, and the fourth\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   will have a monitor on site for any felling during the project, and if nesting owls are present, the project will be subject to a limited operating period, BR 166. Like the Pacific fisher, CSOs nest away from roads, and CSO habitat near roads is lower quality. BR 210. Accordingly, the USFS found that the Bull Run project would have limited disturbance effects and be unlikely to result in significant losses of live foliage and canopy, strong habit factors for CSO. BR 212.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With respect to CSO, Plaintiffs submitted during the comment period an evaluation prepared by Chad Hanson, Ph.D., a member of Plaintiff Earth Island Institute, that included supplemental comments and summaries of additional studies, which he believed to show that even low levels of post-fire logging within 1,500 meters of territory centers show \"severe adverse impacts\" on CSO occupancy. Pls.' MSJ at 23 (quoting BR 312).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The USFS issued the initial Decision Memo, BR 14, on August 30, 2017. The Decision Memo stated that the project was categorically excluded from further NEPA review under the CE for timber stand and/or wildlife improvement activities and the CE for post-fire rehabilitation activities. BR 17-17. Plaintiffs filed suit on September 29, 2017, contending that the Bull Run project violated NEPA by relying on CEs rather than preparing an EA or EIS and by failing to explain why the Bull Run project will not have significant effects on species in the area. ECF No. 1. On October 4, 2017, the USFS issued a Revised Decision Memo, which added the road-maintenance CE to the list of CEs the USFS intended to rely on. Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on October 9, 2017, ECF No. 10, which the Court denied in a written order dated November 17, 2017, ECF No. 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The plaintiffs challenged the ordinance under the U.S. and California Constitutions and various state and federal statutes. The complaint alleged that the challenged ordinance violated due process but did not allege that it was unconstitutionally vague. After the close of discovery and shortly\n   before the filing of cross-motions for summary judgment, plaintiffs' counsel informed defense counsel that they planned to challenge the ordinance of vagueness grounds, and the parties subsequently briefed the issue in their cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court declined to address the vagueness challenge because it was absent from the operative complaint. The Ninth Circuit held that the court should have construed the vagueness argument as a motion to amend the complaint and that the refusal to consider the merits of the vagueness claim was an abuse of discretion. In so doing, it cited both Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) and 15(b). Today, Rule 15(a) applies to \"Amendments Before Trial,\" while Rule 15(b) applies to \"Amendments During and After Trial.\" The Ninth Circuit quoted cases\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   that cited Rule 15(b) prior to the 2007 amendments to Rule 15.\n   <em>\n    Nat.

First, there is no evidence of bad faith. Second, the delay appears to have been the product of an oversight, and one that the Plaintiffs were not alone in failing to catch. Though the operative complaint did not mention CE-4, all parties litigated it at the preliminary injunction stage and again in the summary judgment briefing. There is no undue delay in raising the issue, and there will be no undue delay in litigating it. Third, there is no prejudice to Defendants. The operative complaint alleges that Federal Defendants failed to abide by NEPA because\n   none of the categorical exclusions the USFS identified exempts the action from further NEPA review and that the USFS has failed to explain that the potential effects on certain species will be insignificant. After the USFS issued the Revised Decision Memo on October 4, 2017, the parties litigated the motion for a preliminary injunction, filed October 9, 2017, as if CE-4 were part of the complaint and fully briefed the cross-motions for summary judgment again as if CE-4 were part of the complaint until mentioning in two sentences in the Federal Defendants' reply brief that the central issue in the litigation was not actually among the CEs mentioned in the complaint. Where Defendants \"had ample notice ... and the issue did not require further discovery,\" then the parties \"fully argued\" the issue in their summary judgment briefing, any claim of prejudice rings hollow.\n   <em>\n    Desertrain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054957\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/1147/#p1154\">\n    754 F.3d at 1155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kobold v.

They take aim at the use of the road-maintenance CE for a timber sale. The crux of the dispute between the parties is whether the removal and commercial sale of hazard trees along 52.1 miles of road may properly be classified as \"road maintenance.\" Among other things, Plaintiffs contend that CE-13 (quoted above) limits the acreage of any salvage operation the USFS may cover under a CE (and therefore exempt from normal NEPA requirements).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiffs principally rely on a 2008 case from the Central District of California,\n   <em>\n    Los Padres Forestwatch v. U.S. Forest Service\n   </em>\n   , No. CV-08-845-GW (MANx) (C.D. Cal. July 3, 2008), ECF No. 10-12, the only case that squarely addresses Plaintiffs' contention that CE-13 limits the acreage\n   of salvage operations USFS may cover under a CE. The\n   <em>\n    Los Padres\n   </em>\n   decision, which is unpublished, rejected a plan similar to the one at issue here, where the USFS sought to rely on the road-maintenance CE for a project that included commercial salvage of dead trees near roads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Los Padres\n   </em>\n   court found unreasonable USFS's conclusion that the commercial salvage of dead trees along roadsides fell under the road maintenance CE rather than the salvage CE, reasoning that the salvage CE limited the number of acres that could be treated through salvage operations under a CE. ECF No. 10-12,\n   <em>\n    Los Padres\n   </em>\n   slip opinion, at 15-19. The district court was unpersuaded by the USFS's argument that CE-13 did not apply to maintenance along roadsides because the major environmental effect occurred when roads went in, such that salvage activities near roadsides had different potential environmental effects than salvage away from roadsides. The court emphasized that the salvage CE has no restrictions concerning the\n   <em>\n    type\n   </em>\n   of land (roadside v. non-roadside) but does contain two other types of restrictions: (1) that no more than 250 acres be affected and (2) that there be \"no more than \u00bd mile of temporary road construction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1733551\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/189/851/#p857\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 16 n.19.\n   <em>\n    Los Padres\n   </em>\n   concluded that because the agency determined that acreage\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   matter when undertaking salvage logging, the agency is not free to ignore that determination by selecting a different CE that makes no mention of salvage logging.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   However, other district-court opinions both predating and postdating\n   <em>\n    Los Padres\n   </em>\n   upheld the use of the road-maintenance CE in similar circumstances.

Mont. June 4, 2014), the court granted summary judgment to the USFS in a case involving the commercial salvage of fire-damaged hazard trees along roadways. At issue was the USFS's authorization of the removal of dead or dying fire-damaged hazard trees along 15 miles of existing roads in the Gallatin National Forest. Salvage logging of hazard trees was permitted within 150 feet of roads and was planned to occur on approximately 300 acres of burned land but could affect up to 730 acres. The district court held that the USFS's determination that the project fell within the road-maintenance CE was not clearly erroneous:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Here, the Forest Service determined the Project fell within the categorical exclusion for \"[r]epair and maintenance of roads.\" 36 C.F.R. 220.6(d)(4).

Removing dead trees within 500 feet of the boundaries of administrative sites can generally be said to relate to administrative sites. But the examples given (e.g., mowing lawns, replacing roofs) are far more modest than removing dead trees within a 500 foot swath. Similarly, removing dead trees within 200 feet of roads and 100 feet of trails relates generally to the repair and maintenance of roads and trails. Again though, the examples given are far more modest than the action proposed here (grading a road, pruning vegetation). And, removing dead trees within 500 feet of recreation sites generally relates to the repair and maintenance of recreation sites and facilities. But again, the examples given are far more narrow (applying insecticides and repaving a parking lot). If we were deciding this issue\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , we might have concluded that the action proposed by the roads and trails decision, while within the general description of the categorical exclusions, is far more expansive than the examples given and thus the exclusions would not apply. But we are not reviewing this\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . We must give the agency's interpretation controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the terms used in the categorical exclusion.

In the Project Initiation Letter issued four days later, on February 21, 2017, Mr. La Price identified that the twin goals of the project were \"to mitigate the hazard to public safety posed by the dead and dying trees along roads in the Cedar Fire area and to perform reforestation work in the area,\" BR 267, and wrote that \"[b]ased on the current issues and anticipated effects, the Responsible Official has decided we will begin analyzing this proposal as one that can be excluded from documentation\" through use of a CE.

MSJ at 14. As this Court held in the Preliminary Injunction Order, \"[t]he fact that USFS cast a wide net to expand its sample size for determining an appropriate acreage limitation for CE-13 does not change the legal analysis herein that concludes that nothing precludes USFS from applying an overlapping CE to a project that might, if smaller in size, also qualify under CE-13.\" ECF No. 29 at 15 n.5.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2044598\">\n    68 Fed.

In addition, Plaintiffs' argument that the USFS must only have intended to include projects that would not fit under another CE is belied by the presence of the \"Squaw Creek Fuels Reduction\" and \"Loop Road Visuals/Fuel Reduction CE\" projects in the dataset, both of which fall under CE-10, the fuel-reductions CE. ECF No. 24-3 at 1, 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Plaintiffs also rely on two roadside hazard projects for which the USFS elected not to rely on the road-maintenance CE as further evidence that reliance on that CE here is contrary to agency practice. They first point to the Lucas Creek Project, a project in Sequoia National Forest that would \"remove hazard trees along roads and properties adjoining the Breckenridge Subdivision\" and \"also reduce fuels build-up to protect the community and the Lucas Creek upper and middle watershed from high-intensity fire.\" ECF No. 24-4. The project planned to treat 250 acres of land and invoked the salvage CE.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2044598\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The second is the Piute Roadside Hazard Project, a project involving a \"commercial timber sale to remove hazard trees for safety purposes along approximately 32 miles of roads affected by the 2008 Piute Fire,\" for which the USFS prepared an EA. BR 403. Neither of these examples is particularly instructive. That the Lucas Creek Project proceeded under the salvage CE demonstrates only that a project under 250 acres may be exempt from further NEPA review under the salvage CE, not that it could not\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   fit under the road-maintenance CE. As discussed above, CEs may overlap; that\n   the Lucas Creek Project fit into one CE does not mean that it could not also have fit into another one. The Piute Roadside Hazard Project is also not very edifying. That project included elements not present here, such as \"jackpot burning\" (in areas where fuel loading exceeds 10 tons/acre) on 22 of the 32 miles of treated land, which the EA describes as a process that \"involves igniting concentrations of fuels on the forest floor, whether they are natural fuels or fuels resulting from treatments.\" BR 404 n.3. It is not clear why the USFS elected to proceed with an EA for this project.

Pls.' MSJ at 19. Plaintiff Sequoia ForestKeeper submitted supplemental comments for the Bull Run project, raising concerns that the loss of habitat connectivity resulting from the Cedar Fire, in combination with the Bull Run and Spear Creek projects, could result in significant effects on the fisher population.
