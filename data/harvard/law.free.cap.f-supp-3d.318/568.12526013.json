Haidon (\"Plaintiff\"), proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , commenced this action on April 21, 2017, against Defendants Budlong &amp; Budlong, LLC (the \"Budlong firm\"), Culver Michael Budlong (\"Budlong\"), Laura E. D'Addabbo (\"D'Addabbo\"), Daryl S. Haberern (\"Haberern\"), and Lindy S. Nolan (\"Nolan\") (collectively, \"Defendants\"), seeking compensatory and punitive damages for various state and federal claims arising from Defendants' legal representation of Plaintiff in both a marriage dissolution and child custody matter and a personal injury action against her now-former husband in Connecticut state court. (Dkt. 1). Presently before the Court is Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction, and pursuant to\n   Rules 12(b)(4) and 12(b)(5) for insufficient process and service of process. (Dkt. 4). Defendants also move, in the alternative, to transfer venue to the District of Connecticut pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). For the following reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted, and Plaintiff's complaint is dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are drawn from Plaintiff's complaint and its exhibits unless otherwise noted. The Budlong firm is a Connecticut-based law firm that is registered with the Connecticut Secretary of State and maintains its primary place of business in Hartford, Connecticut. (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 2). Plaintiff further asserts that Budlong, D'Addabbo, Haberern, and Nolan are all residents of the State of Connecticut. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2). According to an affidavit submitted by Budlong,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   he is the founding member of the Budlong firm, which is a Connecticut Limited Liability Company. (Dkt. 4-4 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2). Nolan is a receptionist for the firm, while D'Addabbo is an attorney formerly employed with the firm and Haberern is a paralegal also formerly employed with the firm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 26, 2015, Plaintiff retained Defendants to represent her in a pending marriage dissolution and child custody matter against her now-former husband in Connecticut Superior Court. (Dkt. 1 at 6). Initially, Defendants directed Plaintiff to sign a retainer contract reflecting a $10,000 fee in contemplation of resolving the matter by agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24). However, after contacting opposing counsel, Defendants directed Plaintiff to sign an amended retainer contract reflecting a $25,000 fee to conduct a two-day trial to resolve the matter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The trial was scheduled to commence on April 23, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After retaining Defendants for the pending marriage dissolution and child custody proceedings, Plaintiff initiated a separate personal injury action against her now-former husband in Connecticut Superior Court on March 18, 2015, in which she was again represented by Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). Despite billing Plaintiff for significant time allegedly spent on consultation, research, and preparation, Defendants took no action to pursue the personal injury matter on Plaintiff's behalf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 14, 2015, Budlong attended a pre-trial hearing regarding the marriage dissolution and child custody matter with opposing counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant instructed her not to attend the pre-trial hearing and that the trial would begin as previously scheduled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 22, 2015, Plaintiff paid to fly a witness from California to Defendants' office for a full day of trial preparation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32). Defendants subsequently billed Plaintiff for their time and efforts in preparing the witness for trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants also billed Plaintiff for documents created in preparation of the trial; however, no trial documents were filed by Defendants with the Connecticut Superior Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 32, 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 23, 2015, the trial commenced as scheduled. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    at \u00b6 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Less than an hour into the trial testimony, and while Plaintiff was testifying, opposing counsel claimed that she needed to take an emergency personal phone call. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Budlong asked the state court judge if the parties\n   could take their morning recess, and Budlong's request was granted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32 (trial transcript) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff alleges that after a one-hour recess, Budlong returned to the courthouse to intimidate, threaten, and coerce her into signing a separation agreement, which was apparently drafted by Defendants and opposing counsel during the morning recess. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that she repeatedly stated-in front of multiple witnesses-that she did not want to sign the agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40). Plaintiff further alleges that Budlong berated her after her father contacted her on her cell phone to advise her not to sign the agreement, and that Budlong made racially insensitive comments about Plaintiff's three-year-old daughter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 41-43). Budlong also allegedly threatened to withdraw as Plaintiff's counsel if she did not sign the separation agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46). Additionally, Budlong allegedly instructed Plaintiff to tell the state court judge that she fully understood what she had signed and was not coerced in any way. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff eventually signed the separation agreement \"under extreme duress from her own counsel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44). After the court proceedings resumed, Budlong informed the state court judge that a \"Ms. Richter,\" who was present in the courtroom, had interfered with a conversation he was having with Plaintiff during the recess, and that this individual had claimed that Budlong was coercing Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39). Shortly thereafter, the state court judge ordered that all witnesses be sequestered from the courtroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41). While Ms. Richter was not a witness, she was also escorted out of the courtroom after repeatedly ignoring the state court judge's requests for her to take a seat. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42-43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently testified that she had not been coerced into signing the separation agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49-50, 55). Plaintiff alleges that the first time she became aware that Defendants had previously discussed the separation agreement with the state court judge was during the judge's colloquy with Plaintiff's now-former husband. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 35-36;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The state court judge accepted the separation agreement and entered it as a court order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the separation agreement was not prepared with either her or her minor child's best interests in mind. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12). Among other things, Plaintiff complains that the separation agreement contained no language to differentiate between the \"physical custody\" and the \"legal custody\" of her child, contained conflicting and vague language regarding the primary residence of Plaintiff's child, failed to secure any financial support for Plaintiff and her child, and forced Plaintiff to withdraw her personal injury lawsuit against her now-former husband and prevented her from filing a similar action in the future. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff contacted Budlong on several occasions after April 23, 2015, to express her concerns with the separation agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63). Budlong allegedly continued to verbally abuse Plaintiff and instructed her not to call him again. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Nolan later informed Plaintiff that Budlong would no longer take her calls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64). Subsequently, Plaintiff received a bill from Defendants of over $50,000 for costs accrued during their legal representation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to Budlong's affidavit, Defendants terminated their representation of Plaintiff in May of 2015, after the marriage dissolution and child custody matter had been resolved. (Dkt. 4-4 at \u00b6 7). Throughout the pendency of that matter-and at all times relevant to Plaintiff's claims of wrongful conduct in this action-Plaintiff and her now-former husband resided in Connecticut. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    at \u00b6 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Plaintiff has since relocated to New York, but she did not leave the State of Connecticut until after her family law matter was resolved. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants provided no legal services to Plaintiff since she began residing in New York State. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Budlong also maintains that the Budlong firm transacts all of its business from a single office located in Hartford, Connecticut, and that the firm neither has a physical office or mailing address in New York, nor does it utilize a New York telephone number or fax number. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9). Additionally, Budlong maintains that the Budlong firm's website does not affirmatively advertise legal services to or solicit business from New York State citizens, and that the firm has no legal matters pending in New York courts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11). Budlong has never been licensed to practice law in New York, and neither was D'Addabbo during her employment at the Budlong firm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14). Only one attorney at the firm, who is not named in this lawsuit, is licensed to practice law in New York State, but has, in fact, never done so since joining the Budlong firm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12). Finally, Budlong asserts that all of the Budlong firm's attorneys and employees reside in Connecticut. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on April 21, 2017. (Dkt. 1). By Order, dated May 24, 2017, the Court granted Plaintiff leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and screened Plaintiffs complaint pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2). (Dkt. 3). Additionally, the Court ordered the Clerk of Court to cause the United States Marshals Service to serve Plaintiff's summons and complaint upon Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On August 30, 2017, service of the summons and complaint was executed upon Rebecca Peters (\"Peters\")-the Budlong firm's administrative assistant (Dkt. 4-5)-on behalf of the Budlong firm, Budlong, and Nolan (Dkt. 8). Accordingly, service was made upon those defendants 131 days after the filing of Plaintiff's complaint. There is no indication in the record that service of the summons and complaint was ever successfully executed upon the firm's former employees-D'Addabbo or Haberern. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4). According to Budlong's and Peters's affidavits, Peters was not authorized to accept service on behalf of the Budlong firm, Budlong, or Nolan. (Dkt. 4-4 at \u00b6 21; Dkt. 4-5 at \u00b6\u00b6 8-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On September 19, 2017, Defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss. (Dkt. 4). On September 20, 2017, the Court issued a motion scheduling order directing Plaintiff to submit a response to Defendants' motion by October 17, 2017, and informing Plaintiff that her claims may be dismissed without a trial if she did not respond to the motion. (Dkt. 6). Plaintiff has failed to file a response to Defendants' motion, and she has since taken no further action in this case. The Court now turns to address Defendants' unopposed motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Standard for an Unopposed Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"When, as here, the Court is presented with an unopposed motion, it may not find for the moving party without reviewing the record and determining whether there is sufficient basis for granting the motion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Emerson v.

Indeed, it appears that any witnesses or other evidence supportive of the alleged misconduct would likely be located in Connecticut. However, Plaintiff never filed any opposition papers to Defendants' motion, and she has taken no action in this case for nearly nine months. Since Defendants argue for a transfer of venue in the alternative\n   only, and Plaintiff has failed to respond to Defendants' motion in any way, the Court chooses to dismiss the complaint and declines to exercise its discretion to transfer the case to the District of Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss (Dkt. 4) is granted for lack of personal jurisdiction, and Plaintiff's complaint (Dkt. 1) is dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    A court may take into account factual materials outside the pleadings when considering a motion to dismiss based upon an asserted lack of personal jurisdiction or insufficient service of process.\n    <em>\n     Blau v.
