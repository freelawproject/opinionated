Apr. 2, 2018) ( <em>AFGE III</em> ). The Court, accordingly, will only briefly describe the factual and procedural background here.</p><p id=\"p-11\">A. <em>Factual History</em></p><p id=\"p-12\">AFGE is a national labor organization representing over 1000 federal and D.C. government employees. <em>See</em> ECF No. 36 (Amended Complaint), \u00b6 2. The National Executive Council (NEC) consists of three full-time national officers-National President, National Secretary-Treasurer (NST), and National Vice-President for Women and Fair Practices-and National Vice-Presidents for each of the twelve AFGE districts. <em>Id.</em>, \u00b6 3. Hudson was elected to two consecutive three-year terms as NST beginning in 2012. <em>Id.</em>, \u00b6 7. The Union will hold its triennial convention in August 2018, where Convention delegates will elect the national officers. <em>Id.</em>, \u00b6 8.</p><p id=\"p-13\">On August 19, 2016, Hudson sent his assistant a letter declaring his intent to run for national office at the upcoming Convention-which was later forwarded to AFGE's General Counsel-but he did not specify a particular position. <em>Id.</em>, Exh. 6 (Committee of Investigation File) at 10. Three subsequent communications from Plaintiff to AFGE members form the crux of the disagreement between the parties.</p><p id=\"p-14\">Using AFGE-supplied mailing labels, he first sent a letter announcing his still-unspecified candidacy to AFGE local officers on August 26, and he followed that up with a postcard to the same group of people in October using mailing labels he purchased from AFGE. <em>Id.</em> at 7-8, 11, 13; Amend. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. In November, one week after the American presidential election, Hudson directed an AFGE staff member to send his third communication: an email to a group of AFGE members detailing his views about the incoming Trump administration. <em>Id.</em>, \u00b6 32. He warned that the new administration would have a \"bull's eye planted on the backs of federal workers and the unions that represent them\" and questioned whether AFGE was \"ready for this assault.\" <em>Id.</em>, \u00b6 31.</p><p id=\"p-15\">B. <em>Procedural History</em></p><p id=\"p-16\">Nearly one month later, on December 21, 2016, National Vice-President Keith Hill filed an internal charge against Plaintiff. <em>Id.</em>, \u00b6 39. Hill asserted that Hudson had violated their Constitution by: (1) sending the August 2016 letter; (2) sending <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"10\" href=\"#p10\" id=\"p10\">*10</a>the October 2016 postcard; (3) maintaining a public website containing Union information; (4) directing his subordinate to send the November 15 email; and (5) referring to an AFGE staff member as the \"Nigerian Nightmare\" at a training. <em>Id.</em></p><p id=\"p-17\">Pursuant to Article 13 of the AFGE Constitution, a Committee of Investigation was appointed on February 7, 2017, to consider the charges. Out of the five charges, the COI recommended that the NEC proceed only on the charge related to the post-election email, \"find[ing] probable cause exists for the specific charge of malfeasance of office.\" Amend. Compl., Exh. 11 (COI Findings) at 1. Despite Hudson's request that several NEC members be recused for potential bias, the full NEC adopted the Committee's report, deliberated, and found Hudson guilty of the referred charge. <em>Id.</em>, Exh. 15. It then voted to remove him from his position as NST but did not restrict his Union membership rights. <em>Id.</em>, \u00b6 55. Hudson has appealed the ruling to the National Convention, which, as noted, will take place this August. <em>Id.</em>, \u00b6 59.</p><p id=\"p-18\">Hudson then filed this suit, following his Complaint with a preliminary-injunction motion. <em>See</em> ECF Nos. 1, 4. After the Court granted the injunction on the ground of bias and ordered him reinstated, the Union convened another COI to reprocess the charges against Plaintiff without tainted members. Before those proceedings had concluded, however, Plaintiff withdrew the count upon which the Court had relied in its injunction, leading it to vacate that Opinion and Hudson's reinstatement. <em>See</em> Minute Order, Jan. 12, 2018. AFGE then filed a motion to dismiss, and Hudson followed shortly after with another motion for preliminary injunction. <em>See</em> ECF Nos. 21, 30. The Court largely granted the former and then denied the latter as moot. <em>See</em> <em>AFGE II</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523246\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/121/#p123\">289 F.Supp.3d at </extracted-citation>130-31 ; Minute Order, Feb. 7, 2018.</p><p id=\"p-19\">The internal Union machinery, meanwhile, plodded on. The second COI found, in addition to the violations via the November 2016 email, probable cause existed that Hudson had \"violated AFGE Policy and Practice\" in sending the August 2016 letter, and it referred both of those charges to the NEC. <em>See</em> COI File at 1. On February 6, 2018, the NEC found that Hudson had violated the AFGE Constitution in obtaining mailing labels for his August missive without announcing his candidacy for a specific office. The NEC also concluded that the November email was \"campaign literature[,] as it was his third mass distribution in the brief period following his\" candidacy announcement. <em>See</em> ECF No. 35-1 (NEC Decision). Because the November email \"focused on a political topic,\" and he directed a Union staff member to distribute it \"on AFGE's email server and computer system at the [U]nion's cost,\" the NEC determined that Hudson had violated the AFGE Constitution and Department of Labor regulations. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523246\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/121/#p123\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> The Council then voted to suspend him from office as NST for the rest of his term.</p><p id=\"p-20\">Focusing on this second removal, Hudson filed an Amended Complaint with the Court's permission, and a third motion for preliminary injunction, which the Court denied. <em>See</em> <em>AFGE III</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524977\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/308/121/#p123\">308 F.Supp.3d at 131-32</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201587473\">2018 WL 1587473</extracted-citation>, at *8. AFGE now moves to dismiss the Amended Complaint.</p><p id=\"p-21\"><strong>II. Legal Standard</strong></p><p id=\"p-22\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) provides for the dismissal of an action where a complaint fails \"to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" In evaluating Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, the Court must \"treat the complaint's factual allegations as true ... and must grant [P]laintiff 'the benefit of all inferences that <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"11\" href=\"#p11\" id=\"p11\">*11</a>can be derived from the facts alleged.' \" <em>Sparrow v.

Cir. 2005).</p><p id=\"p-25\"><strong>III. Analysis</strong></p><p id=\"p-26\">The Amended Complaint lists four causes of action. Counts I and II allege that the Union violated Plaintiff's rights under the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) when it removed him in August 2017 and February 2018, respectively. Counts III and IV allege that the Union acted contrary to its Constitution, violating the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA) and D.C. law, respectively. The Court evaluates each below.</p><p id=\"p-29\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"12\" href=\"#p12\" id=\"p12\">*12</a>so long as the speech does not run afoul of the union's \"reasonable rules as to the responsibility of every member toward the organization ... and to his refraining from conduct that would interfere with its performance of its legal or contractual obligations.\" <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411</extracted-citation>(a)(2). The Union based the first removal on the November 2016 email and the second on both that email and the August 2016 letter. <em>See</em> Amend. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 84, 126, 139. For both, Defendant admits that the communications were protected speech but contends that Plaintiff cannot state an LMRDA claim because the removal decisions were based on <em>conduct</em>, not speech.</p><p id=\"p-30\">1. <em>August Letter</em></p><p id=\"p-31\">As a reminder, the charge related to the August letter was that Hudson had not properly obtained the mailing labels to send that missive. AFGE national officers are elected by delegates, and the NST provides \"[a]ll declared candidates for national offices ... [o]ne set of mailing labels\" with the names and addresses of the delegates. <em><extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">,</extracted-citation> Exh. 8 (AFGE Constitution), App. A, Part II, \u00a7\u00a7 1(c), 4(b). A candidate may request additional sets, but must purchase them. <em><extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">,</extracted-citation> \u00a7 4(b)(2). Hudson alleges that he followed this protocol in sending his August letter to local delegates. <em>See</em> Amend. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 17-23. On August 19, he sent his executive assistant a letter proclaiming his \"official notification of [his] candidacy for national officer at the 2018 National Convention.\" COI File at 9-10. One week later, he mailed a letter announcing his candidacy \"using the free set of address labels provided by AFGE.\" Amend. Compl., \u00b6 22.</p><p id=\"p-33\">Defendant's argument, however, requires the Court to determine who is a declared candidate for office under the AFGE Constitution, an inappropriate task for a motion to dismiss. Taking the facts in the Amended Complaint as true and giving Hudson the benefit of all inferences, the plain language of the Constitution says that the NST must provide a free set of labels to all declared candidates, and Plaintiff alleges that he followed the rules by sending his assistant his declaration. <em>See</em> Amend. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 19, 133. Hudson's allegations that he was improperly disciplined for such conduct are thus sufficient to state an LMRDA claim.</p><p id=\"p-35\">Hudson likewise passes the 12(b)(6) pleading bar by alleging that his November email could not serve as the predicate for a removal decision without violating the LMRDA. Shortly after the American presidential election, Hudson directed his subordinate, an AFGE employee, to send a three-and-a-half-page email to a large number of AFGE members using an AFGE computer and email account. As Defendant concedes that this email was \"protected speech,\" Amend. Compl., \u00b6 77, it must show that the email contravened a \"reasonable rule\" of the Union or a Department of Labor regulation to escape liability. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411</extracted-citation>(a)(2). Because both AFGE rules and Labor regulations prohibit any use of union resources <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"13\" href=\"#p13\" id=\"p13\">*13</a>\"to promote the candidacy of any candidate in a[ ] [union] election,\" <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20481\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481</extracted-citation>(g), if Hudson's email was campaign speech, it would not be protected under the LMRDA, and a removal decision could be appropriate.</p><p id=\"p-36\">A motion to dismiss, once again, is generally not the appropriate place to decide whether a communication constitutes campaign literature because that is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>See</em> <em>Dole v. Drywall Tapers &amp; Finishers Local Union 1976</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7395954\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/733/864/#p866\">733 F.Supp. 864</extracted-citation>, 866 (D.N.J. 1990) (finding facts and then holding \"as a matter of law\" that union mailing was campaign literature).

At the preliminary-injunction stage, the Court held that the email would likely be considered campaign material. <em>See</em> <em>AFGE III</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524977\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/308/121/#p123\">308 F.Supp.3d at 126-30</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201587473\">2018 WL 1587473</extracted-citation>, at *4-6. In so holding, however, the Court could only consider the record before it and did not presume Plaintiff's allegations true, as it must here. In light of the facts alleged in the complaint and the language on the face of the email itself, Hudson's claim that it is not campaign material is certainly not <em>implausible</em>. <em>See</em> <em>Iqbal</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">556 U.S. at 678</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">129 S.Ct. 1937</extracted-citation> (complaint need only state facially plausible claim to survive motion to dismiss); <em>Doe 1 v.

At this stage that is all that is required: discovery could well bring to light additional facts that could affect the Court's (or a jury's) ultimate finding as to nature of the November email. Because Plaintiff has stated a plausible claim that the Union's cited reasons for his discharge were retaliatory in violation of the LMRDA, Counts I and II withstand the Motion.</p><p id=\"p-39\">Plaintiff next alleges in Count III that AFGE breached its contract with him via his removal and thereby violated the Labor Management Relations Act. Section 301 of that Act provides a federal cause of action for suits alleging a \"violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees ... or between any such labor organizations.\" <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185</extracted-citation>(a). In <em>AFGE II</em> the Court <em>sua sponte</em> raised doubts about whether it had jurisdiction to hear this claim because Hudson is not an employer or a labor organization. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523246\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/121/#p123\">289 F.Supp.3d at 130</extracted-citation>. In ruling on the third preliminary-injunction motion, the Court remained unpersuaded that federal court was the proper place for this claim given Hudson's summary briefing on the issue, which argued in essence that \"just as AFGE can apply Article XIII and XXIII to discipline him, he can sue AFGE for violating the rights the Constitution bestows on all members.\" ECF No. 37 at 32; <em>see</em> <em>AFGE III</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524977\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/308/121/#p123\">308 F.Supp.3d at 130-31</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201587473\">2018 WL 1587473</extracted-citation>, at *7. In opposing the latest Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff now makes clear that he is not attempting to sue on behalf of his local, but as a third-party beneficiary of the AFGE Constitution, which, as the Court already determined, is a \"contract[ ] ... between ... labor organizations.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201587473\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> Given this new formulation, the Court agrees that it has jurisdiction to hear the claim.</p><p id=\"p-40\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"14\" href=\"#p14\" id=\"p14\">*14</a>The key decision here, <em>Wooddell v.

The Supreme Court found it \"clear\" that Wooddell had \"charged a violation of a contract between two unions within the meaning of \u00a7 301\" because his complaint alleged (and the local conceded) that the local had failed to abide by a section of the international union contract requiring locals to comply with the collective-bargaining contract. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218947\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/93/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218947\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/93/\"> at 100</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218947\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/93/\">112 S.Ct. 494</extracted-citation>.

That is so even though he seeks to vindicate an individual right, rather than a breach by one of the parties of the Constitution.</p><p id=\"p-42\">Not all unions are covered by the LMRA. The Act borrows definitions from the National Labor Relations Act, which defines a \"labor organization\" as \"any organization ... in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers.\" <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20152\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152</extracted-citation>(5). The NLRA-and LMRA by extension-specifically limits the term \"employer\" to the private sector. <em><extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20152\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> \u00a7 152(2) (\"The term 'employer' ... shall not include the United States or any wholly owned Government corporation.\"). Courts have thus uniformly held that, because a public-sector union is not a \"labor organization\" under the LMRA, it may not bring a \u00a7 301 claim, and neither may public employees. <em>See</em> <em>Cunningham v. Local 30, Int'l Union of Op. Engrs.</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2155794\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/234/383/#p395\">234 F.Supp.2d 383</extracted-citation>, 395-96 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (collecting cases).</p><p id=\"p-43\">Hudson, however, is <em>not</em> a public employee but was, until his ouster, a full-time AFGE employee. <em>See</em> AFGE Const., art. VII, \u00a7 1(b). AFGE, moreover, is a \"mixed union,\" meaning it represents both private- and public-sector employees. The Department of Labor and this Circuit have interpreted the LMRDA, but not the LMRA, to apply to mixed unions. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20451.3\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 451.3</extracted-citation>(a)(4) ; <em>Wildberger v.

Because the two statutes define \"labor organization\" in functionally equivalent terms, however, the Court finds that the LMRA also applies to mixed unions. <em>Compare</em> <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20402\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 402</extracted-citation>(i) (\" 'Labor organization' means a labor organization engaged in an industry affecting commerce ... in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers.\"), <em>with</em> <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20152\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152</extracted-citation>(5). It is thus irrelevant that Plaintiff's home local does not qualify as a labor organization. He is suing for a breach of the AFGE Constitution, and at least some of the signatory locals to that contract represent private employees.</p><p id=\"p-44\">Moving to the merits, AFGE alternatively argues that Plaintiff has not \"allege[d] any facts to demonstrate that <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"15\" href=\"#p15\" id=\"p15\">*15</a>AFGE violated its Constitution.\" MTD at 22. That is plainly untrue. The Amended Complaint alleges that AFGE violated its Constitution by: 1) including biased members in both COIs; 2) allowing its GC to \"essentially bec[o]me the prosecutor\" during the second NEC hearing; 3) \"basing its decision on facts not in the administrative file\"; and 4) exceeding the scope of the original charge. <em>See</em> Amend. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 168-69, 171, 175, 179. \"[D]etailed factual allegations\" are not required to withstand a motion to dismiss, and Plaintiff has provided \"sufficient ... factual content that allows the [C]ourt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" <em>Iqbal</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">556 U.S. at 678</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">129 S.Ct. 1937</extracted-citation> (citation omitted).</p><p id=\"p-45\">Defendant's attempt to heighten the pleading standard by insisting that the Court must defer to a union's interpretation of its constitution likewise fails. <em>See</em> MTD at 28. While \"[a]n interpretation of a union constitution rendered by officials of a labor organization is entitled to considerable deference,\" <em>Monzillo v. Biller</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"581337,3799138\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/735/1456/\">735 F.2d 1456</extracted-citation>, 1458 (D.C. Cir. 1984), that deference is not unyielding, and a court may decline to adopt the union's interpretation if it is \"unreasonable or made in bad faith.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"581337,3799138\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/735/1456/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> Whether the Union's interpretations meet that standard is beyond the scope of a motion to dismiss, which tests only the sufficiency of the complaint. <em>See</em> <em>Sickle v.

Cir. 2018). For now, at least, Count III survives.</p><p id=\"p-47\">Count IV alleges that AFGE's constitutional breaches violated D.C. law. As Plaintiff concedes, \"If the Court asserts jurisdiction over\" Count III, Count IV is \"preempted.\" Opp. at 34. The <em>Wooddell</em> Court's animating reason in allowing union members to sue for breach of contract in federal court was to prevent potentially inconsistent interpretations of union contract terms in state and federal courts. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218947\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/93/\">502 U.S. at 102</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218947\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/93/\">112 S.Ct. 494</extracted-citation>. As a result, state-law claims that \"purport[ ] to define the meaning or scope of a term in a contract suit therefore [are] pre-empted by federal labor law.\" <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp. v.
