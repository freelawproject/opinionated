They both allege that Plaintiff's discharge was in retaliation for exercising his statutory free-speech rights, which, in turn, is a violation of the LMRDA. That Act protects a union member's \"right to ... express any views, arguments, or opinions,\"\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-32\">\n     AFGE claims that this did not follow Union protocol. Because he was the incumbent NST, the Union argues that he should have sent his candidacy declaration to the General Counsel to ensure that \"he was a properly declared candidate.\" MTD at 16. It further contends that he, in fact, was not a \"properly declared candidate\" when he sent the August letter because he had \"failed to state for which office he was running.\"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     Based on this conduct, AFGE maintains that Hudson's removal was valid because \"[w]ithout an explanation from the Plaintiff for how he properly obtained the mailing labels, the NEC made an adverse inference that [he] did not properly follow AFGE's procedures for acquiring mailing labels.\"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-34\">\n     2.\n     <em>\n      November Email\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-38\">\n     B.\n     <em>\n      Count III\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-41\">\n     AFGE tries to resist this conclusion, arguing that Hudson does not have standing to bring an LMRA claim because his home local represents only\n     <em>\n      public\n     </em>\n     employees.

This case has now wound its way through three preliminary-injunction motions, a motion to dismiss, and an amended complaint. In this iteration of the litigation, AFGE again moves to dismiss.

The National Executive Council (NEC) consists of three full-time national officers-National President, National Secretary-Treasurer (NST), and National Vice-President for Women and Fair Practices-and National Vice-Presidents for each of the twelve AFGE districts.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      , \u00b6 3. Hudson was elected to two consecutive three-year terms as NST beginning in 2012.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      , \u00b6 7. The Union will hold its triennial convention in August 2018, where Convention delegates will elect the national officers.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      , \u00b6 8.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      On August 19, 2016, Hudson sent his assistant a letter declaring his intent to run for national office at the upcoming Convention-which was later forwarded to AFGE's General Counsel-but he did not specify a particular position.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      , Exh. 6 (Committee of Investigation File) at 10. Three subsequent communications from Plaintiff to AFGE members form the crux of the disagreement between the parties.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-14\">\n      Using AFGE-supplied mailing labels, he first sent a letter announcing his still-unspecified candidacy to AFGE local officers on August 26, and he followed that up with a postcard to the same group of people in October using mailing labels he purchased from AFGE.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 7-8, 11, 13; Amend. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. In November, one week after the American presidential election, Hudson directed an AFGE staff member to send his third communication: an email to a group of AFGE members detailing his views about the incoming Trump administration.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      , \u00b6 32. He warned that the new administration would have a \"bull's eye planted on the backs of federal workers and the unions that represent them\" and questioned whether AFGE was \"ready for this assault.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      , \u00b6 31.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-15\">\n      B.\n      <em>\n       Procedural History\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-16\">\n      Nearly one month later, on December 21, 2016, National Vice-President Keith Hill filed an internal charge against Plaintiff.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      , \u00b6 39. Hill asserted that Hudson had violated their Constitution by: (1) sending the August 2016 letter; (2) sending\n      the October 2016 postcard; (3) maintaining a public website containing Union information; (4) directing his subordinate to send the November 15 email; and (5) referring to an AFGE staff member as the \"Nigerian Nightmare\" at a training.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-17\">\n      Pursuant to Article 13 of the AFGE Constitution, a Committee of Investigation was appointed on February 7, 2017, to consider the charges. Out of the five charges, the COI recommended that the NEC proceed only on the charge related to the post-election email, \"find[ing] probable cause exists for the specific charge of malfeasance of office.\" Amend. Compl., Exh. 11 (COI Findings) at 1. Despite Hudson's request that several NEC members be recused for potential bias, the full NEC adopted the Committee's report, deliberated, and found Hudson guilty of the referred charge.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      , Exh. 15. It then voted to remove him from his position as NST but did not restrict his Union membership rights.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      , \u00b6 55. Hudson has appealed the ruling to the National Convention, which, as noted, will take place this August.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      , \u00b6 59.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-18\">\n      Hudson then filed this suit, following his Complaint with a preliminary-injunction motion.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      ECF Nos. 1, 4. After the Court granted the injunction on the ground of bias and ordered him reinstated, the Union convened another COI to reprocess the charges against Plaintiff without tainted members. Before those proceedings had concluded, however, Plaintiff withdrew the count upon which the Court had relied in its injunction, leading it to vacate that Opinion and Hudson's reinstatement.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Minute Order, Jan. 12, 2018. AFGE then filed a motion to dismiss, and Hudson followed shortly after with another motion for preliminary injunction.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      ECF Nos. 21, 30. The Court largely granted the former and then denied the latter as moot.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       AFGE II\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523246\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/121/#p123\">\n       289 F.Supp.3d at\n      </extracted-citation>\n      130-31 ; Minute Order, Feb. 7, 2018.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-19\">\n      The internal Union machinery, meanwhile, plodded on. The second COI found, in addition to the violations via the November 2016 email, probable cause existed that Hudson had \"violated AFGE Policy and Practice\" in sending the August 2016 letter, and it referred both of those charges to the NEC.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      COI File at 1. On February 6, 2018, the NEC found that Hudson had violated the AFGE Constitution in obtaining mailing labels for his August missive without announcing his candidacy for a specific office. The NEC also concluded that the November email was \"campaign literature[,] as it was his third mass distribution in the brief period following his\" candidacy announcement.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      ECF No. 35-1 (NEC Decision). Because the November email \"focused on a political topic,\" and he directed a Union staff member to distribute it \"on AFGE's email server and computer system at the [U]nion's cost,\" the NEC determined that Hudson had violated the AFGE Constitution and Department of Labor regulations.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523246\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/121/#p123\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      The Council then voted to suspend him from office as NST for the rest of his term.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-20\">\n      Focusing on this second removal, Hudson filed an Amended Complaint with the Court's permission, and a third motion for preliminary injunction, which the Court denied.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       AFGE III\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524977\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/308/121/#p123\">\n       308 F.Supp.3d at 131-32\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201587473\">\n       2018 WL 1587473\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , at *8.
