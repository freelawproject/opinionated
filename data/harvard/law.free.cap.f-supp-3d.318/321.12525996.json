Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 2, 2018, Plaintiffs Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc. (\"Alcresta\") and Jonathan Flath filed suit against the Secretary of Health and Human Services, alleging that the agency improperly failed to grant Alcresta a new billing code for one of its products, Relizorb. ECF No. 1. More than three weeks later, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint, ECF No. 7, and a Motion for Preliminary Injunction (the \"PI Motion\"), ECF No. 8. At the parties' request, the Court stayed its consideration of the PI Motion while they discussed a potential settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After settlement talks broke down, the Court held oral argument on the PI Motion and subsequently issued an Order denying the PI Motion, ECF No. 47, and an accompanying Memorandum Opinion (\"PI Opinion\"), ECF No. 48. The instant opinion assumes familiarity with the facts of the case as described in the PI Opinion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-9. In denying the PI Motion, the Court concluded that, based on the record, Alcresta was not entitled to a preliminary injunction because it failed to establish that absent an injunction, it would suffer irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-15. The Court also concluded that Flath, a patient with cystic fibrosis who had taken Relizorb for a few months, was not entitled to a preliminary injunction because: (1) he failed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of standing, which is necessary to establish a likelihood of success on the merits; and (2) he failed to establish irreparable harm because the preliminary relief sought-including a temporary new billing code for Relizorb-would not cause government insurers to reimburse for Relizorb, and thus would not remedy the irreparable harm Flath had alleged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 15-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 26, Plaintiffs appealed the Court's Order, ECF No. 51 (notice of appeal), and filed the instant Emergency Motion. The Emergency Motion seeks an injunction pending appeal resembling the preliminary injunction Plaintiffs requested earlier. Plaintiffs request that this Court order that Defendant (1) adhere to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (\"FACA\") and other required procedures in considering Alcresta's 2018 application for a permanent, unique billing code, (2) issue a \"reasoned decision\" on Alcresta's 2017 application, and (3) issue a \"valid, usable temporary code\" for Relizorb in the interim.

First, they argue that the D.C. Circuit uses a \"sliding scale\" to evaluate motions for preliminary injunctive relief, and that the Court erred by failing to apply it in the PI Opinion. Emer.

As the Court explained in its PI Opinion, Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that they are \"likely\" to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction. PI Opinion at 10-15, 22-24. Thus, they are not entitled to a preliminary injunction, and the Court need not analyze the remaining factors to reach this conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v.

Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that an injunction pending appeal is justified because the Court purportedly \"disregarded\" three arguments that they are suffering irreparable harm: (1) Flath's inability to obtain Relizorb and the alleged inability of patients taking Relizorb generally to submit claims under Medicare; (2) Alcresta's alleged loss of $15 million in profits, which Plaintiffs claim are not recoverable; and (3) the procedural injury related to the government's alleged failure to comply with FACA. Emer. Mot. at 3. But none of these alleged harms is sufficient to demonstrate irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, the Court explained in the PI Opinion that Flath failed to establish irreparable harm because the injunction he sought would not remedy the harm he alleged. PI Opinion at 22-24. Flath's alleged harm stems from the fact that government insurers do not fully reimburse for Relizorb. But the injunctive relief he seeks would only order Defendant to take various actions regarding Relizorb's billing code. Emer. Mot. at 1-2. As the Court has already explained, there is a \"fundamental disconnect\" between the irreparable harm alleged and the injunctive relief sought because changing the billing code used for Relizorb will not lead government insurers to provide additional reimbursement for the product. PI Opinion at 2, 22-24. For similar reasons, the Court also concluded that Flath failed to establish a substantial likelihood of standing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs also have not established irreparable harm resulting from patients' inability to submit a Medicare claim for Relizorb. As noted in the PI Opinion, Defendant has submitted a sworn and unrebutted declaration establishing that billing code B4035 remains a valid Medicare billing code for Relizorb and provides patients access to the claims and appeals process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9; ECF No. 34-1 \u00b6\u00b6 14-15 (\"[C]ode B4035 is a valid code for Medicare claims processing purposes.... If a Medicare claim is processed, then there is an initial determination regarding Medicare payment on the claim. Initial determinations are subject to administrative and judicial review in accordance with the Medicare statute and applicable rules, regulations, guidance, and procedures.\"). In addition, to the extent Plaintiffs now invoke this theory as to \"patients\" other than Flath, injuries to third parties are not a basis to find irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cardinal Health, Inc. v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784914\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/846/203/#p213\">\n    846 F.Supp.2d 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 213 (D.D.C. 2012) (holding argument about irreparable harm to consumers \"fails because it shows irreparable harm not to [plaintiff], but to third parties\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, the Court explained in detail in the PI Opinion why the lost profits Alcresta alleges do not demonstrate irreparable harm. PI Opinion at 10-15. Plaintiffs suggest that, despite the Court's conclusion, an injunction pending appeal would be proper because there is a \"split\" in this Circuit on whether irrecoverable monetary losses constitute irreparable harm, and that this \"difficult legal question\" justifies an injunction pending appeal. Emer. Mot. at 4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wash. Metro. Area Transit Comm'n v.

Cir. 1977) ). The Court does not agree. As the Court explained in the PI Opinion, the vast majority of district court opinions in\n   this Circuit have rejected the rule that unrecoverable monetary losses constitute per se irreparable harm.
