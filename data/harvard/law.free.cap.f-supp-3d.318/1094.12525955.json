Neither medical malpractice, nor negligence, nor even gross negligence rise to the requisite culpable state of mind for deliberate indifference, which is akin to criminal recklessness.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cesal v.

Nevertheless, \"[t]he receipt of some medical care does not automatically defeat a claim of deliberate indifference,\" which still lies if a \"prison official, having knowledge of a significant risk to inmate health or safety, administers blatantly inappropriate medical treatment, acts in a manner contrary to the recommendation of specialists, or delays a prisoner's treatment for non-medical reasons, thereby exacerbating his pain and suffering.\"\n   <em>\n    Perez v.

This is the crux of Page's position as he stresses that the emergency room staffers who initially evaluated his hand opined that he should follow up with an orthopedist or hand doctor. He thus asserts that Williams and Dr. Obaisi were constitutionally required to arrange this treatment and that the care they provided was inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Even when construed liberally, however, Page's arguments do not create a triable issue of fact as to deliberate indifference. First, Page criticizes Williams for the one-day delay in obtaining an x-ray after his fall. Williams evaluated Page, assessed\n   him with a sprain that needed to be evaluated as a potential fracture, ordered an x-ray, gave him a Toradol injection for pain, ordered an arm sling and ice, and prescribed Motrin. He received an x-ray the following day. This very modest delay after Page's condition was stabilized is consistent with the realities of scheduling medical appointments, both in the correctional context and for private citizens.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Petties\n   </em>\n   , 836 F.3d at 730 (noting that \"delays are common in the prison setting with limited resources, and whether the length of a delay is tolerable depends on the seriousness of the condition and the ease of providing treatment.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Second, Page invites the Court to find that because Dr. Obaisi is not an orthopedic doctor, he was not qualified to make medical decisions about Page's fractured metacarpals. This is not enough to create a fact question as to whether Dr. Obaisi was medically capable of treating Page's hand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Lockdowns caused scheduling conflicts with appointments, but Page was consistently rescheduled as necessary. When Page's soft cast was removed during a shakedown, Williams was notified and responded by contacting Dr. Obaisi and ordering another x-ray. Page received the x-ray the following day and was slotted in to see Dr. Obaisi afterwards. Dr. Obaisi examined him, provided another cast, and scheduled a follow up appointment.

Here, Dr. Obaisi did not turn a blind eye as he was aware of initial difficulties scheduling the outside orthopedic visit due to institutional lockdowns. In the meantime, he provided regular medical attention. Time passed, Page's fractures began to knit together, and Dr. Obaisi monitored this process with the input of examinations and x-rays interpreted by Dr. Leef. Dr. Obaisi eventually deemed it appropriate to remove Page's cast and determined that physical therapy would be medically beneficial. While Dr. Obaisi knew that Page had not seen a specialist, he provided a series of appointments and x-rays (which were interpreted by a radiologist)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   to monitor the fractures as they healed and then ordered a course of physical therapy. This exceeds the constitutional floor of \"adequate, minimum-level care.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Petties\n   </em>\n   , 836 F.3d at 730.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   This is true despite Page's desire to have an outside orthopedic doctor supervise this process, because as noted above, a prisoner may not dictate his own course of treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holloway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3637736\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/700/1063/#p1073\">\n    700 F.3d at 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that a prison doctor \"is free to make his own, independent medical determination as to the necessity of certain treatments or medications, so long as the determination is based on the physician's professional judgment and does not go against accepted professional standards\"). Perhaps Dr. Obaisi could have more aggressively pursued an outside appointment immediately after Page's accident, but at best, any such claim would sound in negligence, which is not enough to suggest deliberate indifference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Norwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20566411\">\n    2018 WL 566411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. Thus, Page's arguments about the scheduling snafus are unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Fourth, Page criticizes Williams and Dr. Obaisi for their response to the shakedown incident when his splint was taken. The record shows that Williams promptly consulted with Dr. Obaisi after she learned about the incident and that Page received an x-ray followed by an appointment with Dr. Obaisi on the following day, when he was recasted. At that time, there was either no displacement or minimal displacement. Neither Williams nor Dr. Obaisi were responsible for the shakedown and the attendant loss of Page's splint, and nothing suggests that their care afterwards was unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whiting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176270\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/658/#p663\">\n    839 F.3d at 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming grant of doctor's motion for summary judgment when the plaintiff did not \"have\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   expert testimony indicating that [the doctor's] infection diagnosis and concomitant treatment plan departed from accepted medical practice, much less\n   <em>\n    substantially\n   </em>\n   so\") (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Fifth, Page's vague references to Williams and Dr. Obaisi's purported ongoing refusal to treat pain associated with his fractures are not grounded in the record. Williams prescribed Toradol and Motrin immediate after Page's accident, Dr. Obaisi followed up with more Motrin, Williams refilled Page's Motrin when she was advised that he had run out of medication, and Dr. Obaisi monitored Page's condition with a series of closely timed x-rays and appointments, ordered a new cast when Page's cast was taken, and ultimately approved a course of physical therapy that resulted in substantial improvement.

Page appears to be contending that a specialist would have effected an immediate cure (or at least a faster cure). He may not, however, create a material issue of disputed fact by offering his own medical opinions that conflict with those of medical professionals, such as Dr. Leef, the diagnostic radiologist who interpreted\n   Page's x-rays.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

SOF \u00b6 23, Page asserts, \"The broken bones were 'not healing' at this point, and remained broken.\" Dkt. 99, \u00b6 23. This does not suggest a disputed material issue of fact because it is undisputed that as of October 1, less than a month after Page's accident, his hand was still healing. To the extent that Plaintiff intends to suggest that healing could or should have progressed more quickly, he is unqualified to offer such an opinion, which has no other record support.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Davis\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202880869\">\n     2017 WL 2880869\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *5.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
