[Docket No. 2.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Upon completion of the briefing on the motion for a TRO, the court ordered the parties to provide supplemental briefing to address the impact of the Supreme Court's February 27, 2018 decision in\n   <em>\n    Jennings v. Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). [Docket No. 13.] The parties timely filed the requested briefing. [Docket Nos. 14-16.] This matter is suitable for resolution without a hearing. Civ. L.R. 7-1(b). For the following reasons, the petition is granted in part and denied in part. The motion for a TRO is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Solano was born in Mexico and is 22 years old. His family brought him to the United States when he was two years old. [Docket No. 1-1 Ex. B (Solano Decl., Jan. 26, 2018) \u00b6 1.] Mr. Solano grew up in the United States and attended school here.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. In 2013, shortly after he turned 18, he was arrested and charged with robbery. He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to four years in prison.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 14, 2017, after completing his prison sentence, Mr. Solano was transferred from criminal custody to the custody of the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"). [Docket No. 1-1 Ex. A (Whitfield Decl., Feb. 15, 2018) \u00b6 2.] On August 15, 2017, DHS served him with a Notice of Intent to Issue a Final Administrative Removal Order, noting that he had entered the United States \"without admission or inspection by an immigration official\" and was \"not lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\" [Docket No. 1-1 Ex. C.] DHS issued a Final Administrative Removal Order on the same day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While in custody, Mr. Solano expressed his fear of returning to Mexico due to threats of violence against him and his family by other family members. Solano Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-7. Following an interview, an\n   asylum officer found that Mr. Solano had a reasonable fear of torture if he returned to Mexico and referred the case to an immigration judge so that Mr. Solano could apply for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture. [Docket No. 1-1 Ex. D; Whitfield Decl. \u00b6 3.] Mr. Solano was then placed in withholding-only proceedings. A hearing on the merits of his claim was scheduled for February 12, 2018. [Docket 8-1 (Olympia Decl., Feb. 20, 2018) \u00b6 6, Ex. E; Whitfield Decl. \u00b6 3.] On November 9, 2017, ICE determined that Mr. Solano would continue to be detained during the pendency of his withholding-only proceedings. Olympia Decl. \u00b6 7, Ex. F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 11, 2017, after being detained for nearly four months, Mr. Solano filed a request for a ruling on his eligibility for a bond hearing. Whitfield Decl. \u00b6 6. Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") Joseph Park denied the request on December 14, 2017, stating that the \"issue [was] not ripe.\" [Docket No. 1-1 Ex. E.] On January 12, 2018, Mr. Solano moved for a bond hearing to be set on or around February 12, 2018, immediately after he would reach six months in custody, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

Whitfield Decl. \u00b6 7; Petition \u00b6 5. The IJ denied the motion on January 25, 2018 on the ground that the \"[court] lacks jurisdiction over custody as respondent [is] in withholding only proceedings.\" [Docket No. 1-1 Ex. F.] On January 30, 2018, Mr. Solano appealed the IJ's decision denying a custody hearing to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"). [Docket No. 1-1 Ex. G.] As of the February 15, 2018 filing date of Mr. Solano's habeas petition, the BIA had not yet set a briefing schedule. Whitfield Decl. \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the February 12, 2018 merits hearing regarding withholding of removal, Mr. Solano moved again for a bond hearing, which the IJ denied. [Docket No. 1-1 Ex. I.] The IJ continued the merits hearing to take additional evidence and testimony; the next hearing date is set for June 5, 2018. [Docket No. 1-1 Ex. J; Whitfield Decl. \u00b6 14.] Mr. Solano has been detained in ICE custody for over seven months without a bond hearing, since August 14, 2017. He remains in detention at the Yuba County Jail in Marysville, California. Petition \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Solano now petitions for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , asserting that his continued detention without a bond hearing is unlawful and in violation of his due process rights. In his petition and motion for a TRO, he seeks to enjoin his continued detention by DHS without a bond hearing, and to secure his release from custody in advance of his June 5, 2018 merits hearing. Mr. Solano asks that the court order either his immediate release from custody, or direct the EOIR to provide him with an individualized bond hearing at which the government bears the burden of justifying his continued detention by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Respondents oppose the petition and the motion for a TRO, and ask the court to resolve Mr. Solano's habeas petition on the merits. [Docket No. 8 (Opp'n) 14.] They argue that the petition should be denied for two reasons: 1) Mr. Solano has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies; and 2) Mr. Solano is not entitled to a bond hearing under applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Administrative Exhaustion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Respondents argue that the court should dismiss Mr. Solano's habeas petition because\n   he has not exhausted his administrative remedies before the BIA. As noted, Mr. Solano's appeal to the BIA of the IJ's January 25, 2018 decision that Mr. Solano is not entitled to a bond hearing remains pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3), a federal district court is authorized to grant a writ of habeas corpus when a petitioner is \"in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3).

As of the date of his reply brief, the BIA had not yet set a briefing or hearing schedule, and such appeals \"often take four months or more\" to adjudicate. Petition \u00b6 25. Mr. Solano contends that awaiting the outcome of his BIA appeal would cause him irreparable harm, because \"[t]he BIA's indefinite timeline in deciding [his] appeal will compound the constitutional violation and constitute an even greater prejudice to [him],\" given his contention that he is entitled to a custody hearing or immediate release. Petition \u00b6 26. Mr. Solano further asserts that being forced to proceed with his application for immigration relief while detained is prejudicial to his case. He cites a study showing that represented noncitizens in the San Francisco Immigration Court who remain detained throughout removal proceedings are less than half as likely to be granted relief from deportation as similar individuals who are not detained at the time of their merits hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. He notes that detention makes it more difficult to meet with attorneys, collect evidence, and fully prepare for a merits hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, Mr. Solano asserts that he is suffering irreparable harm in the form of \"the human cost of remaining detained in a county jail, far from his family and friends.\" Reply 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The court concludes that administrative exhaustion is not required in this case. Mr. Solano filed a BIA appeal that has not yet been set for briefing. The hearing on the merits of his claim for withholding of removal is scheduled for June 5, 2018, just over two months from now, and Mr. Solano asserts that the BIA appeal may take\n   four months or longer to adjudicate, a timeline which Respondents do not dispute. Mr. Solano explains the substantial challenges in preparing for a merits hearing while in custody, and cites statistics which demonstrate that individuals in custody during removal proceedings are less likely to be granted relief from deportation. Again, Respondents do not address this point, thereby conceding it. The court finds that Mr. Solano \"suffers potentially irreparable harm every day that he remains in custody without a hearing, which could ultimately result in his release from detention.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pulido v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , No. C 17-03683 WHA, Docket No. 12, slip opinion 3-4 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 21, 2017) (waiving exhaustion requirement). In these circumstances, waiver of the administrative exhaustion requirement is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Villalta v.

First, Respondents assert that the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Diouf II\n   </em>\n   could challenge his removal order, while Mr. Solano will remain subject to his final removal order even if his application for withholding of removal is granted. The second assertion is a variation on the first, in which Respondents note that unlike the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Diouf II\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Solano has never sought judicial review of his final removal order, and the time to do so has passed. These two factual distinctions are of no import.

As the court noted in\n   <em>\n    Diouf II\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   \"rejected the argument that \u00a7 1231(a)(6) detainees possess no liberty interest in freedom from civil detention merely because they lack a 'legal right' to live at large in the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4093877\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/1081/\">\n    634 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1087 n.8 (citing\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n    533 U.S. at 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). While the government indeed may have a different interest in detaining individuals such as Mr. Solano, Respondents do not explain how this justifies denying Mr. Solano a bond hearing, at which an immigration judge may consider the circumstances of his entry to the United States and criminal history in deciding whether he poses a flight risk or danger to the community. The government's interest in detaining Mr. Solano has no bearing on Mr. Solano's \"important interest\" in \"freedom from prolonged detention.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diouf II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4093877\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/1081/\">\n    634 F.3d at 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, Respondents argue that applying\n   <em>\n    Diouf II\n   </em>\n   to noncitizens like Mr. Solano who are subject to final removal orders would conflict with the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   . According to Respondents,\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   , and not\n   <em>\n    Diouf II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   controls this case, and in order to receive a bond hearing, Mr. Solano must show that \"there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.\" Opp'n 13-14. This argument is not persuasive. In\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court considered whether noncitizens may be detained indefinitely under section 1231(a)(6) pending removal from the United States.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n    533 U.S. at 689-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court identified the liberty interest at issue for such detainees and held that section 1231(a)(6)\"does not permit indefinite detention,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n    at 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but did not address the question of bond hearings. The Ninth Circuit subsequently held that the liberty interest identified in\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   \"applies not only to indefinite detention, but also to\n   <em>\n    prolonged detention\n   </em>\n   \" of six months.\n   <em>\n    Diouf II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4093877\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/1081/\">\n    634 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1087 n.8, 1092 n.13 (emphasis added).
