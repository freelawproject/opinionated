Mehta, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 10, 2017, BuzzFeed News published an article on its website titled \"These Reports Allege Trump Has Deep Ties to Russia.\" The Article includes an embedded document containing what is now popularly referred to as the \"Dossier\"-a 35-page collection of memoranda prepared by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Dossier discusses Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election and contains allegations of ties between Russia and the campaign of then candidate Donald J. Trump.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This matter concerns the final two pages of the Dossier embedded in the Article: a memorandum entitled \"Company Intelligence Report 2016/166\" and dated \"13 December 2016\" (\"Report 2016/166\"). The second to last paragraph of Report 2016/166 alleges that \"a company called XBT/Webzilla\" and an individual named \"Aleksei GUBAROV\" were involved in a scheme to use \"botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data and conduct 'altering operations' against the Democratic Party leadership.\" Apparently, Aleksej Gubarev (not Aleksei Gubarov) was not pleased to have his and his companies' names associated with such allegations. So, shortly after BuzzFeed published the Dossier, Aleksej Gubarev, XBT Holdings S.A., and Webzilla, Inc., sued BuzzFeed, Inc., and its editor-in-chief, Ben Smith (collectively, \"BuzzFeed\"), in Florida state court for defamation, alleging that the penultimate paragraph of the Dossier falsely identifies them as having been involved in Russian efforts to hack Democratic Party leaders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the underlying Florida litigation, BuzzFeed has asserted several affirmative defenses. Among them is the \"fair report privilege,\" which generally shields persons from liability for publishing fair and accurate reports of official government proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 611 (1977). BuzzFeed contends that its publication of the Dossier, including Report 2016/166, is protected by the fair report privilege because the Dossier was the subject of official proceedings-namely, a government investigation and a confidential briefing of President Barack Obama and then President-elect Donald Trump by senior executive branch officials. To support this defense, BuzzFeed subpoenaed several federal government agencies and employees, seeking testimony that would confirm, among other things, that prior to the Article's publication on January 10, 2017, the FBI (and possibly other law enforcement or intelligence agencies) possessed all 35 pages of the Dossier and President Obama had been briefed on the Dossier's contents. When the government parties balked at producing the requested testimony and records in that proceeding,\n   BuzzFeed filed a Motion to Compel in this District Court. In the case's present posture, BuzzFeed does not seek compliance with the full scope of the original subpoenas; rather, it asks the court to order a response to three narrow questions about the Dossier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon consideration of the parties' briefs, and for the reasons set forth below, the court concludes that the subpoena-as substantially narrowed during the course of this litigation-is not unduly burdensome, and that BuzzFeed has made a sufficient showing of need to overcome the law enforcement privilege. The testimony that BuzzFeed seeks is essential to its defense against the defamation action and it cannot be obtained from any other source. Additionally, the release of the testimony will have a minimal impact, if any, on law enforcement interests, particularly in light of the substantial amount of information already officially acknowledged about the Dossier's provenance and subsequent use by the FBI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Accordingly, the court grants the Motion to Compel and orders the Government to produce, subject to a protective order, an affidavit that is responsive to the three topics set forth in BuzzFeed's narrowed request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    1. The Article\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   BuzzFeed News published an article on its website titled \"These Reports Allege Trump Has Deep Ties to Russia\" on January 10, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Compel, ECF No. 1 [hereinafter MTC], at 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   MTC, Ex. 1, ECF No. 1-3 [hereinafter Fla. Compl.], Ex. 2 [hereinafter Article].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As relevant here, the Article includes an embedded document containing the 35-page \"Dossier.\" Article at 3. The Article describes the Dossier as \"a collection of memos .... prepared for political opponents of Trump by ... a former British intelligence agent\" containing \"explosive-but unverified-allegations that the Russian government has been 'cultivating, supporting and assisting' President-elect Donald Trump for years and gained compromising information about him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2. BuzzFeed decided to publish the Dossier, the Article explains, \"so that Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the president-elect that have circulated at the highest levels of the US government.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Article goes on to detail the Dossier's use by federal officials. It states that Senator John McCain \"gave a 'full copy' of the memos to [FBI Director James] Comey on Dec. 9, but that the FBI already had copies of many of the memos.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It also states that \"a two-page synopsis of the report was given to President Obama and Trump.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, the Article cites and links to a CNN article, which specifically reports that the FBI was actively investigating the truth of the Dossier's allegations and that four of the senior-most U.S. intelligence directors-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers-presented a two-page synopsis of the Dossier to President Obama and President-elect Trump as part of a classified briefing.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (linking to CNN article); Evan Perez et al.,\n   <em>\n    Intel Chiefs Presented Trump with Claims of Russian Efforts to Compromise Him\n   </em>\n   , CNN (updated Jan. 12, 2017, 5:26 PM), https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/10/politics/donald-trump-intelligence-report-russia/index.html.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The synopsis purportedly discloses, among other things, that Russia allegedly had compromising personal and financial information about President-elect Trump, continuously exchanged information with surrogates of his campaign, and released information to harm Hillary Clinton's campaign.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    2. The Underlying Florida Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 3, 2017, shortly after BuzzFeed published the Article, Aleksej Gubarev, XBT Holdings S.A., and Webzilla, Inc. (collectively, \"the Florida plaintiffs\") filed suit against BuzzFeed in Florida state court, asserting one count of defamation.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Fla. Compl. Gubarev is a \"venture capitalist,\" \"tech expert,\" and chairman and CEO of XBT Holdings S.A., which owns Webzilla, Inc.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 16.

In their Complaint, the Florida plaintiffs allege that the following paragraph in the Dossier falsely identifies them as having participated in \"computer hacking of the Democratic Party,\"\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-27:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [redacted] reported that over the period March-September 2016 a company called XBT/Webzilla and its affiliates had been using botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data and conduct \"altering operations\" against the Democratic Party leadership. Entities linked to one Ale[ks]ei GUBAROV were involved and he and another hacking expert, both recruited under duress by the FSB, Seva KAPSUGOVICH, were significant players in this operation. In Prague, COHEN agreed [sic] contingency plans for various scenarios to protect the operations, but in particular what was to be done in the event that Hillary CLINTON won the presidency. It was important in this event that all cash payments owed were made quickly and discreetly and that cyber and other operators were stood down/able to go effectively to ground to cover their traces.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26 (alteration and emphasis omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fla. Compl., Ex. 3 [hereinafter Dossier], at 35.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As noted, the Dossier is a compilation of separate memoranda. The above-quoted language can be found in the penultimate paragraph of the last of the memoranda published by BuzzFeed, which is dated December 13, 2016, and identified as \"Company Intelligence Report 2016/166.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dossier at 34-35. As discussed below, the date by which the Government received Report 2016/166 turns out to be critical information that BuzzFeed seeks to mount its defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   BuzzFeed subsequently removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gubarev v. BUZZFEED\n   </em>\n   , No. 0:17-cv-60426-UU,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202289183\">\n    2017 WL 2289183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Fla. removed Feb. 28, 2017). In its Answer, BuzzFeed raises several affirmative defenses, including that the \"publication of the allegedly defamatory statements in the Dossier, within the context of the Article, is protected by the fair report privilege\" under New York law, or alternatively under Florida or Texas law. MTC, Ex. 2, ECF No. 1-4, at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    3. The Subpoenas\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On June 28, 2017, BuzzFeed issued seven subpoenas seeking documents and deposition testimony on ten topics relating to the Dossier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTC at 10; Defs.' Opp'n to Pls.' Mot. to Compel, ECF No. 8 [hereinafter Opp'n], at 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   MTC, Ex. 3, ECF No. 1-5; MTC, Ex. 4, ECF No. 1-6; MTC, Ex. 5, ECF No. 1-7. The subpoenas\n   sought testimony from a designated representative of four federal agencies-the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"), the Central Intelligence Agency (\"CIA\"), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (\"ODNI\")-as well three former officials of those agencies-Comey, Brennan, and Clapper. MTC at 10; Opp'n at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The government agencies and former agency employees responded to the subpoenas in August 2017, and refused to provide any records or testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTC at 10-11; Opp'n at 5-6. In September 2017, counsel for BuzzFeed met with government counsel and proposed to narrow the scope of its original subpoenas. MTC at 11; Opp'n at 6. Specifically, BuzzFeed offered to withdraw subpoenas addressed to the CIA and Brennan in full; to withdraw any request for documents as to all other subpoenas; and to limit its deposition inquiries to nine topics: seven directed to the DOJ, the FBI, or Comey, and two topics to be elicited from Clapper.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202289183\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These topics, generally speaking, \"cover[ed] the public statements previously made [by the Government] about briefings, the existence of an investigation, and merely confirming the receipt of material from Senator McCain.\" MTC at 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MTC, Ex. 9, ECF No. 1-11. The Government rejected BuzzFeed's proposal. MTC at 12; Opp'n at 6;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MTC, Ex. 10, ECF No. 1-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    1. BuzzFeed's Narrowing of the Subpoenas\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On September 27, 2017, BuzzFeed filed a motion to compel in this court against the DOJ, the FBI, the ODNI, Comey, and Clapper (collectively \"the Government Respondents\") under Rules 26 and 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   MTC. In their Motion to Compel, BuzzFeed sought \"slightly narrower discovery\" than that which they proposed to the Government Respondents in their narrowed request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. In particular, BuzzFeed asked the court to compel the Government Respondents to designate and produce \"no more than two witnesses\" from DOJ and/or FBI, and if necessary ODNI, for a deposition limited to roughly the same nine topics of testimony discussed above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTC at 12-13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Government Respondents opposed the Motion to Compel on November 13, 2017, objecting to BuzzFeed's subpoena request, even as further narrowed, on three\n   grounds: (1) relevance, (2) undue burden, and (3) the law enforcement privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 1-2. The Opposition included an ex parte, in camera submission,\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Opp'n, Defs.'

At the hearing, prodded by the court, BuzzFeed agreed to narrow the scope of its subpoenas even more by (1) withdrawing their request for testimony with respect to Topics 1-2, 4-6, and 9 without prejudice,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-15, 40-41, 46-47, and (2) agreeing to accept an affidavit from a government official in lieu of deposition testimony on the remaining topics, i.e., Topics 3, 7, and 8,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15, 17-18, 40-41.\n   <em>\n    See generally supra\n   </em>\n   note 4 (outlining the nine topics in BuzzFeed's original request). On March 1, 2018, BuzzFeed filed a Status Report reiterating its willingness \"to accept an affidavit from the Government, in lieu of testimony, provided that the language of that affidavit is clear and responsive to the topics of testimony requested.\" Status Report, ECF No. 22 [hereinafter March Status Report], at 2. BuzzFeed proposed the following topics of inquiry, which are narrowed even further than was discussed at the February 15, 2018, hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Narrowed Topic No. 3\n   </em>\n   : Whether, prior to 5:20 p.m. Eastern time on January 10, 2017, the FBI and/or any of the other Defendant agencies had the last two pages of the Dossier as it was published by BuzzFeed. Alternatively, if the Defendants were able to simply confirm that as of that time and date the FBI and/or any of the other Defendant agencies had the 35 pages of the Dossier that were published by BuzzFeed, that would be acceptable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Narrowed Topic No. 7\n   </em>\n   : Whether on or about December 9, 2016, the FBI received from Senator John McCain a copy of the Dossier containing the first 33 pages published by BuzzFeed.....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Narrowed Topic No. 8\n   </em>\n   : Whether, prior to January 10, 2017, Mr. Clapper, Mr. Rogers, Mr. Brennan, and/or Mr. Comey briefed President Obama about the Dossier and provided a synopsis of it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3 (footnotes omitted). Thus, what began as a request for documents and records on nine different topics is now limited to three discrete questions, the answers to which BuzzFeed will accept by sworn affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    2. Classification Review of Requested Information\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Notwithstanding BuzzFeed's willingness to substantially narrow its initial requests, the Government Respondents took the position at the February 15, 2018, hearing that compliance with the requested discovery, even as modified, would be burdensome and would compromise sensitive law enforcement interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 32-34. In particular, the Government Respondents insisted that disclosing\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   federal authorities received the Dossier's final two pages, i.e., Report 2016/166, would adversely impact law enforcement interests \"in a very real way.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. The court invited the Government Respondents to state specifically how the disclosure of such information would affect law enforcement interests, noting that the Government's first ex parte, in camera submission had been too general to be useful.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34, 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Government Respondents accepted the court's invitation and filed a second ex parte, in camera declaration, on March 19, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Notice of Lodging of Classified Ex Parte, In Camera Decl., ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   No. 23. On May 25, 2018, the court held a classified, ex parte, in camera hearing to discuss the newly filed declaration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Entry, May 25, 2018. In that declaration, the Government Respondents asserted that certain of the information sought was in fact classified. That assertion prompted the court to issue an ex parte, in camera order that, among other things, asked the Government Respondents whether they intended to invoke the state secrets privilege with respect to the classified material.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Ex Parte, In Camera Order, ECF No. 26. Ultimately, the Government Respondents indicated that they did not intend to assert the state secrets privilege, and that the information initially classified would be declassified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resps.' Notice of Lodging of Classified, Ex Parte Filing, ECF No. 29; Resps.' Notice of Lodging of Classified, Ex Parte Filing, ECF No. 31; Resps.' Notice of Lodging of Classified, Ex Parte Filing, ECF No. 32. Thus, the only privilege that the Government Respondents assert is the one that they invoked at the outset: the law enforcement privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The court now turns to the merits of BuzzFeed's Motion to Compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"Disputes over third-party subpoenas to agencies in civil litigation ... must commence in the district court under Rule 45,\" which \"authorizes court-issued subpoenas to obtain discovery from third parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Watts v.

Cir. 1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Balancing these factors, the court finds that the requested testimony is not protected by the law enforcement privilege because BuzzFeed's need for the limited information sought outweighs the public's interest in non-disclosure. To start, the following factors, per their numbering in\n   <em>\n    Tuite\n   </em>\n   , already have been determined to weigh in favor of disclosure: (4) the information sought is purely factual; (5) BuzzFeed is not a defendant in a current or potential criminal proceeding; (8) BuzzFeed's Motion to Compel is non-frivolous and brought in good faith; (9) the answers that BuzzFeed seeks are not available through other discovery or from other sources; and (10) the discovery demanded is critical to BuzzFeed's defense in the Florida litigation. On the other hand, the court summarily can identify one factor that weighs against disclosure: (6) the DOJ's and the FBI's investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election is ongoing. The court devotes greater discussion to the remaining pertinent considerations, factors (1) and (2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The court is unconvinced that the disclosure of the limited discovery here (1) will thwart government processes by discouraging citizens from sharing information with the government, or (2) will result in revealing the identity of a source of information. Ordinarily, this court would be disinclined to compel even modest factual disclosures about an ongoing law enforcement investigation. The risk attendant to such judicial intervention is obvious. But this is no ordinary investigation. Caution and discretion-typically hallmarks of federal\n   criminal and national security investigations-have given way to unprecedented public disclosures. President Trump has declassified substantial information about the Dossier's provenance and its use by federal investigators, largely through the authorized release of two congressionally drafted memoranda and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications targeting the President's former campaign advisor, Carter Page. From one congressional memorandum, the public now knows that former British intelligence operative, Christopher Steele, drafted the Dossier; that the FBI relied in part on portions of the Dossier's contents to secure a FISA warrant on Carter Page in October 2016; that, at the same time, the FBI was undertaking efforts to corroborate the allegations contained with the Dossier; and, perhaps most significant to this case, that \"in early January 2017, Director Comey briefed President-elect Trump on a summary of the Steele dossier.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Suppl. Information, ECF No. 18, Ex. A, ECF No. 18-1 (Nunes Memo). The second congressional memorandum reveals additional details. It informs that: Steele shared his \"reporting ... with an FBI agent ... through the end of October 2016\"; the counterintelligence team at the FBI investigating Russian interference did not receive \"Steele's reporting\" until \"mid-September 2016\"; the Department of Justice applied for the Carter Page FISA warrant on October 21, 2016; and \"[t]he FBI has undertaken a rigorous process to vet allegations from Steele's reporting.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to All Members of U.S. House of Representatives (Jan. 29, 2018), https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/20180205/106838/HMTG-115-IG00-20180205-SD002.pdf (Schiff Memo).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the released Carter Page FISA application confirms that Steele-identified in the application as \"Source # 1\"-has been an FBI source and that he turned over \"reporting\" to the FBI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Carter W. Page\n   </em>\n   , \"Verified Application,\" U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (Oct. 2016), at 15 &amp; n.8, 16, https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/95-carter-page-fisa-documents-foia-release/full/optimized.pdf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   And there is one more pertinent piece of public information: Senator McCain has publicly acknowledged that he turned over the Dossier to Director Comey.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTC, Ex. 18, ECF No. 2-7 (Press Release from Senator John McCain, dated January 11, 2017) (\"\n   <em>\n    Late last year\n   </em>\n   , I received sensitive information\n   <em>\n    that has since been made public\n   </em>\n   .... I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI.\" (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   John McCain et al.,\n   <em>\n    The Restless Wave\n   </em>\n   238 (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As all of these disclosures show, an unprecedented amount of information about the Dossier's origin and its use in an ongoing investigation is already in the public domain. What BuzzFeed seeks to confirm through its subpoenas would add to this information only at the margins. More than anything, in its three inquiries, BuzzFeed asks the Government Respondents to confirm dates by which the FBI acquired pages of the Dossier, including from Senator McCain, and when President Obama was briefed on its contents. The disclosures already authorized by President Trump, by comparison, are of a far greater magnitude. The court can only assume that the information declassified and released, at the President's direction, was determined to be of the kind whose disclosure would not discourage citizens from coming forward with information and would not compromise a source's identity.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGehee v. Casey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789749,1894758\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/718/1137/\">\n    718 F.2d 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1148 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (holding in FOIA context that courts should \"defer to CIA judgment as to the harmful results of publication\" and apply the \"presumption of regularity\" if a rational explanation for classification is offered). On the public record, the Government Respondents offer no convincing reason to conclude otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Admittedly, the Government Respondents make more specific arguments to justify protecting the requested testimony from disclosure in their in camera, ex parte submissions. The court addresses and rejects those arguments in an addendum to this opinion, which the court files under seal and serves only on the Government Respondents,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Notice of Ex Parte, In Camera Sealed Addendum, ECF No. 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In sum, the court finds that any threat posed by the release of the requested information to an ongoing law enforcement investigation is minimal, and such nominal threat cannot carry the day when balanced against BuzzFeed's critical need for the information to defend itself in the Florida litigation. Thus, the court finds that the information sought by BuzzFeed is not protected by the law enforcement privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the court finds that the testimony sought in BuzzFeed's narrowed subpoena demand: (1) seeks testimony that is relevant to its affirmative defense in the underlying Florida litigation based on the fair report privilege; (2) does not impose an undue burden on the Government Respondents; and (3) does not call for disclosure of privileged information, as the Government is unable to claim the qualified protection of the federal law enforcement privilege in this case. Accordingly, the court grants BuzzFeed's Motion to Compel, ECF No. 1, as modified by its March 1, 2018 Status Report,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 22, and in accordance with the terms this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Government shall produce a sworn affidavit that is responsive to the three narrowed topics of testimony set forth in BuzzFeed's Status Report dated March 1, 2018, as modified below, within three business days of entry of the protective order in the Florida litigation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . In the exercise of its discretion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Watts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3562179,3866332\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/482/501/\">\n    482 F.3d at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court has reworded the three inquires to increase the likelihood of a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" response. For purposes of these interrogatories, the term \"Dossier\" shall mean the 35 pages published by BuzzFeed as embedded in the Article.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Revised\n    </em>\n    Narrowed Topic No. 3\n   </em>\n   : The Government need only respond to one of the following and shall specify in its affidavit whether it is answering (A) or (B):\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (A) Prior to 5:20 p.m. EST on January 10, 2017, did the FBI and/or any of the other Defendant agencies possess the two-page memorandum contained within the Dossier dated December 13, 2017, i.e., Report 2016/166?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (B) Prior to 5:20 p.m. EST on January 10, 2017, did the FBI and/or any of the other Defendant agencies possess all 35 pages of the Dossier?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Revised\n    </em>\n    Narrowed Topic No. 7\n   </em>\n   : Did the FBI receive from Senator John McCain a copy of the first 33 pages of the Dossier (i.e., all pages other than Report 2016/166) on or about December 9, 2016?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Revised\n    </em>\n    Narrowed Topic No. 8\n   </em>\n   : Did Mr. Clapper, Mr. Rogers, Mr. Brennan, and/or Mr. Comey, before January 10, 2017, brief President Obama about allegations contained in the Dossier?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Furthermore, to protect \"both the litigant's right to evidence and the government's interest in not being used as a speakers' bureau for private litigants,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3562179,3866332\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/482/501/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted), the affidavit submitted by the Government Respondents shall be produced subject to a protective order. Such a protective order should include, at a minimum, the following conditions: (1) BuzzFeed may use the affidavit on an \"Attorneys' Eyes Only\" basis solely to support its defense in the Florida litigation; (2) the affidavit may be disclosed to the Florida plaintiffs on an \"Attorneys' Eyes Only\" basis, upon the plaintiffs' counsel's agreement to be bound by the protective order; (3) unless the Florida court orders otherwise, the affidavit shall be filed under seal if used in connection with any motions practice; and (4) unless the Florida court orders otherwise, the affidavit's use at a hearing or trial will be subject to use restrictions agreed-upon by BuzzFeed and the Government Respondents. The parties shall file such a protective order for the Florida court's signature no later than August 24, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally, because the court grants BuzzFeed's Motion to Compel, the court denies as moot BuzzFeed's \"Motion to Strike or, in the Alternative, for an Order Compelling Defendants to File a Redacted Version of Their\n   <em>\n    Ex Parte, In Camera\n   </em>\n   Declaration,\" ECF No. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   This is a final, appealable order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Throughout this opinion, the term \"Dossier\" is meant to refer only to the 35 pages of memoranda published by BuzzFeed News.

Moreover, as in BuzzFeed's initial narrowed request, the Motion to Compel only seeks deposition testimony, not records,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 12, and does not seek to compel enforcement of the subpoenas issued to the CIA and Brennan,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 11 n.2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    In its Motion to Compel, BuzzFeed also argues that the requested testimony is \"highly relevant\" because it could establish that the Article is not false.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 14-15. The court, however, need not assess this separate theory of relevance. As discussed below, the Florida court already has determined that discovery concerning the existence of an FBI investigation into the truth of the Dossier's allegations, as well as classified presidential briefings related to those allegations, is relevant to BuzzFeed's assertion of the fair report privilege as an absolute defense in the underlying litigation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Although the D.C.
