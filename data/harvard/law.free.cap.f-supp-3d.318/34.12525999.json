As discussed below, while the Department's refusal to appoint Pratt as acting DCM while his supervisor was traveling does not constitute an adverse action, the circumstances surrounding the negative EER Pratt received following his EEO activity have been alleged with sufficient factual clarity to survive a 12(b)(6) motion.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-21\">\n      <em>\n       A. The defendant's decision not to install the plaintiff as acting DCM is not an adverse employment action for the purposes of Title VII\n      </em>\n      .\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-22\">\n      First, the State Department has moved to dismiss all claims arising out of its decision to forego appointing Pratt to the temporary acting DCM position. The Department's argument is sound, as it is established within the D.C. Circuit that the \"outright denial of a temporary position\" is not one of the \"terms, conditions, or privileges of employment contemplated by Title VII\" and does not qualify as an adverse employment action for the purposes of a Title VII claim.\n      <em>\n       Stewart v.

Because this failure to appoint Pratt as acting DCM does not constitute an adverse action, Pratt's Title VII claims will be dismissed to the extent that they arise out of this specific allegation.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-24\">\n      <em>\n       B.

This allegedly negative EER was given to Pratt approximately five months after the October 30, 2015 meeting in which he alleges he engaged in protected activity, and two months after he lodged a formal EEO complaint with the State Department. ECF No. 20-3 at 10, \u00b6 43. Pratt's complaint alleges an actual loss of \"$30-40,000\" as a result of the purportedly negative EER, as a fifth positive EER \"would have entitled Pratt to a promotion from a Grade II employee earning $120,000/year to a Grade I employee with the potential to earn $150-160,000/year.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 10, \u00b6\u00b645-46.

While it is difficult to demonstrate that a negative or declining performance evaluation constitutes an adverse action, performance evaluations may not \"categorically be ruled out\" when assessing Title VII claims.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772317,4331661\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/1085/\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-27\">\n      While the Department was correct to assert that Pratt's allegations regarding the negative EER failed to allege an adverse action in his initial complaint, Pratt's later amendments elevated the allegations above a mere \"threadbare recital[ ] of the elements\" of a Title VII claim.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Iqbal\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n       556 U.S. at 678\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n       129 S.Ct. 1937\n      </extracted-citation>\n      . Taken as true for the purposes of a 12(b)(6) motion, Pratt's amendments detail a specific, tangible harm caused by the evaluation, and this Court has no precedential basis to dismiss all claims arising out of the facts alleged.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-28\">\n      The Court notes, however, its skepticism of Pratt's dubious claim of\n      <em>\n       entitlement\n      </em>\n      to a promotion after being given a fifth consecutive, positive EER. While Pratt is not required to support his allegations with evidence at the pleading stage, the Department has demonstrated in its motion to dismiss that the guidelines for promotion of Foreign Service employees state nothing about a numerical or sequential threshold with respect to positive employee evaluations.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Foreign Affairs Manual, Promotion of Members of the Foreign Service, 3 FAM 2323-2326, https://fam.state.gov/FAM/03FAM/03FAM2320.html. Promotion is instead based more generally on \"merit and the needs of the Service,\" with decisions being made by selection boards after the evaluation of a recommended employee's \"performance folder[ ].\"\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      at 3 FAM 2323.1-1; 2326.1-3. Without any authority corroborating the entitlement to a promotion alleged in the complaint, Pratt's negative EER could not likely be distinguished from the negative performance evaluations classified by the above-cited D.C. Circuit precedent as insufficient to allege adverse employment actions. If Pratt is not able to produce evidence that he was, in fact,\n      <em>\n       entitled\n      </em>\n      to a promotion upon the grant of a fifth consecutive, positive EER, or that his work performance during the period evaluated was so strong that a negative review would not make sense but for discriminatory or retaliatory intent by his supervisors, these allegations will likely not survive summary judgment.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-29\">\n      <strong>\n       III. Pratt has alleged sufficient facts to demonstrate a causal connection between his negative EER and his race or prior EEO activity.\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-30\">\n      In its motion, the Department also attacks the causal connection alleged between any adverse action and Pratt's race or prior EEO activity. A well-pleaded Title VII claim is subject to \"traditional principles of but-for causation\" and must allege \"that the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer.\"\n      <em>\n       Univ. of Texas Sw.

ECF No. 20-3 at 10, \u00b6 44. The Department attempts to invoke the \"three month rule\" sometimes used by this Court as a guideline for assessing the sufficiency of temporal proximity in Title VII cases. ECF No. 51-1 at 14. In so doing, it asserts that the temporal gap between Pratt's alleged protected activity during a meeting with his supervisors in October of 2015 and the issuance of his allegedly negative EER is too wide to show causality. This assertion fails to recognize that Pratt's filing of an EEO complaint in February of 2016 also constitutes protected activity under Title VII.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Peters\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5215960\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/460/125/#p133\">\n       460 F.Supp.2d at 133\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (recognizing the filing of an EEO complaint as protected activity). Consequently, the correct temporal gap to be measured is the two months between February, 2016, and April, 2016. Even if the Court were to ignore any other allegations that may be construed to assert facts beyond mere temporal proximity, Pratt's allegations concerning his negative EER satisfy the causal connectivity element of a Title VII claim.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-32\">\n      <strong>\n       <em>\n        CONCLUSION\n       </em>\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-33\">\n      For the reasons stated above, Pratt's allegations concerning his denial of the acting DCM position fail to allege an adverse action and may not survive the Department's 12(b)(6) motion. His allegations concerning his purportedly negative EER, however, have been stated with sufficient factual detail to survive the motion.
