Between 2008 and 2012, the GSEs received nearly $200 billion in federal funding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 1. During that time, the GSEs paid quarterly dividends to the U.S. Treasury equal to 10% of the total amount of federal funds received.

In their contracts with servicers, the GSEs and FHA agree to reimburse various costs and expenses related to foreclosure actions. The servicers, in turn, typically contract with law firms to prosecute these actions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. The GSEs and FHA agree to pay these attorneys a flat fee for their legal work. Separately, the GSEs and FHA reimburse so-called \"default-related, legal expenses,\" which typically include title searches, service of process, and publication and posting costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Any overhead related to these activities, however, must be included in legal fees and not as expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   FHA and the GSEs permit reimbursement only of those default-related legal expenses that are actual, reasonable, and necessary. The FHA, for example, requires that its servicers certify that \"with the submission of each loan for insurance or request for insurance benefits, the applicant has and will comply with the requirements of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development [\"HUD\"], which include, but are not limited to ... HUD's regulations, FHA handbooks, mortgagee letters, and Title I letters and policies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98 (quotations omitted).

Among other things, HUD and the FHA require servicers to have in place a quality control plan,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101-103, to review all claims for insurance benefits,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104, and to ensure that unallowable foreclosure processing fees are not included in insurance claims,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Servicers must further ensure that their \"contractors\" and \"agents\" complied with certain specific FHA requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106 (quoting HUD Handbook 4060.1, 7-3). Among these is the requirement that, in the event a borrower defaults on an FHA-insured mortgage and the servicer prosecutes a foreclosure on the mortgage, \"fees and costs that exceed reasonable and customary fees for the area\" are not to be submitted for reimbursement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110. Also unallowable are costs \"not necessarily incurred or required because of dilatory service,\" and costs that are \"overhead items such as postage, telephone, or duplicating or collection services, all of which should be included in the attorney's or trustee's fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   HUD rules expressly prohibit banks from listing any unallowable costs on any application for insurance benefits as either fees or costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   HUD rules further require banks to \"promptly reimburse HUD for any amount overpaid [by HUD] because of incorrect, unsupported or inappropriate information\" provided by the servicers or their agents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112 (quoting HUD Handbook 4330.4, 1-28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Fannie Mae likewise requires its servicers to retain competent, diligent legal counsel and to \"make every effort to reduce default-related foreclosure expenses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62 (quoting Fannie Mae Servicing Guide E5-07 (Dec. 13, 2017) ). Among other things, Fannie Mae servicers \"must attempt to minimize the costs incurred from vendors utilized by law firms-such as auctioneers, process servers, title companies, posting companies, and newspapers or other publications-by ensuring that all costs are actual, reasonable, and necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64 (\"Fannie Mae will reimburse the servicer [for out-of-pocket costs that it pays to third-party vendors of the courts], as long as the costs are actual, reasonable and necessary\").

For example, Freddie Mac requires that its servicers submit annual eligibility certifications attesting to compliance with Freddie Mac requirements,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88, including the requirement that servicers manage the foreclosure process \"in a cost-effective, expeditious, and efficient manner,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   1 89, \"create and implement a quality control program\" to ensure the same,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90, and impose \"policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that firms handling Freddie Mac Default Matters are in compliance with [ ] the applicable provisions of the Guide, and applicable law,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93. Freddie Mac also requires that servicers require law firms to \"disclose the identity of, and relationship with any entities the firm relies upon to provide third-party support functions performed on the Servicer's behalf, including, but not limited to, title searches, title insurance, posting, publication, and process services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92. Servicers must also require firms to disclose whether they have \"a process to select and regularly review costs and performance of vendors of related sources to ensure competitive pricing and high quality.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Freddie Mac permits reimbursement only of those costs that are \"reasonable and comparable to those customarily charged in the area where the property is located.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (\"Servicers must ensure that attorney fees and costs incurred are reasonable and comparable to those charged in the area where the property is located.\") (quoting Freddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide Bulletin Number 2013-6 (Apr. 15, 2013) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Against this background, Cenlar, Citi, Everbank, Flagstar, Green Tree, Nutter, MetLife, Nationstar, OneWest, PHH, PNC, SunTrust, U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase overcharged Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the FHA hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 1-3, 11.

These affiliates, it is alleged, were designed to generate invoices for unnecessary services and charge excessive rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   The affiliates passed these costs on to the law firms, the law firms passed them on to the servicers, and, upon information and belief, the servicers passed them on to the Government.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Rosicki, for example, controls Enterprise-a service-of-process affiliate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CII \u00b6 54. Rather than actually serve process, however, Enterprise allegedly hired third-party vendors to serve process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. These vendors charged Enterprise approximately $15-25 for each individual served.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. Enterprise then generated invoices for service of process charging between $75 and $125.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72. These invoices exceeded competitive market rates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. Enterprise charged these amounts to Rosicki, which charged them to the Servicers. Enterprise also regularly billed for unnecessary expenses including service upon the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance despite the absence of any tax lien; service upon judgment debtors with names similar to the foreclosure defendant even though the relevant names were irreconcilable; ineffective and worthless service upon \"John Doe\" defendants; and services that were part of law firm overhead expenses such as court filings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 124. Similarly, Rosicki used Paramount to conduct title searches. Rather than do the work itself, however, Paramount engaged third-party abstractors at market rates to provide title documents and marked up their bills substantially (e.g. to $495 where market rates were between $100 and $250) before submitting them to Rosicki and the Servicers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 131; CII \u00b6\u00b6 79-82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   McCabe also used affiliates-AOSS and REO-to conduct title searches and serve process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 139-40. AOSS and REO billed McCabe and ultimately the FHA and the GSEs at excessive rates including at more than $450 for title searches despite market rates between $100 and $250, and for personal service at more than $200 despite market rates of approximately $20 to $40.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 141. Like Paramount and Enterprise, AOSS and REO often contracted with other entities to conduct the actual work and marked up the bills before seeking reimbursement from McCabe and thereafter from the Servicers. Although McCabe could have contracted with these entities directly, McCabe chose instead to contract with its affiliates in order to mark up the bills and generate profits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Upon information and belief, the Servicer Defendants submitted these false claims to the GSEs and FHA in order to save resources that they would otherwise have had to expend on compliance, quality control, and efforts to negotiate better prices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. If the Servicers had monitored and refused to pay unreasonable and unnecessary fees, Relator posits, neither Rosicki's affiliates, McCabe's affiliates, or the other vendors mentioned in the complaints would have been able to continue billing for unnecessary and unreasonable foreclosure expenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118. The Servicers Defendants perpetuated this scheme over many years by falsely certifying to the GSEs and to the FHA that their claims were accurate and that they were in compliance with their contractual commitments to monitor foreclosure costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 120. To this day, upon information and belief, the Servicer Defendants have improperly retained the overpayments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 12. And they have done so despite contractual obligations to refund the GSEs and FHA and despite red flags including knowledge that the Justice Department was investigating the overpayments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 486.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The operative complaints include over sixty specific examples of foreclosure actions in which Rosicki, McCabe, and other law firms charged unreasonable or unnecessary expenses, which the Servicer Defendants, upon information and belief, submitted for reimbursement to FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 170-474; SAC \u00b6\u00b6 163-332; CII \u00b6\u00b6 87-123. In one instance, Rosicki foreclosed on a property on Lake Street in Angola, New York.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87. Rosicki contracted with Enterprise to effect service of process on the two named foreclosure defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88. Enterprise, however, did not serve the process; instead it contracted with a third-party to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The third-party process server charged $20 for one of the named defendants, $10 for the other, and $33.50 for four Doe defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89. Enterprise then charged Rosicki $50 for attempted service on each named defendant, $125 for service on each named defendant, and $300 for the four Doe defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90. Thus, while service of process actually cost $63.50, Fannie Mae ultimately paid $650.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 89-90. Rosicki also contracted with Paramount to perform a title search for the Lake Street property. Rather than do the work itself, Paramount engaged a third-party vendor. Thereafter, Paramount submitted a bill for $275, the maximum amount allowed by Fannie Mae, as well as a $35 document retrieval fee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In another instance, Flagstar foreclosed on a Fannie Mae mortgage secured by a property on East 45\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street in Brooklyn, New York.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 206.

Rosicki contracted with Enterprise to bill for service of process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 208. Enterprise invoiced Rosicki approximately $125 per defendant for each of the defendants at the property, well above market rates of $20-$40 per person, which, upon information and belief, Enterprise itself paid to a third-party process server who actually performed the work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 209. Similarly, Paramount billed $495 for title searches related to that property, well above the market rate of between $100 and $250, which, upon information and belief, is what Paramount paid to the third-party company that actually conducted the title search.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 211.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Grubea discovered defendants' fraudulent scheme in the course of his bankruptcy practice when he noticed a pattern of foreclosure-related proofs-of-claims presenting unreasonable costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 489. Frequently, when he challenged servicers on these costs in his clients' bankruptcy proceedings, the servicers or their agents, the law firms, reduced the claim amounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thereafter, Grubea conducted additional market research,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and obtained direct and independent knowledge of the schemes through communications with lawyers from foreclosure law firms,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 490, including a partner at Steven J.

Although counsel also alleged at oral argument that Grubea had raised the issue of inflated charges with more than one Servicer Defendant, his counsel failed to name even one or to\n   provide the particulars of any such conversation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 43. Moreover, these alleged conversations seem to have resulted in nothing more than foreclosure charges being lowered in certain bankruptcy cases involving Grubea's clients.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42 (\"[w]hen he brought it to their attention, often they simply said, OK, we'll mark that back down\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In other words, rather than basing his complaints on any particularized information about the Servicer Defendants, Grubea asks the Court to infer their knowledge or recklessness from sixty-odd examples of excessive charges billed by Rosicki, McCabe, and other law firms in various foreclosure actions around the country.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Grubea these examples are \"illustrative of the manner in which\" the Servicer Defendants \"engaged in wrongdoing.\" TAC \u00b6 169. Grubea, however, says nothing about how these examples were compiled (whether they represent 5% of foreclosure charges submitted by the various individual Servicer Defendants, 50% of foreclosure charges, or .5% of foreclosure charges). Nor does Grubea have any information about whether the Servicer Defendants actually passed on these charges to the Government, and if they did, whether they did so recklessly. He knows nothing about what compliance systems the Servicers did or did not have in place. Indeed, he alleges nothing in particular about any of the Servicer Defendants except that they serviced the mortgages mentioned in the complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In this regard, it is relevant that the mere fact of the charged amounts themselves do not support a strong inference of gross negligence on the part of the Servicers. The amounts are facially believable-after all, for the scheme alleged against the law firm defendants to work, it was necessary that the charges be below various absolute cut-offs established by the GSEs and FHA. It is also relevant that the various law firms had a fiduciary duty to honestly represent their costs, and, as regards charges submitted to FHA, that the Servicers were on the hook for one-third of the bill no matter what.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HUD Handbook 4330.4, 2-15(C)(2) (\"HUD will calculate the two-thirds allowance based on the amounts entered on the claim form.\"). Accordingly, in the absence of particularized pleadings that would permit the Court to infer that these sixty examples are, in fact, representative of the tens of thousands of mortgages defendants service each year, or facts regarding Defendants' actual servicing practices, Relator's allegations are based on little more than conjecture. At best, they support an inference that the servicers were negligent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Relator's pleadings also fail to satisfy Rule 9(b) because Relator's basis for alleging that the Servicers recklessly passed on fraudulent claims to the Government is merely that the law firms were generating fraudulent claims \"for years and years with no changes,\" \"one of the servicers [HSBC] that was alleged to have participated in this conduct admitted exactly what the allegations were,\" and \"the most plausible allegation is that nothing happened to interrupt the flow of improper charges.\" Tr. at 43-44. A complaint fails to satisfy Rule 9(b), however, where it alleges \"nothing at all\" with respect to how each individual defendant \"did or did not perform\" its obligations, \"except to make the bare assertion that the results in and of themselves show\" that the defendants \"must not have done so.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

Among other things, the McCabe Defendants argue that the three examples of fraud by those defendants alleged by Relator in his complaint are conclusory and do not give rise to a strong inference of fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AOSS Mem. at 8-9; McCabe Mem. at 6-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   To satisfy Rule 9(b), a complaint must \"(1) specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent, (2) identify the speaker, (3) state where and when the statements were made, and (4) explain why the statements were fraudulent.\"\n   <em>\n    Ladas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323231\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/16/#p26\">\n    824 F.3d at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The first involves a Freddie Mac mortgage on a property in Penfield, New York (the \"Katsura Court property\"). Relator alleges that Flagstar retained McCabe to handle the foreclosure on the Katsura Court property and that, upon information and belief, McCabe retained REO and AOSS to conduct a title search and serve process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 302-310. Relator further alleges that, upon information and belief, AOSS invoiced McCabe for service of process at an amount \"above market rates,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 305, and REO charged McCabe $450 for title work, at an amount \"well above market rates,\" which were between $100 and $250,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 307.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The second example involves a Freddie Mac mortgage secured by a property located on Columbia Street in Hamburg, New York (the \"Columbia Street property\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 325. Relator alleges that PNC retained McCabe to handle the foreclosure on the Columbia Street property, and that, upon information and belief, McCabe retained AOSS and REO to serve process and conduct a title search.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 325-333. Relator further alleges that, upon information and belief, AOSS invoiced McCabe for service of process at \"an amount above market rates,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 328, and that, upon information and belief, REO billed $450, an amount \"well above market rates,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 330.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The third example involves an FHA insured mortgage secured by a property on O'Brien Avenue in the Bronx, New York (the \"O'Brien Avenue property\"). Relator alleges that Flagstar retained McCabe to handle the foreclosure on O'Brien Avenue, and that, upon information and belief, McCabe retained AOSS to serve process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 400-06. Relator further alleges that, upon information and belief, AOSS invoiced McCabe for service of process at \"an amount above market rates.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 403. No mention is made of whether REO was involved in this foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   These three foreclosures, even taken together, do not give rise to a strong inference of fraud. The allegations regarding the O'Brien Avenue property, for example, are entirely conclusory. Relator states merely that AOSS invoiced McCabe at above-market rates. Relator nowhere specifies the amount AOSS charged (i.e. the fraudulent statement). In fact, in its moving papers McCabe argues that AOSS was not even hired to conduct service of process on this property. According to McCabe, a third-party vendor, Servium, served process and charged $520.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McCabe Mem. at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As regards the Columbia Street and Katsura Court properties, Relator similarly fails to specify what AOSS charged. Relator instead merely asserts that AOSS billed McCabe an amount \"well above market rates.\" Again, in its moving papers McCabe argues that AOSS was not retained to work on these foreclosures at all.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. And, as regards REO, although Relator specifies the amount REO billed McCabe to perform title searches on these properties ($450), Relator does not allege that REO outsourced this work to a third-party for a lower price (as is alleged with respect to work performed by AOSS and other affiliates in this case).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly,\n   the complaint alleges a total of two fraudulent statements involving McCabe: REO's $450 charge to conduct a title search on the Columbia Street property and REO's $450 charge to do the same for the Katsura Court property. These amounts, although potentially inflated, are facially plausible, and Relator makes no allegation that REO outsourced the work to a third party for a substantially lower rate. Accordingly, in the absence of further\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   pleadings, these allegations are not sufficient to state a claim under the FCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In his answering papers, Relator offers to cure these deficiencies by supplementing his complaint with additional examples. Specifically, Relator proposes to incorporate two examples already included in Relator's complaint in the Second Suit (to which the McCabe Defendants are not a party).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 187-95, 251-59. Among other things, these examples specify the actual amounts billed by AOSS.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 192 (alleging that AOSS invoiced McCabe approximately $133 for service on each defendant at a property in Beacon, New York);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (alleging that $133 was well above market rates of between $20 and $40);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (alleging that AOSS hired a third party process service vendor to serve each defendant at the Beacon property and paid that vendor market rates). These examples also specify that REO hired a third party vendor to conduct title searches at market rates of between $100 and $250 and marked up those invoices to $445 before passing them on to McCabe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 190.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Relator further points to an affidavit that includes additional examples of fraudulent conduct including one example in which AOSS billed $836 for personal service on two defendants, three attempts at service, and mailings, all of which should have cost less than $150. Relator Mem. at 10 n.5 (citing Declaration of Kaleigh Erin Wood dated May 7, 2018 (\"Wood Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 8-23, Exs. 2-3, 5-6, Dkt. 152). According to Relator, McCabe chose not to contract directly with the process server-who charged $30 for personal service-but to route service through AOSS so that AOSS could aggressively mark up the bill before seeking reimbursement. Wood Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   These examples are precisely the sort of specific allegations that are lacking in the Third Amended Complaint but that are necessary to state a claim for fraud under the FCA. Accordingly, the Court dismisses Relator's complaint as against the McCabe Defendants'\n   <em>\n    without prejudice\n   </em>\n   to Relator further amending it to incorporate these\n   allegations, provided such amended pleadings are filed no later than July 11, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The servicers obtained reimbursements from the Government by submitting claims for payment that relied on the half-truths represented by the Rosicki Defendants. When submitting claims to HUD, the servicers used Form 27011, which requires each mortgagee to itemize foreclosure costs in Box 307 to obtain reimbursement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 108.

Freddie Mac's rules require that expenses in these categories be actual, reasonable, and necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 94. When submitting claims to Fannie Mae, the servicers submit Form 571, which requires them to itemize foreclosure costs and expenses by type.

Because Fannie Mae's Board has discretion as to whether to make a dividend payment, Rosicki argues, Fannie Mae did not have an \"obligation\" within the meaning of the FCA. Rosicki cites the Third Circuit's holding that a company's contractual promise to pay dividends to the Small Business Administration was \"contingent on the Board's declaration of dividends,\" and was not an \"obligation\" for FCA purposes because it was \"dependent on a future discretionary act.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

And, even in the event that Fannie Mae's Board of Directors were to elect not to declare a dividend for a given quarter-something that has never occurred in more than five years-the payment obligation to the Government would not disappear. Section 2(b) of the Fannie Mae Senior\n   Preferred Stock Certificates provides that to the extent dividends on the Senior Preferred Stock are not paid, the dividends \"shall accrue and shall be added to the Liquidation Preference [retained by the Government] pursuant to Section 8, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends and whether or not dividends are declared.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Mem. at 26;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perry Capital LLC v.

Indeed, in that case, the relator did not even allege that \"the Board declared the dividends or had an inclination to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at n.50. Here, Fannie Mae's obligation to the Government did materialize-dividend payments pursuant to the Third Amendment were made routinely in accordance with the specific schedule set forth in the Third Amendment. And even if Fannie Mae had declined to make one or more of its dividend payments, the payment obligation remained intact. Accordingly, the Government and Relator have adequately alleged an obligation by Fannie Mae to pay funds to the United States beginning in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Rosicki Defendants also argue that the complaints do not plead a reasonably close nexus between their conduct and any funds owed to the Government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rosicki Mem. at 37-38. As Rosicki puts it, because the theory of liability here would cover a contractor who fraudulently overcharged Fannie Mae for lawn maintenance (i.e. such a fraudulent payment would also \"decrease the amount of dividend payments\" that Fannie Mae could make to the Government), the theory of reverse false claims liability is too broad.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   But, quite aside from the fact that this case does not involve lawn mowers, Rosicki offers no support for this purported \"nexus\" requirement.

Thus, every dollar subtracted from the bottom line of the GSEs by fraud is potentially passed along to the Government to the extent it results in or worsens a net shortfall. In the event of a net shortfall, the Government is contractually obligated to cover the shortfall. Indeed, the\n   Government did so to the tune of billions of dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Although defendants also argue that, unless the funds are traceable directly to Government disbursements there is a slippery slope towards liability for anyone who benefits from federal aid, previous courts have rejected this argument. The D.C. Circuit, for example, posited in a similar context that \"[i]t may not be appropriate\" to impose FCA liability if (1) \"the grantee's federal funds are an insubstantial percentage of its total budget,\" (2) \"there is little likelihood that any of a defendant's money actually came from a federal grant,\" or (3) \"there is little continuing contact between the grantee and the government once the grant is made.\"\n   <em>\n    Yesudian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2338922,11707270\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/731/\">\n    153 F.3d at 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the bailout funds in this case are vastly larger than the annual revenues of the GSEs. Accordingly, during the period when the GSEs were losing money, the claims were virtually guaranteed to be paid with federal funds. Beginning in 2013, once the GSEs began to earn profits, each GSE was obligated to pay Treasury its net worth each quarter less a small capital buffer, such that any request for payment on a false claim after 2013 decreased the amount that Treasury received from the GSEs dollar-for-dollar. Accordingly, adopting a definition of \"claim\" that would include the GSEs would not expand the FCA beyond Congress' intent, rather it would allow the Government to prosecute fraud on behalf of a taxpayer-supported entity that is in federal conservatorship-precisely what Congress had in mind when it amended the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Defendants separately argue that the complaints fail to overcome an additional requirement under the FCA that the alleged false claims \"cause economic loss to the government.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Servicer Mem. at 36 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Garg v.

The $87 billion figure does not represent a profit, as none of the Treasury's principal investment has been repaid. Rather the dividends that Treasury has received are equivalent to interest payments owed to the taxpayers for putting their capital at risk. It is inapposite to whether the false claims in this case caused an economic loss to the Government that, as the supermajority shareholder of the GSEs, the Treasury may ultimately earn substantial returns on its investment. It would still be the case that every dollar extracted from the GSEs by fraud would be a dollar less in return to the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Accordingly, because the claims paid for reimbursement of foreclosure expenses were monies \"spent or used [ ] to advance a Government program or interest\" and because the Government provided a \"portion of the money or property requested or demanded,\" the Court finds that the operative complaints adequately allege \"claims\" within the meaning of the FCA as regards Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
