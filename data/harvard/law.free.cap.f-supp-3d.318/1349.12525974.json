Plaintiff filed a response in opposition to the motion (DE 26), and Defendants filed a reply (DE 28). For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's motion to dismiss is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case is a putative class action purportedly arising out of the Medicare Secondary Payer Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y (the \"MSPA\"). Plaintiff MSPA Claims I, LLC (the \"Assignee Plaintiff\") alleges that Defendants Tenet Florida, Inc. and St. Mary's Medical Center, Inc. (the \"Provider Defendants\") failed to reimburse Florida Healthcare Plus (\"FHCP\")-the assignor Medicare Advantage Organization (\"MAO\")-for conditional payments made on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries who were separately covered by a private insurer qualifying as a primary payer under the MSPA. In addition to the MSPA Claim (Count I), the Second Amended Complaint includes a claim under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"FDUTPA\") (Count II), a claim for unjust enrichment (\"Count III\"), and two claims for declaratory relief (Counts IV and V).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Medicare Secondary Payer Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The specific structure of Medicare payments under the MSPA is explained in detail in Plaintiffs' complaint. In general terms, the MSPA makes Medicare a \"secondary payer\" to other sources of coverage, and entitles them to reimbursement from a \"primary payer\"-once liability has been established with regard to that other entity-for any conditional payments made by Medicare on behalf of the beneficiary. The Act provides for a \"private cause of action for damages\" in the event that a primary payer fails to fulfill its reimbursement obligations under the MSPA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 17 \u00b6\u00b6 33-42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Plaintiff is a limited liability company that receives assignments from various entities to pursue claims arising out of the MSPA. Plaintiff argues that it has standing to bring these claims under the private right of action authorized by the MSPA because an MAO-FHCP-has assigned its recovery rights to Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   An MAO is a private insurer who has entered into a contract with the United States Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") to provide traditional Medicare coverage to Medicare beneficiaries. They receive a fixed payment from Medicare for each Medicare-covered enrollee, and then directly pay providers for any services rendered to those individuals. Depending on the services required during the coverage period, the MAO then absorbs the profit or loss based on the differential between the payments made to providers and the fixed payment received from Medicare. Because they provide traditional Medicare services, MAOs are entitled to \"exercise the same rights to recover from a primary plan, entity or individual that the Secretary exercises under the MSP regulations.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20422.108\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) ). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 17 \u00b6\u00b6 24-32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Hospital Services Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Separate and apart from their rights and obligations under the MSPA, an MAO may enter into agreements with medical providers regarding the provision of covered services to the MAO enrollees. Those agreements are not governed by the MSPA, but are private contractual agreements regarding the relationship between the two entities involved. In this case, FCHP entered into a Hospital Services Agreement (the \"Services Agreement\") with Tenet Florida, Inc. on behalf of St. Mary's Medical Center on July 16, 2013. (DE 17 \u00b6 56). That agreement governed the relationship between FCHP and the Provider Defendants, and, among other things, explained the payment mechanism for services provided to MAO enrollees and set out the manner in which the Parties were entitled to resolve any disputes relating to their arrangement. (DE 17 \u00b6\u00b6 57-60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 3, 2013, an FHCP enrollee was involved in an automobile accident and received medical treatment at St. Mary's. (DE 17 \u00b6\u00b6 44-45). The enrollee was covered both by FCHP and by a private, no-fault insurer-Allstate Fire and Casualty Insurance Company (\"Allstate\")-at the time those services were rendered. (DE 17 \u00b6\u00b6 43, 46). St. Mary's billed both FHCP and Allstate for the medical treatment in the amount of $2086.00. (DE 17 \u00b6\u00b6 47-49). FHCP made a payment of $285.75, and Allstate made a payment of $1,251.60. (DE 17 \u00b6\u00b6 48-49). St. Mary's then reimbursed FCHP in the full amount of its conditional payment-$285.75-based upon the payment by Allstate as a primary payer under the MSPA. (DE 17 \u00b6 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Standing for the MSPA Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Though a valid assignment of recovery rights may allow Assignee Plaintiffs to stand in the shoes of an MAO and bring suit under the MSPA to redress an injury suffered by that MAO assignor, it remains the Plaintiffs' obligation to demonstrate both a valid assignment and an underlying injury to the assignor. With regard to the assignment, the Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate either of these elements of standing, because the Services Agreement signed by the Parties contained a non-assignment provision, making any purported assignment of rights under that contract presumptively invalid. As to the injury, Defendants argue that the full repayment of FHCP's $285.75 conditional payment upon receipt of payment from Allstate two years before this suit was initiated defeats any claims of an injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff first responds by asserting that it has standing because the assignment of recovery rights under the MSPA-which is the basis for these claims-is independent from an assignment of rights under the Services Agreement, which contains the non-assignment clause. In addition, Plaintiff argues that the Provider Defendants' failure to reimburse FHCP within 60 days subjects them to double damages and interest,\n   and therefore Plaintiff has pleaded an injury in fact despite the full reimbursement of the conditional payments made by FHCP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Because Plaintiff's claims under Count I allegedly relate to recovery rights under the MSPA and not contractual obligations under the Services Agreement, the Court agrees that the anti-assignment provision of the Services Agreement is not germane to the question of standing on the MSPA claims. Still, the Court need not evaluate the validity of the MSPA recovery assignment here, because Plaintiff's allegations regarding actual injury are deficient. In the Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff acknowledges, for the first time, that St. Mary's repaid Medicare in full for the conditional payments made on behalf of the enrollee upon receipt of payment from Allstate, a primary payer. Still, Plaintiff states that \"St. Mary's was required to pay $2,086.00, representing the charged amount billed to Plaintiff within sixty (60) days of the receipt of the payment\" and that failure to do so entitles Plaintiff to double damages under the statute.

Putting aside the fact that Plaintiff provides no basis-legally, factually, or statutorily-for that assertion in either the briefing on this motion or the Second Amended Complaint, this contention is directly belied by the language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20411.24\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 411.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which is entitled \"Recovery of Conditional Payments\" and states under Section (c) \"Amount of recovery\": (1) If it is not necessary for CMS to take legal action to recover, CMS recovers the\n   <strong>\n    lesser\n   </strong>\n   of the following: (i) The amount of the Medicare primary payment[; or] (ii) The full primary payment amount that the primary payer is obligated to pay under this part ....\" (emphasis added).

And though Plaintiff has cited to numerous sections of the MSPA statute and the corresponding regulations that permit recovery of payments in a variety of circumstances, none of those provisions alter the plain language of \u00a7 1395y(b)(3)(A), which must be the basis for this suit.

Specifically, Plaintiff contends that certain provisions of the Services Agreement conflict with the MSPA, and therefore asks the Court to declare certain portions of the Services Agreement void and unenforceable, to declare that the provisions of the MSPA preempt any contrary obligations under the Services Agreement, and to declare that Plaintiff is entitled to attorney's fees under the Services Agreement. (DE 17 \u00b6\u00b6 127, 136).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As an initial matter, based on the Court's finding that the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint do not give rise to a claim under the MSPA, any remaining challenges to the payments received by FHCP from the Provider Defendants would arise under the Services Agreement. As Defendants point out, that agreement contains an anti-assignment provision, and the Second Amended Complaint articulates no basis for invalidating that provision and permitting Plaintiff to challenge the terms of that private contract to which Plaintiff is not a party. Put differently, even if Plaintiff had established a valid assignment with regard to recovery rights under the MSPA, Plaintiff has not established any independent basis for challenging the terms of the Services agreement as it seeks to do in Counts IV and V, and indeed concedes in its brief that FHCP did not assign its rights under the Services Agreement to Plaintiff. (DE 26 at 10 (\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FHCP\n     <em>\n      never\n     </em>\n     assigned its contract rights under the Tenet Agreement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Even if Plaintiff were permitted to challenge the terms of the Services Agreement under the Declaratory Judgment Act, those claims fail because Plaintiff has not pled any conflict between the provisions of the Services Agreement-which govern FHCP's rights and obligations relating to the provision of services to MAO enrollees\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   -and the MSPA-which governs\n   FHCP's reimbursement rights relating to primary payers under the Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Plaintiff has pointed to no provision of the Services Agreement that actually undermines or affects any of FHCP's rights under the MSPA. Therefore, the Court finds that there is no \"actual controversy\" as would be required for jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act, and Plaintiff's declaratory judgment claims must be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    GEICO Gen.
