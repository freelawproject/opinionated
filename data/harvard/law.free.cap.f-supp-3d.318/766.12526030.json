Bredar, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Kurt Eichenwald brought this action against Defendant John Rivello over a year ago, on April 24, 2017. (Corrected Compl., ECF No. 2.). Defendant is facing criminal charges related to the same incident underlying this civil case, and therefore this case was stayed on August 28, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Paperless Order, ECF No. 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On March 6, 2018, the Court partially lifted the stay and ordered Defendant to respond to Plaintiff's complaint by March 21, 2018. (Order to Partially Lift Stay, ECF No. 24.) Defendant responded by answering Counts II and III of Plaintiff's complaint (Ans., ECF No. 25), and moving to dismiss Counts I and IV (Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 26). Plaintiff has responded to Defendant's motion (ECF No. 27) and Defendant has replied (ECF No. 30). Therefore, Defendant's motion to dismiss is fully briefed and ripe for review. There is no need to hold a hearing to resolve the matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 105.6 (D. Md. 2016). Defendant's characterization of Texas law regarding civil battery is incorrect, and the Court will not foreclose Plaintiff's attempt to try his fourth count in a different court or at a later time. Accordingly, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Defendant's motion to dismiss, and dismiss Count IV of Plaintiff's complaint without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is a journalist and author currently living in Texas. (Corrected Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-4.) Plaintiff's work is well known. He writes for Newsweek and Vanity Fair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) He worked for years at the New York Times, has authored four books, and has won several awards including the George Polk Award (twice). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.) He is an active Twitter user, having posted over 50,000 tweets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff also has epilepsy. (Corrected Compl. \u00b6 5.) He was diagnosed at age 18, and \"suffered from frequent seizures as a young adult.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Medication has helped reduce the number of seizures, but he continues to experience them. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8.) Plaintiff has been public about his condition in the past and in 2016 wrote an article, published in Newsweek, titled \"Sean Hannity: Apologize to Those with Epilepsy, or Burn in Hell.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the 2016 election, Plaintiff was often critical of then-candidate Donald J. Trump, and expressed those views in his writing and on his Twitter account. (Corrected Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) Plaintiff \"received numerous threats and messages over the Internet\" as a result of his public criticism, and wrote about the online abuse for Newsweek in October 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Kurt Eichenwald,\n   <em>\n    How Donald Trump Supporters Attack Journalists\n   </em>\n   , Newsweek, ECF No. 1-7 (hereinafter \"October 2016 Article\").) In that article, Plaintiff wrote about one instance of online harassment in particular. Plaintiff \"received a tweet from someone with the twitter handle 'Mike's Deplorable AF.' \" (October 2016 Article at 2.) In that tweet \"Mike made mention of [Plaintiff's] seizures and included a small video.... The video was some sort of strobe light, with flashing circles and images ... flying toward the screen.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The video was \"epileptogenic,\" meaning it \"triggers seizures.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff did not suffer a seizure upon opening this video, however, because he quickly dropped the device. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Two months later, on December 15, 2016, a Twitter user with the handle @jew_goldstein, replied to one of Plaintiff's tweets. (Corrected Compl. \u00b6 33.) When Plaintiff \"clicked on the notification button on twitter,\" the replies to his tweet \"immediately loaded,\" including the reply from @jew_goldstein. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) The tweet included (and immediately displayed) a Graphic Interchange Format (\"GIF\") that contained \"an animated strobe image flashing at a rapid speed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) In addition to the flashing images, the GIF contained the message \"YOU DESERVE A SEIZURE FOR YOUR POSTS.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Strobe GIF, Compl. \u00b6 41.) Upon seeing the rapidly flashing GIF, \"Plaintiff suffered a severe seizure.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For reasons that will become clear, it is necessary to briefly discuss the physical reactions that led to Plaintiff's seizure. Light comes in rays, or waves, comprised in part by photons. (Corrected Compl. \u00b6 24.) These waves sometimes reflect off objects and \"strike a person's cornea,\" which \"focuses the light wave.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) The eye focuses the wave onto its retina, which through a process of \"visual phototransduction,\" converts the light wave into electrical impulses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.) That is, photons hit the retina and are converted into electrical signals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.) These electrical signals are then transmitted by the optic nerve to the visual cortex. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) Such electrical signals from strobing images \"can trigger seizures in certain individuals with epilepsy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) So, Defendant intentionally caused photons to hit Plaintiff's retina, causing Plaintiff to suffer a seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff's wife witnessed the seizure and, after caring for Plaintiff, called the police. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50-51.) According to information obtained as a result of the criminal investigation, Defendant, who lives in Maryland, operated the @jew_goldstein account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) Defendant discussed with others his intent to harm Plaintiff by causing a seizure. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57-61.) Defendant was arrested on March 17, 2017, and three days later a grand jury indicted him for the offense of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. (\u00b6\u00b6 55, 65;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Indictment, ECF No. 1-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff continued to suffer as a result of the December 15 seizure. He experienced another seizure in his sleep, and he had to take increased medication, which left him sedated and disabled during the holidays. (Corrected Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 68-70.) He \"required assistance from his family to perform routine tasks,\" and was \"embarrassed, humiliated, and deeply upset,\" as a result of this incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70-71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   With the criminal case against Defendant still pending, Plaintiff filed a civil case against Defendant in this Court on April 24, 2017. Plaintiff brought four claims: (I) battery, (II) assault, (III) intentional infliction of emotional distress, and (IV) \"purposeful infliction of bodily harm/\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   tort under Texas law.\" (Corrected Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 74-88.) The civil case was stayed pending resolution of the criminal case, but in an earlier order the Court partially lifted that stay and ordered Defendant to respond to Plaintiff's corrected complaint by March 21, 2018. Defendant responded on that date, answering Counts II and III, and moving to dismiss Counts I and IV. Defendant's motion to dismiss is fully briefed and ripe, and the Court will turn now to its disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A complaint must contain \"sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

According to this argument, both causes of action are now melded into a single cause of action, \"assault,\" and although a plaintiff can recover for an intentional harmful or offensive touching, he cannot recover for both an intentional harmful or offensive touching and the threat of such a touching. Insofar as this is a proper reading of Defendant's argument, it still fails. As Plaintiff's complaint stands, he alleges that Defendant's intentional tortious conduct a) caused him to suffer physical harm and b) put him in fear of immediate physical harm. Under Texas law, he can recover for both. If it turns out that he can only\n   <em>\n    prove\n   </em>\n   physical harm, or only apprehension of immediate harm, that does not mean it is improper to\n   <em>\n    plead\n   </em>\n   both torts in his complaint. Furthermore, at least at this early stage Plaintiff can plead as many alternative, or even inconsistent, causes of action and legal theories as he pleases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R.

Dec. 3, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendant here allegedly chose to use the electronic capabilities of a computer as a weapon-as a means of causing physical harm. Defendant's tweet, activating certain harmful capabilities of the transmitting computer, converted the computer into a weapon to inflict physical injury. The computer and the tweet were no longer merely a mode of communication. Something more, and separate, from mere communication occurred ... an offensive touching. And, conscious interpretation of the \"message\" was irrelevant to the offensive touching.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The physical element that Defendant caused to come into contact with Plaintiff was something entirely outside either party's mind. It was not words or pictures that would require conscious interpretation (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   an internal process) to cause an impact. The strobe GIF was a physical tool, one that would have the same impact on any person with Plaintiff's condition. It would not have mattered if the GIF had displayed hateful words, words of kindness, certain colors or pictures, or only abstractions. What mattered was the physical nature of the light emitted from the GIF. The light, and not the emotional or intellectual impact of any accompanying message, caused a seizure, and it would not have caused a seizure if viewed by a person without epilepsy, regardless of whether they interpreted the tweet as mean-spirited, frightening, or friendly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   To be sure, Plaintiff has not presented the Court with a case in which a Texas court found a battery under the circumstances presented here. And the Court has found none. But the Court also has not found any Texas case establishing that the use of a laser-beam, or a sonic weapon, constitutes a battery. Yet if a person used a laser to intentionally blind another, or a sonic weapon to intentionally cause permanent hearing loss, the Court is confident that a Texas court would find a battery, even though the contact at issue was \"only\" a beam of light or a sound wave. That no Texas case exists where a plaintiff was harmed by an epileptogenic GIF in a tweet is neither troubling nor surprising. The broad sweep of Texas tort precedents provides firm ground on which to find that this unique fact pattern, if proven, qualifies as \"battery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Although neither party has presented the Court with a case that is entirely on point, neither party has presented the Court with a Texas case that would prevent relief for the contact Plaintiff has alleged here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Texas law does not suggest that knowledge of the specific physical reactions involved in the contact is needed to support the intent necessary for a claim of battery. That a tortfeasor is unaware exactly how a bullet is fired from a gun, or how exactly a poison would cause an illness, does not mean that his shooting or poisoning a victim is not a battery. Defendant here may not have reasoned through the exact physical properties that comprise the harmful touching in this case, but he allegedly knew that the GIF would cause a seizure, and he allegedly intended that the GIF cause a seizure. Ultimately, the Court has found no case law that forecloses the Plaintiff's avenue for relief, and it\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   found ample case law that supports his legal theory: that Defendant intentionally caused Plaintiff physical harm by means of a device, and that is a battery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n    <em>\n     Purposeful Infliction of Bodily Harm\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, Defendant has moved to dismiss Count IV on the ground that it is a tort \"\n   <em>\n    not yet recognized under Texas law\n   </em>\n   .\" (Reply 1, ECF No. 30.) Plaintiff concedes that the tort has not been recognized in Texas, and asks the Court to dismiss the claim without prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n 7, ECF No. 27.) Defendant argues that because this tort has not been recognized in Texas, Plaintiff can prove no set of facts upon which relief could be granted, thus Count IV should be dismissed\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   prejudice.
