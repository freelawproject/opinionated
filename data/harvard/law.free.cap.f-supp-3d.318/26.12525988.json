The Complaint alleges that TEN offered contracts for trade to U.S. customers that were off limits under the 2005 Commission Order, failed to provide the aforementioned pop-up notices to users of its website during the relevant period, neglected to notify the CFTC of its intent to change the individual designated to receive written requests arising from\n   the 2005 Commission Order, and failed to designate a new representative following the prior designee's withdrawal.

ECF No. 60. The Court also found that TEN violated the 2005 Commission Order by (1) allowing for US customers to trade those 5,503 option contracts, (2) failing to have blocks in place for U.S. customers on 2,027 prohibited option contracts, (3) lifting blocks on prohibited option contracts, and (4) failing to notify the CFTC of its intent to change its U.S. representative within fourteen days of the change.

Defendants Committed Serious Violations.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The CEA defines its purpose as \"serving the public interest ... through a system of effective self-regulation of trading facilities, clearing systems, market participants, and market professionals under the oversight of the [CFTC].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Defendants not only repeatedly violated the CEA, but did so in direct defiance of the 2005 Commission Order entered against TEN. Defendants' violations, therefore, severely compromised the regulatory purpose of the CEA and are serious.\n   <em>\n    In re Grossfeld\n   </em>\n   , [1996-1998 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 26,921 (CFTC Dec. 10, 1996),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"105963\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/137/1300/\">\n    137 F.3d 1300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 1998). Given that the initial $150,000 CMP entered against TEN as part of the 2005 Commission Order did not prevent defendants from continuing to violate the CEA, a substantial CMP is warranted for the purpose of maintaining the deterrence function of CMPs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Mitigating Circumstances Put Forth by Defendants Do Not Support a Minimal CMP.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants argue that their violations are the result of an ambiguous statutory duty or \"unsettled law\" and, therefore, do not warrant a substantial CMP. ECF No. 74 at 9-10. This argument fails because violations resulting from the statutory duty were by no means \"isolated.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    JCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416769\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/63/1557/#p1571\">\n    63 F.3d at 1571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that violations of the CEA committed \"knowingly and repeatedly\" do not serve to mitigate a defendant's culpability). Defendants allowed 1,275 U.S. customers to trade 5,503 prohibited contracts during the relevant period. ECF No. 77 at 12. The 2005 Commission Order provided unambiguous notice to defendant TEN that offering certain binary option contracts was forbidden under the CEA and was by no means \"unsettled law.\" ECF No. 47-3; ECF No. 71 at 18. Nevertheless, defendants traded contracts that were identical to those identified in the 2005 Commission Order. ECF No. 47-3 at \u00b6 9-11. Thus, plaintiff's characterization of defendants' misconduct as \"intentional\" and \"reckless\" is accurate. ECF No. 71 at 15. Defendants' prolonged non-compliance after the CFTC notified them of their failure to abide by the 2005 Commission Order further supports this characterization.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants argue that the violations at issue in this matter are the result of the \"unauthorized acts of a rogue\n   director.\" ECF No. 74 at 10. They claim that their then-director, Mr. John Delaney, acted beyond the scope of his authority in lifting the blocks that defendants had put in place as a result of the 2005 Commission Order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. But the text of the CEA forecloses this argument by stating that \"the act, omission, or failure of any official agent, or other person acting for an individual, association, partnership, corporation or trust within the scope of his employment or office shall be deemed the act, omission, or failure of such individual, association, partnership, corporation or trust, as well as of such official, agent or other person.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (emphasis added).

Whether or not Mr. Delaney was acting as an agent for defendants depends on \"an overall assessment of the totality of the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536252\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/855/1288/#p1291\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Berisko v. E. Capital Corp.\n   </em>\n   , [1984-1986 Transfer Binder] Com. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 22,772 (October 1, 1985) ). From 2003 until his death in May 2011, Mr. Delaney served as director and CEO of defendants TEN and Intrade. ECF No. 47-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 101-102. He executed the 2005 Offer of Settlement, wherein defendant TEN consented to the 2005 Commission Order. ECF No. 47.1 at \u00b6 19-22. An e-mail exchange between Mr. Delaney and Intrade's exchange operations manager, Mr. Wolfenden, reveals that he ordered Mr. Wolfenden to lift the trading blocks in order to facilitate trading activity on intrade.com. ECF No 47.1 at \u00b6\u00b6 125-32. The combination of these circumstances allows for the Court to find that Mr. Delaney acted as an official agent of defendants. Thus, defendants are strictly liable for his actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants' argument that Mr. Delaney's death undermines any deterrent effect of a CMP fails. ECF No. 74 at 11. Defendants continued to violate the CEA long after the death of Mr. Delaney in May 2011. ECF No. 77 at 15. In fact, defendants violated the CEA well after they were contacted by the CFTC following Mr. Delaney's death, only refraining from offering prohibited contracts after plaintiff filed its Complaint in November 2012.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536252\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/855/1288/#p1291\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Not only do these facts effectively negate defendants' depiction of Mr. Delaney's actions as \"unauthorized\" and \"rogue,\" it also underscores the necessity of imposing a substantial CMP for the sake of deterring such prolonged and brazen violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants argue that they received at most $52,294.96 in monetary benefits as a result of their violations. ECF No. 74 at 11. But the accounting method that defendants employ fails to account for the monetary benefits that indirectly resulted from their misconduct. By soliciting customers to trade prohibited option contracts, defendants generated new business and drew additional customers to their website to trade non-prohibited option contracts. Thus, the figure that defendants have put forth as \"minimal\" and mitigating is incomplete. Additionally, the CFTC has stated that benefitting in any way from a violation of the CEA is more serious than potentially benefitting.\n   <em>\n    JCC, Inc. v. CFTC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416769\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/63/1557/#p1571\">\n    63 F.3d 1557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1571 (11th Cir. 1995) (quoting\n   <em>\n    In Re Premex\n   </em>\n   , [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 24,165 (CFTC Feb. 17, 1988) ). In this instance, defendants' concession that they did benefit underscores the seriousness of their violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, the Court does not find defendants' return of funds that rightfully belonged to U.S. customers, and to which defendants had no legal right to retain, particularly persuasive as a basis for a minimal CMP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Facts Support a $3 Million CMP.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The CEA provides the Court with the authority to impose a penalty of $130,000 or $140,000 for each of defendants' violations, depending on the date. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 13a-1(d)(1)(A) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20143.8\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 143.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(h). The Court would, therefore, be well within its power to award a CMP exceeding $700 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the Court is aware of defendants' ongoing liquidation and considered their potential financial shortcomings in coming to a decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 92. The facts dictate that the prior, lesser penalty of $150,000 served as no deterrent to defendants. For the sake of maintaining the function of CMPs and upholding the regulatory purpose of the CEA and Commission Regulations, a more severe penalty is required. While the Court believes any CMP approaching $700 million would be excessive, the Court finds that defendants' repeated violations of the CEA and Commission Regulations, coupled with their brazen defiance of the 2005 Commission Order, warrant a CMP of $3 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For the aforementioned reasons, the Court finds that defendants' violations of the CEA and Commission Regulations warrant a substantial CMP.
