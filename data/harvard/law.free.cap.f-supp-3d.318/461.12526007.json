For the reasons set forth below, the aforementioned Motions to Dismiss and the Motion to Joinder (Docket Nos. 96, 99, 103, 104, 107, 108, 110, 113, 114, 115, 119, 131 and 132) are hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the outset, the Court notes that Plaintiffs' pleadings included in\n   <em>\n    the First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   filed under Docket No. 5 are unclear, very broad and often convoluted and/or of difficult understanding. As a result, this Court has undertaken a maximum of effort to fully comprehend Plaintiffs' allegations and will convey them in a general manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs brought a class action suit on behalf of themselves and Class Members who either have been subject to illegitimate foreclosures or sought modifications of payment on their individual mortgage loans through their mortgage servicers of Defendants. Plaintiffs contacted Defendants in an attempt to reduce their loan payments due to a reduction of job hours which affected their payment capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 5 at 6. The Defendants allegedly explained to Plaintiffs that they would submit Plaintiffs to a loss mitigation process which would make Plaintiffs eligible to make reduced monthly payments during a three-month trial period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 5 at 7. Plaintiffs allege they complied with the reduced payments but were still harassed by Defendants for delinquency of their payments. Plaintiffs assert that their rights under the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) were not acknowledged. The HAMP program provided a mechanism to stay any foreclosure proceedings and help Plaintiffs fulfill the promise of smaller loan payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs thus claim that Defendants' failure to honor the HAMP program provisions left them \"financially devastated.\" Docket No. 5 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   All Plaintiffs are residents of Puerto Rico with real estate property holdings in Puerto Rico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 5 at 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The unknown Plaintiffs, and the Class Members which they represent, are likewise described in very broad terms as any person who has real estate in Puerto Rico and whose real estate is encumbered by a mortgage loan serviced by any of the Defendants\n   in the instant case. The Class Members also include mortgagors who have complied with their obligations under the loan modification programs and have not received any of the benefits of the alleged modifications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 5 at 8. Defendants, on the other hand, are banks or mortgage loan servicers committed to providing mortgage loans to qualified individuals in Puerto Rico.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Unknown Defendants, on the other hand, are considered any bank, financial institution or mortgage loan servicers devoted to providing mortgage loans to qualified individuals with offices, branches and subsidiaries in Puerto Rico which can be liable for actions alleged in the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Plaintiffs alleged individual claims related to mortgage loan transactions with one or more of the Defendants. The Complaint, however, fails to specify which financial institution, i.e. which Defendant, financed which loan and/or were designated to provide services under federal laws, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\"RESPA\"), Home Affordable Modification Program (\"HAMP\"), Truth in Lending Act (\"TILA\"), and Home Affordable Refinance Program (\"HARP\"). The Plaintiffs instead seem to believe that their individual claims revolve around similar issues and can be addressed under one Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Moreover, Plaintiffs have yet to connect any facts regarding an \"injury in fact\" caused by Banco Popular as to any of the Plaintiffs. Hence, Plaintiffs cannot even survive the first standing element, let alone the other two.

Further, Banco Popular alleges that Plaintiffs failed to meet this requirement because Plaintiffs simply have no knowledge as to what actions they are alleging against Banco Popular.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guadalupe-Baez v.

Moreover, Banco Popular states that Plaintiffs instead make broad generalizations against Defendants, rather than identifying specific allegations regarding Banco Popular and which of the plaintiffs expressed allegations as to Banco Popular. They further assert that \"[t]his 'one-size-fits-all' approach to pleading is not a serious attempt at alleging\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   grievances concerning Plaintiffs' loans.\" Docket No. 96 at 5.

According to Banco Popular, this lack of compliance by the Plaintiffs with Rule 10(b) justifies dismissal of the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint.\n   </em>\n   While the First Circuit has not expressly ruled on noncompliance with Rule 10(b), other Circuits have been resolute that noncompliance may justify dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

To wit, Banco Popular states that \"[n]ot once in those ten pages are there any allegations, conclusory or otherwise.\" Docket No. 96 at 9.

It therefore also fails to provide a connection between RESPA's provisions and the claims for which relief can be granted for each Plaintiff. As highlighted by Banco Popular, the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   does not cite a single instance wherein Banco Popular can be found responsible of violating RESPA claims and evading RESPA allegations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   In fact, the only instance where Plaintiffs refer to Defendants in general in regards to RESPA claims, offers a disjointed and conclusory statement instead. This fact is evidenced when Plaintiffs state in their\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   that in regards to RESPA and Regulation X requirements, if the Plaintiffs were to comply \"with all the requirements ..., the Defendants would be placed, not only in their legal obligation to consider the Plaintiffs request for loss mitigation, but also, if the Defendants refused to comply with the protocol, appearing would be in their full right to initiate the corresponding claim action for damages.\" Docket No. 5 at 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   District and circuit courts have been resolute in stating that general statements such as these do not suffice to survive RESPA violation claims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sutton v.

Conclusory assertions do not suffice.\") Further, the Eleventh Circuit has stated, in particular in cases related to loss mitigation violations pursuant to Section 1024.41, as the Plaintiffs allege, that RESPA recognizes two types of damages which are an essential part of a RESPA claim: \"(1) actual damages the borrower sustained as a result of the RESPA violation and (2) 'any additional damages, as the court may allow, in the case of a pattern or practice of noncompliance with the requirements of this section, in an amount not to exceed $2,000.' \"\n   <em>\n    Lage v.

In the instant case, Defendant Banco Popular\n   claims that Defendants are improperly joined because the allegations included in the Complaint pertain to individual loans, which arose out of different transactions. Furthermore, Banco Popular claims that a significant number of Plaintiffs do not have a loan with Banco Popular and thus joinder is improper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 96 at 18-19. This Court has addressed misjoinder under Rule 20 multiple times before and has concluded that Plaintiffs whose claims arise out of unrelated transactions may not join in a suit.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pineiro D\u00edaz v.

Remedy for Misjoinder of Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Rule 21 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides a court with the power to sever a case or drop parties when parties are improperly joined. Banco Popular thus contends in its\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   that the first named plaintiff in the suit, Ms. Lilliam Gonz\u00e1lez Camacho, does not have a mortgage loan serviced nor originated by Banco Popular. Further, from the facts alleged in the instant case, she does not seem to claim to have said mortgage either.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 96 at 21. Thus, Banco Popular argues that the rest of the Plaintiffs, save for the first named Plaintiff, should have all their cases dismissed without prejudice and Banco Popular should be dismissed from the case at bar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PPV Connection, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3583895\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/679/254/#p258\">\n    679 F.Supp.2d at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Finally, Banco Popular notes that while typically a court could sever the claims against a certain defendant and thus create a separate suit only in regards to those claims, that is simply not reachable in the case at bar. Instead, Banco Popular argues that since the Court cannot determine from the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   which allegations pertain to Banco Popular and which pertain to the other Defendants,\n   Banco Popular should be dismissed altogether from the instant action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 96 at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   In their\n   <em>\n    Response in Opposition to Motions to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs failed to address any possible severance of Defendants and Plaintiffs' claims, simply stating instead that the \"parties are not misjoined.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 137. Banco Popular then filed a\n   <em>\n    Reply to Plaintiffs' Response in Opposition to Banco Popular's Motion to Dismiss the Complaint\n   </em>\n   wherein it stated that Plaintiffs' failed to include in their\n   <em>\n    Response\n   </em>\n   any counterarguments to Banco Popular's allegations that Plaintiffs' lack standing, failed to comply with Rule 9(b) and 10(b) and failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted. Banco Popular further claims that by not referencing said arguments in their\n   <em>\n    Response\n   </em>\n   , those claims are unopposed. Moreover, Banco Popular asserts that Plaintiff's counterclaims to Banco Popular's dismissal of legal issues related to joinder, Plaintiffs' naked assertions and possible future amendments, fail to address any these deficiencies. Therefore, they reiterate that the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   should be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 150.

Further as to the sufficiency of the allegations under Rule 12(b)(6), the Complaint is to also be dismissed. There simply are no facts alleged that any Plaintiffs is connected to any entitlement of relief as there are no facts specified by any Plaintiff against Banco Popular.

Further, the Defendants claim that without this \"basic information,\" it is impossible to determine what allegations relate to REO PR, Cayman and Rushmore versus what allegations pertain to the other named Defendants in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   In regards to the second flaw, REO PR, Cayman and Rushmore avers that no Plaintiff has stated in the Complaint having suffered damages as a result of any action by any of the three stated Defendants. The three Defendant corporations explain that the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   lacks any allegations stating that a Plaintiff's loan were serviced or modified by any of them. The above-mentioned Defendants claim that this lack of specificity is sufficient proof for said Defendants to argue that Plaintiffs lack standing under Article III of the United States Constitution as to claims against them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 110 at 2. Accordingly, they state that the Court should dismiss the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hochendoner v.

(internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Regarding the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint's\n   </em>\n   third purported flaw, Defendants REO RP, Cayman and Rushmore claim that all Defendants in the instant case are misjoined. Firstly, they all assert that Plaintiffs' allegations are so obscure, that it is impossible to determine which allegations stem from similar transactions and which do not. REO PR, Cayman and Rushmore argue that Plaintiffs instead seem to have included Defendants \"willy-nilly\". As such, Plaintiffs included \"loan servicers (like Rushmore) and banks ..., but also entities that are not engaged in Puerto Rico's loan industry (... Wells Fargo &amp; Co.) and others that do not issue or handle loans at all (the Tax Free Puerto Rico Target Maturity Fund, Inc.).\" Docket No. 110 at 3. Hence, according to REO PR, Cayman and Rushmore, the case at bar does not involve common questions of law, and thus Defendants are misjoined under to Rule 20.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3632116\" index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/563/#p569\">\n    699 F.3d at 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Finally, the fourth fatal flaw that Defendants REO PR, Cayman and Rushmore contend is the fact that the Complaint fails to comply with the requirements set forth in Rules 8(a)(2), 9(b) and 10(b). For example, all three Defendants allege that Plaintiffs failed to comply with Rule 8(a)(2)'s \"short and plain statement of claim\" requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Further, REO PR, Cayman and Rushmore argue that the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   should be dismissed because parties that alleged fraud must, pursuant to Rule 9(b), be specific and detailed in their allegations and here, Plaintiffs have failed to plead the elevated factual standard required under fraud allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mulder\n   </em>\n   , 865 F.3d at 21 (quoting\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

Lastly, Defendants claim that Plaintiffs failed to comply with Rule 10(b), which requires Plaintiffs to state their claims in numbered paragraphs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(b). Accordingly, all of these procedural deficiencies, should be sufficient to dismiss the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   In their\n   <em>\n    Response in Opposition to Motions to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs failed to include any factual allegations that may relate REO PR, Cayman or Rushmore with\n   the any of the claims set forth in the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 137.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, under Rule 12(b)(6) -that is failure to set forth sufficient facts as basis for any claims-lack of constitutional standing under Article III of the United States Constitution and non compliance with Rule 8(a)(2), 10(b), and 9(b)-that is fraud specificity elevated factual standard-the Court grants dismissal as to Defendants REO PR, Cayman and Rushmore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   <strong>\n    H.

Defendants RNMP and TRM also state that Plaintiffs failed to comply with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8(a), 9(b) and 10(b). This analysis pertains to the fact that the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   fails to provide notice to Defendants, RNMP and TRM included, as to specific facts or actions that may inform them as to the violation of law. Both Defendants also state that Plaintiffs fail to state with particularity which scenarios constituted fraud, and finally RNMP and TRM also explain that by not numbering the claims in the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs failed to comply with Rule 10(b). As averred by RNMP and TRM, all of these procedural deficits should suffice to dismiss the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Silverthorne v.

RNMP therefore states that Plaintiffs do not have personal nor general jurisdiction since RNMP is not \"at home\" in Puerto Rico. The Court agrees with RNMP's argument. While the First Circuit has not expressly ruled as much, other Circuits, such as the Ninth Circuit, have ruled that in order to exercise jurisdiction over a corporation, it contacts must be \"at home.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

Firstly, JNBC and Fannie Mae state that Plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   fails at all levels to meet the pleading requirements set forth in Rule 8 and Rule 12(b)(6) as to both defendants.

Specifically, JNBC and Fannie Mae attest that Plaintiffs do not meet the \"predominance\" standards set forth in Rule 23(b) because Plaintiffs have failed to show how they have one common issue. Further, individualized actions against Defendants remain, which may overcome alleged common issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, both Defendants claim that since Plaintiffs failed to provide details regarding class members, such as dates of foreclosures or relevant mortgage documents, the alleged class action would instead turn into multiple \"mini-trials.\" Docket No. 114-1 at 8.

In regards to the alleged violations of Rule 8(a), Lime states that Plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   consists entirely of incoherent allegations and recitations of statutory law. Instead of explaining how Lime violated its purported obligation, Plaintiffs instead \"lump together a handful of conclusory generalizations about loan modifications and foreclosures that are plead indiscriminately as to all defendants.\" Docket No. 119 at 3. Furthermore, Lime contends that \"Plaintiffs' kitchen-sink approach to naming parties and alleging so-called claims give no apparent consideration to presenting a manageable class action in which common issues prevail over individual ones, as require by Fed.

Similar to other Defendants' allegations, Lime contends that Plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   lacks factual content that may prove that Lime is liable. The First Circuit has repeatedly stated that Plaintiffs must state with specificity facts which may prove that they are eligible for relief under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woods v.

In regards to Rule 12(b)(4), Lime contends that Plaintiffs failed to serve Lime with the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   and instead served Lime with a document which combined pages from the First and\n   <em>\n    Second Amended Complaint. See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 119 at 2 n.3.

Furthermore, Freddie contends, in a similar fashion to most of the Defendants in the instant case, that while it was included in the caption as a Defendant, Plaintiffs failed to state a single fact to support a claim against Freddie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   Additionally, Freddie alleges that the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint must\n   </em>\n   be dismissed as a matter of law, because Plaintiffs' state law claims cannot be certified pursuant to Rules 20 and 21. Freddie further invalidates Plaintiffs' class certification pursuant to Rule 23(c)(1)(A). Plaintiffs seek to certify the following members as part of the Class: thirty-three (33) separate and unrelated households, one (1) estate, seven (7) conjugal partnerships and forty-nine (49) unidentified Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Freddie deduced from the Complaint that at least one of the 20 or so joined Defendants entered into separate trial modification agreements with at least one of the thirty-three households. Further, each plaintiff had to fulfill the terms of the agreement established with the Defendants. Moreover, in each alleged transaction, the co-defendant assigned to said specific transaction failed to uphold their promise of a permanent agreement. Freddie, however, states that treating each of these individualized cases will \"overwhelm the case ... and preclude class treatment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Freddie then cites the case of\n   <em>\n    PPV Connection, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3583895\" index=\"358\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/679/254/#p258\">\n    679 F.Supp.2d at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , wherein this Court asked Plaintiffs to show cause as to why multiple sets of co-defendants \"should not be dismissed for improper joinder,\" specifically in regards to Rules 20 and 21. In\n   <em>\n    PPV Connection, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , this Court determined that all co-defendants, except the first-named party, were improperly joined and dismissed without prejudice all claims against the defendants. Freddie thus contends that the case at bar by the alleged\n   class, which has yet to be certified, should be dismissed as well. This occurs as well since Rule 23, which set forth the requisites of class certification, should not be considered a pleading standard, rather, a party must \"be prepared to prove that there are\n   <em>\n    in fact\n   </em>\n   sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or fact,\" a set of claims or defenses, and adequacy of representation.\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

In general, OPC alleges that Plaintiffs failed to specify how OPC, in particular, violated said statutes.

OPC also states that Plaintiffs' fraud claims should be dismissed because pursuant to Rule 9(b) a party must specify with particularity which circumstances constituted fraud by the named party, in this case OPC. Plaintiffs, however, have failed to do the same and their claims to the contrary should be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   OPC further states that they have no contractual obligations with the Plaintiffs and as such, they cannot be sued for a breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   OPC further alleges that Plaintiffs' state law claims should be dismissed and thus the court should not grant supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.

OPC then filed a\n   <em>\n    Reply to Opposition to Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   wherein it stated that Plaintiffs' Response was \"a generic and unspecific opposition to motion\" and that Plaintiffs' continued to assert that the Parties were not misjoined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   Docket No. 154 at 2. OPC further claims that Plaintiffs' failed to comply with the\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   standards and with the pleading standards required by RESPA, HAMP, HARP, TILA, Regulation Z and Acts No. 184-2012 and 169-2016.

The allegations constitute merely conclusory in nature included RESPA, HAMP, HARP, TILA. The Plaintiffs do not have a cause of action identified against defendant, and hence has a lack of standing as Plaintiffs have no injury as required by Article III of the United States Constitution. Further, OPC is not identified as having served, provided or modified loans to any particular client. Further there is a lack of compliance with Rules 20 and 23 as to an improperly joined party. Fondly all frauds claims should be dismissed under Rule 9(b) as the facts against OPC do not reach the required standard under Rule 9(b) as to specify of facts on the record. The Defendant request for fees under Rule 11 is premature as the request is to be made pursuant to the Local Rules for the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, Local Rule 54(a) fees and (b) costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   <strong>\n    M.

A simple review of this record shows that it is plagued with procedural errors since its inception, specifically and most critical, Plaintiffs' lack of factual allegations connecting the facts of each plaintiff with the corresponding defendant or defendants that may respond to a plausible cause of action. The Court simply cannot accept Plaintiffs' request to dismiss the instant case without prejudice and start again, and allow the Plaintiffs to continue filing amended pleadings or merely new complaints adding new Plaintiffs until finally reaching the plausibility standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   Up to the instant moment, Plaintiffs have merely added additional plaintiffs without providing facts and the mortgagors' links or information with specific causes of action as to each defendant. The Court is precluded from considering similar facts and application of law, as the Plaintiffs have absolutely failed in providing sufficient facts to enable the Court \"to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\"\n   <em>\n    Ocasio-Hernandez v.

First, the right to amend once as a matter of course terminates 21 days after service of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f). This provision will force the pleader to consider carefully and promptly the wisdom of amending to meet the arguments in the motion. A responsive amendment may avoid the need to decide the motion or reduce the number of issues to be decided, and will expedite determination of issues that otherwise might be raised seriatim. It also should advance other pretrial proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-347\">\n   Second, the right to amend once as a matter of course is no longer terminated by service of a responsive pleading. The responsive pleading may point out issues that the original pleader had not considered and persuade the pleader that amendment is wise. Just as amendment was permitted by former Rule15(a) in response to a motion, so the amended rule permits one amendment as a matter of course in response to a responsive pleading. The right is subject to the same 21-day limit as the right to amend in response to a motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-348\">\n   The 21-day periods to amend once as a matter of course after service of a responsive pleading or after service of a designated motion are not cumulative.

The short answer is that Plaintiffs' amendments were filed before trial, and without leave of Court, as explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   Plaintiffs' original complaint was filed on April 5, 2017, Docket No. 1.

The court should freely give leave when justice so requires.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-357\">\n   On June 20, 2017, Defendant Oriental Bank filed a\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss Second Amended Complaint for Failure to State a Claim\n   </em>\n   , under Rule 12(b)(6), filed at Docket No. 16. Hence, Plaintiffs had 21 days from June 20, 2017, that is, July 11, 2017, to reply to the responsive pleading, or file an amended complaint, as provided by Rule 15(a)(1)(B). The record shows that Plaintiffs did not reply to Oriental's motion to dismiss on or before July 11, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-358\">\n   On July 19, 2017, Plaintiffs filed instead a Third Amended Complaint at Docket No. 68,\n   <strong>\n    without leave of court or the opposing parties written consent\n   </strong>\n   , as provided by Rule 15(a)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-359\">\n   On that same date, that is, July 19, 2017, defendant Tax-Free Puerto Rico Target Maturity Fund, Inc. filed a\n   <em>\n    Motion to Strike Second and Third Amended Complaints\n   </em>\n   , at Docket No. 69. On July 26, 2017, the Court granted defendant Tax-Free Puerto Rico Target Maturity Fund, Inc., on the grounds that the second and third amended complaints were filed without leave of court, and in violation of the provisions of Rule 15(a)(1)(B). The Court further ordered that Plaintiffs' Second and Third Amended Complaints filed at Docket entries No. 9 and 68, be stricken for the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-360\">\n   Hence, Plaintiffs' amended complaints were clearly filed prior to trial, and after the defendants have filed responsive pleadings under Rule 12(b)(6). Thus, special attention must now be given to the most critical terms provided by Rule 15(a)(1)(A) and (B). As stated by the 2009 Amendments to Rule 15(a)(1)(A), \"the right to amend no longer is terminated by the service of a responsive pleading.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wright &amp; Miller, 6 Federal Practice and Procedure Civil \u00a7 1483 (3d edition) (April 2018 Update). The treatise further explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-361\">\n   Instead, Rule 15(a)(1)(A) extends the right to amend as a matter of course to within 21 days after serving a pleading or within one of the periods in Rule 15(a)(1)(B),\n   <strong>\n    whichever is earlier. These periods are not cumulative; only one amendment as a matter of course is permitted. Further, Rule 15(a)(1)(B) now provides that a party may amend once as a matter of course within 21 days after service of a responsive pleading or 21 days after service of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f). Thus, the time period in which a right to amend terminates now is the same 21-day period whether a responsive or a Rule 12 motion is involved\n   </strong>\n   . As pointed out in the Committee Note accompanying the rule amendment, by including Rule 12(b) motions and allowing amendments as of course 21 days after the service of either a motion or a responsive pleading, these changes \"\n   <strong>\n    will force the pleader to consider carefully and\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    promptly the wisdom of amending to meet the arguments in the motion\" and \"the responsive pleading may point out issues that the original pleader had not considered and persuade the pleader that amendment is wise\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Emphasis ours).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-362\">\n   After a careful review of the record, the Court finds that Plaintiffs did not amend the complaint in conformity with the responsive pleadings filed by the defendants under Rule 12(b)(6), and within the period of 21 days provided by Rule 15(a)(1)(B). Instead, Plaintiffs decided\n   <em>\n    motu propio\n   </em>\n   to merely continue adding new plaintiffs or new defendants, and left intact the general claims relating to the alleged violations to several federal laws, such as, RESPA, HAMP, TILA, and HARP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-363\">\n   However, Plaintiffs' failure to raise new allegations via amendment of the pleadings, regarding the new added plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    versus\n   </em>\n   new and/or already appearing defendants, and its relation to the law in order to comply with the plausibility standard, was clearly sending a message that no amendment was necessary. Hence, leaving Plaintiffs exposed to a potential dismissal pursuant to the citation stated\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \"the respondent pleader may point out issues that the original pleader had not considered and persuade the pleader that amendment is wise.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   the Advisory Committee Notes of the 2009 Amendments cited\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-364\">\n   Consequently, based upon Plaintiffs' course of action, the defendants as well as the presiding Judge were indirectly advised that the pleadings as filed were sufficient at law, and that there was no need to amend the pleadings any further.
