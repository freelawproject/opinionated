BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n   This case involves the Department of Homeland Security's decision to delay implementing an Obama-era immigration rule, the International Entrepreneur Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%205%2C238\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 5,238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jan. 17, 2017). The Rule would have allowed certain foreign entrepreneurs to obtain immigration \"parole\"-that is, to temporarily enter the United States despite lacking a visa or green card. It was finalized in the waning hours of the Obama administration and was set to take effect 180 days later-on July 17, 2017. On the eve of that date, however, the Department issued a new rule (\"the Delay Rule\") delaying the effective date for another eight months, until March 14, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs brought suit last September, alleging that the agency had violated the Administrative Procedure Act in promulgating the later rule. This Court agreed and granted summary judgment in their favor, vacating the Delay Rule in the process. Plaintiffs' counsel now move for an award of attorney fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), which \"directs a court to award 'fees and other expenses' to private parties who prevail in [certain types of] litigation against the United States if, among other conditions, the position of the United States was not 'substantially justified.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commissioner, INS v.

After all, the Court awarded them complete relief, vacating the challenged Delay Rule in the process. Nor do Defendants dispute that Plaintiffs are financially eligible to receive an EAJA award. The Court, too, agrees that each Plaintiff has provided sufficient documentation in that respect.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF Nos. 31-1 (Declaration of Bobby Franklin); 31-2 (Declaration of Atma Krishna); 31-3 (Declaration of Anand Krishna); 31-4 (Declaration of Alex Modon); 31-5 (Declaration of Aksh Gupta).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    The Government instead maintains that its actions were substantially justified, thereby precluding any award.

Degree of success is \"the most critical factor\" in evaluating the reasonableness of a fee award.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hensley\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p434\">\n     461 U.S. at 436\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p434\">\n     103 S.Ct. 1933\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Second, they achieved that result efficiently. Throughout this case, counsel (1) filed a Complaint (which required interviews with five different clients); (2) fully briefed a preliminary-injunction motion; (3) presented oral argument; and (4) fully briefed summary judgment on an expedited basis. They did all this in 450 hours, relying principally on two lawyers and one paralegal. That number clocks in far below analogous cases.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Am. Petroleum Inst.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690153,7414934\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/72/907/\">\n     72 F.3d at 916\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (allowing 560 hours for briefing a stay petition and oral argument);\n    <em>\n     Loving v. IRS\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2012778284\">\n     2014 WL 12778284\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *9 (D.D.C. Sept. 19, 2014) (allowing 1300 hours for litigation challenging IRS rule). Third, Plaintiffs have complied with the Supreme Court's admonition to exercise \" 'billing judgment' with respect to hours worked.\"\n    <em>\n     Hensley\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p434\">\n     461 U.S. at 437\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p434\">\n     103 S.Ct. 1933\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Mot. at 13 (noting voluntary exclusion of over 125 hours).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The Court thus generally finds reasonable the total number of hours for which Plaintiffs seek reimbursement, subject to three exceptions. First, Defendants point out that counsel clocked four hours to \"[p]repare for oral argument\" after the actual oral-argument date.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Opp. at 22 (citing Hughes Decl., Exh A). Plaintiffs admit that they listed those hours inadvertently and omit them from their final tabulations.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Reply at 11 n.5, 15. The Court, of course, will exclude them as well.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Second, Plaintiffs report spending 9.5 hours on \"press strategy\" and \"coordination with clients regarding media inquiries and outreach.\" Mot. at 6-7. \"In this circuit,\" however, \"the [G]overnment cannot be charged for time [Plaintiffs] spen[d] in discussions with the press.\"\n    <em>\n     Role Models Am., Inc. v. Brownlee\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3720307,9297980\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/353/962/\">\n     353 F.3d 962\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 973 (D.C.

Circuit has stated that discussions with press are not compensable.\"). Other circuits, too, have disallowed costs for efforts to \"sway public opinion.\"\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Rum Creek Coal Sales, Inc. v. Caperton\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522796\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/31/169/#p176\">\n     31 F.3d 169\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 176 (4th Cir. 1994) ;\n    <em>\n     Halderman by Halderman v.

Following their lead, the Court will disallow the 9.5 logged for press-related activities\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Third, Defendants challenge Plaintiffs' fees for the instant Motion. The Court generally finds that such \"fees on fees\" are appropriate, as Plaintiffs prevailed on the \"major issue[ ]\" in this case: whether they were \"entitled to fees in the first place.\"\n    <em>\n     AIC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270538\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/82/396/#p411\">\n     82 F.Supp.3d at 414\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That said, the 159.25 hours spent on the Motion were excessive. Counsel provide no justification for the time expended, and their hours are out of step with those regularly allowed on such motions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     New Jersey v. EPA\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869168,5869813\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/110/\">\n     703 F.3d 110\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 116 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (allowing 91 of the requested 227.5 hours spent on a motion for fees);\n    <em>\n     Am. Wrecking Corp. v. Sec'y of Labor\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9272393,5662395\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/364/321/\">\n     364 F.3d 321\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 331 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (\n    <em>\n     per curiam\n    </em>\n    ) (calling 118 hours billed for an EAJA petition \"an excessive amount\" and allowing recovery of 59 hours);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Loving\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2012778284\">\n     2014 WL 12778284\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *8 (allowing 80 of the requested 190.25 hours for requested fees motion). In keeping with those cases, the Court will allow Plaintiffs to recover 85 hours of attorney time dedicated to this application.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    It will thus reduce Plaintiffs' hours and award fees as follows:\n   </p>\n   <pre id=\"p-48\"><strong>Attorney Hours</strong> <strong>Attorney Hours</strong> <strong>Year</strong> <strong>Requested</strong> <strong>Reduction</strong> <strong>Final</strong> <strong>Rate</strong> <strong>Total</strong> 2017 447.50 (13.5) 434 $196.78 $85,402.52 2018 159.25 (74.25) 85 $198.99 $16,914.15 <strong>All</strong> 606.75 (87.75) 519 $102,316.67</pre>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiffs were prevailing parties and that the position taken by the Government was not substantially justified. It also finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to $102,316.67 in attorney fees. A separate Order so stating will issue this day.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
