Although she had originally been praised for her discovery of Roche's overpayment to Humana, she was terminated shortly after the parties executed the December 2013 agreement.

In Count I, she alleges that Humana presented, and Roche caused to be presented, false claims to CMS in violation of \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(A). In Count II, she claims that Humana made material false statements, and that Roche caused material false statements to be made, in conjunction with claims Humana submitted to CMS in violation of \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(B). In Count III, she alleges that defendants violated \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(C) by engaging in a conspiracy to commit the violations asserted in Counts I and II. And in Count IV, relator asserts that defendants retaliated against her because of her efforts to stop the aforementioned FCA violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants move for dismissal on the ground that the complaint fails the particularity and plausibility standards of Rule 9(b) and Rule (8).

The claim may proceed, however, against Roche.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The FCA's anti-retaliation provision authorizes relief for any employee who is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   discharged ...

Roche seeks dismissal on the ground that the allegations do not plausibly suggest that relator engaged in protected conduct. The Seventh Circuit has observed, however, that as amended in 2009, \u00a7 3730(h)(1) protects two categories of conduct: (1) acts taken \"in furtherance of an [FCA] action,\" and (2) \"other efforts to stop\" FCA violations, \"such as reporting suspected conduct to internal supervisors.\"\n   <em>\n    Halasa v.

And because claims that result from AKS violations may also violate the FCA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(g), a reasonable person in relator's position could have believed that Humana and Roche were defrauding the government with this arrangement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Roche further argues that the FCA's retaliation protections are unavailable to relator because she never provided the employer with \"specific, factual allegations of fraud being committed against the government.\" But neither the statute nor case law suggests that a relator is required\n   to meet Rule 9(b)'s particularity standard when reporting suspected fraud to his or her employer.
