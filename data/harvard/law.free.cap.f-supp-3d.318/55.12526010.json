Accordingly, the Court grants Defendants' motion to dismiss. An Order is issued separately.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Plaintiff erected six signs on his property, and describes them as \"four-four feet by sixteen feet and two four feet by eight feet in size displayed on a major highway.\" (Ans. to Defs.'
