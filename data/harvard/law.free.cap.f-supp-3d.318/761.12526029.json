The motion to remand is fully briefed, and the Court rules under Loc. R. 105.6 because a hearing is not necessary. For the reasons that follow, the Court GRANTS Ndzerre's motion and remands this case to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland for further proceedings. The Court denies Defendant's motion to dismiss as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 19, 2017, Plaintiff Habakuk Ndzerre (\"Ndzerre\") filed this action\n   in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland (\"Montgomery County Circuit Court\"). In the Complaint, Ndzerre asserts individual and class claims against Defendant Liberty Power Corp. LLC (\"Liberty Power\") under the Maryland Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, the Maryland Door-to-Door Sales Act, and the Maryland Consumer Protection Act. The Complaint also asserts common law claims for unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 2. The claims stem from Liberty Power's alleged practice of signing up consumers for electricity service without the consumer's knowledge or consent, a practice known as \"slamming.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2, 4. Specifically, Ndzerre alleges that Liberty Power used pre-printed forms and disclosures to \"slam\" consumers with its services, and forged Ndzerre's signature on a pre-printed form.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22-26. Ndzerre further alleges that Liberty Power provided him with a renewal notice that did not comply with Maryland law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 30-32. Ndzerre previously obtained a ruling in his favor regarding one or more of these claims from the Maryland Public Service Commission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Complaint proposes two classes: a \"Slamming Class,\" consisting of persons in the State of Maryland that were solicited by Liberty Power with pre-printed, legally insufficient forms, and an \"Improper Renewal Class,\" comprised of \"members for whom Liberty Power automatically renewed for its electrical supply services but [ ] failed to specify the specific renewal date.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37-38. All claims in the Complaint are brought for Ndzerre individually and on behalf of one or both of the proposed classes.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 14, 2018, Liberty Power timely removed the case to this Court, asserting jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), \"due to diversity of citizenship of the parties and an amount in controversy that exceeds the jurisdictional amount.\" ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 2. Liberty Power then moved to dismiss the claims. ECF No. 17. On March 7, 2018, Ndzerre, individually and on behalf of the putative classes, moved to remand the case to Montgomery County Circuit Court. ECF No. 18. The Court stayed briefing on Defendant's motion to dismiss pending the resolution of the remand motion. ECF No. 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
