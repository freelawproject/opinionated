INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Kevin Crowley was employed as an Engineering Branch Chief with the Food Safety Inspection Service at the United States Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\") from September 2012 to December 2015. On March 20, 2015, USDA approved Plaintiff's request for an accommodation allowing him to telework twice a week because of his disability. A few weeks later, on April 10, 2015, Plaintiff's supervisors placed Plaintiff on a Performance Improvement Plan (\"PIP\"). As a result, Plaintiff filed a formal Equal Employment Opportunity complaint on June 23, 2015, claiming that the PIP was in retaliation for his Reasonable Accommodation request. Plaintiff ultimately filed this lawsuit\n   against the former USDA Secretary, alleging that his employer, USDA, retaliated against him in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20791\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This matter is before the court on Defendant's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment.

In order to make the transition smoother, Plaintiff's second-line supervisor, Jennifer Sisto, provided oversight on telecommunications issues. Sisto Dep.

Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6 20. For example, Sisto noticed that some telecommunication accounts for people who had left USDA years before were still open and that the agency therefore continued to pay for those accounts unnecessarily. Sisto Dep. I at 53;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6 20. On at least one occasion, she called Plaintiff into her office to discuss those accounts, as it was Plaintiff's responsibility to ensure that they were closed properly. Sisto Dep. I at 53;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot., Ex. 1, Attach. 4 [hereinafter Sisto Decl.], at 63, \u00b6 5. Sisto also noticed that six conference lines were still open-despite one employee assigned to one of the conference lines having left two years ago-and instructed Plaintiff to close the lines. Sisto Decl., Attach. 1 [hereinafter Sisto Emails], at 71. Similarly, Sisto informed Plaintiff of lines open for personnel who had since left the agency, staff with more than one line open, loaner devices that had been out for more than four years, and numerous devices being paid for with no one assigned to them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20791\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20791\">\n    at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For instance, on December 8, 2014, Thompson emailed Plaintiff asking him to stay up to date on tickets made for service outages, some of which were up to two months old. Sisto Decl. at 64-65, \u00b6 10. Moreover, according to Sisto, she was frequently contacted about issues in areas falling under Plaintiff's responsibility, such as a \"lack of prompt service restoral of down telecom connectivity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20791\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, on February 24, 2015, Janet Stevens-Plaintiff's third-line supervisor-emailed Plaintiff about two offices that had lost their telecommunications for days due to lack of payments on their invoices.

II at 12-14;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6 20. For example, Plaintiff explains that he had to close multiple tickets that had been open for years when he first joined USDA in 2012 and that his team only started to get ahead of those issues in 2014. Crowley Dep. II at 13;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6 20. Moreover, Plaintiff asserts that part of the reason for lines remaining open was the lack of a formal \"out-boarding process,\" whereby managers could notify the telecommunications team if someone was leaving their division. Crowley Dep. II at 16. Because no such process existed within the agency, Plaintiff says he was not aware of who was leaving the agency and when, and thus he did not know whose accounts to close and when to do so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20791\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, Plaintiff notes that he had three vacancies on the telecommunications team during this time, which, combined with the increase in workload, made fulfilling requests difficult.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20791\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20791\">\n    at 6-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    3.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant moves for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's retaliation claims on two grounds. First, as to the claim that Defendant retaliated against Plaintiff for his Reasonable Accommodation request by placing Plaintiff on the PIP, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish that Defendant's reasons for placing Plaintiff on the PIP were pretext for a retaliatory motive. Second, as to the claim that Defendant retaliated against Plaintiff for his EEO activity by extending the PIP, Defendant argues only that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation in response to Plaintiff's EEO activity; he does not, notably, offer a non-retaliatory reason for extending the PIP. Plaintiff claims that there are genuine issues of material fact such that a reasonable jury could find in his favor on both grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the court denies Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Instead, he asserts a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for placing Plaintiff on the PIP: poor performance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6. When questioned about why Plaintiff was put on the PIP, Sisto stated that \"[t]here was money being wasted .... Things weren't being corrected. Responsiveness was down. Restoral of services was down.\" Sisto Dep. I at 57. Sisto testified that these were all responsibilities of Plaintiff and his team.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56. In addition, there are numerous emails on the record that document instances where payments were missed, accounts were not closed, and tickets were left open, which necessitated Plaintiff's supervisors to reach out to him directly to deal with the issues-or, in some cases, necessitated Plaintiff's supervisors to deal with the issues themselves.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sisto Decl. at 63-66, \u00b6\u00b6 4-15. Thus, having produced evidence showing a legitimate reason for placing Plaintiff on the PIP, the remaining question for the court is \"whether [Plaintiff] produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that [Defendant's] asserted ... non-retaliatory reason was not the actual reason and that [Defendant] intentionally ... retaliated against [Plaintiff].\"\n   <em>\n    Ames v.

District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9049621,3720325\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/351/519/\">\n    351 F.3d 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 525 (D.C. Cir. 2003), temporal proximity alone is not enough to prove pretext. As the D.C. Circuit has observed, \"[i]f temporal proximity sufficed to rebut a legitimate proffer, then protected activities would effectively grant employees a period of immunity, during which no act, however egregious, would support summary judgment for the employer in a subsequent retaliation claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Woodruff v.

And, while Thomas signed and dated Plaintiff's PIP April 10, 2015, Thomas first called Human Resources to ask about the PIP on April 3, 2015. Pl.'s Ex. 3 at 63, 66;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 2 at 14. This close-in-time relationship between Plaintiff's protected activity and the adverse action, although not sufficient by itself to establish pretext, does weigh in favor such a finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Sisto and Stevens's \"Equity Email\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiff also relies on an email between Sisto and Stevens concerning the equity of employees' teleworking arrangements as evidence of pretext.

Specifically, on December 4, 2014, Stevens forwarded an email to Sisto attaching a telework participation report for Stevens and Sisto's program area. Pl.'s Ex. 3 at 1. In that email, Stevens told Sisto that they \"[n]eed to discuss the equity of this[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3562058,3865187\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/482/521/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In her deposition, Sisto explained that she and Stevens were discussing whether \"people were implementing the policy equitably\" to ensure that they \"didn't have disparity going on where some supervisors were saying nobody could telework, and some people were saying you can telework as much as you want.\" Sisto Dep. II at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff asks the court to infer from this \"equity email\" that Plaintiff's supervisors issued the PIP in retaliation for his request to telework. Pl.'s Mem. at 5-6. While the court is required to draw all inferences in the Plaintiff's favor, those inferences still must be \"reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5649072\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/938/46/#p49\">\n    938 F.Supp. at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, Plaintiff's favored inference is not a reasonable one given Sisto's unrebutted explanation of its meaning and the timing of Plaintiff's Reasonable Accommodation request. First, Sisto explained in her deposition exactly what the statement in Stevens's email meant, and Plaintiff has offered no evidence that this general email was specific to him in any way. There is no evidence on the record to suggest that Sisto and Stevens discussed between themselves how Plaintiff's specific telework situation was\n   inequitable or that they discussed it with Plaintiff himself. Nor is there any evidence showing that Sisto and Stevens were upset about Plaintiff's telework situation. Second, the email was exchanged in December 2014, when Plaintiff had already been teleworking for over a year and\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   he made the Reasonable Accommodation request. Pl.'s Ex. 3 at 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Crowley Dep. I at 28. Even if Sisto and Stevens could be viewed generally as hostile towards teleworking, it is too far a logical leap to then say they retaliated against Plaintiff for requesting a teleworking arrangement to accommodate his disability. Accordingly, the \"equity email\" provides little evidence of pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Thompson's Opinion of the PIP and Plaintiff's Performance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In his Complaint, Plaintiff alleged that Thompson informed him that he was being placed on the PIP in retaliation for teleworking and that Thompson disagreed with the reasons that Plaintiff was placed on the PIP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-37, 43-47, 56-59. Now, Plaintiff wishes to rely on those assertions to defeat summary judgment. But Plaintiff offers no\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   to support that Thompson ever made such statements. He did not depose Thompson or obtain an affidavit from him. Nor is there deposition testimony or an affidavit from Plaintiff in the record attesting to what Thompson purportedly told him about the PIP.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Crowley Dep. I; Crowley Dep. II. Indeed, the only record evidence about what Thompson said or did not say comes from a brief affidavit obtained by Defendant from Thompson, in which he denies ever having had any conversation with Plaintiff about the PIP. Thompson Decl. at 59-60, \u00b6\u00b6 3-5. Because Plaintiff's assertion about what Thompson said rests on \"mere allegation[s] ... of his pleading,\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    477 U.S. at 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , he cannot rely on them to defeat summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Alternatively, Plaintiff relies upon statements made by Thompson during the EEO investigation of pretext, specifically Thompson stated that he did \"not agree or disagree\" as to whether placing Plaintiff on a PIP was warranted,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 2 at 6. Plaintiff asks the court to infer from these statements that Thompson did not agree with putting Plaintiff on the PIP. Pl.'s Mem. at 23. The court, however, cannot draw the suggested inference here, as Thompson's statement is simply too ambiguous. Moreover, even if Thompson did view the PIP as unwarranted, such evidence is of little probative value. According to Thompson, it was Sisto who made the decision to put Plaintiff on the PIP,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 2 at 6, and, therefore, the only relevant appraisal of Plaintiff's work is Sisto's as the decision maker, not Thompson's.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fischbach v.

The court notes, however, that an \"employer's description of an employee's performance as unsatisfactory will not be deemed pretextual just because the employee was\n   a good performer at an earlier time.\"\n   <em>\n    Hicks v.

In\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

The plaintiff argued that because he had prior successful performance reviews, the defendant's stated reason for firing him (that he had failed his PIP) must be pretextual.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202041\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/729/54/#p70\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the court found that despite those successful performance reviews in prior years, the plaintiff's performance had \"deteriorated and bec[o]me unacceptable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202041\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/729/54/#p70\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202041\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/729/54/#p70\">\n    at 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, while an employee may have done his job well in the past, there is nothing that necessarily prevents his performance from deteriorating later or new management stepping in and starting to notice existing issues, as Defendant claims happened in this case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 4-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Nor do Plaintiff's protestations to the proffered reasons for the PIP establish pretext. Plaintiff offers a rebuttal for why his performance fell short-namely that it was not his fault, as his team was understaffed and already behind even before Plaintiff began working at USDA.

Indeed, some are obvious. For example, Keegan's ultimate opinion is that the PIP \"didn't comply with the requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations.\" Keegan Rep. at 14. The D.C. Circuit has held, however, that expert testimony cannot contain \"legal conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    Burkhart v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"854600,3705153\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/112/1207/\">\n    112 F.3d 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1212 (D.C.

Thus, while Keegan is able to testify as to the specific facts he found and whether the PIP is consistent with regulatory requirements and best practices, he may not express the legal opinion that the PIP violated federal regulations.

Keegan's report does not clearly state what evidence he actually reviewed to form his opinions. Keegan identifies a short list of materials that he \"considered in formulating [his] opinion,\" Keegan Rep. at 14, yet at the same time broadly states that his conclusions are based on \"Crowley's legal complaint,\n   agency interrogatory responses and discovery documents provided by the Department of Agriculture.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 (\"I conducted a thorough review of the agency interrogatory responses and document production.\"). Thus, it is not at all clear to the court how much of the discovery Keegan actually reviewed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Clear factual errors in Keegan's report only underscore this concern. For example, Keegan states, without further explanation, that \"[t]here is nothing in the agency document production ... that document any specific deficiencies with Mr., (sic) Crowley's performance and the justification for the PIP.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. The record, of course, contains numerous examples to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Sisto Emails. Elsewhere, he states that, \"[s]ubsequent to Mr. Crowley being placed on a PIP, he submitted a formal request for Reasonable Accommodation.\" Keegan Rep. at 11. However, the exact opposite is true: Plaintiff claims that he was retaliated against with a PIP because of his Reasonable Accommodation request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 16-23. Keegan's struggle with basic facts is worrisome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Notwithstanding the deficiencies of Keegan's report, the court is not prepared to exclude it altogether at this stage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, Keegan explains that the initiation and administration of a PIP typically follow strict guidelines under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20432.104\">\n    5 C.F.R. \u00a7 432.104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204302\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and internal regulations from the Office of Personnel Management.

Here, a reasonable jury could find that the deficiencies in preparation and execution of the PIP that Keegan identifies,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Keegan Rep. at 11-14, are evidence that the true motive behind the PIP was not to improve Plaintiff's performance, but to punish him for seeking reasonable accommodation. Thus, portions of Keegan's testimony create a genuine dispute of fact as to the question of pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   f.\n   <em>\n    The Extension of the PIP\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff points to the extension of his PIP past its expected end date of June 22, 2015, as evidence of pretext, arguing that the extension shows that the PIP was not meant to actually bring Plaintiff's performance to an acceptable level but to punish him for a longer period of time. Pl.'s Mem. at 22. The PIP formally began on April 24, 2015, had an expected duration of 60 days, and had an expected end date of June 22, 2015. Pl.'s Ex. 3 at 65. Defendant asserts that Plaintiff was placed on the PIP because of \"poor performance,\" Def.'s Mem. at 6, and, according to Sisto, the goal of the PIP was \"to improve [Plaintiff's\n   ] performance.\" Sisto Dep. I at 57. Sisto also asserted in her deposition that in early June Plaintiff had \"met the ... criteria set forth in the PIP ... and that [Osman] wanted [Plaintiff] to come off of [the PIP].\" Sisto Dep. II at 21. Despite Sisto's-and, according to her, Osman's-opinion that Plaintiff had met the criteria of the PIP, the PIP did not officially end until November 10, 2015. Crowley Dep. I at 43. Indeed, there are emails on the record from Osman to Plaintiff and vice versa that show that not only was the PIP still active through July, September, and October, but that there were still regular meetings scheduled to discuss Plaintiff's performance and the PIP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 6 at 1, 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Keegan Rep. at 7. The PIP's unexplained, undocumented continuance after Plaintiff had met the criteria to improve his performance could be construed by a reasonable jury as reason to question the original explanation for the PIP. Indeed, a rational trier of fact could conclude that, if the PIP truly was for the purpose of improving Plaintiff's performance, it would have ended when his performance improved. The fact that the PIP did not timely end might reasonably be viewed as reinforcing the original retaliatory objective. Accordingly, the extension of the PIP past its expected end date is evidence of pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   It bears repeating that the court views this as a close case. But viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the combination of the close temporal proximity of the PIP and the Reasonable Accommodation request; the deficiencies of the PIP; and the unexplained, undocumented extension of the PIP for months after the initial 60-day period, the court concludes that a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff was placed on the PIP in retaliation for his Reasonable Accommodation request. Accordingly, the court denies Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to Plaintiff's claim that he was placed on the PIP in retaliation for his Reasonable Accommodation request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Retaliation Based on Plaintiff's EEO Activity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiff also claims that Defendant retaliated against him for his EEO activity by extending the PIP beyond the expected end date of June 22, 2015, despite Plaintiff having met the PIP's performance objectives by June 19, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 24-25. Defendant's sole response to this claim is that Plaintiff has failed to make out a prima facie case; he does not advance a non-retaliatory reason for the extension. Defendant asserts that Plaintiff falls short on two elements: (1) the extension of the PIP does not constitute an adverse action, and (2) Plaintiff cannot establish a causal link between his EEO activity and the continuation of the PIP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 8-9. The court concludes otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    1. Plaintiff's Prima Facie Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Continuation of the PIP as \"Materially Adverse\" Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   This court already has held, in the context of Defendant's motion to dismiss, \"that the imposition of a PIP-even one that does not result in a negative impact on salary, grade or performance appraisal-can constitute an adverse action.\" Mem. Op. at 6. The question here is slightly different and appears to be one of first impression: Whether the\n   <em>\n    continuation\n   </em>\n   of a PIP beyond its expected end date constitutes material adversity for purposes of a retaliation claim. Based on the record evidence, the court finds that in this case it does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \" 'Adverse Actions' in the retaliation context encompass a broader\n   sweep of actions than those in a pure discrimination claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Baloch v.

Cir. 2008). To satisfy the adversity element in the retaliation context, a plaintiff must prove that he suffered a \"materially adverse\" action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575311,5742599\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/1191/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575311,5742599\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/1191/\">\n    at 1198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff's PIP specifically states that should Plaintiff not meet the \"Fully Successful\" level in his performance reviews, then \"the Agency is bound by statute to remove [him] from Federal service, demote [him] to a lower grade, or reassign [him] to another position.\" Pl.'s Ex. 2 at 14. Furthermore, according to Keegan, remaining on a PIP can result in \"[d]isqualification from any applicable performance bonus or incentives,\" and hiring managers in other departments will frequently look at parts of the employee's record, such as PIPs, when making hiring decisions. Keegan Rep. at 13. Thus, the consequences of not meeting a PIP's objectives are stark. Yet, without apparent regard for these consequences, Defendant in this case left Plaintiff on a PIP for months after Plaintiff met its objectives. The PIP began on April 24, 2015, but did not end until November 10, 2015. Pl.'s Ex. 3 at 65; Crowley Dep. I at 43. Plaintiff satisfied the PIP in early June,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sisto Dep. II at 21, yet the undisputed evidence shows that his superiors blithely kept the PIP hanging over his head, providing him with no explanation for why his job and his future prospects remained at risk if he failed to perform. Thus, a reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff's having to work under such uncertain conditions for an extended period constitutes an adverse action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Causal Link Between the PIP and EEO Activity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As discussed above, \"a close temporal relationship may alone establish the required causal connection\" for purposes of satisfying a plaintiff's prima facie case.\n   <em>\n    Singletary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9049621,3720325\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/351/519/\">\n    351 F.3d at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the temporal proximity between the protected activity and adverse action easily satisfies the prima facie causation element. Plaintiff filed his informal EEO complaint on May 15, 2015. Pl.'s Ex. 2 at 1. One month later, on June 19, 2015, Osman emailed Sisto to inform Sisto that he had a meeting planned with Plaintiff and intended to discuss with Plaintiff that he had reached an acceptable level of performance and that Osman therefore would close out the PIP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 3 at 70; Sisto Dep. II at 16 (Sisto testimony that \"Mr. Osman had told us that ... he felt that Mr. Crowley's performance had improved to an acceptable level and he could come off the PIP\" in early June). Yet, without explanation, Plaintiff remained on the PIP. Then, on June 23, 2015, Plaintiff filed his formal EEO complaint alleging that his placement on the PIP was in retaliation for his Reasonable Accommodation request. Pl.'s Ex. 2 at 1. On July 15, 2015, Osman sent an email with the subject line \"PIP\" stating that he \"did not have time to meet last Friday\" and giving Plaintiff a list of objectives regarding the PIP, clearly showing formal continuation of the PIP. Pl.'s Ex. 6 at 3. On September 14, 2015, Osman emailed Plaintiff to state that he \"intends to make a final assessment and recommendation regarding the PIP status on Friday 09/18/2015.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. On November 10, 2015, the PIP was closed out. Crowley\n   Dep. I at 43. Given the \"close temporal relationship\" between the EEO activity and the continuation of the PIP, and Osman's failure to close out the PIP in June 2015 despite Plaintiff meeting the PIP's performance goals, Plaintiff has established a causal link between his EEO activity and the continuation of the PIP to satisfy the causation element of a prima facie case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court finds that a reasonable jury could find that Defendant retaliated against Plaintiff both for Plaintiff's Reasonable Accommodation request and his EEO activity by placing him on, and ultimately extending, the PIP. Accordingly, the court denies Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    The following citations generally are to the record, as opposed to either party's statement of material facts.

As for Defendant, the facts listed in his statement of facts typically were immaterial or contradicted by the record. For this reason, the facts generally are drawn from the record and supplemented by the parties' (timely) statements of facts where possible.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    All citations to the exhibits of either party are to the page numbers electronically generated by CM/ECF.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Plaintiff disputes that he was permitted to telework for the\n    <em>\n     entirety\n    </em>\n    of this period.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6 15 (noting that all telework was suspended for a period in early March 2015);\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    (citing a roughly two-week period in April 2015 when Plaintiff did not telework).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Plaintiff only received a yearly performance review, though he cannot remember exactly which rating he received from Rivera.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The parties dispute the amount of days that Plaintiff requested to telework.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6 15;\n    <em>\n     cf.\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6 15. While this fact is immaterial, as Plaintiff's request was granted regardless, the record does contain the actual request, which states that Plaintiff requested to telework four days per pay period (i.e., two days per week). Pl.'s Ex. 2 at 25.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    It is unclear from the present record exactly when the agency granted Plaintiff's request. The only evidence in the record on this score is: (1) the EEO Counselor Report, which recites Plaintiff's allegation that the request was approved on March 20, 2015,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Ex. 2 at 1; and (2) Plaintiff's untimely statement of additional facts in support of his Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, which states that, on March 20, 2015, \"Thompson was informed that [Plaintiff's] reasonable accommodation request was granted,\" citing a March 20, 2015 email from an HR Specialist to Thompson in support of that proposition. Pl.'s Additional Stmt. \u00b6 40. That email, however, does not support Plaintiff's allegation. In the March 20, 2015 email, the HR Specialist asked to speak to Thompson about the request and explained that she would draft a decision letter for Thompson's signature \"\n    <em>\n     [a]fter\n    </em>\n    a decision [was] made regarding [Plaintiff's] request.\" Pl.'s Opp'n, Ex. 3, ECF No. 27-5, at 60 (emphasis added). In any event, as with the scope of the actual request,\n    <em>\n     see supra\n    </em>\n    note 6, the exact date of agency action is not material here, as there is no genuine dispute about when Plaintiff's supervisors became aware of his Reasonable Accommodation request, which was March 3, 2015.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Sisto Decl. at 66, \u00b6 19.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Defendant claims that Plaintiff was placed on the PIP on April 16, 2015, based on Plaintiff's recollection during his deposition.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6 21 (citing Crowley Dep. I at 15). Plaintiff, on the other hand, contends that the PIP is dated, and was supposed to be issued on, April 10, 2015. Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6 21. It appears that both sides are wrong. Although the PIP states that it lasts 60 days from April 10, 2015, HR determined that it would actually last 60 days from April 24, 2015, the date the PIP was presented to Plaintiff.
