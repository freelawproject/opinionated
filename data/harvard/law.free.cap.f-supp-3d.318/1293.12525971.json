CORRIGAN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The parents of St. Johns County, along with teachers and administrators of the St. Johns County School District, have a solemn obligation to guard the well-being of the children in their charge. As recent events from around the country have tragically demonstrated, this is a very challenging job. Recognizing the difficulty of this task and that local school boards, answerable to the citizens of their community, are best situated to set school policy, federal courts are reluctant to interfere. Nevertheless, the federal court also has a solemn obligation: to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States. That is why federal courts around the country have recognized the right of transgender students to use the bathroom matching their gender identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Drew Adams is a rising senior at Allen D. Nease High School. He is transgender, meaning he \"consistently, persistently, and insistently\" identifies as a boy, a gender that is different than the sex he was assigned at birth (female).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At trial, Adams testified: \"I am a boy and I know that with every fiber of my being.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, when the principal of Nease was asked whether she considered Adams to be a boy, she replied, \"I do not.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   That's what this case is about. Everyone agrees that boys should use the boys' restroom at Nease and that girls should use the girls' restroom. The parties disagree over whether Drew Adams is a boy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I can only answer that question with the evidence given to me at trial. Drew Adams says he is a boy and has undergone extensive surgery to conform his body to his gender identity; medical science says he is a boy; the State of Florida says so (both Adams' Florida birth certificate and Florida driver's license say he is a male); and the Florida High School Athletic Association says so. Other than at his school, Adams uses the mens' bathroom wherever he goes, including in this federal courthouse during trial. Even the St. Johns County School Board regards Adams as a\n   boy in every way, except for which bathroom he can use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When confronted with something affecting our children that is new, outside of our experience, and contrary to gender norms we thought we understood, it is natural that parents want to protect their children. But the evidence is that Drew Adams poses no threat to the privacy or safety of any of his fellow students. Rather, Drew Adams is just like every other student at Nease High School, a teenager coming of age in a complicated, uncertain and changing world. When it comes to his use of the bathroom, the law requires that he be treated like any other boy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court recognizes that some will disagree with this decision, for religious and other reasons. I respect their point of view. However, as a judge, my job is to determine what the law requires and apply it faithfully to the facts. I have done that to the best of my ability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Through his next friend and mother, plaintiff Drew Adams, a minor,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed suit in June 2017 (when he was a rising junior at Nease) under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging that the School District violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, \u00a7 2, and Title IX,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , by refusing to let him use the boys' bathroom at school.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 (and as amended, Doc. 60). Soon thereafter, he filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the School Board (the School District's governing body) from continuing its policy during the pendency of the case. Although the Court denied his motion, it set an expedited schedule so the matter could quickly be brought to trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 50, 57 (Order and hearing transcript). The Court held a three day non-jury trial on December 11, 12, and 13, 2017, hearing testimony from ten witnesses\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and admitting numerous exhibits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two witnesses were unable to appear live and the Court agreed to accept their videotaped deposition testimony and a declaration from one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties also stipulated\n   to certain facts that are deemed admitted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   A month after the trial (and while school was out of session), the undersigned toured Nease High School with the school principal and counsel for both sides, visiting every restroom on campus. Thereafter, the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and supplemental briefs addressing the School Board's bathroom policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 172, 173-1,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   174, 175. The Court heard closing arguments on February 16, 2018. Doc. 184. While the Court has adopted portions of each party's submission, the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law are its own. Several pending motions were carried with the case, and those rulings are incorporated herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Defining Transgender/Gender Identity/Sex Assigned at Birth\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As explained by Dr. Diane Ehrensaft, a developmental and clinical psychologist who studies and specializes in treating transgender children and adolescents, there are a number of components that determine a person's gender: external genitalia, internal sex organs, chromosomal sex, gonadal sex, fetal hormonal sex, hypothalamic sex, pubertal hormonal sex, neurological sex, and gender identity and role. Doc. 166, Ct. Ex. 3 at \u00b6 20.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among these markers, external genitalia, the most physically obvious one, has historically been used to determine gender for purposes of recording a birth as male or female.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    at \u00b6 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In most people, all the markers, including external genitalia, lead to a singular conclusion that an individual is either a male or a female. Doc. 166, Ct. Ex. 3 at \u00b6 19.

From a young age, Adams' parents noticed that Adams rejected what they describe as stereotypically feminine behaviors and attributes, such as playing with dolls, favoring the color pink, or wearing dresses; instead, Adams preferred playing with toy race cars and dinosaurs, and going to the science center. Doc. 160-1 at Tr. 217-18; Doc. 161 at Tr. 87. Nonetheless, Adams was a happy and smart child. Doc. 160-1 at Tr. 81, 189.

Under the Best Practices Guidelines, upon request by a student or parent, students should be addressed with the name and gender pronouns corresponding with\n   the student's consistently asserted gender identity; school records will be updated upon receipt of a court order to reflect a transgender student's name and gender; unofficial school records will use a transgender student's chosen name even without a court order; transgender students are allowed to dress in accordance with their gender identity; students are permitted to publicly express their gender identity; and the school will not unnecessarily disclose a student's transgender status to others.

Doc. 162 at Tr. 75-78. In February 2017, the Departments of Education and Justice withdrew the 2016 Guidance, explaining that it had not undergone any formal public process and had been issued without extensive legal analysis or explanation as to how it was consistent with Title IX. Doc. 152, Def. Ex. 237.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Incorporating both the long-standing unwritten School Board bathroom policy and the Best Practices Guidelines, the current policy in St. Johns County public schools for grades four and up is that \"biological boys\" may only use boys' restrooms or gender-neutral single-stall bathrooms and \"biological girls\" may only use girls' restrooms or gender-neutral single-stall bathrooms, with the terms \"biological boys\" and \"biological girls\" being defined by the student's sex assigned at birth, as reflected on the student's enrollment documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 162 at Tr. 45-46, 62, 71; Doc. 161 at Tr. 248.

The retired Director of Student Services who led the LGBTQ task force explained the privacy concerns:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [W]hen a girl goes into a girls' restroom, she feels that she has the privacy to change clothes in there, to go to the bathroom, to refresh her makeup. They talk to other girls. It's kind of like a guy on the golf course; the women talk in the restrooms, you know. And to have someone else in there that may or may not make them feel uncomfortable, I think that's an issue we have to look at. It's not just for the transgender child, but it's for the other.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Doc. 161 at Tr. 213. The School District's Deputy Superintendent for Operations raised similar points, saying a student may want privacy to undress or clean up a stain on her clothing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201001.42\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Tr. 248. The School Board Attorney also explained that allowing a transgender student to use a restroom that conformed to his or her gender identity could create opportunities for students \"with untoward intentions to do things they ought not to do,\" although the School Board has never received any complaints of untoward behavior involving a transgender student. Doc. 162 at Tr. 112-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As for the safety aspect, the School Board seeks to assure that members of the opposite sex are not in an unsupervised bathroom together, citing as an example the risks of danger posed to a female freshman student who might find herself alone in the restroom with an 18-year old male student.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201001.42\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Tr. 69, 111, 115. A related concern raised by the retired Director of Student Services was that under a relaxed policy, a student-a football player for example-could pose as being gender-fluid for the purpose of gaining access to the girls' restroom, but the school would have no way to know whether his belief that he is gender-fluid is sincere. Doc. 161 at Tr. 213. However, the task force's research did not reveal any actual situations where a problem like that occurred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201001.42\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Tr. 213.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The retired Director of Student Services also expressed concern for the safety of transgender students, worrying that they might be bullied or assaulted or ridiculed by other students if they are in the bathroom that matches their gender identity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201001.42\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Tr. 217. While the School Board's code of conduct would address any violations, by keeping boys and girls separate in the unsupervised restrooms, the School Board seeks to minimize the opportunity for any such violation to occur. Doc. 162 at Tr. 115. However, the School Board is not aware of any bullying violations involving a transgender student in any St. Johns County School District restroom,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201001.42\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Tr. 115, nor did the task force hear of any such incidents in other school districts involving transgender students using the restroom that aligned with their gender identity. Doc. 161 at Tr. 219-20. Moreover, the retired Director of Student Services acknowledged that for a transgender student who has made the social transition and whose appearance is consistent with his or her gender identity (for example, a transgender girl whose hair is long, whose\n   breasts are enhanced, who is wearing lipstick), there may be safety, security, and privacy concerns if that student used the restroom that is consistent with the sex the student was assigned at birth; thus, she thought it would be preferable if such a student used a gender-neutral single-stall bathroom.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201001.42\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Tr. 207-09; 217-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Additionally, if a transgender student enrolled in the St. Johns County School District having already changed their legal documents to reflect their gender identity, the student's school records would reflect that gender as well. Doc. 162 at Tr. 35. The school district has no process to determine if a student is transgender. Doc. 161 at Tr. 235. As the School Board Attorney said, \"[t]he district does not play bathroom cop,\" and it accepts the information on the enrollment documents at face value. Doc. 162 at Tr. 53. Thus, unless there was a complaint, a transgender student could use the restroom matching his or her gender identity until he or she graduated and the school would be none the wiser.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201001.42\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Tr. 35-36, 53.

The Court is mindful that schools are traditionally locally controlled and that a federal court should tread lightly when asked to contravene a policy established by a local school board. Minor children are involved here and the concerns of their parents and school administrators charged with their safety cannot be minimized. Moreover, of all the areas in a school, bathrooms are where privacy considerations are at their peak. So, even if a school is otherwise prepared to accept a student as transgender, it is not surprising that allowing transgender students to use restrooms aligned with their gender identity is not an easy step. But neither was it easy when public restrooms were racially integrated. To be sure, what the law requires and what some are comfortable with are not always the same.

Doc. 162 at Tr. 67. The Court agrees that the School Board has a legitimate interest in protecting student privacy, which extends to bathrooms. But allowing transgender students to use the restrooms that match their gender identity does not affect the privacy protections already in place. When he goes into a restroom, Adams enters a stall, closes the door, relieves himself, comes out of the stall, washes his hands, and leaves. Adams has encountered no problems using men's restrooms in public places, and there were no reports of problems from any boys or boys' parents during the six weeks of his freshman year when Adams used the boys' restrooms at Nease. Nor was there any evidence that any school official associated with the St. Johns County School District, including members of its LGBTQ task force, had ever heard of any incident anywhere where a transgender student using a restroom acted in a manner that invaded another student's privacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Likewise, the research and experience of the school officials from Broward County and Jefferson County Public Schools in Kentucky revealed no privacy concerns when transgender students used the restroom that matched their gender identity. While St. Johns County School personnel said girls may want privacy in the restrooms while talking to their peers, changing clothes (which can be done in a stall), putting on make-up, or removing stains from their clothing, none of that requires them to expose their anatomy to other students such that having a transgender student in the restroom would invade their bodily privacy. And, any student who wants additional privacy for any reason is permitted to use the gender-neutral single-stall bathrooms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Admittedly, the boys' restrooms at Nease- which Adams would use if he could- have urinals without dividers, so if someone chose to be a voyeur, there is the potential that a boy's genitals could be viewed. But this is not a real concern for several reasons. First, Adams cannot use a urinal and always uses a stall. Second, there is no evidence that a transgender boy is more likely to be curious about another student's anatomy than any other boy. Third, any student engaging in voyeurism in the bathroom would be engaging in misconduct which is subject to discipline through the School District's code of conduct. Fourth, any boy who is concerned about other students seeing his anatomy can use a gender-neutral bathroom or a stall in the boys' restroom (as Adams would when using the boys' restroom).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Nor was there any evidence that transgender students might expose themselves to other students in the restroom; in fact, the evidence was to the contrary- transgender students want to be discrete about their anatomy so other students do not recognize them as anything but the gender with which they identify. Indeed, as the School Board admitted, there could be transgender students whose enrollment documents are consistent with the students' gender identity, and no one would know they are using restrooms that are different from the ones that match their sex assigned at birth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Based on the evidence at trial, the Court concludes that the School District's bathroom policy \"does nothing to protect the privacy rights of each individual student vis-a-vis students who share similar anatomy and it ignores the practical reality of how [Adams], as a transgender boy, uses the bathroom: by entering a stall and closing the door.\"\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1050\">\n    858 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1052 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boyertown\n   </em>\n   , 893 F.3d at 193 (rejecting cisgender students' argument that\n   transgender students in school locker rooms and multi-stall restrooms violated their constitutional right to privacy, noting \"appellants are claiming a very broad right of personal privacy in a space that is, by definition and common usage, just not that private\").

Safety\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The School Board also cites student safety as a basis to uphold its bathroom policy, expressing concern for transgender students who may be bullied or harassed in the bathroom matching their gender identity and for cisgender students who may not feel safe if a person with genitalia of the opposite sex is in the restroom with them. There was no evidence that Adams encountered any safety concerns during the six weeks he used the boys' restroom at Nease or when he does so in other public places. Likewise, there was no evidence that Adams presents any safety risk to other students or that transgender students are more likely than anyone else to assault or molest another student in the bathroom. Any incidents of misconduct are subject to the school's code of conduct and, if necessary, Florida criminal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   None of the school officials who testified had ever heard of an incident where student safety was compromised by the presence of a transgender student in the restroom that matched his or her gender\n   identity. Again, any student with safety concerns-including a transgender student-can use a gender-neutral single-stall bathroom. Consistent with a number of other courts that have considered the issue, this Court finds concern for student safety is not an \"exceedingly persuasive justification\" for upholding the school bathroom policy.\n   <em>\n    Virginia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730076\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/515/#p532\">\n    518 U.S. at 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730076\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/515/#p532\">\n    116 S.Ct. 2264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Evancho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268046\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/237/267/#p288\">\n    237 F.Supp.3d at 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding safety concerns were unfounded given availability of disciplinary code and lack of record of any threat that a student would pose as transgender to gain access to a restroom);\n   <em>\n    Highland\n   </em>\n   , 208 F.Supp.3d at 876-77 (finding testimony from other districts showed parents' safety concerns to be \"wholly unfounded in practice\" and noting that any worry about sexual activity in the bathrooms was \"logical[ly] flaw[ed]\" given that gay males were not excluded from boys' restrooms and gay females were not excluded from girls' restrooms).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Additional Considerations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Although the Court has found that the School Board's concerns about privacy and safety are only conjectural (and therefore insufficient to survive intermediate scrutiny), the School District says it creates policy with an eye toward minimizing the risk of future problems, even if none have ever occurred. With that in mind, the Court has carefully considered whether the eleven gender-neutral single-stall bathrooms on campus (which are open to all students) provide an appropriate accommodation for Adams such that more is not required. They do not. While there are more stalls available in gender-neutral bathrooms (eleven) than in the multi-stall boys' restrooms (ten), some of them are further away from Adams' classes. More importantly, however, Adams testified to the stigma that attaches to his use of gender-neutral bathrooms, especially when he has to walk right past an available boys' restroom to find one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 160-1 at Tr. 204 (describing the walk from his class to a gender-neutral single-stall bathroom as \"feel[ing] almost like a walk of shame\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   He also testified about the message it sends to other students that the school does not view him as a real boy. Using his words: \"[B]ecause I'm using a special bathroom and I'm oftentimes passing a men's bathroom, everybody knows I'm different, and I just want to fit in. So it's the opposite of what I want.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Tr. 205. In\n   <em>\n    Boyertown\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit rejected the suggestion from cisgender students that the school should offer transgender students the opportunity to use gender-neutral single-stall facilities, finding that policy \"invite[s] more scrutiny and attention\" from the transgender students' peers, \"very publicly brand[ing] all transgender students with a scarlet \"T\" [which] they should not have to endure ... as the price of attending their public school.\" 893 F.3d at 192 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1050\">\n    858 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1045 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds the placement of\n   the numerous gender-neutral single-stall bathrooms on campus, while useful and well-intentioned, does not remedy the Equal Protection violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The retired Director of Student Services testified that the task force was concerned about what to do about \"gender-fluid\" students if the School District strayed from its long-standing policy of only permitting \"biological boys\" to use the boys' restroom and only permitting \"biological girls\" to use the girls' restroom. The general point is well-taken, but merely hypothetical given where we are. This case does not raise the issue of what to do about gender-fluid students; rather, the question here is whether to permit a transgender boy who has taken significant social, medical and legal measures to present as a boy (and who never intends to use a girls' restroom) to have access to the boys' restroom. Thus, to the extent school officials are worried that gender-fluid students might be using a boys' restroom one day and a girls' restroom the next, that would not happen if relief is granted here because this case is only about permitting one transgender boy to use the boys' restroom.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   For this same reason, the hypothetical worry that cisgender students might pose as gender-fluid for the purpose of gaining access to the restroom of the opposite sex is not a valid concern here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   This case is not about eliminating separate sex bathrooms; it is only about whether to allow a transgender boy to use the boys' bathroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court likewise rejects the contention that permitting Adams to use the boys' restroom is just the beginning of a \"slippery slope\" which will result in the elimination of separate sex restrooms. As explained by the Medical Amici, a transgender individual \" 'consistently, persistently, and insistently' identifies as a gender different than the sex they were assigned at birth.\" Doc. 119, Ex. A at 7. Transgender individuals are not gender-fluid and their sense of who they are is settled. Adams does not want to use the girls' restroom. The undisputed evidence is that he is a transgender boy and wants to use the boys' restroom. There is no evidence to suggest that his identity as a boy is any less consistent, persistent and insistent than any other boy. Permitting him to use the boys' restroom will not integrate the restrooms between the sexes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Even so, the School Board contends that its policy is simply based on the realistic physical differences between the sexes.

The Court's consideration in the Equal Protection analysis of harm to Adams caused by the School Board policy excluding Adams from the boys' restrooms applies here too. Thus, as in a number of other cases where transgender students have raised Title IX challenges to their school's bathroom policies, the issue here is whether the bathroom policy which excludes Adams from the boys' restroom based on his transgender status is discrimination \"on the basis of\n   sex\" as used in Title IX and its implementing regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Title IX does not define the term \"sex,\" nor do its regulations.

Remedy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Having found that the School Board's bathroom policy violates Adams' rights under the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX, the Court must now consider the remedy. In his proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, Adams has narrowed the scope of his requested injunctive relief from that requested in his amended complaint, and seeks to permanently enjoin the School Board \"from enforcing any policy, practice, or custom of the St. Johns County School District that denies transgender students access to and use of restrooms that match a student's gender identity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 175 at 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The evidence has established that Drew Adams is a transgender boy. Adams has undergone social, medical, and legal transitions to present himself as a boy. Adams wears his hair short; he dresses like a boy; his voice is deeper than a girl's; his family, peers, classmates and teachers use male pronouns to refer to him; he takes hormones which suppress menstruation and make his body more masculine, including the development of facial hair and typical male muscle development; he has had a double mastectomy so his body looks more like a boy; the state of Florida has provided him with a birth certificate and driver's license which state he is a male; and when out in public, Adams uses the men's restroom. As a transgender boy, Adams must be permitted to use the boys' restroom at school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   However, the Court has had no occasion in the context of this case to determine what threshold of transition, if any, is necessary for the School Board to accommodate other transgender students, nor did the parties ask the Court to do so. The Court received no evidence concerning any other transgender student. Thus, the injunction that will enter in this case will be limited to the plaintiff, Drew Adams.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \"[D]amages for emotional distress or mental anguish are at best difficult to measure.\"\n   <em>\n    Benton v.

The School Board argued that Adams is in therapy only as needed, he is not taking medications for anxiety or depression, and he suffered from pre-existing medical conditions, so it is hard to say that not using the boys' restroom is really the cause of his distress.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 160-1 at Tr. 90, 131, 188.

Although the School Board did not have transgender students in mind when it originally established separate multi-stall restrooms for boys and girls, it has since become aware of the need to treat transgender students the same as other students and does so in all other respects, except when it comes to the bathroom policy: A student whose sex assigned at birth is female is subject to discipline if the student identifies as a male and uses the boys' restroom, whereas the same student would be free to use the boys' restroom if his sex assigned at birth was male or if he agreed to act in conformity with the School Board's expectations and use the girls' restroom.
