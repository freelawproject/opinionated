Currently before the Court is Defendants' motion [99] to dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint and, in the alternative, for a more definite statement, and Defendants' motion to strike certain exhibits from Plaintiff's Amended Complaint. For the reasons stated below, Defendants' motion to dismiss [99] is granted. Plaintiff's Amended Complaint is dismissed without prejudice. Plaintiff is given until August 17, 2018 to file a second amended complaint consistent with this opinion, if Plaintiff believes that she can overcome the deficiencies identified below. This case is set for further status hearing on August 22, 2018 at 9:00 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Lisa Parks (\"Plaintiff\") began working for Defendant Speedy Title &amp; Appraisal Review Services (\"STARS\") in June 2012 as a real estate review appraiser. [96, at 3.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant Anthony Greer served as Plaintiff's direct supervisor beginning in January 2013. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Defendant Karie Magedoff was the Director of Human Resources at STARS during Plaintiff's employment. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Defendants Greer and Magedoff worked out of STARS' office in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, while Plaintiff telecommuted from Chicago, Illinois. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to Plaintiff, when she began working at STARS, she was a good employee who received good evaluations along with Quality of Excellence Awards in 2012 and 2013. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 3, 6.] Plaintiff also alleges that she was well-qualified for the position based on her prior work experience and advanced education. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 2.] However, Plaintiff alleges that at some point during her tenure at STARS, her superiors (particularly Defendant Greer) began to harass her in various ways or to otherwise contribute to a hostile and unfair work environment that forced her to eventually resign her position as an appraiser in 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to Plaintiff, soon after she was hired in 2012, Defendant Greer threatened to give her more difficult assignments than other employees. Plaintiff thereafter received more assignments than other appraisers. [96, \u00b6\u00b6 18-21.] Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant Greer sent Plaintiff unnecessary copies of work-related e-mails to her personal e-mail account, which made her feel unsafe; did not refer\n   to her awards in a professional manner; completed work for other employees but not for Plaintiff; and disciplined her for errors that were non-critical or not her fault. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 14, 24, 31, 40.] Defendant Greer also allegedly disciplined Plaintiff more frequently and more severely than other employees, and over time her performance evaluations stopped being as positive as they had initially been when she began her job at STARS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15.] Plaintiff alleges that another supervisor, Andrew Reisser, once threatened her in a meeting along with Defendant Greer and \"spoke in a voice louder than normal\" to her. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 4.] Plaintiff makes other general allegations of verbal threats and disciplinary actions by STARS employees, but does not specify what those threats were or who (besides Reisser and Greer) made such threats. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 6-7.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2014, Plaintiff received two corrective actions (one in August and one in December). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 6-9.] These corrective actions seem to be related to technical issues that Plaintiff faced in performing her job responsibilities. As a telecommuter, Plaintiff faced many technical difficulties in completing her work on the STARS system, affecting her work output. These technical issues were not properly addressed, however, and she was reprimanded in these corrective actions for not completing her work despite Defendant Greer's knowledge of these technical issues she encountered throughout her tenure. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 26-27, 33, 51.] While technical support employees would call Plaintiff in an attempt to address and fix these issues, they would often call her near or during her lunch hour. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The August 2014 corrective action that she received via email stated that Plaintiff was no longer eligible for merit increases, promotions, or transfers. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 7.] Plaintiff was also denied a raise during her 2014 performance review after she received these two corrective actions. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 15, 34.] According to Plaintiff, these corrective actions were retaliatory and part of the harassment that she faced at STARS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff makes various other allegations regarding her salary and benefits while she was employed as an appraiser at STARS. STARS paid Plaintiff less than her male \"and possibly female\" counterparts, despite her advanced experience and education. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 38.] Although other employees received overtime pay, Plaintiff was denied such overtime. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.] Plaintiff also had to work additional hours without pay in order to remain employed at STARS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 32.] According to Plaintiff, she would have qualified for a better benefits plan and higher company contributions with a better salary. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 53.] Plaintiff was also issued an insurance policy by STARS, but STARS could not properly explain this policy to her. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 52.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff describes various other conditions of her employment that contributed to the hostile and threatening environment she faced while employed at STARS. Plaintiff maintains that she was not given a balanced workload as she was promised, and that at times she was given more assignments than other appraisers. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 18, 21.] Additionally, STARS managers continually insisted that she was an underwriter, rather than an appraiser, [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 2-5, 10-11, 29]; STARS took excessive deductions from her paycheck and lost one of her paychecks in 2015, [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 2, \u00b6 13]; Plaintiff often faced confusion about whether or not she needed to travel to New Jersey for training opportunities, and for one such training trip she was not reimbursed as quickly for her travel expenses as other employees, [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 25, 35-37]; and Plaintiff was forced to get a second internet contract at her home in order to work, although other employees were\n   allowed to use their regular internet contract, [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 40-41].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff reported at least some of these events to Defendant Magedoff in December 2014 and February 2015, including Defendant's Greer's treatment of her. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 16, 23.] Defendant Magedoff failed to discipline Defendant Greer appropriately, nor did she speak to Plaintiff about how to cope with the treatment she had received. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 57.] Plaintiff claims that she also made reports to the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulations (\"IDFPR\"), the Illinois Department of Labor, and the New Jersey Board of Real Estate Appraisers, although she does not describe the timing or the contents of these reports. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 5.] Plaintiff does allege that she spoke extensively with a representative of the IDFPR. The exact content of these conversations is unclear, but it seems that Plaintiff spoke to this representative about proper methods of recordkeeping and STARS's failure to follow these methods. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 1-6.] According to Plaintiff, she discussed contacting the IDFPR with her STARS supervisor Andy Reisser in July 2014. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 2.] Plaintiff also started the process of filing a complaint with the EEOC in December 2014, after receiving her second corrective action. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9.] Plaintiff wrote to the EEOC again after Greer spoke to her in a \"very unprofessional\" manner in March 2015. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 31.] Based on the sum total of these events and the hostility that Plaintiff felt at her job, Plaintiff resigned from STARS on March 23, 2015. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 35.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that she is a member of a protected class because she is female and African American. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 4.] She notes that she was the only African American employee in her department in 2014. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 7.] According to Plaintiff, at least some of the disciplinary actions that she faced at STARS were motivated by her membership in these protected classes, as well as by her complaints about STARS both internally and to the IDFPR. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 6-7.] Other such actions were, according to the Amended Complaint, \"retaliatory\" or otherwise related to the corrective actions that she had received. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 15, 34, 51.] Plaintiff had no choice but to leave her position after this treatment became increasingly hostile and an IDFPR representative suggested to her that she resign. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 7.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit against Defendants in February 2016 after receiving a Notice of Right to Sue letter from the EEOC in December 2015. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, [see 29], and the Court struck this motion without prejudice after granting Plaintiff's oral motion for leave to file an amended complaint [34]. Plaintiff filed her Amended Complaint in August 2017. [See 96.] In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff brings claims for wrongful termination in violation of Title VII (Count I); discrimination in violation of Title VII and Title VI (Count II); retaliation in violation of Title VII (Count III); violation of FLSA (Count IV); violation of Section 1981 (Count V); violations of the IMWL and the EPA (Count VI); violation of the IWA (Count VII); violation of the CEPA (Count VIII); violation of ERISA (Count IX); violations of appraiser independence requirements (Count X); and violations of the Dodd-Frank Act (Count XI). Defendants again moved to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, for a more definite statement. [See 99.] Defendants also moved to strike Exhibits G and I from Plaintiff's Amended Complaint.

To the extent that Plaintiff has stated a valid claim, Defendants move for a more definite statement on those valid claims, setting forth the basis for each Defendant's liability and the facts supporting them. Defendants have also moved to strike Exhibit G and Exhibit I from the Amended Complaint.

Her allegations in Count VIII relate to the internal disciplinary actions that she received, but do not allege any rule that this violates, nor does she allege that she was a whistleblower regarding any of these activities. The only law that Plaintiff references is a New Jersey law stating that STARS \"should have told appraisers about office closings.\" [96, \u00b6 49.] But she does not identify the law to which she refers, nor does she state that she complained about STARS's failure to follow this law and suffered an adverse employment action as a result.

According to Plaintiff, the Dodd-Frank Act states that appraisers should be paid \"reasonable and customary fees,\" but she was not paid in line with her qualifications. [See 96, \u00b6 61.] Plaintiff does not cite to any particular portion of Dodd-Frank, but\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201026.42\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1026.42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a federal regulation promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, states that \"[i]n any covered transaction, the creditor and its agents shall compensate a fee appraiser for performing appraisal services at a rate that is customary and reasonable for comparable appraisal services performed in the geographic market of the property being appraised.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201026.42\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1026.42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1).
