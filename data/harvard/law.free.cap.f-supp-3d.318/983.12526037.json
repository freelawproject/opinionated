The court held a hearing on these motions on May 23, 2018. The Individual Defendants all consented to jurisdiction after the hearing. Dkts. 79, 80. After considering the motions, responses, replies, arguments at the hearing, related filings, and the applicable law, the court is of the opinion that the motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction (partially, Dkts. 25, 46, 51) should be DENIED, the motions to dismiss under the TCPA (Dkts. 26, 47, and, partially, Dkts. 18, 51, 52) should be either GRANTED (Dkts. 18, 26, 47, 51) or GRANTED IN PART DENIED IN PART (Dkt. 52), and the motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) (partially, Dkts. 18, 25, 46, 51, 52) should be either DENIED AS MOOT (Dkts. 18, 25, 46, 51, 52) or GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART (Dkt. 52). Additionally, the motion for bond (Dkt. 30) should be DENIED, and the evidentiary objections (Dkt. 76) should be OVERRULED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case is about issues that are particularly significant to the Vietnamese American community. Plaintiff Tu Nguyen's father, Dam Phong Nguyen, was a prominent journalist in Vietnam who wrote under the name Dam Phong. Dkt. 63 at 4. Dam Phong Nguyen, his wife, and ten children (including Tu) escaped the communist government in Vietnam in 1975.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 72-2 at 5 (\"My family and I previously lived in Vietnam and like many other individuals, had to escape the communist government in Vietnam at great risk to my life.\"). By 1981, the family had settled in Houston, Texas, and Dam Phong Nguyen had founded a Vietnamese language newspaper. Dkt. 63 at 4-5. In 1982, he published some investigative reports about a group known as \"The Front.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Tu Nguyen contends that The Front wanted Dam Phong Nguyen to discontinue publishing the investigative reports, falsely accused Dam Phong Nguyen of being a communist and supporting the Vietnamese government, and threatened Dam Phong Nguyen's life. Dkt. 72-2. On August 24, 1982, when Tu Nguyen was 19 years old, Dam Phong Nguyen was murdered in front of his home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   No arrests were ever made.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Tu Nguyen has strong suspicion that agents of The Front were involved in his father's murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also believes that The Front is linked to the political party Viet Tan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After his father's murder, Tu Nguyen was concerned for his safety and the safety of his family.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He consequently refrained from participation in Vietnamese community activities for many years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, he began investing a possible link between The Front and Viet Tan in 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On or around November 3, 2015, Tu Nguyen was featured in a PBS Frontline documentary,\n   <em>\n    Terror in Little Saigon\n   </em>\n   . Dkt. 72-2; Dkt. 73-3. According to the translated transcript of a press conference given by defendant Diem Hoang Do on November 14, 2016, who was the Viet Tan party Chairman at the time, the film can\n   be summarized \"as alleging that the National United Front for Liberation of Vietnam [ (the Front) ] was behind the deaths of a few Vietnamese journalists in the 1980's. To give the impression that The Front was guilty, they painted the Vietnamese refugees community as radical, bent on using violence, and intending to resume a war to reclaim privileges and social positions they lost.\" Dkt. 73-3 at 3. Diem Hoang Do characterized the film's contents as \"offensive to the Vietnamese refugees community's struggle.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Tu Nguyen continued his investigation. In the summer of 2016, he learned that Viet Tan was not an officially incorporated entity. Dkt. 72-2. An acquaintance of Tu Nguyen's incorporated an entity in California named VT Corp (Viet Tan-Vietnam Reform Party).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Tu Nguyen was originally an officer in this corporation, but he has since resigned.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Registration of the name led to a lawsuit in California.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 46, Ex. 6 (Complaint,\n   <em>\n    Vietnam Reform Party v. Viet Tan-Vietnam Reform Party\n   </em>\n   , No. 5:17-cv-00291-NC (Jan. 20 2017) ). In this lawsuit, Viet Tan alleged that Tu Nguyen is a resident of Texas and the owner and incorporator of Viet Tan-Vietnam Reform Party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Viet Tan contended that it was formed on September 19, 2004, as an association of members whose aim is \"to establish democracy and reform Vietnam through peaceful and political means.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It asserted that since that time it has continually used its marks throughout California and the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Viet Tan alleged that the Viet Tan corporation \"was organized for the sole, improper purpose of interfering with [Viet Tan's] ongoing business and political activities and attempting to usurp control of [Viet Tan's] Marks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Viet Tan additionally alleged that Tu Nguyen contacted various individuals and organizations and advised that the Viet Tan corporation, as opposed to the original Viet Tan party, had exclusive rights to the Marks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Tu Nguyen and Viet Tan eventually settled the case. Dkt. 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Unfortunately, in the midst of this kerfuffle, Tu Nguyen contends that he started to receive death threats about his involvement with the creation of the Viet Tan corporation. Dkt. 68-1. He consequently started performing Internet searches of the names of various leaders of the RFA and Viet Tan, and he discovered numerous statements on the Internet about or relating to him that he contends are defamatory.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The statements, for the most part, indicate that Tu Nguyen's work to discredit Viet Tan is at least peripherally aiding the communist party in Vietnam. Dkt. 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Tu Nguyen contends that he has vivid memories of his father's murder and that the current death threats have made him fearful of leaving his home. Dkt. 72-2 at 7. He is afraid he \"may ultimately face the same fate as [his] father\" because of the statements made by the defendants in this lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He believes that the defendants in this lawsuit have falsely labeled him as a communist or communist sympathizer and asserts that \"being labeled as a communist or communist sympathizer can shatter a person's reputation in the [Vietnamese American] community.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. He explains that in the \"Vietnamese community in the United States, it is considered taboo and traitorous to show any support to the communist government in Vietnam.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Tu Nguyen states that he has never supported the communist government in Vietnam and is ideologically opposed to that government.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. In fact, he contends that he agrees with Viet Tan's stance against communism in Vietnam.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Tu Nguyen initiated this lawsuit on July 6, 2017. Dkt. 1. He originally sued (1) the Broadcasting Board of Governors Directors Leon Aron, Ryan Crocker, Michael W. Kempner, Jefferey Shell, and Matthew\n   Armstrong, in their official capacities; (2) RFA as a corporation; (3) Libby Liu, John Lansing, Bernadette M. Burns, Susan Lavery, Alan Tanenbaum, Norman Thompson, and Khanh Van Nguyen, who all appear to be affiliated in some way with RFA; (4) Viet Tan/Viet Nam Reform Party as an unincorporated association; (5) Duy Tu Hoang (Dan Hoang), Diem Hoang Do, Dinh Co Hoang, Chan Vu Dang, Xuyen Dong Matsuda, Doan Bui \"Ly Thai Hung,\" and Angelina Trang Huynh, who all appear to be affiliated with Viet Tan; (5) Nguoi Viet Daily News, Inc.; (6) Giao Thein Phu Pham; and (7) John Do # 1 through Doe # 10.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 3, 2018, summonses were issued relating to Doan Bui, Chan Vu Dang, Dim Hoang Do, Dan Hoang, Dinh Co Hoang, Angelina Trang Huynh, Libby Liu, Xuyen Dong Matsuda, Khanh Van Nguyen, RFA, Trinity Hong Thuan, and Viet Tan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. (Jan. 3, 2018). According to the record, each of these individuals except Trinity Hong Thuan was served at some point between February and March 2018. Dkts. 11-15, 19-24. Tu Nguyen did not serve the other originally named defendants. Tu Nguyen subsequently filed an amended complaint in which he only names the following individuals as defendants: Viet Tan/Viet Nam Reform Party, Duy Tu Hoang a/k/a Dan Hoang, Diem Hoang Do, Dinh Co Hoang, Chan Vu Dang, Xuyen Dong Matsuda, Trinity Hong Thuan, Doan Bui a/k/a Ly Thai Hung, Angelina Trang Huynh, and RFA. Dkt. 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Tu Nguyen alleges that the following statements are defamatory:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (1) On March 1, 2016, Chan Vu Dang wrote an article published in\n   <em>\n    Viet Times\n   </em>\n   magazine that allegedly accuses Tu of \"being a willing puppet for the communists in Vietnam.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (2) On April 25, 2016, Chan Vu Dang allegedly stated in an article published on Viet Tan's blog that Tu Nguyen \"was attacking Viet Tan and its ideals to fight against communism.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (3) On August 27, 2016, Dan Hoang allegedly issued a statement that indicated that Tu Nguyen and his collaborators were \"lending a hand in helping to let off the pressure on the Vietnamese Communist regime, and dispersing the common struggle of all Vietnamese.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (4) In the same statement, Dan Hoang allegedly stated that the \"scheme\" \"creates chaos in the Vietnamese community overseas,\" and then he called on \"all executive committees of community organizations, all media organizations, and all associations to be vigilant to isolate these saboteurs from the ranks of those who seek freedom and democracy for our country.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. Tu Nguyen contends that it called for community leaders to take action against him personally because he was assisting the communist regime in Vietnam.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (5) On August 28, 2016, Angelina Huynh, who Tu Nguyen contends is the executive director of Viet Tan, allegedly stated on Facebook that Tu Nguyen was \"serving the interests of the communist Vietnam\" and \" 'hiding behind the so-called \"search for justice\" to undermine efforts to fight for democratic freedom' \" and that the people doing this \" 'should be isolated, as this is serving the interests of the communist Vietnam.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (6) On April 27, 2016, Trinity Hong Thuan, an alleged Viet Tan member, allegedly stated that \" 'there is someone overseas who claims to \"seek justice for Dad\" but continues to use the communist dirty tactics' \" and this person \" 'should be condemned.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (7) On the same day, Trinity Hong Thuan allegedly also posted on her Facebook page that it was \" 'no surprise that [the plaintiff] and \"The People\" newspaper [the official communication of the communist party in Vietnam] form a tag team.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (8) On April 26, 2016, Xuyen Dong Matsuda allegedly posted an article by Hoi Trinh about Tu Nguyen on her two Facebook pages. Xuyen Dong Matsuda shared the article and allegedly stated that \" 'the communist party would succeed, to a certain extent, when it could condition the thought of those who care to the point that they agree with it.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. Tu Nguyen contends that the comment \"incites the idea that Tu [Nguyen] had been conditioned by the communist party of Vietnam to be in like mindset with it to further that party's objectives.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (9) On March 3, 2016, Xuyen Dong Matsuda allegedly created another Facebook page under the alias Xuyen Dan An and reposted the allegedly defamatory remarks of Chan Vu Dang calling Tu Nguyen a puppet for the communists. She also allegedly posted the article to a blog.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (10) In September 2016, Diem Hoang Do allegedly made a statement in front of the media stating that Tu Nguyen's actions benefitted the Vietnamese communist party \"and were offering a spear to the enemy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (11) On September 8, 2016, Dinh Co Hoang, who Tu Nguyen contends is the chair of the Viet Tan and former Chief Financial Officer of The Front, allegedly sent an email that accused Tu Nguyen of \"being a tool for the communist regime in Vietnam and sabotaging the cause of freedom and democracy for Vietnamese people.\" He also allegedly stated that Tu Nguyen brought his father \" 'back to life' \" by following in his footsteps, which Tu Nguyen interprets as meaning that his \"father deserved to be killed\" and Tu Nguyen deserves the same treatment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. Tu Nguyen contends that this email was re-broadcasted by Viet Tan members and sympathizers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (12) On September 2, 2016, Nguyen Tuong Thuy, who is not a party in this case, allegedly published an article on an RFA-affiliated blog. This article stated that Tu Nguyen stole Viet Tan's name and concluded that Tu Nguyen's work benefitted the communist party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (13) On November 14, 2015, Viet Tan issued a statement regarding\n   <em>\n    Terror in Little Saigon\n   </em>\n   . Diem Hoang Do held a press conference in Orange County, California, and Doan Bui held a press conference in Houston, Texas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. Tu Nguyen alleges that during these press conferences they \"insinuate[d that] the film and those involved,\" including Tu Nguyen, \"had the financial support of the Vietnamese communist government.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (14) On May 2, 2018, after the trademark case in California settled, Dan Hoang and Viet Tan issued a press release that was posted on Viet Tan's website.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. Tu Nguyen contends that the press release referred to him as a criminal defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (15) Tu Nguyen contends that Nguyen Tuong Thuy reposted his RFA article insinuating that Tu Nguyen's actions benefitted the Vietnamese communist party on his Facebook page on or around this same time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Tu Nguyen also argues that the Individual Defendants, who he contends are all high-ranking members of Viet Tan in America, worked in concert to defame his name by coordinated press conferences and making an erroneous connection between criticism of Viet Tan and having a relationship with communists.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. He additionally contends that RFA and the Viet Tan defendants \"have embarked on a witch hunt to defame Tu [Nguyen] with false accusations of being aligned with or acting for the communist party in Vietnam.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The defendants have all filed motions to dismiss:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (1) Libby Liu, Khanh Van Nguyen, and RFA filed their motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) and the TCPA on March 13, 2018.

Dkts. 25, 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (3) The Individual Defendants Group Two filed their motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and under Rule 12(b)(6) and the TCPA on April 20, 2018. Dkts. 46, 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (4) Diem Do and Viet Tan both filed motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) and the TCPA on April 26, 2018, and Diem Do's motion included a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Dkts. 51, 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The defendants all seek attorneys' fees or, in the alternative, sanctions, under the mandatory attorneys' fees provision of the TCPA. Dkts. 18, 26, 47, 51, 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   After Libby Liu, Khanh Van Nguyen, and RFA filed their motion to dismiss, Tu Nguyen voluntarily dismissed Libby Liu and Khanh Van Nguyen from the case. Dkt. 29 (filed Mar. 28, 2018). The next day, Libby Liu, Khanh Van Nguyen, and RFA filed a motion to require Nguyen to post a bond. Dkt. 30 (filed Mar. 29, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The court set a hearing on all these motions for May 23, 2018. Dkt. 49. Before the hearing, Tu Nguyen moved for leave to file the second amended complaint, and the court granted the motion. Dkts. 59, 62. After Tu Nguyen filed his second amended complaint on May 8, 2018, RFA filed a request to maintain the May 23 hearing, and the court maintained the hearing. Dkts. 63, 64. Prior to the hearing, Diem Do and Viet Tan's filed objections to Tu Nguyen's evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 76. The parties all appeared for the hearing on May 23. All of the defendants who filed motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction have now consented to jurisdiction. Dkts. 79, 80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The motions are ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    II. EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Diem Hoang Do and Viet Tan present two evidentiary objections. Dkt. 76. First, they object to the translator's \"note\" in a translation Tu Nguyen provided on a May 1, 2018 press release by Viet Tan. Dkt. 76 (objecting partially to Dkt. 72-16). Second, they object to a translation of an email that does not contain information about the person to whom the email was sent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (objecting to Dkt. 72-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   With regard to the translator's note, the translator stated that \"Bi Cao in this context is referring to the defendant as a criminal in criminal procedure, where as Bi Don is a defendant in a civil case.\" Dkt. 72-16. However, in the translated text, the translator merely uses the English word \"defendant\" without any modifiers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Diem Hoang Do and Viet Tan\n   object to the translator's note under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and 703, arguing that the note is improper expert testimony. Dkt. 76. Tu Nguyen argues that the note \"was inserted to highlight the distinction in Vietnamese between the words for criminal defendant versus civil defendant.\" Dkt. 81. He asserts that foreign languages cannot \" 'convey precisely and exactly the same idea and intent comprised in the original text, and it is unrealistic to impose an impossible requirement of exactness before allowing a translation to be considered.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Zambrana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306054\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/841/1320/#p1337\">\n    841 F.2d 1320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1337 (7th Cir. 1988) ). Tu Nguyen contends that if the court does not consider the note, \"the translation would be lacking the necessary context that would assist the Court in making its decision.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306054\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/841/1320/#p1337\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He points out that Diem Hoang Do and Viet Tan could have provided a competing translation and failed to do so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306054\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/841/1320/#p1337\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   While certainly it would have been helpful if the translator had just modified the translated word \"defendant\" with the word \"criminal\" rather than adding this context with a note, it is difficult to fault a translator for attempting to explain a variation in how things are interpreted by adding a note, especially to the extent that merely adding the English word \"criminal\" in front of \"defendant\" would not accurately convey the distinction. The note does not transform the translator into an expert any more than any particular translation of any other word in the document would do so. Moreover, Diem Hoang Do and Viet Tan were certainly not prohibited from offering a different translation or calling the translator to testify if they actually took issue with the substantive correctness of the note. The objection to the translator's note is therefore OVERRULED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The court now turns to the email.

RFA argues that a non-party's publishing of an article on an RFA blog cannot be construed as negligence on RFA's part, noting that there is no allegation that it viewed the article beforehand.

While Tu Nguyen contends that the gist of the entire article is that he is a communist or communist sympathizer, a review of the article, which\n   Tu Nguyen provided, reveals that the gist is more along the lines of questioning how Tu Nguyen's actions in California impact or could impact the Viet Tan party and those who refer to the party by this name. The article is, in fact, entitled: \"Is Viet Tan at risk of being a 'victim of circumstance'?\" Dkt. 40-7. Tu Nguyen seems to take more issue with the discrete statement that his work was in line with the interests of the Vietnamese communist party. This is an example of potential defamation by implication. But Tu Nguyen cannot make out a prima facie case of defamation based on this statement because there is no way to prove the truth or falsity of this statement.

Dkt. 26 at 10. They also argue that they can establish several of their defenses by a preponderance of evidence because the claims are outside of the statute of limitations and the plaintiff failed to request a retraction as required by the Defamation Mitigation Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Tu Nguyen contends that he has clear and specific evidence to support each element of his defamation claim.

He asserts that a reasonable person would perceive the statements of the Individual Defendants Group One as associating Tu Nguyen with communism.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. He additionally contends that he is a private individual and that the negligence, not malice, standard applies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The court briefly discussed the content of the allegedly defamatory publications of these defendants in Part IV.B.1.b,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .

The excerpt discusses documents Tu Nguyen publicized about the relationship between RFA and Viet Tan, which the\n   <em>\n    People's Newspaper\n   </em>\n   calls a \"terrorist organization.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Chan Vu Dang opines that \"the propaganda machine of the Vietnamese communists is using the allegations made by Mr. Nguyen Thanh Tu as a weapon to attack RFA.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The document discusses how the \"Vietnamese media are actively exploiting the American mainstream media\" and gives three points that those \"elements truly placing as top priority the struggle to eliminate the communist dictatorship need to remind each other.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After these points, it again mentions Tu Nguyen, stating that he \"attacked RFA\" the \"other day\" and posing questions about other ways in which \"the enemy would succeed\" in showing that people who \"oppose the communists are all bad people.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The gist of this document is about how the Vietnamese communists are allegedly using propaganda to \"attack Viet Tan,\" including using Tu Nguyen's allegations to \"sow dissention [sic.],\" and what Viet Tan can do to continue its mission to \"truly plac[e] as top priority the struggle to eliminate the communist dictatorship.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Certainly the article discusses Tu Nguyen's work as one part of the strategy, but the overall gist is much broader than that. The discrete statements about Tu Nguyen are about him attacking RFA, which implies, like the other statement, that Tu Nguyen is being used as a puppet or a weapon in the broader scheme. But again, these statements are opinion and not verifiable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   With regard to Trinity Hong Thuan, the Facebook statements are that Tu Nguyen \"continues to use communist dirty tactics\" and \"should be condemned\" and that Tu Nguyen and\n   <em>\n    The People\n   </em>\n   newspaper, which she contends is \"the official communication of the communist party in Vietnam,\" \"form a tag team.\" Dkt. 58 at 13 (citing Dkt. 55, Ex. F). These statements are all either opinions or cannot be considered false statements of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   With regard to Xuyen Dong Matsuda, Tu Nguyen contends that she defamed him on two Facebook posts in which she reposted an article from\n   <em>\n    VOICE\n   </em>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    VOICE\n   </em>\n   article rebuts points made in Tu Nguyen's recent article that the author states \"linked [a group called] VOICE and me to the Viet Tan party.\" Dkt. 55, Ex. J. The article states that Tu Nguyen's assertions \"are not based on the truth,\" and it discusses Trinh Hoi's background extensively.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It discusses the political affiliations of the board members of VOICE.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And then the author says, \"I would like Nguyen Thanh Tu to hear the following words of mine before I stop writing because he publicly denounced me by name.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Trinh Hoi then addresses points Tu Nguyen made regarding why he thought Trinh\n   Hoi was affiliated with Viet Tan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Trinh Hoi advises Tu Nguyen that he \"may not trample fairness and reason\" during his \"journey to seek truth and justice\" and that \"what goes around comes around.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The gist of this article is a defense to something Tu Nguyen had written, not an accusation that Tu Nguyen is affiliated with the communist party in Vietnam. The statement Xuyen Dong Matsuda made when reposting it on April, 26, 2016, is that \"the Communist Party would succeed, to a certain extent, when it could condition the thought of those who care to the point that they agree with it, that someone as likable and humane as Trinh Hoi or the organization ... like Viet Tan is 'bad.' \" Dkt. 55, Ex. I. This statement, even if one were to infer that it means that Tu Nguyen's thoughts were \"condition[ed]\" by the communist party because of what he wrote, can still only be considered an opinion. It is not verifiable. Tu Nguyen also takes issue with Xuyen Dong Matsuda allegedly reposting Chan Vu Dang's article on her alias's Facebook page. Dkt. 58 at 14. Again, however, this article cannot be considered defamatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Since none of these posts or statements is reasonably capable of defamatory meaning, Tu Nguyen is not able to show by clear and specific evidence that he can meet the elements of his defamation claim against these defendants. Moreover, even if Tu Nguyen has clear and specific evidence of each of the elements of defamation for all of these defendants, these defendants have shown that each statement was posted on the Internet outside of the limitations period, and Tu Nguyen cannot demonstrate that the discovery rule applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Under Texas law, the statute of limitations for a defamation claim in one year.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016.002\">\n    Tex.

Thus, these statements were all made outside of the limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Tu Nguyen contends that the statute of limitations was tolled under the discovery rule. Dkt. 58 at 15 (referring to his response to the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim); Dkt. 56 at 15-16. Under Texas law, whether the discovery rule applies is a question of law. Tu Nguyen asserts that he did not learn about these statements until October 2016 when he started searching the Internet after having received death threats. Dkt. 56 at 17. Tu Nguyen notes that Chan Vu Dang's article was published in a local magazine and was thus inherently undiscoverable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6880028\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/456/605/#p611\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He also asserts that the Facebook posts were inherently undiscoverable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6880028\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/456/605/#p611\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, as the defendants point out, Tu Nguyen was able to discover all of these posts when he became diligent about searching for the information in October 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 65 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Tu Nguyen cites\n   <em>\n    San Antonio Credit Union\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that he did not have an obligation to search the Internet for defamatory information. Dkt. 58. However,\n   <em>\n    San Antonio Credit Union\n   </em>\n   relates to the plaintiff discovering that a criminal complaint had been filed. The state court determined that \"[a] person should not be required to check his or her criminal record periodically for potentially an indefinite period, in the event that a complaint which might contain defamatory comments is filed against that person.\"\n   <em>\n    San Antonio Credit Union v.

The court noted that the \"nature of a criminal complaint makes it difficult if not impossible to discover.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9088504\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/115/82/#p98\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Here, Tu Nguyen contends in his affidavit that Chan Vu Dang's statements were in a blog and were also published on the Viet Tan website. Dkt. 55-1 \u00b6 32. The exhibit also states that it was posted on the Viet Tan website. Dkt. 55-3. Unlike the criminal complaint in\n   <em>\n    San Antonio Credit Union\n   </em>\n   , an article posted on the Viet Tan website on March 1, 2016, even if originally in a regional publication, was not \"difficult if not impossible to discover\" as of the date it was posted on the Viet Tan website, which was more than one year before Tu Nguyen filed suit.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9088504\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/115/82/#p98\">\n    115 S.W.3d at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He goes on to state that Thuan's \"statements were also published on the Viet Tan website.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9088504\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/115/82/#p98\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These statements therefore were not inherently undiscoverable. The defamation claim asserted against Trinity Hong Thuan for the statements she made on her Facebook\n   page are barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Next, with regard to the statements made by Xuyen Dong Matsuda, Tu Nguyen asserts the statements were made on her Facebook pages and does not state that they were reposted on Viet Tan's website. The court finds that these statements are more inline with the types of statements in the cases indicating that Internet postings are similar to a mass media publication than the type of statement in\n   <em>\n    San Antonio Credit Union\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Velocity Databank\n   </em>\n   , 456 S.W.3d at 610 (collecting cases finding that the Internet is a mass medium and determining that statements published on a government website that were accessible to the public were not inherently undiscoverable),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    San Antonio Credit Union\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9088504\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/115/82/#p98\">\n    115 S.W.3d at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the discovery rule applied to a criminal complaint that by nature was \"difficult if not impossible to discover\").

Here, it appears Tu Nguyen easily found the information on Facebook when he decided to start searching. The court finds that the discovery rule does not apply to Xuyen Dong Matsuda's Facebook posts and the defamation claim arising from the posts is barred by the statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Because the statements made by the Individual Defendants Group One are either opinions or not false statements of fact and were, regardless, all made outside of the limitations period and not inherently undiscoverable, the Individual Defendants Group One's motion to dismiss the defamation claim under the TCPA is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    3) Individual Defendants Group Two\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The Individual Defendants Group Two assert that Tu Nguyen cannot identify any statements made by them that contain defamatory facts or were false. Dkt. 47 at 10. They additionally assert that he cannot show by clear and specific evidence that they acted with malice or even negligence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9088504\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/115/82/#p98\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, they contend that they have established that the Tu Nguyen's defamation claims are barred by the Defamation Mitigation Act (\"DMA\") by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Tu Nguyen contends that the gist of the statements made by these defendants (and in fact all of the defendants) is that he is either a communist or a communist sympathizer. Dkt. 68 at 11. With regard to Dan Hoang, Tu Nguyen provides two documents in which he claims Hoang asserted Tu Nguyen was \"lending a hand\" to the Vietnamese communist regime and asked the community to isolate saboteurs like Tu Nguyen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Dkt. 68, Exs. B, C). He\n   also asserts that in discussing the California settlement, Hoang used the word for \"criminal defendant\" to describe Tu Nguyen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Dkt. 68, Ex. C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The first document is a press release issued by Viet Tan in which it announces that \"a group of individuals represented by Nguyen Thanh Tu\" incorporated the name Viet Tan in California. Dkt. 68, Ex. B. It explains that Viet Tan \"is an entity with the legal status as an unincorporated association\" and that Tu Nguyen and his \"collaborators\" were \"lending a hand in helping to let off the pressure on the Vietnamese Communist regime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It also \"respectfully call[s] on all executive committees of community organizations, all media organizations, and all associations to be vigilant and to isolate these saboteurs from the ranks of those who seek freedom and democracy for our country.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Individual Defendants Group Two assert that this press release is merely opinion and does not convey a verifiable fact. Dkt. 71 at 2-3 (citing\n   <em>\n    Tatum\n   </em>\n   ). They also contend that the publications do not have the gist asserted by Tu Nguyen, pointing out that publications \" 'typically have a single gist.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Tatum\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The court finds that the press release is a response to Tu Nguyen's incorporation of the name Viet Tan in California. The gist is essentially a rebuttal to Tu Nguyen's efforts to prohibit Viet Tan from using the name. The statement that Tu Nguyen was lending a hand to the communists in Vietnam is an opinion and cannot be verified. The statement about isolating saboteurs cannot be defamatory because the \"saboteurs\" portion is an opinion and the remainder of the statement is not a \"false statement of fact.\" In his affidavit, Tu Nguyen states that he believes the \"use of the word 'isolate' was meant to incite Viet Tan members to take action against me, including physical violence.\" Dkt. 68, Ex. A \u00b6 35. The court finds this troubling, but it is not actionable as defamation since it is not a false statement of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The second statement that Tu Nguyen asserts is a defamatory statement by Dan Hoang is a press release that describes the agreement reached in the California case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 68, Ex. C. The Individual Defendants Group Two assert that it is not clear this press release was even written by Dan Hoang, as he is listed as a \"contact\" not an author. Dkt. 71 at 2 &amp; n.2. The court agrees that on its face the document does not reveal that it is written by Dan Hoang.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 68, Ex. C (listing Viet Tan as the author and listing Duy Tu Hoang as the contact). In his affidavit, Tu Nguyen asserts that Dan Hoang is the spokesperson for Viet Tan and, \"[u]pon information and belief,\" that he drafts \"many if not all of the press releases.\" Dkt. 68, Ex. A \u00b6 35. The court need not reach the issue of whether this statement is defamatory because Tu Nguyen's evidence that Dan Hoang wrote this press release does not meet the clear and specific standard required under the TCPA. The first element of a defamation claim requires that the plaintiff show that the defendant published the statement, and Tu Nguyen does not meet that element with regard to this statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   With regard to Angelina Trang Huynh, Tu Nguyen contends that she posted Dan Hoang's press release on her Facebook page and commented that Tu Nguyen's actions were serving the interests of communist Vietnam. Dkt. 68 at 12 (citing Dkt. 68, Ex. D). Tu Nguyen provided a translation of this post, which states: \"Hiding behind the so-called 'search for justice' in order to undermine the fight for democratic freedom is unacceptable and should be isolated, as it means serving the interests o the Communist Party of Vietnam.\" Dkt. 68, Ex. D. She goes on to state it is \"pure lunacy\" to think registering an employee ID number with the IRS equates\n   to owning the name and that \"[t]his poor attempt at name stealing will be punished by the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Tu Nguyen contends this is defamation because it indicates that he is serving the interests of communist Vietnam. Dkt. 68. The Individual Defendants Group Two argue that this cannot be considered defamation because it is opinion. The court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   With regard to Dinh Co Hoang, Tu Nguyen contends that he sent an email accusing Tu Nguyen of \"being a tool of the communist regime\" and also sent a message \"that was interpreted as justifying the killing of [Tu Nguyen's] father.\" Dkt. 68 at 12 (citing Dkt. 68, Ex. E). Tu Nguyen asserts in his affidavit that the email was rebroadcast by Viet Tan members. Dkt. 68, Ex. A \u00b6 37. The email states that Tu Nguyen \"hides behind the initial guise of searching for the one who killed his father, in order to conduct many acts of sabotage, not only aiming at VietTan but also at most of the adversaries of the Vietnamese communists.\" Dkt. 68, Ex. E. It discusses Tu Nguyen's father briefly and states that Tu Nguyen \"follows the exmple of his father: Play pranks with the fight for liberty and democracy from Vietnam of his compatriots.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It also states that Tu Nguyen \"has given many people the sense of why the unfortunate thing had happened to [Tu Nguyen's father].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defendants contend that whether conduct is justified is not objectively verifiable and neither is describing a person as a tool. Dkt. 71 at 3. The court agrees that these are opinions and not verifiable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   With regard to Doan Bui, Tu Nguyen argues that Bui's speech to the media about the documentary\n   <em>\n    Terror it Little Saigon\n   </em>\n   was defamatory. Dkt. 68 at 12. He asserts that Bui's statements implied that the individuals involved with the documentary, including Tu Nguyen, were supported by the communists.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Dkt. 68, Ex. F). According to the translation of the transcript of the video, it was published on November 6, 2016. Dkt. 68, Ex. F. However, this transcript, or at least the translation the court received, discusses the killing of Tu Nguyen's father, but it does not mention Tu Nguyen.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The Individual Defendants Group Two note that Tu Nguyen contends that the speech insinuates that he received financial support from the communist government, which they assert is conclusory. Dkt. 71 at 4. They also assert that Tu Nguyen has provided no evidence negating that he received financial support.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court agrees that even if it were possible to infer from the transcript that Tu Nguyen received financial support from the communist government, Tu Nguyen has provided no evidence negating receipt of financial support and thus no clear and specific evidence that the \"statement\" is not true.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   In sum, because Tu Nguyen has not provided clear and specific evidence that the allegedly defamatory statements made by the Individual Defendants Group Two are false statements of fact, he has not met his burden under the TCPA with regard to these defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Individual Defendants Group Two's motion to dismiss the defamation claim under the TCPA is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    4) Diem Do\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Diem Do asserts that Tu Nguyen cannot provide clear and specific evidence to support the elements of his claims, and even if he could, Diem Do can establish several of his defenses by a preponderance of the evidence.

Dkt. 73 at 14.

In\n   <em>\n    Backes\n   </em>\n   , the Texas Court of Appeals in Dallas, in a case about allegedly defamatory Facebook posts, determined that the TCPA \"requires more than an inference that there was a meeting of the minds\" as it requires \"clear and specific evidence.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802040\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/486/7/#p27\">\n    486 S.W.3d at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that evidence of \"heated discussions\" between three women on Facebook and the fact that there were \"various postings between [two women] prior to [the allegedly defamatory] Post, many of which are mean-spirited\" did not meet the\n   threshold of \"clear and specific evidence\" of a meeting of the minds).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Here, Tu Nguyen asks the court to infer that there was a meeting of the minds because of the close relationship between RFA and Viet Tan and because RFA and the other defendants made their posts around the same time period. First, the court will address the evidence of a close relationship. Tu Nguyen asserts in his affidavit that Thuy is closely associated with Viet Tan, which brought him to the United States to attend an event hosted by RFA. Dkt. 55, Ex. A \u00b6 14. He also states that there are \"substantial connections between Libby Liu and Khanh Van Nguyen and the Viet Tan organization\" and that these individuals \"have allowed RFA to often serve as the mouthpiece for Viet Tan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. He states that he \"learned\" that Libby Liu, an RFA officer, \"has a very close connection to many high-ranking Viet Tan members\" and that Khanh Van Nguyen, an officer of RFA, \"has also been involved with Viet Tan owned or affiliated media outlets.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. He additionally asserts that RFA and Viet Tan have worked together in the past, pointing to a time when a Viet Tan member spoke at an RFA program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Finally, he contends that RFA and Viet Tan \"have significant financial connections,\" including financial contributions by RFA to Viet Tan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. The court finds that this testimony is not sufficient to amount to clear and specific evidence that RFA and Viet Tan had a meeting of the minds to conspire to defame Tu Nguyen. The fact that it appears the two entities have some sort of relationship or shared interests, without an indication that the shared interest is to defame Tu Nguyen, is not enough.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   With regard to the timing argument, the allegedly defamatory posts on RFA's site and by the Individual Defendants were about specific things that Tu Nguyen did during those time periods-appearing on the documentary, participating in the incorporation of a company that used the same name as Viet Tan, and settling the lawsuit relating to the incorporation of the Viet Tan name. The fact that the defendants had similar interests with regard to these activities does not lead to an inference that they were in cahoots, and it certainly is not clear and specific evidence of a meeting of the minds. Moreover, this inference cannot simply be tied to the circumstantial evidence that there was a relationship between RFA and Viet Tan to make up an inference that they must have met and conspired to defame Tu Nguyen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   In addition to the argument that RFA and Viet Tan conspired, Tu Nguyen appears to argue that Viet Tan and the Individual Defendants, all of whom are members of Viet Tan, conspired to defame him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 63. These defendants argue that an organization cannot conspire with itself under the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine. Dkts. 26, 47, 51, 52. Tu Nguyen argues that the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine \"does not state that a corporation cannot conspire with itself.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 72 at 23. He also asserts that the doctrine has not been applied to an unincorporated association, which does not enjoy the same privileges as a corporation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Tu Nguyen cites\n   <em>\n    Elliott v.

The Texas Supreme Court, in\n   <em>\n    Cox v.

Four years later, in\n   <em>\n    Juhl v.

She allegedly encouraged the reporter to \" 'make the Tatum tragedy public.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407910\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/526/462/#p468\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The reporter's article quoted the obituary of Paul Tatum and discussed the circumstances of his death in enough detail that readers were able to identify him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407910\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/526/462/#p468\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Texas Supreme Court, in determining whether to dismiss an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim filed against the petitioner by Paul Tatum's parents, determined that, notwithstanding the fact that the family was still in mourning when the article was published, the petitioner's \"indirect actions do not meet the high standard for extreme and outrageous conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407910\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/526/462/#p468\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Here, if there were an allegation that the defendants had directly asserted that Tu Nguyen is a communist, given Tu Nguyen's testimony about the impact of such a statement in the Vietnamese American community, it may have been sufficient to meet the high standard for extreme and outrageous conduct. But the inferential leap required to get from a statement that conduct was possibly aiding communists to the statement indicating one is a communist sympathizer or actually a communist is too steep for the court to conclude that, by providing the court with the statements, Tu Nguyen has provided clear and specific evidence of extreme and outrageous conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since he cannot meet this element with regard to all of the claims that stem from Tu Nguyen's contention that the gist of various statements is that he is a communist or a communist sympathizer, his intentional infliction of emotional distress claims must be dismissed under the TCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   In sum, because all of Tu Nguyen's intentional infliction of emotional distress claims stem from statements that Tu Nguyen additionally contends are defamatory, his intentional infliction of emotional distress claims fail because it is a gap-filler tort and there is no gap to fill. The claims that stem from the statements that Tu Nguyen contends suggest he is a communist or communist sympathizer because they indicate his actions were in some way aiding communists in Vietnam fail for the additional reason that Tu Nguyen has not provided clear and specific evidence that this is extreme and outrageous conduct. The motions to dismiss the intentional infliction of emotional distress claims under the TCPA are GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Rule 12(b)(6)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   All of the defendants also request dismissal of their claims for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). Since the court finds that dismissal is appropriate under the TCPA, with the exception of one claim against Viet Tan, there is no need to address the remainder of the Rule 12(b)(6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   motions. They are therefore DENIED AS MOOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   With regard to the motion to dismiss the defamation claim against Viet Tan based on the May 2018 press release, in its motion to dismiss, Viet Tan asserts that the amended complaint \"sets forth no facts to explain what Viet Tan allegedly did or how its unstated conduct resulted in liability.\" Dkt. 52. Tu Nguyen argues that the press release used the word for \"criminal defendant\" as opposed to the distinct word for defendant in a civil case and that this was in a formal statement by Viet Tan displayed on its website and social media page. Dkt. 72. Viet Tan replies that \"[n]one of the complained-of-statements are objectively verifiable, nor do they contradict anything that Plaintiff has pleaded as true.\" Dkt. 75 (citing\n   <em>\n    Tatum\n   </em>\n   ). It also contends that there is no factual matter in the complaint to show that Viet Tan was negligent or intended the defamatory inferences.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407910\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/526/462/#p468\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The court finds that the complaint plausibly states a claim of defamation based on the May 2018 press release. To reiterate, a defamation claim in Texas requires that the defendant \"(1) published a statement; (2) that was defamatory concerning the plaintiff; (3) while acting either with actual malice, if the plaintiff was a public official or public figure, or negligence, if the plaintiff was a private individual, regarding the truth of the statement.\"\n   <em>\n    McLemore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11675407\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/978/568/#p571\">\n    978 S.W.2d at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The amended complaint specifically discusses the press release, alleging that (1) the press release was published on Viet Tan's website and Facebook page with 1.3 million followers; and (2) it \"referred to Tu as the accused in a criminal investigation-even though this is a civil case and Tu maintained he had not done anything improper.\" Dkt. 63 \u00b6 44. Later in the complaint, Tu Nguyen alleges that the defendants \"acted with malice or were at least negligent when they made these statements\" and \"acted with reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the statements made.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. The amended complaint clearly meets all of the elements for stating a defamation claim, and the claim is plausible. Therefore, with regard to the May 2018 press release only, Viet Tan's motion to dismiss Tu Nguyen's defamation claim is DENIED. With regard to the other allegedly defamatory statements made by Viet Tan, it is, like the other motions to dismiss, DENIED AS MOOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Request for Bond\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   RFA, Libby Liu, and Khanh Van Nguyen (the \"RFA Defendants\") filed a motion requesting that the court require Tu Nguyen to post a bond in the amount of $50,000 to confirm his ability to pay an award of attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses under the TCPA. Dkt. 30. In the alternative, they seek sanctions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(c) and the TCPA so that Tu Nguyen will be deterred from filing additional meritless lawsuits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The motion seeks a bond \"until the RFA Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is resolved.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At the hearing, counsel for the RFA Defendants indicated that they would like the court to require Tu Nguyen to post a bond pending any subsequent appeal to ensure that he can pay any attorneys' fee award while prolonging the finality of the case. Counsel also argued in the motion and at the hearing that even though Tu Nguyen voluntarily dismissed his claims against Libby Liu and Khanh Van Nguyen, this dismissal cannot be used to evade their right to recover their fees under the TCPA, and the court should still award fees for these defendants and require a bond on their behalf notwithstanding the voluntary dismissal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   First, the request in the motion to post a bond pending the decision on the motion to dismiss is now moot. However,\n   the request for a bond pending appeal is not. The court, however, is reticent to require a bond pending appeal absent specific authority indicating this is appropriate. And the court does not believe there is any conduct here warranting the imposition of sanctions, as it appears that Tu Nguyen subjectively perceived the statements as defamatory and extreme and outrageous even though he did not meet the clear and specific burden. The court will address whether Libby Liu and Khanh Van Nguyen may maintain their request for attorneys fees in the section discussing attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   The motion for a bond is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Request for Attorneys' Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   All of the defendants request attorneys' fee or, in the alternative, sanctions, under the mandatory attorneys' fees provision of the TCPA. Dkts. 18, 26, 47, 51, 52. Under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 27.009, if the court dismisses a case under the TCPA, it \"shall award to the moving party: (1) court costs, reasonable attorney's fees, and other expenses incurred in defending against the legal action as justice and equity may require; and (2) sanctions against the party who brought the legal action as the court determines sufficient to deter the party who brought the legal action from bringing similar actions described in this chapter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027.009\">\n    Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Remedies Code Ann. \u00a7 27.009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Tu Nguyen argues that the amount of fees is in the court's discretion, and he requests nominal fees and sanctions. Dkt. 82. The statute requires \"reasonable attorney's fees,\" and the court does not interpret that as indicating that the court has the discretion to award nominal fees as opposed to awarding the reasonable amount of fees incurred by the defendants in defending this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   The voluntarily dismissed defendants Libby Liu and Khanh Van Nguyen originally requested attorneys' fees in their motion to dismiss filed on March 13, 2018. Dkt. 18. Tu Nguyen voluntarily dismissed his claims against these defendants on March 28, 2018. Dkt. 29. The court finds that the request for mandatory attorneys' fees under the TCPA is analogous to a counterclaim and that it does not go away simply because Tu Nguyen decided to drop his claims against these plaintiffs after they had already incurred attorneys' fees for drafting a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   All of the defendants' requests for reasonable attorneys' fees, including the request made by the dismissed defendants, are GRANTED. The amount will be determined after the parties have submitted sufficient briefing. The court finds that the reasonable fees incurred by the multiple defendants in this case will be a sufficient deterrent and that there is no need to impose sanctions. Accordingly, the requests for sanctions are DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
