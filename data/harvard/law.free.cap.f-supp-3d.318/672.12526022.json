For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background Regarding Legal Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 14, 2016, plaintiffs Local 1180, Communications Workers of America AFL-CIO (\"Local 1180\"), Lourdes Acevedo (\"Acevedo\"), Nathia Beltran (\"Beltran\"), Adrienne Reed (\"Reed\"), Jo Ann Richards (\"Richards\") and Roseann Schembri (\"Schembri\"), commenced an action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against the City and DCAS by\n   filing a Summons with Notice. (Summons with Notice, ECF No. 1-1, at 1.) According to the Notice, the claims asserted by Plaintiffs were for \"intentional and unintentional discrimination\" based on sex, gender and race, in violation of various provisions of federal law, New York state law and New York City law, including the federal Equal Pay Act and the New York State Equal Pay Law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) The Notice annexes and incorporates by reference a Charge of Discrimination that was filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") on December 5, 2013 against the City and DCAS by Local 1180 and Jane Doe Administrative Managers # 1-1000 and Jane Doe Former Administrative Managers # 1-1000, as well as a Supplemental Charge of Discrimination that was filed on November 19, 2014. (Summons with Notice, Exs. A &amp; C.) The EEOC Charge and Supplemental Charge allege violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), in addition to violations of the Equal Pay Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It is alleged that the City and DCAS \"engaged in a pattern or practice of wage suppression\" in the job title Administrative Manager Non-Managerial (hereinafter, \"Administrative Manager NM\") that \"adversely impacted women and persons of color.\" (Summons with Notice, Ex. A, \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 7, 2017, the Summons with Notice was served upon Defendants. On April 21, 2017, Defendants filed a Demand for Complaint in the New York Supreme Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Local 1180, et al. v. City of New York, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Index No. 160513/2016, N.Y. Sup. Ct., N.Y. County, NYSCEF Doc. No. 8.) On April 26, 2017, Defendants removed the action to this Court on the basis that it asserted claims arising under federal law. (Notice of Removal, ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 1-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 11, 2017, a Complaint was filed in this action in this Court. (Compl., ECF No. 5.) Certain of the plaintiffs named in the Complaint were the same as those named in the Summons with Notice (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Local 1180, Acevedo, Beltran and Reed); two of the plaintiffs that had been named in the Summons with Notice were dropped (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Richards and Schembri); and two plaintiffs were added (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Andrews and Rose Reeves). (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Summons with Notice at 1\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Complaint asserts claims under the federal Equal Pay Act and the New York Equal Pay Law. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 117-28.) The Complaint-like the EEOC Charges-alleges that the City and DCAS engaged in discriminatory pay practices with respect to the job title Administrative Manager NM. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 21, 2017, a First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") was filed on behalf of the same plaintiffs as named in the Complaint. The FAC adds a claim under Title VII. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 119-27.) Of relevance to the motion before the Court, the First Amended Complaint alleges that Andrews works at NYCHA (FAC \u00b6 8), which is not named as a defendant in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 21, 2018, Defendants filed their motion for judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(c) and 12(h)(2)(B), to dismiss the claims asserted by Andrews on the grounds that, as Andrews's employer, \"NYCHA's involvement is of such a nature that without joinder, complete relief cannot be accorded to her,\" and \"pragmatic considerations\" warrant dismissal. (Mot., ECF No. 54, at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 9, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their\n   memorandum of law in opposition to the motion, arguing (among other things) that Defendants have not met the standard to show that NYCHA is a necessary party. (Opp. Mem., ECF No. 56, at 3-4.) On July 18, 2018, Defendants filed their reply memorandum (ECF No. 58), and the parties submitted supplemental briefing at the request of the Court on July 27, 2018. (ECF Nos. 60-61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To put the legal issues in proper context, the Court discusses in the section below NYCHA and NYCHA's relationship with the City and DCAS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Background Regarding NYCHA And Its Relationship With City And DCAS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   NYCHA \"is a public corporation created pursuant to the Public Housing law of the State of New York for the purpose of implementing the State Constitution by providing 'low-rent housing for persons of low income as defined by law ...'

Apr. 3, 2002). However, there is a closeness of relationship between the City and DCAS, on the one hand, and NYCHA, on the other hand. For example, the City's Mayor appoints the seven members of NYCHA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Pub.%20Hous.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20402\">\n    N.Y.

Thus, the paystub for plaintiff Andrews is from the City. (Pl. 7/27/18 Ltr., Ex. A, ECF No. 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"CBA\") that is relevant to this case, which includes a February 9, 2015 side letter relating to the Administrative Manager NM job title, was entered into by the City Office of Labor Relations (\"OLR\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   with Local 1180, and NYCHA is not a signatory to the CBA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. 7/27/2018 Ltr., App. A.) However, according to the City at oral argument, NYCHA elected to have the OLR bargain on NYCHA's behalf, such that the CBA applies to NYCHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The New York City Employees' Retirement System (\"NYCERS\") is a municipal public retirement system. Among the members of NYCERS are employees of NYCHA.
