In addition, the declarations of the proposed class members state that, they were employed by Defendants as \"non-exempt welder[s],\" wore \"welding jacket[s],\" and put away \"welding wire,\" allowing the Court to make the reasonable inference that Plaintiff and the proposed class are similarly situated. ECF Nos. 11-3; 21-3 at PageID#: 173. Based on a fair reading of these declarations, therefore, coupled with Plaintiff's allegations in the Complaint, the Court finds that Plaintiff has made the modest factual showing to warrant conditional certification of the proposed class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff's motion for conditional class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

ECF No. 11 at PageID#: 104; 11-4.

Because Defendants' statute of limitations argument requires an evaluation of the merits of Plaintiff's claims, it is inappropriate for resolution at this early stage of litigation. Therefore, the Court rejects statute of limitations argument, at this time, without prejudice to it being resurrected at a later stage, if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
