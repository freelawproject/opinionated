BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case arises out of the promulgation of a rule (\"the Suspension Rule\") that suspends the 2015 Clean Water Rule (\"the WOTUS rule\") for two years. The Clean Water Act (\"the Act\") prohibits discharge of pollutants from a point source into \"navigable waters\" without a permit.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201311\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 1342, 1344, 1362(12). The Act defines \"navigable waters\" as \"waters of the United States, including the territorial seas\" but does not define what constitutes \"waters of the United States.\" In 1980, the Environmental Protection Agency (\"the EPA\"), and in 1982, the Army Corps of Engineers (\"the Army Corps\") (together, \"the agencies\"), issued a regulation that defined the term \"waters of the United States,\" (hereinafter, \"the 1980s regulation\"). Under the 1980s regulation, the term \"waters of the United States\" included interstate waters, such as interstate wetlands, \"intrastate lakes, rivers, streams (including intermittent streams), mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, playa lakes, or natural ponds,\" and wetlands adjacent to these waters. The 1980s regulation specifically excluded \"waters that are themselves wetlands\" as a \"waters of the United States.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 28, 2015, the EPA and the Army Corps enacted the WOTUS rule to clarify what types of waters constitute a \"waters of the United States\" and are thus covered by the Act. The WOTUS rule replaced the 1980s regulation and includes seasonal streams, wetlands, and tributaries as a \"water of the United States.\" Soon after its enactment, the WOTUS rule became embroiled in litigation, with cases being brought in district courts across the country, including the Southern District of Texas (\"the Texas litigation\"). The government petitioned the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation to consolidate these district court actions, which the Panel denied in October 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   All of the challenges to the district court decisions regarding the WOTUS rule were consolidated in the Sixth Circuit. In February 2016, the Sixth Circuit ruled that it had original jurisdiction over challenges to the WOTUS rule and issued a nationwide stay of the rule. At the time that the Sixth Circuit issued its nationwide stay of the WOTUS rule, the District of North Dakota had issued a preliminary injunction against the WOTUS rule effective in thirteen states. As a result of this ruling by the Sixth Circuit, the pending district court cases were either stayed or administratively closed. On January 22, 2018, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the circuit\n   courts did not have original jurisdiction to review the WOTUS rule, and that challenges must continue to be filed in the district courts. The Sixth Circuit then vacated the nationwide stay of the WOTUS rule. The injunction against the WOTUS rule issued by the District of North Dakota stayed in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 28, 2017, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13778 entitled \"Restoring the Rule of Law, Federalism, and Economic Growth by Reviewing the 'Waters of the United States' Rule,\" which directed Pruitt, the Administrator of the EPA, and Fischer, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, to \"review the... [WOTUS rule]... for consistency with... [administration] policy... and publish for notice and comment a proposed rule rescinding or revising the rule, as appropriate and consistent with [the] law.\" On February 6, 2018, the Suspension Rule was published in the Federal Register. The effect of the Suspension Rule to delay the WOTUS rule until 2020, and in the interim period the controlling interpretation of \"waters of the United States\" was that prescribed by the 1980s regulation which had been in place prior to the WOTUS rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On the same day that the Suspension Rule went into effect, environmental plaintiffs filed suit against the manner in which the Suspension Rule was enacted. Environmental plaintiffs allege the following claims: (1) in promulgating the Suspension Rule, the EPA and Army Corps violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") by taking action with inadequate public notice and comment as prescribed by the APA; (2) the government's failure to consider the substantive implications of suspending the WOTUS rule in enacting the Suspension Rule was arbitrary and capricious under the APA, which directs federal agencies to \"examine the relevant data and articulate... satisfactory explanation[s] for... [their] action[s]\"; and (3) the government's failure after enacting the Suspension Rule to restore the 1980s regulation to the Federal Register violates the APA, which requires federal agencies to publish the language of any substantive regulation that they intend to have legal effect. Environmental plaintiffs ask the court to declare that the EPA and the Army Corps acted arbitrarily and unlawfully in promulgating the Suspension Rule, and to vacate the Suspension Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This motion has been fully briefed and is now ripe for the court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

The court addresses the first two grounds as one and agrees with environmental plaintiffs that the agencies' refusal to consider or receive public comments on the substance of the WOTUS Rule or the 1980s regulation did not provide a \"meaningful opportunity for comment\" as set forth in\n   <em>\n    N.

Refusal to Solicit and Consider Public Comment on Merits of WOTUS Rule or 1980s regulation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Environmental plaintiffs contend that in promulgating the Suspension Rule, the government violated the APA by refusing to solicit or consider any substantive comments on the change of regulatory definition to \"waters of the United States\" from the WOTUS Rule to the 1980s regulation.

Carolina Growers' Ass'n, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit made clear that an agency's suspension of a set of regulations and reinstatement of another set of regulations qualifies as \"rule making\" under the APA, triggering notice and comment requirements. Having established that the suspension of a rule requires the same substantive requirements of notice and comment rule making as the promulgation of that rule, the court now turns to whether the notice and comment rule making that occurred here was sufficient under \u00a7 553 and whether it allowed for \"meaningful\" comment. The court finds that it was not and did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    N. Carolina Growers' Ass'n\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit analyzed an almost factually indistinguishable rule making attempt. The Secretary of Labor proposed in March 2009 to suspend the current 2008 regulations governing the admission of foreign workers for temporary employment in the agriculture sector and temporarily reinstate a 1987 regulation generally seen as more favorable to U.S. agricultural workers.\n   <em>\n    N.

In doing so, the Secretary allowed for a ten day notice and comment period and specified that the Department of Labor would only consider comments on the suspension itself as opposed to any comments on the substantive merits of either the 2008 regulations or the 1987 regulations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646752\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/755/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646752\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/755/\">\n    at 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Fourth Circuit noted that the 1987 rule \"ceased to have any effect\" upon publication of the 2008 rule, so its \"reinstatement would have put in place a set of regulations that were new and different 'formulations' from the 2008 regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646752\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/755/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646752\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/755/\">\n    at 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fourth Circuit held that the Department of Labor's refusal to consider the substance of either the 2008 regulation or the 1987 regulation violated the APA as the merits of those rules were \"integral to the proposed agency action\" of suspending one set of rules and reinstating an earlier set of rules.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646752\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/755/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646752\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/755/\">\n    at 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On November 16, 2017, the agencies published a proposed rule to \"review and revise\" the definition of \"waters of the United States.\" ECF No. 1, Ex. 1 Proposed Suspension Rule. The proposed rule explains that the Suspension Rule amends the effective date of the WOTUS rule to two years from the date of final action of the Suspension Rule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. In\n   relevant part, the proposed rule states that the agencies \"solicit comment as to whether it is desirable and appropriate to amend the effective date of the [WOTUS rule],\" and that the agencies are \"proposing to establish an effective date of two years after a final rule and seek comment on whether the time period should be shorter or longer, and whether delaying the effective date contributes to regulatory certainty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. It goes on to state that the Suspension Rule \"does not undertake any substantive reconsideration of the [1980s regulation]\" and so the agencies are not \"soliciting on the specific content of [the 1980s regulation]\" or the \"scope of the definition of \"waters of the United States\" that the agencies should ultimately adopt.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13. The proposed rule goes on to acknowledge that the request for comment is on \"such a narrow topic,\" and that a \"short comment period is reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. In a \"memorandum for the record,\" the agencies explain the rule making process for the Suspension Rule. In that memorandum, the agencies explain that the Suspension Rule is considered \"step 1\" of the process to rescind the WOTUS rule and to recodify the 1980s regulation. ECF No. 60, Ex. 2, EPA Memorandum for the Record on Suspension Rule Rule making Process.

Here, the Suspension Rule explicitly restricted public comments to \"whether it [was] desirable and appropriate to add an applicability date\" to the WOTUS rule and whether the two-year delay in implementing what would be an ultimately revised definition of the \"waters of the United States\" should be \"shorter or longer.\" The text of the proposed rule and the EPA Memorandum for the Record on Suspension Rule Rulemaking Process make clear that the agencies did not solicit any comments on the merits of the WOTUS rule or the merits of the 1980s regulation before issuing the Suspension Rule. The agencies refused to engage in a substantive reevaluation of the definition of the \"waters of the United States\" even though the legal effect of the Suspension Rule is that the definition of \"waters of the United States\" ceases to be the definition under the WOTUS rule and reverts to the definition under the 1980s regulation. The definition of \"waters of the United States\" is drastically different under these two regulations.

The government argues that the Suspension Rule is distinguishable from these cases because in those cases the agency undertook a \"delay, suspen [sion], or otherwise [change]\" in regulations during reconsideration without engaging in notice and comment rule making, whereas here the agencies conducted notice and comment rule making. ECF No. 62 at 23. But it is the agencies' decision to promulgate the Suspension Rule without allowing the public to comment on the substance of either the WOTUS Rule or the 1980s regulation that renders the notice-and-comment rule making infirm under the APA. An illusory opportunity to comment is no opportunity at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In determining whether the opportunity for notice and comment was \"meaningful,\" the court also finds persuasive the differences in rule making between the WOTUS rule and Suspension Rule.

There, the Fourth Circuit considered the fact that the 11,000 comments that the agency received during the 2008 rule making compared to the 800 received during the abbreviated ten-day period of rule making for the 2009 rule in finding that the Department of Labor did\n   not provide a \"meaningful opportunity\" to comment. Here, the WOTUS rule received over one million public comments during a notice-and-comment period that was over 200 days, and the rule making process itself involved over four years of reviewing thousands of peer-reviewed scientific studies. WOTUS Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2037\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 054 (June 29, 2015). This stands in sharp contrast to the Suspension Rule, which received over 680,000 public comments in the few weeks that public comment was open and was promulgated in mere months in a process that involved instructing the public to withhold substantive comments and did not consider any scientific studies. ECF No. 60, Ex. 1, EPA Rule making Memo. While not determinative, the length of the rule making process is also a factor in the court's analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The government contends that the Suspension Rule is just that-a suspension of the WOTUS rule. It is not, according to the government, a repeal or rescission of the WOTUS rule. The government's stated rationale for the Suspension Rule is also what the government attempts to use to distinguish this case from the Department of Labor regulation that was found to violate the APA in\n   <em>\n    N.C. Growers' Association\n   </em>\n   -that the WOTUS rule has been ensnared in litigation and its suspension would reduce \"uncertainly and confusion\" in the regulated community from that litigation. ECF No. 19, Ex. 1 Suspension Rule. It is not uncommon for administrative rules to face judicial challenges by regulated entities. The court cases challenging an administrative rule does not mean that agencies may disregard the procedural requirements of the APA. The government has pointed to no language in\n   <em>\n    N.C.

No such \"reasoned analysis\" was provided in the promulgation of the Suspension Rule. By refusing to allow public comment and consider the merits of the WOTUS rule and the 1980s regulation, the agencies did not allow a \"meaningful opportunity\" to comment. As such, the court finds that the agencies were arbitrary and capricious in promulgating the Suspension Rule. It vacates the Suspension Rule for this reason. To allow the type of administrative evasiveness that the agencies demonstrated in implementing the Suspension Rule would allow government to become \"a matter of the whim and caprice of the bureaucracy.\"\n   <em>\n    N.C.

Monaghan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"602264\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/193/#p199\">\n     484 U.S. 193\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 199,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"602264\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/193/#p199\">\n     108 S.Ct. 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"602264\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/193/#p199\">\n     98 L.Ed.2d 529\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1988) (\"Article III of the Constitution limits federal courts to the adjudication of actual, ongoing controversies between litigants.\"). The court has been tasked with determining the answer to a discrete question-whether the agencies violated the APA in promulgating the Suspension Rule.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    To this litany of cases, the court adds two more from the last several months-\n    <em>\n     Nat. Res. Def. Council v. Nat'l Highway Traffic Safety Admin.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517546\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/894/95/#p113\">\n     894 F.3d 95\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 113 (2d Cir. 2018) and\n    <em>\n     Children's Hosp. of the King's Daughters, Inc. v. Azar\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517752\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/615/\">\n     896 F.3d 615\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (4th Cir. 2018). In\n    <em>\n     Nat. Res. Def. Council\n    </em>\n    , petitioners claimed that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\") violated the APA when it indefinitely delayed the effective date of a rule that would have increased penalties for violations of certain vehicle environmental standards.\n    <em>\n     NRDC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517546\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/894/95/#p113\">\n     894 F.3d at 100\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Second Circuit held that the NHTSA violated the APA by \"announcing the Suspension Rule without having first undertaken notice and comment rulemaking.\" In\n    <em>\n     Children's Hosp. of the King's Daughters, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , the Fourth Circuit held that the Department of Health &amp; Human Services (\"HHS\") violated the APA in changing the methodology by which HHS calculated financial assistance available to hospitals that served \"a disproportionate number\" of low-income patients without complying with the notice and comment rulemaking requirements of the APA.\n    <em>\n     Children's Hosp. of the King's Daughters, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517752\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/615/\">\n     896 F.3d at 616-17\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (4th Cir. 2018). As these cases make clear, this court is but the latest in a series to recently find that an agency's delay of a properly promulgated final rule circumvented the APA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Now, environmental plaintiffs made an additional argument that has less credence. Specifically, that the Suspension Rule is inconsistent with the purpose of the Act and so runs contrary to the requirement that an agency \"show that... [a] new policy is permissible under the statute\" under which the rule is promulgated. ECF No. 60 at 21, quoting\n    <em>\n     F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653713\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/502/#p515\">\n     556 U.S. 502\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 515,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653713\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/502/#p515\">\n     129 S.Ct. 1800\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653713\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/502/#p515\">\n     173 L.Ed.2d 738\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2009). The court is not convinced-the Suspension Rule restores the regulatory definition of \"waters of the United States\" to the 1980s regulation. From the 1980s until 2015, when the WOTUS rule was enacted, it was that definition of \"waters of the United States\" that the EPA operated under. Environmental plaintiffs have not alleged that the 1980s regulation was ever successfully attacked in its nearly 30-year history as impermissible under the Act or somehow inconsistent with the Act's objective of \"restor[ing] and maintain[ing] the... integrity of the Nation's waters.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n     33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Certainly, nationwide injunctions have the potential for abuse. As the Seventh Circuit recently observed in\n    <em>\n     City of Chicago v. Sessions\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/#p288\">\n     888 F.3d 272\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 288 (7th Cir. 2018) :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n    [U]nder the Obama administration, such injunctions stymied many of the President's policies, with five nationwide injunctions issued by Texas district courts in just over a year[.] At that time, then-Senator and now-Attorney General Sessions characterized the upholding of one such nationwide preliminary injunction as \"a victory for the American people and for the rule of law.\" Press Release, Sen. Jeff Sessions III, June 23, 2016. Now, many who advocated for broad injunctions in those Obamaera cases are opposing them.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    This court agrees that nationwide injunctions should be utilized \"only in rare circumstances.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/#p288\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    This is one such set of rare circumstances.
