TRO, and after holding a hearing, the Court granted the motions as to one type of relief, but converted the motions into a preliminary-injunction motion with an expedited briefing schedule as to the other types of relief sought by W.S.R. and C.D.A. W.S.R. R. 21, C.D.A. R. 16, 6/29/18 Order. For the reasons discussed below, Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction is granted in part and denied in part.

The government also must not remove the fathers from the country without their sons. But the other requests for relief, including ordering the release of their fathers from immigration detention, are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

[redacted] and W.S.R. then entered the United States outside of a port of entry and were stopped by Customs and Border Patrol (CPB) officers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Two days later, on the night of May 25, a guard told [redacted] he was being transferred to a jail and that W.S.R. would be separated from him for two or three days, or at most five.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.

C.D.A. had never been separated from both his mother and father, and cried when [redacted] said that they would be apart for three days, five days at the most.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.

To prevail on a motion for a preliminary injunction, the moving party must show (1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a lack of an adequate remedy at law; and (3) an irreparable harm will result if the injunction is not granted.\n   <em>\n    Lambert v. Buss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3629050\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/498/446/#p451\">\n    498 F.3d 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 451 (7th Cir. 2007). If the moving party meets these requirements, then the court balances the nature and degree of the potential harm to each party and the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Girl Scouts of Manitou Council, Inc. v. Girl Scouts of U.S.A., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734916\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/549/1079/#p1086\">\n    549 F.3d 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1086 (7th Cir. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Reunification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The first claim at issue is Plaintiffs' request to be immediately reunited with their fathers. This is a narrower claim than the request that the reunification be effectuated by simultaneously releasing their fathers. As noted earlier, the class-action order in\n   <em>\n    Ms. L. II\n   </em>\n   already requires that the government reunite Plaintiffs with their fathers by July 26, which is the thirty-day deadline for children age five and over. Practically speaking, the government has stated that it intends to comply with the class-action order, 6/29/18 Order; Gov't Resp. Br. at 2, and does not directly oppose Plaintiffs' request for reunification-it only contests the timeline (and the broader request for simultaneous release of the fathers). Gov't Resp. Br. at 14, 18-19. The government asserts that the entry of additional reunification orders will impede its efforts to comply with\n   <em>\n    Ms. L. II\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Although the government's objection to reunification is limited to timing, a start-to-finish analysis of the reunification claim is necessary for two reasons. First, the relative strengths of the parties' positions bear on the consideration of the preliminary-injunction factors, because ultimately the \"court must somehow balance the nature and degree of the plaintiff's injury, the likelihood of prevailing at trial, the possible injury to the defendant if the injunction is granted, and the wild card that is the 'public interest.' \"\n   <em>\n    Girl Scouts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734916\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/549/1079/#p1086\">\n    549 F.3d at 1086\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lawson Prods., Inc. v.

Second, in the\n   <em>\n    Ms. L.\n   </em>\n   case, the government recently asked for more time to confirm parentage and parental fitness with the under-five July 10 deadline approaching.\n   <em>\n    Ms. L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524460\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/302/1149/\">\n    302 F.Supp.3d 1149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.

The fathers' criminal detentions necessitated the separation of W.S.R. and C.D.A. But the fathers are now back in immigration custody, so the specific interest is a child's right to reunify with his parent in immigration custody, after the parent's criminal detention ends and absent parental unfitness or danger to the child. That specifically and concretely described right is supported by the long line of cases, cited above, that established and continually reaffirm the fundamental right of a child to remain in the custody of a fit parent. Although Congress has broad authority to regulate immigration, even in that context the Supreme Court approved of a regulation that presumptively placed detained minors with their parents.\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6228898\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/292/#p302\">\n    507 U.S. at 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6228898\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/292/#p302\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The list [of custodians] begins with parents, whom our society and this Court's jurisprudence have always presumed to be the preferred and primary custodians of their minor children.\").

The record evidence demonstrates that the boys have suffered irreparable harm from the separation, and the ongoing separation is inflicting ongoing irreparable harm. First, remember that, at the outset of the separation, not surprisingly both boys cried when told that they would be separated from their fathers. [redacted] Decl. \u00b6 23; [redacted] Decl. \u00b6 22. Based on what the government told the fathers, the boys were told-wrongly-that they would be separated for no more than five days.

But there is more than common sense. In the record is this plea of hopelessness from W.S.R., when he finally spoke to his father on the phone: \"Dad, I'm never going to see you again.\" [redacted] Decl. \u00b6 30.

To balance the equities, \"the court must compare the potential irreparable harms faced by both parties to the suit-the irreparable harm risked by the moving party in the absence of a preliminary injunction against the irreparable harm risked by the nonmoving party if the preliminary injunction is granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Girl Scouts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734916\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/549/1079/#p1086\">\n    549 F.3d at 1100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As just recounted above, the irreparable harm to W.S.R. and C.D.A. is obvious and intense. On the other side of the reunification ledger is nothing: the government has articulated no harm, let alone irreparable harm, that would result from reuniting the boys with their fathers. Indeed, the government has repeatedly said that it intends to comply with the\n   <em>\n    Ms. L. II\n   </em>\n   class-action order requiring that Plaintiffs be reunited with their fathers, either together in an ICE family residential center or by being released together. Gov't Resp. Br. at 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The key question, then, is timing: by when must the government accomplish the reunification? The government contends that reunifying Plaintiffs with their fathers on a faster track than the\n   <em>\n    Ms. L.

Pl.'s Reply Br. at 18-19. That is true: the government embarked on a zero-tolerance policy, bringing misdemeanor charges and separating thousands of children from their parents, without a plan for reunification after the short time-served sentences.\n   <em>\n    Ms. L.

On these facts, there is no doubt that the scales of justice weigh entirely in Plaintiffs' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   What makes this a close call, however, is that the Court also must consider the public interest, \"which includes the ramifications of granting or denying the preliminary injunction on nonparties to the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Girl Scouts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734916\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/549/1079/#p1086\">\n    549 F.3d at 1100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But there are around 3,000 other children who have been separated from their parents, and picking out W.S.R. and C.D.A. to leapfrog over others poses the risk that diverting resources in order to effectuate the accelerated reunification for W.S.R. and C.D.A. would delay the reunification of other children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Ultimately, however, the balance of equities favors accelerated reunification for W.S.R. and C.D.A. Yes, all of the children of the\n   <em>\n    Ms. L.

It might be that many other sons and daughters of\n   <em>\n    Ms. L. II\n   </em>\n   class members would be able to compile the same record evidence if they had the lawyers and resources to do so. But the fact of the matter is that W.S.R. and C.D.A. have proven that every day of separation is causing dangerous harm to their mental health. And the entry of this order on July 9, 2018 means that the government should be reunifying most of the 100 or so under-five kids imminently (by July 10) and then moving on to devoting efforts to reunifying the remainder of the children. The government also has not raised any questions about the parental relationship between W.S.R. and [redacted] or C.D.A. and [redacted], nor about either father's fitness to parent. The outcome of the balancing of equities, and consideration of the public interest, is this: absent any government filing alleging parental unfitness or danger posed by the fathers, the government must reunite C.D.A. with his father, [redacted], and must reunite W.S.R. with his father, [redacted], both within\n   <strong>\n    72 hours\n   </strong>\n   of the posting of this order on the docket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

But it is important to remember that subject matter jurisdiction is different from the merits of the claim. Jurisdiction is federal-court authority to\n   <em>\n    decide\n   </em>\n   the merits of a legal claim. When properly conceived, subject matter jurisdiction poses no obstacle to considering Plaintiffs' claim under the\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   Agreement. That is because the original\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   case itself-filed in the Central District of California-was premised on federal-question jurisdiction. The plaintiffs challenged, among other things, the conditions in which minor aliens were detained by the now-replaced Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flores v.

Another way to think about this is that no one questions the adjudicative authority-that is, the subject matter jurisdiction-of the District Court overseeing\n   the consent decree to decide claims under it. Subject matter jurisdiction does not vary from federal District Court to District Court, so it is as secure here as it is in the Central District of California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The real question is whether the\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   Agreement permits\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   District Court-or, for that matter, any other District Court aside from the District Court overseeing the consent decree-to decide individual claims under the Agreement. Typically, a consent decree is enforced by the District Court before which the decree was entered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Local No. 93, Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters, AFL-CIO v.

But the\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   Agreement is atypical: the parties specifically provided that \"a minor who disagrees with the INS's determination to place that minor in a particular type of facility ... may seek judicial review in any United States District Court with jurisdiction and venue over the matter to challenge that placement determination ....\"\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   Agreement \u00b6 24(B). In effect, Paragraph 24(B) acts as a choice-of-forum clause, allowing District Courts around the Nation to consider individual challenges to the government's placement determination (so long as venue is proper under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Parental Release\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Before addressing Plaintiffs' claim for simultaneous release of their fathers, the government makes the threshold argument that Paragraph 24(B) of the\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   Agreement does not provide for judicial review in this forum of even a\n   <em>\n    child\n   </em>\n   's claim for release, let alone a parent's. The government offers a reasonable argument, though it is ultimately flawed. Specifically, the government points out that Paragraph 24(B) allows for judicial review when a minor \"disagrees with the INS's determination to place that minor in a\n   <em>\n    particular type of facility\n   </em>\n   ....\"\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   Agreement \u00b6 24(B) (emphasis added). To the government's way of thinking, the determination that is subject to review is only as to the\n   <em>\n    type\n   </em>\n   of facility, not as to whether release to a parent is required. Gov't Resp. Br. at 17-18. Under this interpretation, for example, a child can challenge placement in a State or county juvenile detention facility and instead seek to be transferred to a licensed program-but cannot challenge the refusal to release the minor from INS (now ORR) custody in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   But this reading is too narrow. First, context is crucial in interpreting any contract. One of the exhibits to the\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   Agreement is a detailed set of instructions to immigration officers.\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   Agreement, Exh. 2, Instructions to Service Officers. Paragraph 24(B) is implemented by a specific instruction that treats challenges to a refusal to release in the same way as challenges to a refusal to be placed in a license program:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    (j) Notice of right to bond redetermination and judicial review of placement.\n   </strong>\n   A minor in deportation proceedings shall be afforded a bond redetermination hearing before an immigration judge in every case, unless the minor indicates on the Notice of Custody Determination form that he or she refuses such a hearing. A juvenile who is\n   <em>\n    not released or placed in a licensed placement\n   </em>\n   shall be provided (1) a written explanation of the right of\n   judicial review as set out in Exhibit 6 of the\n   <em>\n    Flores v. Reno\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement, and (2) the list of free legal services providers compiled pursuant to INS regulations (unless previously given to the minor[ ) ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Instructions to Service Officers, \u00b6 (j) (emphasis added). The first sentence of Instruction Paragraph (j) addresses Paragraph 24(A)'s grant of a right to a bond redetermination hearing. The next sentence of Instruction Paragraph (j) thus implements the right of judicial review in Paragraph 24(B). The instruction specifically tells immigration officers to provide the judicial review notice for challenges to a refusal to release, and makes no mention that the Central District of California is the sole forum for that challenge. The parties to the\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   Agreement also presumably took practical considerations into account when crafting Paragraph 24(B). As a matter of judicial resources, it would make little sense to require\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   single individual detention challenge to be brought in the Central District of California. Indeed, because minors seeking release could be located in Districts all around the Nation, the most relevant sources of evidence-the minor and, usually, the pertinent government officials-would be located in those other Districts. Of course, judicial review of requests for\n   <em>\n    class\n   </em>\n   -based relief remains exclusively within the Central District of California's purview. But Paragraph 24(B) does authorize other Districts to consider a child's claim for release under the\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On the merits, however, the\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   Agreement does not encompass a right to a\n   <em>\n    parent\n   </em>\n   's release, at least on consideration of the issue at the preliminary-injunction stage.
