(Dkt. 1). By a Decision and Order entered May 4, 2015, this Court dismissed all claims against all defendants. (Dkt. 45). Plaintiff appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and that court affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded the case to this Court for further proceedings. (Dkt. 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Specifically, the Second Circuit agreed that this Court had properly dismissed Plaintiff's malicious prosecution and false arrest claims, but the court vacated the dismissal of Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against the County,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   stating as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Although the initial complaint was insufficient to state a [\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   ] claim, the proposed amended complaint added allegations that may plausibly suggest that the County had a policy or custom, which County officials knew about and approved, of depriving arrestees of their constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Payton v.

Although the district court briefly considered the plausibility of a stand-alone\n   <em>\n    Payton\n   </em>\n   claim as pleaded in Laboy's initial complaint, ... the district court had no opportunity to consider a\n   <em>\n    Payton\n   </em>\n   -based\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim. Accordingly, we remand to the district court to determine, in the first instance, whether such a claim is plausible, would have been timely made, and if so, to permit [Plaintiff] to amend his complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (Dkt. 49 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This Court held a telephone status conference on October 27, 2016, and set a briefing scheduling to address the issue remanded by the appellate court. (Dkt. 51). Plaintiff filed papers in support of his request to amend the complaint on November 28, 2016, and November 30, 2016. (Dkt. 53; Dkt. 54). The County submitted its response in opposition on December 23, 2016 (Dkt. 55), and Plaintiff replied on January 9, 2017 (Dkt. 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In sum, on remand, the Court must consider the narrow question of whether Plaintiff's proposed amended complaint contains a plausible\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against the County based on\n   <em>\n    Payton\n   </em>\n   . The Court concludes that it does. Therefore, Plaintiff's request to amend the complaint (Dkt. 28) is granted, and the County's motion to dismiss (Dkt. 14) is denied insofar as the Court permits Plaintiff's amended complaint to go forward against the County with respect to his\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court assumes familiarity with its May 4, 2015, Decision and Order (Dkt. 45) and will restate only the facts and background relevant to the narrow issue presently before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standards\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Plaintiff also alleges that it is the \"policy and practice of the Sheriff's Office and the named defendants to effectuate arrests for violations that were not committed in their presence and without probable cause.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 85). He contends that \"Deputy Edington ... stated under oath that she believed it was in her discretion to either arrest without a warrant or to issue an appearance ticket\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 87), and that \"such arrests are a common-place occurrence in Ontario County\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 86).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff's proposed amended complaint contains additional allegations that did not appear in his original complaint. He alleges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The county prosecutor confirmed in his oral argument to the court that arrests like [Plaintiff's] are typical in Ontario County by saying:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"There's no requirement and [defense counsel] hasn't identified any requirement, he cannot identify any requirement, that there be a warrant or information filed in court. In fact, that would be contrary to what we know happens on these harassment arrests every day in that they're arrested, they're either given appearance tickets or taken and arraigned and an order of protection before there's a filing. There's no requirement that any of that occur[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88 (first alteration in original) ). The proposed amended complaint further alleges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The county prosecutor further confirmed at sentencing that numerous top officials within the sheriff's department had attended the trial in a show of support for the propriety of Deputy Edington's actions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"[T]he support for Deputy Edington was apparent at every turn with her extended law enforcement family with her throughout this trial. At times Sheriff Povero, Undersheriff Tillman, Lieutenant Falkey, Lieutenant Storer, Sergeant Colburn, Sergeant Cirencione, [Deputies] Dill, Bowerman, Fogarty, Nelson, Fitzgerald, Taylor and so many others were here to support her because they knew she was doing the right thing, and they knew she was doing it the right way[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Timeliness of Plaintiff's\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court turns, first, to the timeliness of any\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim that Plaintiff might be able to assert based on the record in this case. Plaintiff argues that he has timely alleged a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim because he brought the complaint within three years of when it became clear that his unlawful arrest was the consequence of a municipal policy or custom. (Dkt. 53 at 16-17). According to Plaintiff, he became aware of the unconstitutional policy, at the earliest, on February 25, 2011-the date on which he was sentenced in state court and the prosecutor stated that the Sheriff's office supported Deputy Edington's actions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). Plaintiff contends that February 25, 2011, was the first time that he could have been made aware that there was an endorsed policy of engaging in unlawful arrests that violated the Fourth Amendment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The County disagrees, arguing that Plaintiff became aware that he was suffering from an alleged wrong at the time of his arrest and that his\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim is therefore time-barred. (Dkt. 55 at 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As a general matter, the statute of limitations for \u00a7 1983 actions arising in New York is three years.\n   <em>\n    Eagleston v.

However, when a plaintiff brings a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against a municipal defendant for harm caused by a policy or custom, the limitations period does not necessarily accrue at the time of the alleged constitutional violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Pinaud v.

He continues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendant County and Sheriff Provero have created and tolerated and developed long-standing, department-wide customs, law enforcement related policies, procedures, customs, practices and/or failed to properly train and/or supervise its officers in a manner amounting to deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of plaintiff and the public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1155).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff also relies on the prosecutor's statements during the state court proceedings to support a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim. (Dkt. 53 at 12-14). The prosecutor referenced the warrant requirement, stating, \" 'There's no requirement and [defense counsel] hasn't identified any requirement, he cannot identify any requirement, that there be a warrant or information filed in court.' \" (Dkt. 32-3 at \u00b6 88 (quoting the prosecutor) ). He also voiced \" 'support for Deputy Edington ... at every turn.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 89 (quoting the prosecutor) ). Plaintiff argues that the prosecutor was \"[p]resumably ... well-aware of how arrests are usually made,\" and \"it appears that the prosecutor had personal knowledge that all of the top-brass within the Sheriff's Department endorsed Deputy Edington's actions....\" (Dkt. 53 at 13-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The County responds that Plaintiff's allegations regarding the \"policy and practice of the Sheriff's Office\" (Dkt. 32-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 85-87), as well his reliance on the prosecutor's statements (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 88-89),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   are\n   misplaced. (Dkt. 55 at 16-17). According to the County, Plaintiff, in his original complaint, and the prosecutor, during oral argument, were referring to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L%20%C2%A7%20140.10\">\n    N.Y. C.P.L \u00a7 140.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the statute on which Plaintiff based his false arrest claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). As Plaintiff states in his complaint,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.%20%C2%A7%20140.10\">\n    N.Y. C.P.L. \u00a7 140.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a) provides that \"the police are not authorized to arrest a person for a violation-level offense that did not take place in the officer's presence.\" (Dkt. 32-3 at \u00b6 30). The County argues that Plaintiff's defense attorney never raised an issue concerning a\n   <em>\n    Payton\n   </em>\n   theory at trial, and Plaintiff is now attempting to recast his false arrest claims as a\n   <em>\n    Payton\n   </em>\n   -based\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim. (Dkt. 55 at 13-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court agrees that the prosecutor's remarks appeared to be focused primarily on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.%20%C2%A7%20140.10\">\n    N.Y. C.P.L. \u00a7 140.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a), and the Court also agrees that Plaintiff's initial focus was not directed at a\n   <em>\n    Payton\n   </em>\n   -bassd claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless, at this stage of the proceedings, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has alleged enough facts tending to support, at least circumstantially, a plausible inference that the County had a municipal policy or custom favoring warrantless arrests inside an individual's home in violation of\n   <em>\n    Payton\n   </em>\n   . Thus, the allegations in the proposed amended complaint are sufficient to state a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim. Therefore, Plaintiff is granted leave to file his proposed amended complaint to pursue a\n   <em>\n    Payton\n   </em>\n   -based\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim, and the County's motion to dismiss the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiff's request to amend the complaint (Dkt. 28) is granted and the County's motion to dismiss (Dkt. 14) is denied with respect to the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim. Plaintiff is directed to file the proposed amended complaint (Dkt. 32-3) within 21 days of the entry of this Decision and Order. The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate all defendants from this action with the exception of the County of Ontario.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Consistent with the Second Circuit's opinion (Dkt. 49) and Plaintiff's proposed amended complaint (Dkt. 32-3), the County is the only remaining defendant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    On November 30, 2016, Plaintiff submitted a revised version of his proposed amended complaint with \"strikethroughs\" of the claims and allegations that were dismissed by this Court and affirmed by the Second Circuit. (Dkt. 54-1). The Court will cite to the original proposed amended complaint (Dkt. 32-3) throughout this decision. The cited portions are identical in the two versions of the proposed amended complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The Court acknowledges the County's argument that even if the prosecutor's statements during the state court proceedings were in reference to a Fourth Amendment violation, those statements would not be sufficient to state a\n    <em>\n     Payton\n    </em>\n    -based\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    claim against the County, which is a separate entity from the district attorney's office. (Dkt. 55 at 17). Nonetheless, at this stage of the proceedings, the comments may at least be considered in evaluating whether a\n    <em>\n     Payton\n    </em>\n    -bassd\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    claim has been plausibly alleged.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The County argues that Plaintiff asserts for the first time, on remand, that his\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    claim is based on\n    <em>\n     Payton\n    </em>\n    , and previously any such claim was based on a violation of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.%20%C2%A7%20140.10\">\n     N.Y. C.P.L. \u00a7 140.10\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . (Dkt. 55 at 18). While the Plaintiff's position concerning a\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    claim has evolved, the Second Circuit remanded the case for the specific purpose of addressing whether Plaintiff could pursue a\n    <em>\n     Payton\n    </em>\n    -based\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    claim, and thus, this Court cannot consider Plaintiff's\n    <em>\n     Payton\n    </em>\n    claim waived.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
