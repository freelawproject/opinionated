Am. Compl. \u00b6 1, ECF No. 10. The FDIC moved for summary judgment. Upon consideration of the pleadings, relevant law, related legal memoranda in opposition and in support, and the entire record, the Court finds that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the FDIC articulated legitimate, nondiscrimination reasons for its actions, which Ms. Wilkerson has not rebutted as pretextual.

She held this role, a CG-15 level position, as a term employee for four years, between February 2011 and February 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Ms. Wilkerson describes her responsibilities to include \"conduct[ing] research on community development issues of concern to financial institutions, and [ ] develop[ing\n   ] educational/outreach material to help facilitate bank investment in economic and community development projects.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   One of the educational materials on which she worked was a handbook called \"Strategies for Community Banks to Develop Partnerships with Community Development Financial Institutions\" (the \"CDFI Guide\").\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Throughout her tenure at the FDIC, Ms. Wilkerson's first-level supervisor was Section Chief Luke Reynolds, who Ms. Wilkerson characterizes as \"a white male in his late 30s.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. For most of her tenure, Ms. Wilkerson's second-level supervisor was Elizabeth Ortiz, Deputy Director of the FDIC's Division of Depositor and Consumer Protection, but Janet Gordon, Associate Director of the Section, became her second-level supervisor for the last nine months of her term (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , June 2014 to February 2015).

Ms. Wilkerson's Complaint - Discrimination Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Wilkerson alleges that the FDIC discriminated against her on the basis of her race, sex, and age, particularly as compared to a \"younger white male colleague,\" James Yagley, who held the same position as Ms. Wilkerson and was another of Mr. Reynolds' direct reports. Am. Compl. \u00b6 9. Her discrimination claims fall into three categories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   First, Ms. Wilkerson claims that in the time leading up to November 2014, she received disparate treatment than Mr. Yagley, such as: (i) being told that she was not permitted to travel to meetings and conferences as a term employee; (ii) being denied access to certain shared electronic resources (e.g., computer drive, Community Affairs folder, CARDs system); (iii) not being given a laptop; (iv) not being provided opportunities to present at meetings of the Regional Community Affairs Officers or moderate national webinars; (v) not being able to attend the meetings of the FDIC Chairperson's Advisory Committee of Economic Inclusion; and (vi) being denied attendance at the Community Reinvestment Act training held in March 2012 and the FDIC's Examination School for Non-Examiners held in February 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also alleges that her performance rating of \"III - Accomplished Practitioner\" on her 2013 performance evaluation was lower than she previously received.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Second, Ms. Wilkerson argues that her 2014 performance evaluation, where she received a \"III - Accomplished Practitioner,\" was lower than she deserved vis-\u00e0-vis Mr. Yagley's performance that year, for which he was rated a \"IV.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9; Mot. for Summ.

Ms. Wilkerson conducted two rounds of interviews for the positions, but was not selected for either.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14. She claims that her second-level supervisor, Ms. Gordon, was aware of her discrimination complaint and retaliated against her by not selecting Ms. Wilkerson for either position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b614.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Under this framework, the plaintiff must first establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case; the burden then shifts to the employer to \"articulate a legitimate, non[-]discriminatory and/or non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action;\" whereupon the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to \"demonstrate that the offered non-discriminatory reason was, in fact, pretext for a prohibited reason.\"\n   <em>\n    Mokhtar v.

In this Circuit, at the summary judgment stage, a court need not decide whether the plaintiff actually made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case under\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brady v.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Each of Ms. Wilkerson's claims fail as a matter of law because she has not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the FDIC's articulated, non-discriminatory and nonretaliatory reasons for its actions are pretext for discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Disparate Treatment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Each of Ms. Wilkerson's allegations of disparate treatment has been met by the FDIC with a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the action, which Ms. Wilkerson has not shown to be pretextual. With respect to her claim that she was not permitted to travel to meetings and conferences as a term employee unlike Mr. Yagley, the FDIC asserts that Ms. Wilkerson was not told that she could not travel, but rather that she was ineligible for a\n   Professional Learning Account as a term employee. Mem. of P. &amp; A. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Mot. for Summ. J.\") 17, ECF No. 17-1. The account provides funds to FDIC employees for external training opportunities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3664501,3569967\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/617/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As term employees, neither Ms. Wilkerson nor Mr. Yagley were eligible for these funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Term employees, however, were eligible to travel to meetings and conferences for work-related purposes, which Mr. Yagley did for certain of his assignments, and, in fact, Ms. Wilkerson did too.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 9 (Pl.'s Answers to Def.'s Interrogs.) at 48, ECF No. 20-9 (Ms. Wilkerson stating that she participated in four meetings that involved travel). Though she alleges that Mr. Yagley was afforded more travel opportunities than she was, Ms. Wilkerson has not rebutted the FDIC's explanation that his travel was work-related or-more importantly-demonstrated that she had fewer or was denied travel opportunities because of her race, sex, or age. Her self-serving allegation that race, sex, and/or age motivated the apparently discrepant decisions does not suffice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mokhtar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290765\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/83/49/#p70\">\n    83 F.Supp.3d at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Summary judgment for a defendant is most likely when a plaintiff's claim is supported solely by the plaintiff's own self-serving, conclusory statements\" because these \"do not create genuine issues of material fact.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The record also shows that Ms. Wilkerson was granted access to the electronic resources that she complains that she did not receive as quickly as Mr. Yagley.

Ms. Wilkerson offers no evidence that these resources were denied or delayed to her on account of her race, sex, and/or age, and, in any event, it is not clear that delayed access is sufficient to establish that Ms. Wilkerson suffered an adverse action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huang v.

Mot. for Summ. J. 20. The record does not indicate who requested or approved for Mr. Yagley to receive a laptop, much less that the decision was made on a discriminatory basis between Mr. Yagley and Ms. Wilkerson. In response, Ms. Wilkerson does not offer evidence to show that the FDIC's proffered legitimate reason was pretextual, but asks the Court to infer it merely from her statement that Mr. Yagley was given a laptop from the start of his employment while she was not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. to Mot. for Summ.

J. 12-13. These reasons-which are business decisions unrelated to Ms. Wilkerson's race, sex, or age-have not been shown to be pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Ms. Wilkerson also quarrels with not being permitted to attend the meetings of the FDIC Chairperson's Advisory Committee of Economic Inclusion. Am. Compl. \u00b6 10f. Mr. Reynolds explained that this was due to space constraints, but that an overflow room was later opened to permit FDIC staff to attend. Mot. for Summ. J. 20-21. The record does not indicate whether Ms. Wilkerson later attended the meetings via the overflow room or through a live feed on her computer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21; Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 9 at 49 (Ms. Wilkerson stating that the meeting could be watched via a live stream on the FDIC's website). It is also not clear whether these meetings were always available to watch via a live stream, and thus Ms. Wilkerson's true objection is being unable to attend in person. In any event, none of these outstanding questions present a genuine issue of material fact and Ms. Wilkerson has not adequately demonstrated that her absence from these meetings was motivated by her race, sex, or age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The same is true for her dispute with being denied participation in the FDIC's Community Reinvestment Act (\"CRA\") training and the Examination School for Non-Examiners. Mr. Reynolds testified that none of his staff attended the CRA training because the course was \"specifically for examiners.\" Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 10 (Dep. of Luke Reynolds) 202:7-12. With respect to the Examination School, Mr. Reynolds explained that Ms. Wilkerson's participation was denied because her term was scheduled to end the same month as the training, and it did not make sense for the FDIC to pay for this training under these circumstances. Mot. for Summ. J. 21. Ms. Wilkerson has not offered any evidence to rebut this legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation.

Although this evidence shows that Mr. Reynolds did downward adjust Ms. Wilkerson's scores, notably absent is any indication that Mr. Reynolds adjusted, or was directed by his supervisor to adjust, Ms. Wilkerson's evaluation due to discrimination. Indeed, Mr. Reynolds' initial instinct to rate Ms. Wilkerson at the top of the performance scale undermines any suggestion of invidious discrimination on his part. And Ms. Wilkerson points to no evidence indicating that Mr. Reynolds' supervisors provided input on Ms. Wilkerson's evaluation specifically.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. 10, ECF No. 21. Rather, Mr. Reynolds' supervisors assessed that he incorrectly applied the evaluation standards for a number of his subordinates. This feedback was appropriate and within the scope of their roles to guide the evaluation process, including calibrating the process across all subordinates. The mere fact that Ms. Wilkerson's overall score changed during this process is insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the change was due to discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Third, the Court has already addressed Ms. Wilkerson's claims about her attendance at meetings, conferences, and trainings,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.A.1., and found that none exhibited any discriminatory motive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. to Mot. for Summ.

Ms. Wilkerson claims that Mr. Reynolds' \"first explanation\" for her evaluation was that she needed to know \"more people outside FDIC\" and that his \"second explanation\" that she only made \"relatively modest\" updates to the CDFI Guide during the evaluation year constitutes sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude pretext. Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 19.

Mr. Reynolds stated that Mr. Yagley \"was deeply involved\n   <em>\n    during the rating year\n   </em>\n   in working with several AEIs [Alliance for Economic Inclusion programs] to conduct self assessments and improvement plans,\" which \"involved him spending a considerable amount of time mentoring staff in those regions on how to clarify goals and outcomes, developing realistic timeframes for achieving goals ... and on written communications.\" Mot. for Summ.

These tasks, among others that Mr. Reynolds highlighted to support Mr. Yagley's rating, were \"non-routine for anyone in the Section to do.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. The record supports the agency's legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons to rate Mr. Yagley as a \"IV\" and Ms. Wilkerson has not identified any evidence to rebut this presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    3. 2014 Monetary Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Ms. Wilkerson also disputes not being awarded a Mission Achievement Award for her work on the CDFI Guide during the 2014 evaluation cycle and contends that \"the young, white Mr. Yagley received substantial cash awards for much less important work during his tenure at FDIC.\" Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 12. Mr. Reynolds explained that this award is \"based on the extent of an employee's contribution to the accomplishment of either corporate or division goals and objectives\" and that the Guide was a Section goal, but not a corporate or divisional goal. Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 4 at 4. Employees are recognized for assisting with Section goals through the routine performance evaluation process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Reynolds also noted that \"Divisional leadership has on several occasions reminded me and the other managers in the Division of their expectation that we be familiar with and adhere to the rules [for the awards programs].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Ortiz testified that these awards are \"generally very hard to get\" and that \"[m]any good things get done in the Agency that do not get recognized with a [Mission Achievement Award].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 9\n   at 3.

In fact, Mr. Yagley did not receive a Mission Achievement Award for his work either.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 41. Mr. Reynolds' assessment that Ms. Wilkerson's work on the Guide was not one of the pre-set specific divisional or corporate goals does not raise an inference that he thought so due to her race, sex, or age, and no reasonable juror could find as such. Ms. Wilkerson's attempted comparison to Mr. Yagley also fails, for the record shows that Mr. Yagley received one award for the 2014 performance year, a STAR Award of $250 for assisting at a training conference, just like Ms. Wilkerson.

The EEO Counselor's\n   Report dated March 3, 2015-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , after Ms. Wilkerson's term at the FDIC ended-shows that the Counselor spoke with Mr. Reynolds about the complaint, but there is no indication that Ms. Gordon was aware of the complaint, much less that it played a role in the hiring decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 1, ECF No. 20-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Ms. Wilkerson further contends that Ms. Gordon's reliance on criteria not listed in the vacancy announcement to select among candidates is sufficient to support an inference of pretext. Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 23. She asserts that Ms. Gordon's explanation that she and the panel were \"most interested in learning from each candidate about their collaborations involving bankers and community leaders\" and that banking knowledge was \"particularly emphasized\" was not stated in the vacancy announcement, and this deviation is evidence from which a jury could infer pretext.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4261582\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/19/167/#p199\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the vacancy announcement and Ms. Gordon's explanation are not incongruent. The announcement stated that the position would \"[e]ngage[ ] in pro-active communication with community-based organizations, academic researchers, government officials, bankers and other lenders\" and to \"[r]epresent[ ] the FDIC as speaker or participant as designated, at events designed to educate financial institutions, community representatives and others.\" Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 8, ECF No. 17-2. These written descriptions are consistent with Ms. Gordon's explanation and fail to raise a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to withstand summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
