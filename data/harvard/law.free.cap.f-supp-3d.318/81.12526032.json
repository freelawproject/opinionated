Additionally, a previous action that resulted in a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim \"presents a ruling on the merits with a\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   effect\" for the purposes of the final judgment requirement under\n   <em>\n    Smalls\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Haase v.

As to the first prong, Ms. Middleton's allegations arise from the same \"nucleus of facts\" as the allegations in\n   <em>\n    Evelyn Middleton v. United States of America\n   </em>\n   , No. 6:12-cv-00041,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205426842\">\n    2012 WL 5426842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D.

In ordering the W.D. Va. Dismissal, Judge Moon recounted Ms. Middleton's factual claims regarding her contact with DOL benefits adviser John Miller and a letter that she received from DOL regarding her rights under ERISA. W.D. Va. Dismissal at *1-2. Judge Moon also emphasized that in previous cases, she pled allegations regarding her \"former employment and the withdrawal of monies from her 403(b) retirement savings account.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. These are the same allegations as in Ms. Middleton's current action. SAC 6, \u00b6 15 (describing Ms. Middleton's interactions with John Miller and a letter received from DOL);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1 \u00b6\u00b61-2 (alleging that DOL unlawfully withheld monies from her retirement account).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In the E.D. Va. Dismissal, Judge Davis' Rule 12(b)(6) order noted that Ms. Middleton argued fraud and the use of fictitious names by DOL officials, which is repeated in this action.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   E.D. Va. Dismissal Order at 2 (Sept. 14, 2012), ECF No. 6\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   SAC 6, \u00b6 15;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, \u00b64 (alleging that DOL official Jane Smith falsely identified herself as Virginia Smith). Ms. Middleton's factual assertions clearly arise out of the same nucleus of facts as the W.D. Va. and E.D. Va. Dismissals. And to the extent that Ms. Middleton tweaks her legal basis for relief from previous cases-which does not appear to be the case-her ability to litigate this matter still is foreclosed because she had the opportunity to raise those legal entitlements in past actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NRDC v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333388,1310031\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/838/1224/\">\n    838 F.2d 1224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1235 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (holding that r\n   <em>\n    es judicata\n   </em>\n   \"bars re-litigation not only as to all matters which were determined in the previous litigation, but also as to all matters that might have been determined\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The only event that occurred subsequent to the W.D. Va. and E.D. Va. Dismissals and therefore could not have been previously raised was Ms. Middleton's correspondence with DOL benefits adviser Shofall\n   Jindal. This, however, does not save her action because she has not sufficiently pled any misconduct by Mr. Jindal. As Ms. Middleton describes the events, Mr. Jindal attempted to assist her in finding her alleged lost money by directing her to the Virginia Unclaimed Property program. SAC 9-10, \u00b6 34. These references to Mr. Jindal, therefore, do not form any cognizable cause of action. The only facts alleged in the Second Amended Complaint upon which Ms. Middleton's claim is based are \"related in time, space, origin, or motivation\" to the previously dismissed lawsuits in the Western and Eastern Districts of Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stanton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3708296,1000625\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/127/72/\">\n    127 F.3d at 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The other prongs of the\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   test are easily satisfied. Ms. Middleton brought both the W.D. Va. and E.D. Va. Dismissals against the United States, and since a federal agency is in privity with the United States for purposes of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , the second prong is fulfilled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mervin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"521561,3779097\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/591/821/\">\n    591 F.2d at 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The dismissals for failure to state a claim in the Western and Eastern Districts of Virginia actions are considered final judgments on the merits under the standard articulated in\n   <em>\n    Haase v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , satisfying the third prong.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332453,10549974\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/835/902/\">\n    835 F.2d at 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, under the fourth prong of the\n   <em>\n    Smalls\n   </em>\n   test, the previous court must have had \"competent jurisdiction\" to decide the case. The Western and Eastern Districts of Virginia are unquestionably competent courts with full subject matter jurisdiction to decide a dispute between a federal agency and a citizen alleging violations of ERISA and the FTCA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525905\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/200/#p208\">\n    542 U.S. 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 208,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525905\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/200/#p208\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525905\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/200/#p208\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) (holding that an ERISA claim can be removed to federal court);\n   <em>\n    FDIC v.

Indeed, these courts are the most obvious venues for Ms. Middleton's cause of action given her residence in the Commonwealth of Virginia; one wonders whether her decision to now cross the Potomac River was motivated by her repeated failure to convince her home courts of the merits of her case and their eventual imposition of pre-filing restrictions upon her. Because all prongs of\n   <em>\n    Smalls\n   </em>\n   are satisfied,\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   precludes further litigation of this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Notably, Ms. Middleton offers no response to the DOL's\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   defense in her opposition to the DOL's motion.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mot. in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 26. Her only comment about the DOL's argument perfunctorily stated that she \"is not asking the [Court] to relitigate any cases from the Eastern District of Virginia.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. She does not refer or acknowledge any of the multiple closed cases in the Western District of Virginia, nor submits any substantive argument as to why this case differs from any of the previous cases. Even construing her Second Amended Complaint liberally given her status as a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigant, Ms. Middleton alleges no additional facts or claims that have not been covered by the prior final judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Even if her case was not doomed by\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , it must be dismissed because Ms. Middleton has failed to state a claim under both ERISA and the FTCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC 1, \u00b6 11. ERISA is a federal statute that provides protections for individuals enrolled in employee benefit plans by imposing certain standards and fiduciary duties on the administrators of those plans.\n   <em>\n    Aetna Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525905\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/200/#p208\">\n    542 U.S. at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525905\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/200/#p208\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although Ms. Middleton attempts to make a claim against the DOL under ERISA Section 510, this Section\n   only allows a claim to be brought against \"persons.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201140\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (codifying Pub.

This does not include government entities, and therefore, no cause of action can be brought against the United States under ERISA Section 510 unless the Government is the plaintiff's employer, a fact that Ms. Middleton has not alleged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pa.

Pa. 1993) (\"Congress did not include governmental agencies within its specifically defined list of persons, and only 'persons' can be beneficiaries.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The DOL also owes no fiduciary duties to Ms. Middleton under ERISA. The statute defines fiduciaries as only those persons who exercise authority or control with respect to an ERISA investment plan.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (21). The DOL exercised no such authority or control over her retirement plan here. The extent of the DOL's relationship with Ms. Middleton was receiving the complaint she filed against Centra Health and American General Company for alleged mishandling of her retirement account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    West v.

Therefore, with respect to Ms. Middleton, the DOL is merely a third party which could not have breached the fiduciary duties defined by ERISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Ms. Middleton also fails to state a claim under the FTCA, which \"remove[s] the sovereign immunity of the United States from suits in tort\" and \"render[s] the Government liable in tort as a private individual would be under like circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richards v.
