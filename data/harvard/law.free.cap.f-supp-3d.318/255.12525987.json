FRIEDRICH, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Jody TallBear brings this action against her employer, the U.S. Department of Energy, alleging that it racially discriminated against her by allowing other employees to discuss the Washington Redskins football team and display Redskins paraphernalia at work. She also alleges that the Department of Energy retaliated against her after she raised concerns about the Redskins following in the office. Before the Court is Energy Secretary James Richard Perry's Motion to Dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 9. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant the motion in part and deny it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Department of Energy (DOE) hired TallBear in 2011 as an attorney advisor in the Office of Economic Impact and Diversity. Compl. \u00b6 8, Dkt. 1. TallBear \"has held herself out to be Native American,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1, and for several years served as lead for tribal and Native American engagement in DOE's Economic Impact and Diversity office,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. In 2013, TallBear became the\n   Strategic Initiatives and Policy Advisor for the Economic Impact and Diversity office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. In that role, TallBear gave numerous presentations on issues of race and bias, such as \"What can a critical look at Indian mascots teach us about uncovering bias in ourselves and others?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The crux of the discrimination claim is TallBear's allegation that she has been \"repeatedly exposed\" to the Washington Redskins name and logo, from \"posters placed in common areas by DOE employees\" to \"clothing worn by employees\" and \"causal and widespread use\" of the term in her presence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. TallBear also cites two specific instances of exposure to the Redskins. First, a DOE leadership trainer wore a Redskins tie and mentioned the Redskins during a presentation in February 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Second, a DOE attorney left a \"Redskins Special\" flyer from Subway-the sandwich shop-on Tallbear's desk in December 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. TallBear also alleges that Native Americans are not included in diversity training though other groups are and that DOE has not offered \"cultural sensitivity training\" on Native American issues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. All this, TallBear says, despite the fact that she has \"communicated multiple times to DOE leadership that she is deeply offended by the [Redskins] term and its widespread use in the DOE workplace.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. TallBear considers the term a racial slur, in part because it was \"widely used throughout the 18th and 19th centuries to denote the physical proof of kill of a Native American in order for hunters to collect the monetary bounty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In March 2013, TallBear expressed her concerns in a memorandum to her boss, Director of Economic Impact and Diversity LaDoris Harris, and two DOE Deputy Directors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. TallBear asserted that DOE was fostering a hostile work environment that caused her anxiety and depression.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In June 2013, DOE's Office of General Counsel informed DOE's Office of Diversity and Inclusion that it had found no legal basis to ban Redskins paraphernalia and did not advise providing sensitivity training on the issues TallBear raised.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. The Office of General Counsel also suggested that TallBear could direct her concerns to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) or the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   TallBear accordingly sent a memorandum to those agencies in October 2013, but received no response.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. TallBear wrote additional memoranda to OPM in June 2014 and to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in November 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31. In December 2014, the OPM Director of Diversity and Inclusion responded that there was \"no legal basis for banning [Redskins] paraphernalia.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In October 2015, TallBear informed Harris that she had accepted several invitations to speak at other federal agencies on issues of race and bias during Native American Heritage Month events.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. TallBear had spoken at similar events in the past two years and had given a presentation on sensitivity training at a meeting of agency diversity leaders the previous month.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33, 35. Harris responded negatively, stating that she did not want her \"role as Director [in] jeopardy because you went off speaking regarding controversial issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. The same month, Harris postponed TallBear's attendance at a federal training program that was scheduled for January 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. As of the complaint's filing in January 2017, that training had not been rescheduled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. Also in October 2015, Harris allegedly began to \"remov[e] Ms. TallBear from her policy lead position\" and \"exclude Ms. TallBear from meetings, briefings with senior leadership or other offices, and similar assignments that she had handled for the last several years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. TallBear\n   also alleges that the ten to fifteen trips per year she normally took for speaking engagements or stakeholder engagement was reduced to zero.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. TallBear was also asked by a member of the Office of General Counsel to \"take personal leave and disassociate herself from DOE\" when speaking at planned engagements for Native American Heritage Month because TallBear planned to make presentations \"showing other ethnic groups as mascots\" and that could \"open the agency up to litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41 (some quotation marks omitted). TallBear alleges that in November 2015, Harris reassigned many of her responsibilities to a less experienced staff member.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 7, 2015, TallBear was reassigned to DOE's Office of Civil Rights to process Title VII complaints.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. TallBear calls this a \"de facto demotion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   TallBear says that she has sought detail opportunities in energy-policy offices since then but that Harris or the Office of General Counsel rejected those requests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. TallBear also alleges that in February 2016, Harris did not include her in a meeting to discuss a report of Harris's accomplishments at DOE, and in March 2016, a request to attend a DOE meeting with the Montana Governor's office was denied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45, 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   TallBear filed an informal complaint on December 10, 2015 and a formal administrative complaint in March 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. The FBI issued a Report of Investigation in September 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. On January 5, 2017, more than 180 days after TallBear filed her administrative complaint, she filed suit in this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.
