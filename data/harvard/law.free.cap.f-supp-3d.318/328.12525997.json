Richard Hopp, to establish the amount of fees and costs owed in this case. Decl. of Att'ys' Fees &amp; Legal Costs [Dkt. # 7-3] (\"Hopp Decl.\"). The declaration attaches documentation outlining the 8.9 hours expended by Mr. Hopp on this case, and it states that Mr. Hopp billed his time at $295.00 per hour.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1 to Hopp Decl. [Dkt. # 7-3] (\"Time Records\"). Mr. Hopp avers that he has been practicing labor and employee benefits law since 1991, and that his firm has \"a negotiated fee of $295.00 per hour for attorney time with his client for the performance of this type of legal representation.\" Hopp Decl. \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Although plaintiffs do provide sufficient information regarding the hours expended in this case in the form of contemporaneous time records, the evidence supplied regarding the reasonableness of the hourly rate is a bit sparse. To support the reasonableness of his rate, Mr. Hopp states that he would be entitled to $796.00 per hour under the\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   Matrix.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hopp Decl. \u00b6 4.

Therefore, it will award plaintiffs $2,625.50 in attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs also seek legal costs in the amount of $185.00 incurred for service of process and $400.00 incurred to file the complaint in this case. Hopp Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Based on the documentary evidence provided, which shows that plaintiffs did incur these costs, Ex. 2 to Hopp Decl. [Dkt. # 7-3]; Ex. 3 to Hopp Decl. [Dkt. # 7-3], the Court will award plaintiffs their costs totaling $585.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Plaintiffs are also entitled to equitable relief.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In an action to enforce the payment of unpaid contributions and in which judgment is granted in favor of the plan, ERISA also provides that the court \"shall award ... such other legal or equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2)(E). Plaintiffs seek two forms of equitable relief: (1) they ask the Court to order defendant to submit to an audit of its payroll records, and (2) they seek an injunction to prevent defendant from continuing to fail to report and pay contributions to plaintiffs. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33-40, 41(D), 41(G); Pls.' Mem. at 8-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First, plaintiffs ask the Court to order defendant to submit to a payroll audit. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33-35; Pls.' Mem. at 9-10. Pursuant to the relevant agreements in this case, defendant is obligated to submit monthly remittance reports and to make contributions to plaintiffs. To ensure that defendant is providing accurate information and paying the required contributions, the Collection Procedures entitle plaintiffs to conduct audits of defendant's books and records. Stupar Decl. \u00b6 16; Collection Procedures at 3 (\"Audits will be conducted to ensure full compliance with employer obligations under collective bargaining agreements. Every employer can expect to be audited at some time. If a delinquency is discovered as a result of an audit, the employer will be assessed the cost of the audit.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are entitled to the requested equitable relief under the terms of the relevant agreements.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boland v.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36-40, 41(G); Pls.' Mem. at 10. They ask the Court to direct defendant \"to comply with its obligations to correctly report and contribute to the [p]laintiffs in a timely manner in the future.\" Compl. \u00b6 41(G); Pls.' Mem. at 10 (\"Plaintiffs ask the Court for an order to enjoin the [d]efendant from violating the terms of its Agreements ... by requiring the [d]efendant: 1) to submit all remittance reports accurately to the [p]laintiffs no later than the fifteenth day of the month following\n   the month in which the [d]efendant performed the work, and 2) to pay the [p]laintiffs all contributions owed no later than the fifteenth day of the month following the month in which the [d]efendant performed the work.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Because the Court has the discretionary power to award plaintiffs \"such other legal or equitable relief as the court deems appropriate,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2)(E), the Court concludes that plaintiffs' requested relief is appropriate. However, it will grant this aspect of plaintiffs' motion by requiring defendant to comply with its contractual and statutory obligations to plaintiffs, instead of prohibiting defendant from\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   complying with those obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Int'l Painters &amp; Allied Trades Indus.

It will order defendant to pay unpaid contributions, as well as interest and liquidated damages on those unpaid amounts.
