Dr. Coulibaly asserts eleven counts against the Secretary of State, the State Department's Office of the Inspector General (\"OIG\"), and twenty-one current or former employees of the State Department. Specifically, Dr. Coulibaly brings claims pursuant to Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1982, 1983 ; and tort law. In some of the counts, Dr. Coulibaly asks this Court to consider claims that he previously attempted to bring in a rejected proposed amended complaint filed in an earlier suit. Defendants move to dismiss Dr. Coulibaly's complaint, arguing that it is barred by the rule against claim-splitting and that, in any event, Dr. Coulibaly has failed to state claims upon which relief may be granted. For the reasons explained below, this Court grants Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

First, Dr. Coulibaly is barred from alleging an FTCA claim against any Defendant except for the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202674\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The United States shall be liable ...

The claims brought against all other Defendants in their official and individual capacities are thereby improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Second, Dr. Coulibaly has not demonstrated that he has exhausted his administrative remedies under the FTCA to pursue a claim against the United States. For example, Dr. Coulibaly has not shown that he has filed an FTCA claim with the appropriate agency or that he received a written denial of his claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Totten\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5317147\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/421/115/#p122\">\n    421 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   122 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202675\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Therefore, this Court is \"deprive[d] ... of jurisdiction to hear a tort claim against the federal government.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Totten\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5317147\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/421/115/#p122\">\n    421 F.Supp.2d at 122-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). Accordingly, this Court dismisses without prejudice Count 11, the civil conspiracy claim against Defendants in their official and individual capacities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Although the rule against claim-splitting does not preclude Dr. Coulibaly from asserting his claims, the Court concludes that Dr. Coulibaly fails to state any claims upon which relief may be granted. For the foregoing reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety. An order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion is separately and contemporaneously issued.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Only four of the twenty-two counts survived the motion to dismiss: a First Amendment claim, a Title VII hostile work environment claim, a wrongful discharge claim, and a retaliation claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Coulibaly\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271591\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/213/93/#p105\">\n     213 F.Supp.3d at 104-05\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The remaining claims were later consolidated with\n    <em>\n     Coulibaly v.
