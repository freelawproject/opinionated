Mr. Ham was first placed on a three-month PIP on November 9, 2011 for work deficiencies. After Mr. Ham was informed that he had failed the PIP, he sought reconsideration by the Superintendent, Senate Office Buildings. The Superintendent agreed that Mr. Ham had failed the PIP but extended it for another 90 days because Mr. Ham had worked for the AOC for more than 21 years. Mr. Ham's supervisor concluded that he had failed the second PIP as well, on February 13, 2013, and Mr. Ham again sought reconsideration. On July 1, 2013, the Superintendent agreed that Mr. Ham had failed the second PIP and that a demotion was appropriate. Mr. Ham sought EEO counseling on July 22, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Overlooking the two PIPs altogether, Mr. Ham recites only the dates relevant to his demotion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 6-7.

However, it is not quite so simple, because the Court must consider whether any post-July 2013 hostile acts might be a continuation of an earlier hostile work environment complaint that was included in the counseling and mediation requested by Mr. Ham in July 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Neither party mentions the salient fact that Mr. Ham's request for counseling complained of \"[h]arassment-hostile work environment\" due to a specific incident on July 17, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Counseling Request at 2.
