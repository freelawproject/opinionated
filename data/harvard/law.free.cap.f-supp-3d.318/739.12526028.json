(ECF No. 15 at \u00b6 10.) W.J.L. was a good student and did not have disciplinary or behavioral problems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During the 2016-2017 school year, W.J.L. suffered \"intense, persistent, and malicious bullying\" from fellow students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.) The bullying involved \"unwanted and unwarranted physical contact,\" \"persistent and pervasive ridicule,\" \"threats of violence,\" and statements that W.J.L. was \"better off dead\" and should commit suicide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.) Some of the bullying that W.J.L. suffered involved his \"not being perceived to be masculine enough relative to his peers and not having the ideal appearance for a male in his age group.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Students bullied W.J.L. \"on school property during educational hours.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.) W.J.L. also experienced bullying off of school grounds, such as while walking back to his father's house or online through social media. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   W.J.L. experienced bullying in the presence of Altoona Junior High staff and fellow students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.) In fact, \"[i]t was well known throughout the school that W.J.L. was persistently picked on by his peers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Furthermore, it was known that the students who bullied W.J.L. were football players. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.) However, Altoona Junior High did not take disciplinary measures against the bullies because they were members of the football team. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On one occasion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   W.J.L. was being bullied in a male teacher's classroom and asked to leave the classroom and go to the guidance counselor's office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.) Rather than allow W.J.L. to see the guidance counselor, the male teacher told W.J.L. that he \"needed to stop being a baby.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Despite the fact that students and school personnel knew about the severe and persistent bullying that W.J.L. suffered, Defendants failed to take any action to address the problem. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.) Further, in violation of school policy, school officials never notified W.J.L.'s parents about the persistent bullying their son experienced. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   W.J.L. killed himself on May 18, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.) W.J.L. took his life after a \"particularly brutal day of bullying\" at school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The day after W.J.L. committed suicide, Lansberry received a phone call from AASD stating that W.J.L. was \"absent\" from school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.) However, when Lansberry received this phone call, AASD had already been made aware that W.J.L. had committed suicide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A special public meeting was held on May 25, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.) At this meeting, AASD acknowledged that AASD's bullying and harassment policy was deficient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A second public event was held on April 18, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.) At that meeting, a member of AASD's board of directors stated that a bullying \"problem\" persisted at Altoona Junior High that had not adequately\n   been addressed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During this meting, Defendant Charles Prijatelj-the Superintendent of AASD-offered his condolences to Lansberry's counsel and his wife, mistaking them for the Lansberry family. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.) Also at that meeting, AASD's board of directors voted to hire outside counsel to review all AASD policies and procedures, with a \"focus on student services.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.) However, a member of AASD's board of directors stated that the results of the attorney's work were \"sitting on a shelf in the directors' room collecting dust\" and that the AASD board of directors had never reviewed the recommendations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After W.J.L.'s death, AASD removed items from his locker without notifying his family or the Altoona Police Department, which was investigating his suicide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.) AASD did not produce W.J.L.'s passbook to his parents or the police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Lansberry filed a Complaint before this Court (ECF No. 1), which he subsequently amended (ECF No. 15).

The Court Will Grant Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Lansberry's Title IX Claim Against AASD Because Lansberry Failed to Plead a Plausible Title IX Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants argue that Lansberry failed to state a cognizable Title IX claim for several reasons. Defendants argue that Lansberry merely alleges teasing and name-calling, not gender-based sexual harassment. (ECF No. 17 at 7.) Defendants further contend that Lansberry failed to allege sexual harassment that was sufficiently \"severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive\" that it deprived W.J.L. of access to educational opportunities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants further assert that Lansberry failed to allege that the Defendants knew about, or ignored, any incidents of sexual harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.) Defendants also argue that AASD did not assert \"substantial control\" over any conduct occurring via social media, and thus cannot be liable for any harassment that took place online. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Finally, Defendants argue that the single instance of teacher bullying that Lansberry alleges neither constitutes \"sexual harassment\" nor rises to the level of \"persistence or severity\" required to state a Title IX claim, and further asserts that Lansberry did not allege that any school official had knowledge of this single incident of teacher harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In response, Lansberry contends that \"sexual harassment did occur on school grounds during school hours through both peer harassment and bullying and at least one instance of a teacher engaging in harassment and bullying of W.J.L. while in [a] classroom during class.\"(ECF No. 25 at 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Lansberry further argues that Defendants\n   had knowledge of the harassment because \"it was well-known throughout the school that W.J.L. was bullied and harassed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lansberry also asserts that Defendants withheld and/or destroyed items in W.J.L.'s locker-such as his hall passbook -and that this conduct violates AASD's policies and indicates that \"Defendants did engage in willful and deliberate indifference to the ongoing harassment of W.J.L. by his peers and school personnel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lansberry states that the bullying and harassment took place \"on a near daily basis\" and that W.J.L. faced not merely name-calling, but also bullying that was \"physical and psychological in nature.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lansberry further contends that the harassment deprived W.J.L. of an educational benefit because \"a benefit is to be educated in a safe, nurturing and fostering environment and not have to look over one's shoulder to see if the bullies are behind you.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, Lansberry asserts that \"Defendants cannot properly argue that an opportunity or benefit was not denied when a child chose death over life due to bullying and harassment that took place at his school.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Title IX provides that \"[n]o person ... shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

More Vulnerable to Danger than He Would Have Been Had Defendants Done Nothing (Prong 4)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendants argue that the Court should dismiss Lansberry's state-created danger claim because Lansberry failed to allege an affirmative act by Defendants that harmed W.J.L. or made him more vulnerable to the danger than he would have been had Defendants done nothing at all. (ECF No. 1 at 11-15.) Defendants further contend that returning an alleged bully to a school environment does not, as a matter of law, constitute an affirmative action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) Finally, Defendants assert that their failure to report the bullying that W.J.L. suffered to W.J.L.'s parents fails to constitute an affirmative action.

First, Lansberry argues that Defendants' inaction in the face of the persistent bullying suffered by W.J.L. constituted affirmative action. (ECF No. 25 at 5.) Second, Lansberry contends that the male teacher who told W.J.L. to stop being a \"baby\" and prevented him from visiting the guidance counselor took an affirmative action attributable to Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Lansberry asserts that these two \"affirmative actions\" by Defendants rendered W.J.L. more vulnerable to the danger and contributed to his decision to take his life.

Therefore, contrary to Lansberry's contention, AASD's failure to take appropriate action does not constitute an affirmative act that can subject AASD to liability under the state-created danger doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Court rejects Lansberry's argument that AASD took affirmative action by violating its own policy of informing parents when their children suffer bullying. As noted above, the Third Circuit has held that a school's failure to enforce its own policy does not comprise an affirmative use of state authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morrow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4054667\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/719/160/#p165\">\n    719 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   178-79 ;\n   <em>\n    Gayemen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407111\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/712/218/#p220\">\n    712 F.

Therefore, the fact that AASD ignored its own anti-bullying policy by failing to intervene cannot, as a matter of law, constitute state action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court similarly rejects Lansberry's contention that the male teacher's isolated comment to W.J.L. constituted affirmative use of state authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   While this comment was insensitive and inappropriate, it does not constitute an affirmative action for the purposes of the state-created danger doctrine for three independently sufficient reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   First, the teacher's denial of W.J.L.'s request to visit the guidance office maintained the status quo. The teacher required W.J.L. to remain in class under his supervision. Lansberry has not alleged that denying W.J.L.'s request to leave class violated the status quo or classroom protocol. Therefore, the Court holds that the teacher's denial did not constitute an affirmative use of state authority.\n   <em>\n    L.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353472\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/235/#p242\">\n    836 F.3d at 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Second, the Amended Complaint fails to explain how the teacher's insensitive comment rendered W.J.L. \"more vulnerable to danger.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353472\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/235/#p242\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353472\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/235/#p242\">\n    at 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In fact, the Amended Complaint does not even name the teacher or allege when he made the comment. Lansberry does not allege a causal connection between W.J.L.'s suicide and the teacher's remark, or explain how one isolated statement could have increased W.J.L.'s vulnerability to danger. Because Lansberry failed to plead facts that plausibly support the conclusion that teacher's isolated comment increased W.J.L.'s vulnerability to danger, the Court holds that the remark did not constitute an affirmative use of state authority.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353472\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/235/#p242\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Third, an isolated comment by a teacher is fundamentally different from the conduct that courts have found to constitute affirmative uses of state authority for the purposes of the state-created danger doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    L.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353472\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/235/#p242\">\n    836 F.3d at 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that teacher affirmatively used state authority when she authorized an unidentified adult to remove a kindergarten student from classroom);\n   <em>\n    Kneipp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7647365\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/95/1199/#p1201\">\n    95 F.3d at 1209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that police officers affirmatively used state authority when they stopped a couple late at night, released the man, and allowed a visibly intoxicated woman walk home alone in the cold). The exercise of state authority here is much more tenuous than in\n   <em>\n    L.R.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kneipp\n   </em>\n   . The teacher did not release W.J.L. to an unidentified stranger or permit him, while visibly impaired, to navigate home by himself on a cold evening. Lansberry has failed to cite a single case for the proposition that the teacher affirmatively used state authority by making an isolated insensitive remark and denying W.J.L.'s request to visit the guidance counselor's office.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the Court is unaware of any case that embraces such an expansive definition of state action.

However, Lansberry's Amended Complaint alleges that Defendants violated AASD \"policy/regulation\" by failing to remedy the persistent bullying that W.J.L. experienced. (See ECF No. 15 at \u00b6\u00b6 9; 17; 53;\n   <em>\n    55\n   </em>\n   ; 60.) Because Lansberry's Complaint references an AASD \"policy/regulation,\" Defendants proactively address the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   issue in their brief, arguing that Lansberry failed to sate a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim because he failed to allege that the implementation of an AASD policy or practice caused W.J.L.'s death. (ECF No. 17 at 18.) In response, Lansberry now argues in his Response Brief that his Amended Complaint did in fact articulate a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim. (See ECF No. 25 at 7.) Lansberry contends that AASD had a custom or practice of ignoring state law and its own anti-bullying policies, and that this failure establishes willful indifference and deliberate inaction sufficient to support a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim.

For example, Lansberry does not allege that AASD had received, and failed to adequately respond to, previous reports of bullying. Nor does he allege that other students' rights to bodily integrity had been violated due to known bullying incidents that the school failed to properly address. In other words, while Lansberry alleges that W.J.L. experienced bullying, he does not allege a wider bullying problem at AASD that could have plausibly put AASD on notice that the constitutional rights of its students were being violated. Accordingly, Lansberry does not plausibly allege that, given the conditions at Altoona Junior High with regard to bullying, the need for additional training was \"so obvious\" and the status quo so likely to result in constitutional violations that AASD \"can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent\n   to the need.\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=722%20F.%20App%27x%20194\">\n    722 F.

Rather than citing cases to counter Defendants' arguments, Lansberry merely (1) identifies the elements of a state-created danger claim, and (2) articulates policy arguments (unsupported by any case citations) for why the Court should hold that Defendants' inaction constituted an affirmative use of state authority. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 25 at 6.) Lansberry's most creative, yet least persuasive, argument is that Defendants' duty to act in the face of bullying is analogous to attorneys' duty to act when they observe a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 7.) But Lansberry fails to explain where Defendants' purported duty originates, or why, if such duty existed, it would mirror that which governs attorneys.
