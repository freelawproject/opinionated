CROTTY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a lawsuit about how the U.S. Government treats unaccompanied alien children (\"UAC\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Generally, when UAC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   are apprehended by an agency of the Federal Government, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), the agency must transfer custody of the UAC to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Refugee Resettlement (\"ORR\") within 72 hours.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20279\">\n    6 U.S.C. \u00a7 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). ORR is then responsible for the care and custody of the UAC, until they are reunited with a family member or placed with other individuals or entities, while removal proceedings go forward in immigration courts. When UAC come into ORR's custody, ORR places UAC into one of three types of state licensed, ORR-funded, caretaker facilities: (1) secure facility; (2) staff-secure facility; and (3) shelter care facility. A secure facility has the most restrictive custodial condition and it is in many ways akin to juvenile jails; a staff-secure facility is less restrictive than a secure facility, but movement within it is substantially controlled; and a shelter care facility is the least restrictive custodial setting. These facilities are supposed to provide UAC with housing, education, health, and case management services. The ORR website explains its role as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"On March 1, 2003, the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Section 462, transferred responsibilities for the care and placement of unaccompanied alien children from the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Since then, ORR has cared for more than 175,000 children, incorporating child welfare values as well as the principles and provisions established by the Flores Agreement in 1997, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and its reauthorization acts, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) of 2005 and 2008.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Unaccompanied alien children apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration officials are transferred to the care and custody of ORR. ORR\n   <em>\n    promptly places\n   </em>\n   an unaccompanied child in the\n   <em>\n    least restrictive setting\n   </em>\n   that is in the\n   <em>\n    best interests\n   </em>\n   of the child, taking into consideration danger to self, danger to the community, and risk of flight. ORR takes into\n   <em>\n    consideration the unique nature of each\n   </em>\n   child's situation and incorporates\n   <em>\n    child welfare principles\n   </em>\n   when making placement, clinical, case management, and release decisions that are in the\n   <em>\n    best interest of the child\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphases added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (\"TVPRA\") mandates that ORR \"promptly\" place UAC \"in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interests of the child.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(A). Prompt placement of the child is critical to minimize the deleterious impact (anxiety, depression, and/or cognitive change) of detention. There is no dispute that the longer the detention, the greater the impact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This lawsuit challenges the ORR's newly revised process for placing UAC in the most appropriate setting at the earliest possible opportunity. In mid-2017, the then-newly appointed director of ORR, Scott Lloyd, added a director review step to the UAC release process, requiring his personal approval of release decisions involving UAC who are housed in a staff-secure\n   facility or have ever been housed in a staff-secure or secure facility. Plaintiffs claim that the director review step adds unjustifiable delays to the UAC release process and violates the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), TVPRA, and Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Lead Plaintiff L.V.M., who is an UAC, brings this action on behalf of himself and those similarly situated against Scott Lloyd, Jonathan White, Steven Wagner, Alex Azar, and Ely Valdez (\"Defendants\") who are federal officers and employees of ORR, seeking injunctive relief and declaratory judgment, as well as habeas relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To be clear, this lawsuit does not deal with the Department of Homeland Security's new policy of separating children from their undocumented parents at the border. Nor does it deal with ORR's apparent loss of contact with 1,500 UAC under its supervision. Nor the alleged routine and forcible administration of a range of psychotropic drugs at an ORR-funded facility. Nor the ORR's alleged practice of detaining and transporting UAC to detention facilities without notifying their parents or lawyers. Nor the ORR's alleged employment of a psychiatrist that has treated children without board certification for nearly a decade. Rather, this lawsuit challenges only the ORR's process for promptly placing UAC in the most appropriate setting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs move for class certification and a preliminary injunction; Defendants move to dismiss. With this Court's leave, the parties completed expedited discovery. On June 7, 2018, the Court heard oral argument on each of the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Defendants' motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED;\n   </strong>\n   the Plaintiffs' motion for class certification is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED;\n   </strong>\n   and the Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED-IN-PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED-IN-PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Not only have Plaintiffs pleaded plausible statutory and constitutional violations, but they have also adequately demonstrated irreparable injury and the likelihood of success on numerous claims. For example, the APA guards against agency actions instituted based on personal preference of decisionmakers. According to evidence before the Court, Lloyd's director review policy was instituted within hours of Lloyd's appointment as the director of ORR, with no record demonstrating the need for a change. Apparently, the change was based on unidentified news reports about criminal activities involving immigrant minors. Expedited discovery has not yielded any record showing a consideration of relevant law, agency documents, or the impact on UAC. This is at the zenith of impermissible agency actions. This unlawful agency action keeps Plaintiffs-the very subjects that ORR is statutorily mandated to protect-from reuniting with their sponsors for at the very least 35 more days (and likely more than that) in a process which already takes too long.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court cannot turn a blind eye to Plaintiffs' suffering and irreparable injury. The Court hereby directs ORR to vacate the director review policy, until further order of the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Well Pleaded Allegations Concerning Custody and Processing of Immigrant Children\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Every year, foreign or alien children come to the United States, some with parents, some with relatives, some with\n   friends, and some, alone. A great number of these children have no legal right to enter. Compl. \u00b6 16. In the 80's and 90's, the government locked up these undocumented children in jail facilities across the country.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There have been numerous legal challenges to these practices. More than two decades ago, the Supreme Court held that UAC do not have a fundamental right to be placed in the custody of a willing and able private custodian.\n   <em>\n    Reno v. Flores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6228898\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/292/\">\n    507 U.S. 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6228898\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/292/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6228898\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/292/\">\n    123 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). Nonetheless, the litigating parties continued negotiations, which ended with a 1997 consent decree (also referred to as the\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   settlement) setting standards for the detention, release, and treatment of UAC. The\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   settlement mandates that UAC be released \"without unnecessary delay\" and provides that the Government must engage in \"prompt and continuous efforts\" towards family reunification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compl. \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Since then, Congress has passed two statutes addressing the care and custody of UAC. In 2002, Congress enacted the Homeland Security Act (\"HSA\"), which transferred authority over the care and placement of UAC to ORR. The ORR's mission is to incorporate child welfare values into the care and placement of UAC,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. In 2008, Congress enacted the TVPRA, which grants legal protections to UAC in ORR's custody and directs ORR to (1) promptly place UAC, (2) in the least restrictive setting that (3) is in the best interest of the child.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ORR has never promulgated any regulations under the TVPRA, but it has developed an internal guide (which was posted online in 2015) setting forth agency procedures for UAC placement and release.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. The guide governs more than 7,000 children in ORR's custody, approximately 1,200 of whom are located in New York.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. According to the guide, when a child comes into ORR's custody, ORR places the child into one of three types of facilities: (1) secure facility; (2) staff-secure facility; (3) shelter care facility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. ORR places UAC in secure or staff-secure facilities for a variety of reasons including, for example, disruptive behaviors, escape risks, or any behaviors which raise safety concerns.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   UAC can move up from a shelter care facility to a staff-secure or secure facility; and down from a secure facility to a staff-secure or shelter care facility. Most UAC, however, are released to family members and others (also known as sponsors) who are qualified to care for them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Further, ORR places in a long-term foster-care program UAC who have demonstrated safe behavior in a non-secure setting, but have no sponsor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25. The release of UAC is recommended to an ORR Federal Field Specialist (\"FFS\") by an ORR care provider, after consultation with a nongovernmental third-party reviewer. FFS can approve, reject, or seek more data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Prior to the January 20, 2017 change in administration, the release decisions were made expeditiously. UAC in staff-secure facilities (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Children's Village) were released to a sponsor in about 30 to 90 days; and for UAC in shelter care facilities, within 34 days.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Since the change in administration, however, the release of children in a secure or staff-secure facility no longer takes 90 days; it now takes seven to eight months on average.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that this unconscionable delay results, in part, from a new review policy instituted by the then-newly appointed Director of ORR, Scott Lloyd. Upon taking office, Lloyd instituted a director\n   review policy (reflected in the June 12, 2017 revision to the online ORR guide\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), under which any UAC who has ever been held in a secure or staff-secure facility cannot be released, unless the release is personally approved by Lloyd or his designee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. Lloyd does not disclose what standards he follows; nor does he describe how he makes his decisions. Under a policy of his own making, Lloyd has unfettered discretion to approve, deny, or request additional information, unguided by any rule or fixed set of criteria, giving him unrestricted power to rule over the fate of vulnerable children.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The director review policy allegedly has substantially increased the time for reunification of UAC with their family, or placement in foster care.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. The actual review by Lloyd is not the only source of delay; the director level policy also requires FFS to prepare the review package for Lloyd, which adds further delay to the release process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. UAC understandably suffer substantial harm from the director review policy; the prolonged period of detention causes depression, deterioration in mental health, as well as behavioral problems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. But ORR has yet to provide any substantive explanation or justification for the new policy.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Well Pleaded Allegations Pertaining to Lead Plaintiff L.V.M.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   L.V.M. is a 17-year-old from El Salvador who came to the United States with his mother seeking asylum.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.

Equally unsurprisingly, neither party disputes that the director review policy imposes significant delays (at least 35 days) on the release of UAC from ORR's custody, which already takes too long. The \"overall average length of time for children who are in ORR custody is currently 57 days\" (Tr. 40:23-24; 94:14-15), but \"the average length of time that the plaintiff class spends detained is 242 days\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   56:21-22; 104:22-23). The largest single component of delay is the 35 days needed for review of the director review package in the Office of Director (ECF 44 (\"Rafael Decl.\") \u00b6 11(b); Tr. 65:6-8; 84:17-18, 88:14-15), as well as \"significant\" delays even before the application is escalated for director review (Zayas Decl. \u00b6 37).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   ECF 36-4 (\"Carey Decl.\") \u00b6 17 (\"the very act of adding headquarters review to decisions in individual cases will add substantial time just as a matter of process\"). What is disputed (surprisingly) is whether the more than 35 days of average delay would impose irreparable harm on Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov. Mem. 14; Tr. 82:10-13, 20-22; 84:17-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   It is clear to this Court that the 35 days of average delay imposed by the director review policy, as well as additional delays incurred even before the application is escalated for director review, causes irreparable injury to Plaintiffs. Multiple experts have opined that even a short detention can have \"deleterious effects\" on minors (Zayas Decl. \u00b6 32), causing \"psychological trauma and induce long-term depression, anxiety and PTSD\" (ECF 46 (\"Fortuna Deck\") \u00b6 16) that are not necessarily resolved once the detainee is freed (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Carey Decl. \u00b6 17 (\"even short delays of a few days can have serious implications for child well-being\"). The Court finds these opinions reliable and credible. The Court is mindful of the vulnerable and exposed nature of UAC, and concludes, at the very least, that the delay incidental to the challenged director review policy (more than 35 days) is clearly long enough to cause irreparable harm to Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zayas Decl. \u00b6 32 (\"Stays as short as 14 days can have deleterious effects on youth\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    ii.\n    <em>\n     Likelihood of Success\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   To warrant a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs \"need not show that there is a likelihood of success on the merits of all of [their] claims for relief.

The Court finds no rational relationship between the director review policy and the ORR's apparent goal \"to release every UAC to a suitable sponsor\" (ECF 65 (\"Fields Deck\") \u00b6 5), nor do Defendants provide any (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 88:24-89:15). Indeed, the director review policy is antithetical to the statutory goal of prompt release of\n   UAC to suitable sponsors. Moreover, Lloyd has no expertise or experience to evaluate the propriety of the release decision made by a skilled FFS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is especially so because his release decision is not subject to any written guidelines or specific criteria.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zayas Deck \u00b6\u00b6 20-21; Carey Deck \u00b6 18.

As discussed above, there is no dispute that the director review policy incurs more than 35 days of average delay.\n   <em>\n    See supra.\n   </em>\n   These delays are substantial, especially in view of the vulnerable nature of immigrant children, and is clearly antithetical to the TVPRA's mandate to promptly release UAC to the least restrictive setting.
