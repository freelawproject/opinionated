MCFADDEN, United States District Judge\n   Under Title X of the Public Health Service Act, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) can award federal grants for \"voluntary family planning projects\" around the country, \"which shall offer a broad range of acceptable and effective family planning methods and services.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20300\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). HHS annually releases a funding opportunity announcement for the program, explaining how it will evaluate grant applications, a process that has historically included scoring based on seven criteria. The Plaintiffs-three Planned Parenthood affiliates and the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association-challenge the 2018 Announcement's addition of an eighth criterion to proposal scoring. This new factor evaluates proposals based on their ability to address the agency's program priorities and key issues enumerated in the Announcement. The Plaintiffs particularly object to the Announcement's focus on \"[a] meaningful emphasis on ... the benefits of avoiding sexual risk,\" easier access to primary health care, \"increasing family participation,\" and \"[c]ooperation with ... faith based organizations.\" Compl. Ex. A at 9-11. They argue that the challenged language required notice-and-comment rulemaking, violates the Title X statutory scheme, and is arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Government claims that the Announcement language is not subject to judicial review-except about whether rulemaking was required-because the Announcement is not \"final agency action\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and consideration of extra factors in Title X grantmaking is \"committed to agency discretion\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). On the merits, the Government argues that the eighth criterion is only a rule of agency procedure exempt from notice-and-comment rulemaking, and that the agency's substantive priorities are consistent with Title X's design, and not arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Both parties seek summary judgment on the undisputed administrative record. I conclude that the language in this Announcement, which does not bind the final decisionmaker, is not a \"final agency action\" reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Although the Plaintiffs' notice-and-comment claim is reviewable, the eighth factor is a procedural rather than legislative rule, and it is not arbitrary and capricious. The substantive tweaks to the program priorities and key issues are neither new nor incompatible with Title X, instead they rephrase similar priorities and issues that appeared in prior funding announcements without objection or notice-and-comment rulemaking. I will therefore grant summary judgment for the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

But it is the Plaintiffs who ignore Title X and mischaracterize the Announcement language and what HHS intends.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    To begin with, Title X's mention of \"natural family planning methods\" implicitly requires the agency to \"offer\" at least one type of selective abstinence as a method of family planning.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20300\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a).

Instead, it can involve various sexual abstentions, including \"avoiding sexual activities that put an individual at risk for unwanted pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections or other associated risks.\" AR 125.

The Announcement merely encourages Title X providers to discuss healthy relationships and sexual risk avoidance, in a nuanced and research-informed way. However unpopular, decisions to choose forms of sexual abstinence have undeniable relevance to family planning, and the administrative record supports the Government's conclusion that a meaningful emphasis on this topic can be part of a well-reasoned approach to Title X programs.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , AR 887 (\"[T]he Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ... described abstinence as the 'surest way to avoid transmission of sexually transmitted diseases,' and abstinence\n    is obviously an effective method of preventing unwanted pregnancies.\").

The Plaintiffs' chief complaint is what they consider this a preference for on-site primary care, Pls.'

The obvious reason for this longstanding agency commitment, as HHS explains, is the overall health of Title X patients. Gov. Mot. Summ. J. 36-37.
