The SEC has shown that it is likely to prove at trial that these defendants participated in an unregistered, illegal public offering of the stock of Longfin Corp. (\"Longfin\"). Accordingly, the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On April 4, 2018, a court order froze the proceeds of these defendants' sales of Longfin shares, among other things. The SEC has sought a preliminary injunction to extend that freeze pending trial. On April 19, this case was reassigned to this Court. The preliminary injunction motion became fully submitted on April 23. The SEC has submitted three declarations attaching numerous exhibits in support of its motion. The three defendants whose assets have been frozen submitted declarations and supporting exhibits, as well as declarations from defendant Venkata Meenavalli, the CEO and founder of Longfin, and non-party Philip Magri, an attorney retained by defendant Altahawi with respect to his sales of certain Longfin shares. Having considered this evidence, this Opinion constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     STATUORY FRAMEWORK FOR REGULATION A+ OFFERINGS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Longfin first received SEC approval to publicly offer its shares on June 16, 2017, and engaged in a public offering after that date. This public offering took place pursuant to provisions in the Jumpstarting Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (\"JOBS Act\"), which amended our nation's securities laws. Pub. L.

Before describing the events at issue here, the pertinent statutory framework created by the JOBS Act will be outlined. A more detailed description of the relevant legal standards follows the findings of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The JOBS Act was designed in part to permit early-stage companies to raise capital from public offerings with less expense than normally accompanies initial public offerings (\"IPOs\"). Title IV of the JOBS Act directed the SEC to create an exemption from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act for companies to publicly sell shares in an offering of securities in an amount up to $50 million with fewer requirements than those applicable generally to companies undertaking an IPO.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20Stat.%20306\">\n    126 Stat. 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 324 (codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77c ).

Longfin is now headquartered\n   in New York City. According to Meenavalli, since its founding, Longfin has earned revenue from the sale of physical commodities and by providing services to customers that use its trading platform. Longfin represented to the SEC in 2017 that, as of February 28, 2017, it had total assets of $298,861 and liabilities of $293,827, with most of the assets consisting of trade receivables.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Altahawi Consulting Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The day Longfin was incorporated it entered into a consulting agreement (\"Agreement\") with Altahawi's company Adamson Brothers Corp.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Meenavalli had met Altahawi in late 2016. Altahawi is a United States citizen and resides in Florida. Altahawi explains that he has over twenty-four years' experience in the securities industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   According to the Agreement, Altahawi specializes in \"Reg 'A' drafting and filings\" and will assist Longfin \"to initiate a \"Reg 'A+' tier II Direct Public Offering ('DPO').\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Altahawi agreed to assist Longfin \"for the sole purpose of filing Reg 'A' tier II qualification statement with the SEC.\" He agreed to draft an offering \"for up to $50 million.\" The term of the Agreement was set at twelve months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For Altahawi's services, Longfin agreed to pay Altahawi $65,000 and stock in four components:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   a. $25,000 deposit at signing this agreement in order to cover legal, Reg \"A\" qualification statement, drafting and managing the SEC process; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   b. The company shall pay $25,000 in 60 days of signing this agreement to cover the above; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   c.

The company will pay the consultant 3% equality [sic] of the company's outstanding shares pre-offering covering the above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Accordingly, Altahawi's services pursuant to the Agreement required him to \"draft\" and manage the SEC process for a Regulation A offering worth up to $50 million, including the duty to file a Tier 2 qualification statement with the SEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In a filing with the SEC made on March 10, 2017, Longfin disclosed the existence of the Agreement, and described it in the following terms.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The company has entered into an agreement with Mr. Andy Altahawi/Adamson Brothers for the provision of filing Reg A tier 2 and structuring for which Adamson Brothers\n   <em>\n    will charge 3%\n   </em>\n   of the issued shares post shares swap\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    after the successful completion of fund raising\n   </em>\n   . Mr. Altahawi is not affiliated with the company or its officers and directors in any way.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (Emphasis supplied.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Announcement of Intent to Engage in IPO\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On March 10, 2017, Longfin made a Form 1-A filing with the SEC indicating its intent to offer up to 20 million shares of its common stock on a \"best efforts\" basis. With each share priced at $2.50 per share, it intended to raise a maximum of $50 million for Longfin. The filings explained that the sale of shares would commence two days after the Offering Statement filed with the SEC \"is qualified.\" It warned that there was currently no trading\n   market for Longfin's common stock and that its securities were speculative and carried \"significant\" risks. It explained that as of February 28, it had 7.5 million shares outstanding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In that same filing, Longfin announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire a Singaporean company, Stampede Tradex Pte Ltd. (\"Stampede Tradex\"), through a \"share swap.\" Longfin was to issue 100 million shares of its common stock to shareholders of Stampede Tradex in exchange for 100% of Stampede Tradex's stock, making Stampede Tradex a subsidiary of Longfin. The SEC filing explained that Stampede Tradex had been operating since 2014, and had experienced a \"significant\" growth in its business. Longfin added that its \"core business plan\" was to utilize Stampede Tradex's technology, strategy, infrastructure and its business model, which was employed in the Asia Pacific region, for markets in the Americas, Europe, and Africa. The filing described Stampede Tradex as 55% owned by Stampede Capital Limited and 45% owned by Meenavalli.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Attached to the filing was an independent auditor's report for Longfin for the month of February. The auditor was identified as AJSH &amp; Co. LLP of New Delhi, India.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In a May 23, 2017 filing with the SEC, Longfin indicated that its offering would be for up to 10 million shares at $5 per share. It also indicated that the share swap arrangement had changed, such that Longfin would issue 50 million shares to Stampede Tradex's shareholders for 100% ownership in Stampede Tradex. The May 23 filing indicated that, after the share swap, the Longfin founders would hold 7.5 million shares, the Stampede Tradex shareholders would hold 50 million shares, and an additional 10 million shares would be held by the public, assuming that the IPO sold out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    SEC Qualification of Longfin's Offering\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On June 16, 2017, the SEC qualified Longfin's Regulation A+ offering. The SEC authorized Longfin to begin selling up to 10 million shares to the public at a price of up to $5 per share. Therefore, if Longfin had completely sold out its offering, it would have raised $50 million, the maximum permissible under Tier 2 of Regulation A+.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The share swap arrangement with Stampede Tradex closed three days later, on June 19, 2017. After the share swap arrangement, Longfin had 67,500,000 total shares outstanding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Altahawi Becomes Longfin's Secretary\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In June 2017, Longfin asked Altahawi to become its corporate secretary, and Altahawi accepted. Altahawi was issued a company e-mail address and began signing corporate resolutions on behalf of Longfin. In a July 6 Offering Circular, Longfin disclosed that \"Mr. Altahawi became an affiliated [sic] with the company and he is being considered to be part of our management team.\" On July 15, Altahawi, as corporate secretary, signed the certificate of adoption of the bylaws of Longfin. An August PowerPoint presentation listed Altahawi as a director of Longfin and point of contact for the company. On September 14, as corporate secretary, Altahawi signed a corporate resolution transferring 3% of Longfin's stock to himself, amounting to just over 2 million shares of Longfin, \"for the professional services rendered to the company since inception\" (the \"Consulting Shares\"). The resolution authorized Longfin's transfer agent, Colonial Stock Transfer Co., Inc. (\"Colonial Transfer\"), to issue\n   the shares to Altahawi \"as compensation for his professional services.\" The resolution was also signed by Meenavalli and Longfin's CFO Krishanu Singhal. Altahawi was identified as well in the resolution as a member of Longfin's board of advisors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Although Altahawi has submitted in opposition to this motion a resignation letter bearing the date September 1, 2017, which indicates that he resigned as corporate secretary as of September 1, 2017, that resignation letter was not effective.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As just described, Altahawi continued to act officially as Longfin's secretary for some time after September 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    The Issuance of Longfin Shares Begins\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   According to the control log and escrow account records for Longfin, shares began to be issued to individual purchasers in small increments on September 1, 2017, with another batch issued in even smaller increments on October 16, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   NASDAQ initial listing requirements generally require approximately 300 individual holders of shares, as well as 1 million total publicly held shares.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On September 15, Longfin disclosed that it had engaged Network 1 Financial Securities, Inc. (\"Network 1\") as lead underwriter for its DPO. As Longfin reported to the SEC, on September 25, it also agreed with Altahawi that Longfin would be listed on www.ipoflow.com, a website owned by Adamson Brothers, for \"no additional compensation.\" Although Longfin had been authorized by the SEC in July to sell up to 10 million shares, between September 1 and December 11, 2017, Longfin claims to have issued only 1.14 million shares through its Regulation A+ DPO, and to have raised approximately $5.7 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    The December 6 Shares\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   After a series of amendments to its SEC filings, but without disclosing any new financial information since February 2017, on November 22, 2017, Longfin registered its securities on a Form 8-A pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. The Form 8-A became effective on November 24, 2017. With that registration in place, Longfin became eligible for listing on a public stock exchange.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On December 4, 2017, Altahawi sent an e-mail with a subject line of \"RE: Longfin - Shareholders List\" to Colonial Transfer, asking it to share Longfin's current shareholder list with Network 1. Colonial Transfer responded by including not only the shareholder list, but also the records of payments received for those shares. It states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Here are the issuances from each of the 3 closings from the offering. In addition, I've included the escrow reconciliation printout showing all the deposits that were received along with the remittances to Longfin.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Network 1 then responded: \"Perfect. Thank you. Can you also send me a shareholders list as of today for NASDAQ.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On December 6, Altahawi sent the last e-mails in the record from the Longfin email address issued to him as secretary of Longfin. These emails were sent in the December 4 e-mail thread, with Altahawi\n   writing that \"I need to submit 24 subscriptions we need to issue the shares for as of today please.\" Shortly thereafter, Altahawi attached subscription agreements, first from eleven individuals, and then another thirteen. Longfin's share control log reflects that the twenty-four individuals were issued 409,360 shares of Longfin that same day (the \"December 6 Shares\"). The control log shows that each of these issuances have an \"R\" notation, indicating that the issuance was of restricted shares. There is no evidence in the record that any payment was received by Longfin or Colonial Transfer for these 409,360 shares. The December 6 Shares are included in the 1.14 million shares Longfin claims to have issued through its DPO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Two of the individuals who were issued shares on December 6 without any record of payment were defendants Penumarthi and Tammineedi. Penumarthi has known Meenavalli since childhood, having grown up with him in India. Penumarthi now resides in Dorset, United Kingdom. Penumarthi entered into a consulting arrangement with Longfin on July 1, 2017, which he asserts ended on September 30, 2017. Penumarthi's Facebook page stated that he was the Head of Operations for Longfin's United Kingdom operations. Penumarthi now states in his declaration that \"[w]hile I was acting as a consultant, I referenced my role on my Facebook page inaccurately. In fact, I have never been the 'Head of Operations' of Longfin Corp.\" His subscription agreement is dated September 2, 2017. Penumarthi was issued 40,000 shares of restricted Longfin stock on December 6. Colonial Transfer has no record that Penumarthi paid for these shares. Penumarthi's subscription agreement required payment to the escrow account maintained by Colonial Transfer for Longfin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Tammineedi is a director of Stampede Capital Limited, a company that Meenavalli founded and that is Longfin's largest shareholder. Stampede Capital Limited owns well over 10% of Longfin's shares, and Meenavalli himself has a substantial interest in Stampede Capital Limited.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tammineedi and Meenavalli are frequent business colleagues and close associates. Tammineedi resides in Telangana, India. His subscription agreement to purchase Longfin shares is dated September 25, 2017. Tammineedi was issued 30,000 shares of restricted Longfin stock on December 6. As is true for Penumarthi, Colonial Transfer has no record that Tammineedi paid for those shares. Tammineedi's subscription agreement also required payment to the escrow account maintained by Colonial Transfer for Longfin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Listing on NASDAQ\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On December 13, 2017, Longfin was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. The stock began trading at between $5-7/share.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Tammineedi Buys Shares on the Open Market\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On December 13 and 14, Tammineedi purchased 67,000 shares of Longfin on NASDAQ through a company called \"Source Media\" (the \"Source Media Shares\"), at an average price of approximately $5.50/share. Tammineedi is the sole officer and owner of Source Media.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Longfin's Acquisition of Ziddu.com\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On December 15, 2017, two days after public trading began, Longfin announced that on December 11, it had acquired \"Ziddu.com,\" an entity at least 92%-owned by Meenavalli. Longfin had not disclosed to the SEC during the Regulation A+ process that it intended to make this acquisition. Longfin publicly represented that Ziddu.com had expertise in blockchain and\n   cryptocurrency technology. It stated that Ziddu.com was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   a Blockchain technology empowered solutions provider that offers Microfinance Lending against Collateralized Warehouse Receipts in the form of Warehouse Coins to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), processors, manufacturers, importers and exporters using crypto currencies across continents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Longfin's stock price and trading volume sky-rocketed. That day, December 15, Longfin's stock closed at $22.01/share, more than four times the previous day's closing price. On December 18, 2017, Longfin's stock price reached a high of $142.82/share before closing at $72.38/share, which valued Longfin at over $3 billion. Over the next few months, Longfin shares generally traded in the $40-$60/share range. Longfin later advised the SEC that Ziddu.com had no revenue historically and its carrying value was zero.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Altahawi's Continued Actions on Behalf of Longfin\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On December 18, 2017, Altahawi sent an e-mail to Colonial Transfer directing the issuance of 2.5 million Longfin shares to the entities owning Ziddu.com.

First, Altahawi relies on the Rule 144 safe harbor, and alternatively, he relies on Section 4(a)(1) itself. The analysis for each of these exemptions differs depending on whether Altahawi was a Longfin affiliate at the time he acquired the Consulting Shares or for a relevant period of time thereafter.

These three attributes are hallmarks of an affiliate status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Securities Act Release No. 7391,\n   <em>\n    Revision of Rule 144, Rule 145, and Form 144\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%2070601\">\n    1997 WL 70601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4-5 (Feb. 20, 1997) (\"Many practitioners ... use [these] criteria as a guide.\"). Assuming each of those assertions is so, his personal management of the entire DPO process and his control of the public float in Longfin shares gave him an equivalent degree of control to qualify as an affiliate. The affiliate test is fact-specific, and in these circumstances, Altahawi is likely to be found an affiliate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   2. Rule 144's Requirements for Selling Restricted and Control Shares\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Rule 144 provides two distinct sets of requirements for selling \"restricted\" or \"control\" shares. Each of these categories also has different requirements, depending on whether the seller is an affiliate or a non-affiliate. Application of the requirements for the sale of restricted stock will be sufficient to analyze Altahawi's sale of his Consulting Shares; the requirements for the sale of control shares impacts the analysis of Altahawi's sale of the Private Transaction Shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 144, restricted securities include \"[s]ecurities acquired directly or indirectly from the issuer, or from an affiliate of the issuer, in a transaction or chain of transactions not involving any public offering.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20230.144\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). Control securities, by contrast, arise from the definition of an affiliate in Rule 144. Rule 144(b)(2) provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   Any affiliate of the issuer, or any person who was an affiliate at any time during the 90 days immediately before the sale, who sells restricted securities,\n   <em>\n    or any person who sells\n   </em>\n   restricted or\n   <em>\n    any other securities for the account of an affiliate of the issuer of such securities\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    or any person who sells\n   </em>\n   restricted or\n   <em>\n    any other securities for the account of a person who was an affiliate at any time during the 90 days immediately before the sale\n   </em>\n   , shall be deemed not to be an underwriter of those securities within the meaning of section 2(a)(11) of the Act if all of the conditions of this section are met.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20230.144\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Thus, Rule 144 provides limitations on the sale of two classes of securities held by affiliates (and those who were affiliates within the 90 days before their sale of securities): an affiliate's sale of restricted securities, and the affiliate's sale of \"any other securities\" that are sold for them.

If it is a reporting company for the previous 90 days, then the holding period is six months. Otherwise, it is one year. In either case the holding period begins to run from the payment of full consideration.

Application to Consulting Shares\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Altahawi's Consulting Shares were restricted shares under the terms of\n   Rule 144(a). They were acquired directly from Longfin, and outside any public offering.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   As restricted securities, they could not be sold unless Longfin was in compliance with its \"current public information\" reporting requirements. It is undisputed that Longfin did not file the necessary Exchange Act reports, including its 10-Q within 45 days of the November 24 registration of its shares under the Exchange Act. Indeed, Longfin did not begin to comply with its Exchange Act reporting requirements until it filed a 10-K report on April 2, 2018. Because the SEC has shown that Longfin did not file the required reports, it is unnecessary to address the other requirements for selling restricted shares that apply to the sale of the Consulting Shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Altahawi's arguments for why Longfin was in compliance with its reporting obligations are without merit. First, Altahawi contends that financial statements need not be included in a registration statement for a Regulation A+ offering. But, Rule 13a-13 does not tie its filing requirements to any requirement or lack of a requirement that financial data be included in the registration statement. Rule 13a-13 provides that, to the extent financial statements are not included in the registration statement, the company must report updated financial information on a quarterly basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Second, Altahawi claims that he had conversations with an SEC attorney in January and February 2018 in which he was advised that Longfin was in compliance with its reporting obligations\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   and was never advised that Longfin was out of compliance with those obligations. The SEC also apparently issued a comment letter to Longfin dated February 27, 2018,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which the SEC did not mention that Longfin was out of compliance with its periodic reporting obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Altahawi's argument is essentially one for equitable estoppel.

One-Year Waiting Period\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Altahawi makes one additional argument in support of the legality of his sales of the Consulting Shares.

As explained above, it is likely that the trier of fact at trial will conclude that Altahawi was an affiliate of Longfin. But, even if Altahawi were not an affiliate, he did not comply with the one-year holding period before selling his Consulting Shares. Altahawi contends he acquired his Longfin shares when he entered into his Agreement with Longfin on February 1, 2017, which is more than one year before he began to sell the Consulting Shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   A person acquires shares by purchase for the purposes of Rule 144 only when the \"full purchase price or other consideration is paid or given by the person acquiring the securities from the issuer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20230.144\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3).

This conclusion is compelled by the terms of the Agreement itself, as well as by the statements Longfin made to the SEC. Altahawi was retained as a consultant to obtain qualification for Longfin's DPO, among other tasks, which occurred on June 16, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Altahawi, in support of a February 1, 2017 acquisition date, points to statements made by Meenavalli to Longfin's stock transfer agent on March 6, 2018 to the effect that Altahawi's shares were fully earned by February 1, 2017. These statements do not override the terms of the Agreement, which in any event was an integrated contract. Meenavalli's statement is also inconsistent with the nature of the transaction. It would make no sense for Longfin to enter into an arrangement whereby Altahawi had fully earned the Consulting Shares on February 1, 2017, even if he chose not to perform any future services for the company. Accordingly, the earliest possible date on which Altahawi could prove that he acquired his shares was June 16, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Because Altahawi did not acquire the Consulting Shares until, at the very earliest, June 16, 2017, he did not hold the shares at least one year before he sold them in March 2018. Under Rule 144, in order to sell the Consulting Shares as a non-affiliate in less than a year after acquisition, Longfin would have had to be in compliance with its Exchange Act reporting requirements. As discussed above, it was not. The SEC is likely to show, therefore, that Altahawi's sales of the Consulting Shares did not comply with Rule 144 even if he is deemed to be a non-affiliate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   6. Section 4(a)(1) Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Altahawi contends that even if he does not qualify for Rule 144's safe harbor, his sales of the Consulting Shares are exempt under Section 4(a)(1) itself. But, as explained above, it is likely that Altahawi will be found at trial to have been an affiliate of Longfin for Rule 144 purposes. If so, he will be deemed an \"issuer\" for the purpose of the definition of an underwriter under Section 2(a)(11).\n   <em>\n    Kern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1550596\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/425/143/#p148\">\n    425 F.3d at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That is, the courts look to whether the security holder has held the securities long enough to negate any inference that his intention at the time of acquisition was to distribute them to the public.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   There is abundant evidence that Altahawi always intended to sell the Consulting Shares and not to hold them as an investment. First, there was no effective public market for the Longfin shares until December 2017, when trading began on the NASDAQ. Thus, he had no market for his shares until that date. Altahawi began to sell the Consulting Shares not long thereafter, on a date in March which was six months to the day after he had arranged for the shares to be issued to him. Because the Rule 144(d) six-month holding period expired on that day, this strongly indicates that Altahawi intended from the time he received them to distribute his shares rather than invest in them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, Altahawi's business is apparently to act as a consultant for Regulation A+ offerings, earning his income from that work. He has not asserted that his business is to become a long-term investor in the companies for which he consults. Finally, Altahawi worked in February 2018 to have the restricted designation removed from the Consulting Shares. He hired a lawyer, obtained an opinion letter, and arranged for Meenavalli to confirm to Colonial Transfer that the shares were fully earned as of the date the Agreement was executed, which was February 1, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Notably, in his declaration, Altahawi never claims that he took the shares of Longfin with an investment purpose. Nor does he attempt to set out any change of circumstance that required a speedier than originally contemplated sale, a circumstance that might entitle him to an exemption under the statute. Although subjective\n   statements of intent, standing alone, would likely not suffice to meet his burden to show his intent to acquire for an investment purpose, the absence of any attempt to make that showing confirms that Altahawi will likely be found at trial to be an underwriter under Section 5, even if not found to be an affiliate of Longfin. The proceeds from the sales of the Consulting Shares will therefore remain frozen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Altahawi's Private Transaction Shares\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The next tranche of assets the SEC seeks to freeze are assets derived from Altahawi's sale of his Private Transaction Shares. The Private Transaction Shares were among the shares purportedly issued by Longfin to twenty-four individuals on December 6, 2017. Altahawi asserts that he acquired 121,000 of those December 6 Shares from ten individuals on January 12, 2018. He sold them in January and February 2018 over the NASDAQ. Like the Consulting Shares, these shares were not sold pursuant to a Securities Act registration statement, and therefore, the SEC has carried its initial burden of showing a violation of Section 5. Altahawi contends that the shares were purchased pursuant to the Regulation A+ offering, and thus that the shares were not restricted securities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether or not Altahawi is found to be an affiliate, Altahawi's sale of these shares likely violated the securities laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   In the first instance, because Altahawi is likely to be deemed an affiliate, even if the shares were originally acquired pursuant to the Regulation A+ offering, when they came into Altahawi's possession they became \"control\" securities under Rule 144. As such, in order to resell the shares pursuant to Rule 144's safe harbor, among other things, Longfin had to be current in its Exchange Act filings and Altahawi had to provide appropriate notice to the SEC. Neither requirement was met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Because Altahawi sold at least some of the Private Transaction Shares before 90 days had expired since Longfin became an Exchange Act reporting company on November 22, 2017, the \"current public information\" requirement under Rule 144 differs somewhat from the analysis just conducted with respect to the Consulting Shares. As described above, the 90-day period called for by Rule 144(c)(1) ended on February 22, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Rule 144 precludes the sale of control shares in an issuer that is required to file Exchange Act reports until 90 days following registration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, as to any sales of the Private Transaction Shares that occurred before February 22, 2018, there was no \"current public information.\" For the sales which took place after February 22, 2018, for the reasons described in the discussion of Altahawi's sales of the Consulting Shares, Longfin was delinquent in its reporting obligations. Accordingly, the current public information requirement would not be satisfied as to these sales either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Even if Altahawi is not found at trial to be an affiliate, however, Altahawi is unlikely to show that the Private Transaction Shares were acquired through a Regulation A+ offering. Accordingly, the Private Transaction Shares would have been restricted shares, for which at least two provisions of Rule 144 were not complied with: the current public information requirement\n   and the holding period, as already described.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Meenavalli claims that each of the ten individuals from whom Altahawi acquired the Private Transaction Shares had themselves purchased their shares from Longfin through its Regulation A+ offering and paid Longfin directly for those shares. But, there is no documentation to show that Longfin received any payment for those shares.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the notation on the control log reflects that these shares were restricted, suggesting that these shares were not acquired pursuant to the Regulation A+ offering. The circumstantial evidence suggests that the December 6 Shares were issued as part of a calculated effort designed by Altahawi to obtain a listing on the NASDAQ and were not bona fide sales by Longfin. As reflected in e-mails, the twenty-four individuals' subscription agreements were packaged together, apparently in connection with providing a shareholder list to the NASDAQ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Altahawi has also not explained how he managed to purchase these shares from ten separate individuals living in India by obtaining their signatures on the same piece of paper, much less why they agreed to sell the shares at below-market value. Nor has Altahawi provided documentation to confirm he paid even this below-market price for the shares.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   At bottom, the burden is on Altahawi to produce evidence showing that the ten individuals purchased their shares pursuant to the Regulation A+ offering, which he has failed to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Because Altahawi is unlikely to show that the Private Transaction Shares were acquired in the Regulation A+ offering, they were obtained directly from the issuer outside of any public offering, and thereby were restricted shares under Rule 144.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Altahawi acquired the shares from the ten individuals, they remained restricted under Rule 144.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20230.144\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(i). As restricted shares, Altahawi's sales of the shares needed to comply with the current public information requirement and the applicable holding period. The shares were not held for even six months, and the current public information requirement was not satisfied for the reasons described above. Accordingly, Altahawi is unlikely to establish that his sales of the Private Transaction Shares complied with Rule 144, even if he is a non-affiliate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Tammineedi and Penumarthi\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   There are two sets of shares at issue with respect to defendants Tammineedi and Penumarthi. Both acquired and sold December 6 Shares, and Tammineedi sold shares purchased through the Source Media account. The SEC has frozen proceeds from the sales of both sets of shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   1. The December 6 Shares\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The SEC has established that it is likely to succeed in showing that Tammineedi and Penumarthi sold unregistered shares in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act when they sold shares they\n   acquired on December 6, 2017. Again, there was no Securities Act registration filed by Longfin and the other elements of a Section 5 violation are likewise undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Tammineedi and Penumarthi have not shown that their sales of Longfin shares in December 2017 and January 2018 were protected by Rule 144's safe harbor, or that they are entitled to an exemption under Section 4(a)(1) of the Securities Act. There is strong evidence that their December 6 Shares were acquired directly from the issuer outside the Regulation A+ offering. There is no documentary evidence that either defendant paid for their December 6 Shares. Their subscription arrangements were apparently driven by the desire to provide the NASDAQ with a shareholder list and thereby meet the NASDAQ's listing requirements. Their shares are in fact marked on the control log as restricted shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Tammineedi and Penumarthi's explanations for how they paid for their shares are unlikely to be found credible. Penumarthi claims that he became aware Longfin was contemplating an IPO, and purchased 40,100 shares pursuant to two subscription agreements. He then says that he\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   paid Longfin Corp. for the shares by transferring from my personal funds borrowed from Adarsh Global Pvt Limited and paid to Stampede Enterprises Limited on August 18, 2017. Stampede confirmed to me that my funds are received by Longfin Corp, Bank on September 1, 2017. I have filled my subscription form and applied on September 2, 2017. And received my shares on December 6, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Penumarthi has not produced any documentation supporting these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Similarly, Tammineedi claims that he purchased his shares with funds transferred to him from Kling Enterprises Limited and that he used those funds to pay Stampede Enterprises Limited in March 2017. He then claims that Stampede was to remit the money on his behalf after the DPO qualification. He also says that Stampede Enterprises Limited confirmed to him that they remitted the funds to Longfin on July 18, 2017. Again, he has produced no documentation to that effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Moreover, both of these defendants purchased at least a small number of shares from Longfin in the normal course, with their payments recorded in the Colonial Transfer records, without resort to the roundabout method they purportedly used to acquire the December 6 Shares marked as restricted. Accordingly, it is likely that the trial will establish that both Tammineedi and Penumarthi acquired the shares outside the Regulation A+ offering, and that their shares were restricted shares under Rule 144.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   As restricted shares, under Rule 144, Penumarthi and Tammineedi were required to hold the December 6 Shares for a minimum period of one year, as described above. Because the December 6 Shares were clearly not held the required one-year period, the sales were not protected by Rule 144.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   The SEC also contends that both Tammineedi and Penumarthi are affiliates of Longfin. A finding that they were affiliates would provide additional grounds for freezing the proceeds of their sales of the December 6 Shares. The record for this hearing provides strong support for finding that each of them was an affiliate of Longfin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Tammineedi is a director of Stampede Capital Limited, a company that Meenavalli founded and that is Longfin's largest shareholder. Stampede Capital Limited owns well over 10% of Longfin's shares, and Meenavalli himself has a substantial interest in Stampede Capital Limited.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Tammineedi and Meenavalli are frequent business colleagues and close associates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Penumarthi acknowledges that he has worked as a consultant for Longfin. He has identified himself as well as a Director of Longfin's UK operations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Penumarthi grew up with Meenavalli and appears to have been a previous business partner of his.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Finally, Penumarthi and Tammineedi do not attempt to demonstrate compliance with Section 4(a)(1) of the Securities Act beyond their claim of compliance with Rule 144. Given the minimal length of time between their acquisition of the December 6 Shares and their resale of those shares, they would not be able to establish that the shares were not acquired with a view to distribution. Accordingly, the proceeds of their sales of the December 6 Shares will remain frozen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   2. The Source Media Shares\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   The SEC is also likely to establish that Tammineedi was ineligible to sell the shares he purchased through his company, Source Media, shortly before the Ziddu.com announcement. The analysis turns on whether Tammineedi was an affiliate of Longfin. It is undisputed that the shares were acquired on the public market by Tammineedi, and sold thereafter. Based on the facts outlined above, the SEC is likely to show that Tammineedi was an affiliate of Longfin at the time he purchased the shares.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Although the Source Media Shares were acquired on the public market, once an affiliate of Longfin acquired them, they became control shares under Rule 144. As control shares, in order to make a sale of these shares legal, Longfin had to have \"current public information\" filed with the SEC and Tammineedi had to provide notice to the SEC. For the reasons described above, there was no current public information filed, and it is undisputed that Tammineedi did not provide the required notice to SEC. And, as an affiliate, Tammineedi is ineligible for the Section 4(a)(1) exemption. Therefore, the proceeds from the sale of the Source Media Shares will remain frozen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   The SEC's April 4, 2018 motion for a preliminary injunction is granted with respect to defendants Altahawi, Tammineedi, and Penumarthi.
