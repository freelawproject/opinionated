KELLY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Blessing Ekemezie worked as a pharmacist for CVS Pharmacy, Inc. (\"CVS\") for twenty-five years, until she was fired on September 12, 2015. She claims that her firing violated federal and District of Columbia law for several reasons, including that it breached the collective bargaining agreement governing her employment and that it was the product of unlawful age- and race-based discrimination. CVS, for its part, asserts that the firing was justified by repeated instances of poor performance. Ekemezie also claims that her union, United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Local 400 (\"Local 400\"), improperly declined to pursue a grievance on her behalf against CVS. Local 400 has moved to dismiss her \"hybrid \u00a7 301/fair representation claim\" as time-barred, and CVS has moved for partial judgment on the pleadings on the same ground. For the reasons explained below, these motions will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For purposes of this decision, the Court takes as true the allegations in Ekemezie's Amended Complaint. Ekemezie worked at CVS\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for twenty-five years. ECF No. 12 (\"Am. Compl.\") \u00b6 6. For eighteen of these years, she served as \"Pharmacist in Charge\" at a CVS location.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Starting in May 2015, Ekemezie's newly-hired manager began to criticize her performance on the basis of multiple customer complaints,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 23, mishandling of records,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80, and a failure to follow prescription-verification measures designed to ensure patient safety,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 82-83. The manager also claimed that productivity at the store had increased while Ekemezie was on vacation.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. On September 12, 2015, the manager terminated Ekemezie after she once again failed to follow the prescription-verification procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 90. Ekemezie alleges that CVS's asserted grounds for her termination were pretextual and that she was actually terminated because of her race and age and because, as a long-tenured employee, she enjoyed a high salary that made her costly to retain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Three days after her termination, on September 15, 2015, Local 400 filed a grievance on Ekemezie's behalf against CVS, alleging that her dismissal was without cause and thus violated the collective bargaining agreement. Pl.'s Ex. B.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Five months later, on February 22, 2016, Local 400 sent a letter to Ekemezie informing her that CVS had offered to settle her grievance for just over $30,000. Pl.'s Ex. C. Local 400 \"strongly recommend[ed]\" she accept the settlement because her \"case lack[ed] sufficient merit to proceed to arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The letter explained that, if Ekemezie chose \"not to accept this offer within 30 days,\" Local 400 would \"be forced to withdraw [her] grievance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ekemezie did not accept the settlement. Am. Compl. \u00b6 150. On March 23, 2016, Local 400 informed Ekemezie that it had reviewed her case thoroughly and \"there [was] not sufficient basis to warrant arbitration or pursuing [her] grievance further.\" Pl.'s Ex. F. In the same letter, Local 400 stated that it would \"consider the matter closed\" unless she provided \"newly discovered evidence concerning [her] grievance\" within seven days.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On March 25, 2016, Ekemezie sent Local 400's Executive Board a letter appealing the decision. Pl.'s Ex. G. After hearing nothing for almost two months, Ekemezie sent a follow-up letter on May 21, 2016, reattaching her original appeal. Pl.'s Ex. I. On May 31, 2016, Local 400 informed Ekemezie that the Board would consider her appeal and respond as soon as it had made a decision. Pl.'s Ex. H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In a letter dated July 19, 2016 (the \"July 19 Letter\"), Local 400 again informed Ekemezie that \"there [was] not sufficient basis to warrant arbitration or pursuing [her] grievance further\" and that unless she contacted Local 400 \"in writing within the next 7 days to provide [it] with any newly discovered evidence concerning [her] grievance,\" it would \"have to consider the matter closed and [would] take no further action.\" Pl.'s Ex. J. Ekemezie received the letter on July 30, 2016, when she returned\n   from vacation. Am. Compl. \u00b6 155.

On August 8, 2016, Ekemezie sent Local 400 a follow-up letter asking for information about the basis for the Executive Board's decision not to arbitrate on her behalf and how she could further appeal it. Pl.'s Ex. K. On August 29, 2016, Local 400 responded to Ekemezie's questions in a letter describing the previous actions taken on her behalf, outlining Local 400's grounds for not pursuing the matter further, and informing her that \"[t]here are no other internal appeal processes available.\" Pl.'s Ex.

Here, any reasonable person would have concluded that Local 400 had stopped processing Ekemezie's grievance after she failed to reply with new information by July 26, 2016, seven days after the July 19 Letter. Therefore, she should have known by July 30, 2016 that her claim had accrued. Because she filed suit on February 28, 2017, more than six months later, her claim is untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ekemezie offers two grounds for tolling the statute of limitations. First, she argues that her efforts to exhaust the union's internal appeals process tolled the running of the statute of limitations until August 29, 2016, when Local 400 informed her that there were no further appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 17-22. Second, she argues that equity supports tolling the statute of limitations due to Local 400's own delay in processing her case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-17. Neither argument saves her claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   First, Ekemezie's pursuit of a further intra-union appeal after July 30, 2016, is not a basis for tolling the six-month statute of limitations. The D.C. Circuit, citing out-of-circuit case law, has suggested that efforts to exhaust internal union appeals could, at least potentially, toll the limitations period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Emory v. United Air Lines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058776,3664916\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/915/\">\n    720 F.3d 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 931 (D.C.

However, neither Ekemezie nor Defendants assert that Ekemezie actually had additional intra-union appeals to pursue after July 30, 2016. To the contrary, the record shows that Ekemezie's first appeal, to Local 400's Executive Board on March 25, 2016, was her only appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In similar cases, courts have held that efforts to pursue fruitless follow-on appeals or motions for reconsideration do not toll the statute of limitations. In\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   , for example, a group of union members had filed an intra-union appeal.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10510602\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/20/720/#p729\">\n    20 F.3d at 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Seventh Circuit concluded that their initial appeal tolled the statute of limitations, but that further efforts to appeal would not. Once \"a union responds\n   to an appeal in a clear manner, continuing requests are not sufficient to toll the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10510602\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/20/720/#p729\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10510602\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/20/720/#p729\">\n    at 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Ekemezie argues that the doctrine of equitable estoppel makes her claim timely.

In the labor context, courts have found equitable estoppel where an employer not only represented that an employee's grievance was still being processed-which, on its own, would be insufficient-but also made \"affirmatively misleading statements that a grievance [would] be resolved\n   <em>\n    in the employee's favor.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Currier v.

Cir. 1998). Here, Ekemezie alleges Local 400 intentionally ignored her initial appeal and took longer than it needed to evaluate it. Pl.'s Opp'n at 14-15. Such delay, unaccompanied by misrepresentations, cannot estop Defendants from asserting the statute of limitations. Moreover, equitable estoppel tolls the statute of limitations for only so long \"as is necessary to prevent the defendant from benefitting from his misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Chung v.

Cir. 2003). Even if Local 400's delay in handling Ekemezie's appeal did constitute misconduct, tolling the limitations period past July 30-when Ekemezie concededly became aware of Local 400's decision on the appeal-would not be \"necessary to prevent the defendant from benefitting from his misconduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Nor is there any basis to conclude that equitable tolling, a related doctrine often conflated with equitable estoppel,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Currier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665888,1615461\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/159/1363/\">\n    159 F.3d at 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , can save Ekemezie's claim.

In this context, a mere failure to communicate with the plaintiff on the union's part is not enough.
