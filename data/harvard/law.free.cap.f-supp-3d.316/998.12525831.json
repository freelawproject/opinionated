Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Khalid Turaani commenced this action on December 20, 2017. Dkt. No. 1. In the Complaint, he contends that the Defendants improperly delayed (by three days) his right to purchase a firearm and constructively denied him that right.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The Defendants are an Unnamed FBI Agent, in his individual capacity, and the following individuals in their official capacity: Jefferson B. Sessions, III, the Attorney General of the United States of America; Christopher A. Wray, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; Charles H. Kable, IV, the Director of the Terrorist Screening Center; and Thomas E. Brandon, the Deputy Director, Head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Turaani asserts a defamation claim against the Unnamed FBI Agent in his individual capacity (Count I). He also maintains that the official-capacity Defendants violated his right to procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment (Count II); substantive due process under the Fifth Amendment (Count III); and equal protection under the Fifth Amendment (Count IV). Additionally, Turaani alleges that the official-capacity Defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 706 (\"APA\"), (Count V), and he asserts a claim for injunctive and declaratory relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2202 (Count VI).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 5, 2018, the official-capacity Defendants moved to dismiss Counts II-VI of the Complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Dkt. No. 10. Turaani responded to the motion on April 26, 2018. Dkt. No. 12. The official-capacity Defendants replied in support of the motion on May 23, 2018. Dkt. No. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Presently before the Court is the official-capacity Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Counts II-VI of the Complaint for Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction and Failure to State a Claim [10]. The Court held a hearing on this motion on Monday, June 4, 2018. For the reasons detailed below, the Court will GRANT the official-capacity Defendants' Motion to Dismiss [10]. The Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over certain claims asserted by Turaani. The Court also concludes that Turaani has failed to state a claim on Counts II-VI. That is, the Court will dismiss his claims regarding procedural due process (Count II), substantive due process (Count\n   III), equal protection (Count IV), the Administrative Procedure Act (Count V), and injunctive and declaratory relief (Count VI).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Additionally, as the claims against the official-capacity Defendants will not survive the motion to dismiss and the individual-capacity Defendant (the Unnamed FBI Agent) has yet to receive service, the Court will DISMISS Count I WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

According to Turaani, the constructive denial occurred through the store clerk's decision to halt the transaction until the FBI has confirmed that Turaani is not, or never was, the subject of an FBI investigation. Dkt. No. 1, p. 19 (Pg. ID 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First, Turaani plausibly pleads standing for the three-day delay because he alleges that the FBI called the store clerk and instructed the clerk to delay the transaction. This instruction obligated the store clerk to pause the transaction until the FBI had responded \"proceed\" or \"deny,\" or three days had passed from the delay response, whichever had occurred first.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2025.6\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 25.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(l)(iv)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Yet his allegation that the Government \"constructively denied\" his right to purchase a firearm is not fairly traceable to Government conduct. Turaani maintains that no law prohibits him from obtaining a firearm and that, after the three-day delay, the law permitted him to complete the transaction. Therefore, the store clerk's voluntary and independent actions have caused him harm, not Government conduct. This finding is fatal to Turaani's constructive denial claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   And as the Government argues,\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   is illustrative.

After categorizing the harm alleged, the\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   panel held that these plaintiffs lacked standing. The court reasoned that \"[s]everal of [p]laintiffs' alleged harms ar[ose] not from FFIs' acting under the command of [the contested regulations], but rather from the FFIs' voluntary choice to go above and beyond [the regulations].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264857\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/438/#p452\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264857\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/438/#p452\">\n    at 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"FFIs may do so,\" the court explained, \"by choosing not to do business with certain individuals, whether to protect their own interests in [regulatory] compliance or for some other reason.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264857\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/438/#p452\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264857\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/438/#p452\">\n    at 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A similar situation has transpired here. Like the\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs, Turaani pleads indirect harm. In particular, he maintains that the Government has \"constructively denied\" him the ability to purchase the firearm because the store clerk refuses to sell him the firearm. And here, as in\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   , all agree that the law is not forcing the store clerk to refuse Turaani's request. In other words, there is no dispute that Turaani may legally possess a firearm and that he was legally able to complete the firearm transaction once three days had passed from the delay response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The \"constructive denial,\" then, is solely the result of the store proceeding with an abundance of caution or, as the Sixth Circuit has stated, going \"above and beyond\" the law.

First, because Turaani appeared on a No Fly List or Watch List, the FBI would have delayed the firearm transaction regardless of any alleged due process violations.

Dkt. No. 1, p. 12 (Pg. ID 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Second, he fails to properly plead prejudice for the \"constructive denial\" claim. After the expiration of the three-day delay, the law permitted him to complete the firearm transaction. Therefore, as outlined in the Court's standing analysis, he does not assert prejudice from the official-capacity Defendants' conduct. Instead, he asserts prejudice from the store clerk's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Beyond prejudice, the relevant considerations also indicate that Turaani has not adequately alleged a procedural due process violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   1.

The three-day delay complied with federal regulations and did not violate his procedural due process rights.

The rule prohibiting such disclosures is clear and the FBI takes precautions to prevent these occurrences, including through limiting NICS access \"to the initiation of a NICS background check in connection with the proposed transfer of a firearm\" and having the FBI \"periodically monitor telephone inquiries to ensure proper use of the [NICS] system.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2025.8\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 25.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1), (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In light of the above, Turaani's procedural due process claim will not survive the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   C.

Turaani also argues that the official-capacity Defendants failed to comply with the APA (Count V), and he asserts as a standalone count a claim for injunctive and declaratory relief (Count VI). In response, the Government moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted [10]. The Court will GRANT the Motion to Dismiss [10]. In particular, the Court will find that Plaintiff lacks standing to raise claims regarding the constructive denial of his rights. Even though he has standing for other allegations of harm, his claims will not survive the Motion to Dismiss. On Counts II-VI of the Complaint, the Court will conclude that Turaani has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
