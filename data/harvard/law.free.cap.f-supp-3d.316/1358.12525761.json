(Doc. 81 (\"\n   <strong>\n    12(c) Motion\n   </strong>\n   \").) Plaintiffs Deborah L. and Kevin John Gallaher (collectively, \"\n   <strong>\n    Gallahers\n   </strong>\n   \") failed to respond. On review, the Court finds that the Motion is due to be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case stems from a state foreclosure action initiated by Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (\"\n   <strong>\n    Deutsche Bank\n   </strong>\n   \") related to a mortgage on the Gallahers' residential property (\"\n   <strong>\n    Foreclosure Action\n   </strong>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 64, \u00b6 2.) Following a failed mortgage mitigation process, Deutsche Bank completed foreclosure. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 43.) The Gallahers then objected to the foreclosure sale, which the trial court overruled, and they appealed to Florida's Fifth District Court of Appeal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 38.) The appellate court dismissed the appeal on December 27, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gallaher v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 5D17-3591, Doc. 142 (Fla. 5th DCA Nov. 13, 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the interim, the Gallahers initiated this action in state court, asserting several federal and state-law claims against Deutsche Bank, its loan servicers-Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing (\"\n   <strong>\n    Shellpoint\n   </strong>\n   \") and Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (\"\n   <strong>\n    Select\n   </strong>\n   \")-and the Association on December 7, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 2 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Initial Complaint\n   </strong>\n   \").) Invoking the Court's federal question and supplemental jurisdiction, Deutsche Bank, Shellpoint, and Select removed the action here on January 8, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1.) Following removal, all Defendants answered the Initial Complaint, and the Association brought a counterclaim against Mr. Gallaher for unpaid statutory assessments, interest, and attorney's fees under Florida law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 14, \u00b6\u00b6 17-28.) Because Mr. Gallaher failed to respond to the counterclaim, the Association moved for entry of default (Doc. 29), and a Clerk's default was entered on February 27, 2018 (Docs. 31, 33). To date, the Association has not moved for entry of default judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Despite their failure to respond to the Association's counterclaim, the Gallahers sought leave to amend their pleading, which the Court granted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 46, 61.) In their Amended Complaint, the Gallahers assert the same claims against Deutsche Bank, Shellpoint, and Select and include additional claims against the Association. (Doc. 64.) Thereafter, Plaintiffs settled their claims with Deutsche Bank, Shellpoint, and Select and moved the Court to drop these Defendants as parties, which the Court granted. (Docs. 85, 92.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Now, the Association remains the only Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Against it, the Gallahers bring claims for: (1) violating the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act (\"\n   <strong>\n    FCCPA\n   </strong>\n   \") (\"\n   <strong>\n    Count 5\n   </strong>\n   \"); (2) violating the Federal Debt Collection Practices Act (\"\n   <strong>\n    FDCPA\n   </strong>\n   \") (\"\n   <strong>\n    Count 6\n   </strong>\n   \"); (3) tortious interference with a contract (\"\n   <strong>\n    Count 7\n   </strong>\n   \"); and (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"\n   <strong>\n    Count 8\n   </strong>\n   \"). (Doc. 64, \u00b6\u00b6 62-88.) The Association answered the Amended Complaint (Doc. 73) and filed the 12(c) Motion (Doc. 81).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite the opportunity, the Gallahers failed to respond, and the 12(c) Motion is now ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Rule 12(c) provides that \"[a]fter the pleadings are closed ... a party may\n   move for judgment on the pleadings.\" A court may grant a 12(c) motion when \"there are no material facts in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Cannon v.

Palm Beach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11104815\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/250/1299/#p1301\">\n    250 F.3d 1299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1301 (11th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted). In ruling on such a motion, a court accepts as true all material facts alleged in the non-moving party's pleading and views those facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perez v. Wells Fargo N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340167\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/1329/#p1335\">\n    774 F.3d 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1335 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing\n   <em>\n    Hawthorne v.

When a 12(c) motion alleges that the complaint fails to state a claim, it is evaluated under the Rule 12(b)(6) standard for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strategic Income Fund, LLC v. Spear, Leeds &amp; Kellogg Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11394078\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/305/1293/\">\n    305 F.3d 1293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1295 n.8 (11th Cir. 2002) (noting that when the issue is plaintiff's failure to state a claim, the standard under 12(c) and 12(b)(6) are identical).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As it stands, the Gallahers have a single federal claim over which the Court has original jurisdiction-the FDCPA claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 64, \u00b6\u00b6 77-88.) This is significant because where a \"district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction, it may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over\" the remaining state-law claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Because the Court's decision to exercise its discretion depends on the success of the FDCPA claim, the Court begins there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Association first attacks the Court's subject matter jurisdiction over the FDCPA claim under the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under that doctrine, federal district courts lack jurisdiction to hear appeals from final state-court judgments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nicholson v. Shafe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3359903\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/558/1266/#p1268\">\n    558 F.3d 1266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1268 (11th Cir. 2009). To that end, the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine precludes review of claims that were raised in state court and those \"inextricably intertwined\" with that state-court judgment.\n   <em>\n    Casale v.

A federal claim is inextricably interviewed with a state-court judgment where: (1) the success of the federal claim would \"effectively nullify\" the state-court judgment; and (2) the federal claim \"succeeds only to the extent that the state wrongly decided the issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Springer v.

Fla. 2013) (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Contrary to the Association's argument (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 81, \u00b6\u00b6 9-14), the Gallahers do not ask the Court to invalidate or reject the state-court judgment concerning debt\n   <em>\n    owed to the Association\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, the Gallahers do not deny owing a debt to the Association. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 64, \u00b6 82.) Instead, they complain of the steps the Association took in its attempt to collect the \"weekly payments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82, 83.) Because resolution of whether the Association has transgressed the FDCPA is not contingent on review or invalidation of the Foreclosure Action's judgment, the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine is not implicated.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Solis v.

Accordingly, the Court exercises subject matter jurisdiction over the FDCPA claim. With this, the Court turns to the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Federal Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In a single count, the Gallahers allege that the Association contravened the FDCPA by violating: (1) \u00a7 1692e through false representation; (2) \u00a7 1692f through engaging in unfair practices; and (3) \u00a7 1692j(a) through furnishing deceptive forms. (Doc. 64, \u00b6 78.) The Association seeks judgment arguing that the Amended Complaint fails to state an FDCPA claim under any provision. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 81, \u00b6\u00b6 25-32.) The Court agrees with the Association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To plead a plausible violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1692e and 1692f, a plaintiff must allege, among other things, that the defendant is a debt collector.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pinson v.

Under the FDCPA, a \"debt collector\" is \"any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or\n   <em>\n    due another\n   </em>\n   .\" 15 U.S.C \u00a7 1692(a)(6) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This does not include creditors-a person collecting or attempting to collect a debt \"originated by such person.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872977\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/1211/#p1216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1692a(6)(F)(ii).

(Doc. 64, \u00b6\u00b6 82, 83.) From this, the Court cannot see how these \"weekly payments\" were owed to anyone other than the Association. Rather, this confirms that the Association was collecting its own debt.

Because the Gallahers fail to allege that the Association is a debt collector under the FDCPA, their claim fails to the extent it is based on a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1692e and 1692f.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Gallahers also allege that the Association violated the FDCPA under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692j(a). (Doc. 64, \u00b6 78.) Known as \"flat rating,\" \u00a7 1692j(a) makes it unlawful for any person to \"design, compile, and furnish any form knowing that such form would be used to create the false belief in a consumer that a person other than the creditor of such consumer is participating in the collection of or in an attempt to collect a debt such consumer allegedly owes such creditor, when in fact such person is not so participating.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692j(a) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sobers v.

Even so, the Gallahers' reliance on this provision is misplaced. The Amended Complaint fails to allege facts to support an inference that the Association designed, created, or furnished any form that would give the Gallahers the impression that anyone other than the Association was collecting or attempting to collect the weekly payments. Thus, this claimed violation of \u00a7 1692j(a) also fails.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sobers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20443651\">\n    2017 WL 443651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (adopting report and recommendation dismissing FDCPA claim based on \u00a7 1692j(a) violation where the complaint failed to plead sufficient facts suggesting the defendant engaged in flat rating). As the Gallahers have failed to bring the Association within the ambit of the FDCPA, the 12(c) Motion is due to be granted on that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Remaining State-Law Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   What remains then are the Gallahers' state-law claims against the Association for violating the FCCPA, tortious interference with a contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress (Doc. 64, \u00b6\u00b6 62-76, 89-107) and the Association's state-law counterclaim against Mr. Gallaher (Doc. 14, \u00b6\u00b6 17-28). Having disposed of the only federal claim over which it had original jurisdiction, the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over these remaining claims under \u00a7 1367(c)(3).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Novak v. Cobb Cty.-Kennestone Hosp.

Ga. 1994) (applying \u00a7 1367(c)(3) to remaining state-law claims after granting defendants' summary judgment motions on the plaintiff's federal claims). Accordingly, the Court remands Counts 5, 7, and 8 of the Amended Complaint and the Association's counterclaim to state court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Myers v. Cent. Fla.
