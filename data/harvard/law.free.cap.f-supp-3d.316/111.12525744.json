BACKGROUND</strong></p><p id=\"p-10\">The defendant is currently serving his term of imprisonment at a federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. <em>See</em> Gov't's Mot., Exhibit (\"Ex.\") A (Bureau of Prisons Inmate Locator Results for Leonard Forrest) (showing that the defendant is incarcerated at the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Terre Haute, Indiana). At the time of his arrest for the conduct underlying the criminal charges in this case, the defendant was on parole for prior criminal convictions under District of Columbia law. <em>Compare</em> Criminal Complaint, Ex. 1 (Statement of Facts) at 1 (indicating that the defendant was arrested on December 6, 2013), <em>with</em> Presentence Investigation Report at 19 (Feb. 19, 2015) (indicating that the defendant was paroled in connection with the District of Columbia convictions on May 10, 2013, with a parole expiration date of December 25, 2020). Consequently, on February 21, 2014, \"a parole violator warrant was issued [by the United States Parole Commission (the \"Commission\") ] ..., and [was] lodged as a detainer with the United States Marshal[ ]s Service\" (the \"February 21, 2014 detainer\"). <em><extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\"> at 19</extracted-citation>.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-11\">The defendant alleges that on or about August 9, 2016, he submitted a request to the Commission for removal of the February 21, 2014 detainer. <em>See</em> Def.'s Demand, Ex. 1 (Affidavit of Leonard Forrest (Nov. 16, 2017) (\"Forrest Aff.\") ) at 1. He further alleges that on October 12, 2016, the Commission responded to his request by letter, in which it \"acknowledge[d] [ ] that [it] had received the [request]\" and informed him that the request had been \"forwarded to the Case Service Office.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">,</extracted-citation> Ex. 1 (Forrest Aff.) at 1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The letter also allegedly <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"114\" href=\"#p114\" id=\"p114\">*114</a>\"stated ... that a decision would be made [by the Commission] within [forty-five] days.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">,</extracted-citation> Ex. 1 (Forrest Aff.) at 1. Additionally, it appears that the defendant also \"request[ed] a hearing in order to remove the detainer.\" <em>See</em> Def.'s Pet. at 20 (attachment to the defendant's petition is a letter purporting to be from the defendant to the Commission, but not reflecting a date or otherwise indicating that it was actually sent).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-12\">On October 4, 2016, the defendant filed his Petition in this Court, representing that \"because ... [the February 21, 2014] detainer w[as] not removed, [he is] not eligible for home-confinement [or] community release/halfway house [placement,] which would greatly assist [him] in returning as a productive member of society.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\"> at 1</extracted-citation>.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, on December 12, 2017, the defendant filed his Demand for a Speedy Disposition Review, in which he requests that the Court order the Commission \"to recall/dismiss/withdraw/close the warrant pending against him\" on the grounds that the detainer \"is greatly interfering with [his] rehabilitation efforts,\" \"[h]is ability to participate in [Bureau of Prisons] programs and educational classes,\" and his \"eligib[ility] for home confinement or ... to be moved to a lower custody facility.\" Def.'s Demand at 1-2. In his affidavit, the defendant additionally asserts that the Commission should remove the February 21, 2014 detainer in light of the fact that more than forty-five days have passed since the Commission sent him the October 12, 2016 letter acknowledging receipt of his request. <em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">,</extracted-citation> Ex. 1 (Forrest Aff.) at 1. The government having not responded to either of the defendant's submissions, the Court, on December 18, 2017, ordered the government to respond. <em>See</em> Order at 1 (Dec. 18, 2017), ECF No. 28. In compliance with the Court's Order, the government filed a motion requesting that the Court transfer the defendant's claims to the Southern District of Indiana. <em>See</em> Gov't's Mot. at 1.</p><p id=\"p-13\"><strong>II. DISCUSSION</strong></p><p id=\"p-14\">The government argues that because the defendant's \"claim[s] relate[ ] solely to the execution of [his] sentence and seek[ ] to shorten the duration of his confinement, [they] must be raised through a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\"> at 2</extracted-citation>. It further argues that because the defendant \"was at the time of filing confined ... in Terre Haute, Indiana, and ... remains confined there today, [his] ... petition cannot be considered by this Court[ ] because this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over the 'person having custody of the person detained,' as required by <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241</extracted-citation> [ (2016) ].\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\"> at 3</extracted-citation> (collecting cases). In response to the government's motion, the defendant argues that \"having a detainer removed has nothing to do with post[-]conviction relief\" because it \"does not get [him] out of prison sooner than [seventy] months,\" <em>see</em> Def.'s Resp. at 1, and that the Court may properly hear his <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"115\" href=\"#p115\" id=\"p115\">*115</a>claims because he is \"from the [D]istrict of Columbia[,] [ ] the U.S. Parole Commission is in Washington[,] D.C.[,] and [he] will be returning to Washington[,] D.C.,\" Def.'s Supp. Resp. at 1.</p><p id=\"p-15\">As an initial matter, the Court concludes that it need not resolve at this time the issue of whether the defendant's request for removal of the February 21, 2014 detainer may only be raised in a habeas petition, because although the defendant insists that his request for removal of the detainer \"has nothing to do with post[-]conviction relief,\" Def.'s Resp. at 1, he has not provided the Court with any legal authority that would otherwise permit the Court to grant or even consider the relief he is requesting.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, no other legal authority that would permit the Court to consider the defendant's request is readily apparent to the Court. Because a habeas petition under <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241</extracted-citation> is an available and appropriate remedy for the defendant's challenge to the detainer, <em>see, e.g.</em>, <em>United States v. Stewart</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4271705\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/148/38/#p41\">148 F.Supp.3d 38</extracted-citation>, 41 (D.D.C. 2015) (recognizing that \"[a]n inmate may seek habeas [relief under \u00a7 2241 ] to challenge a detainer lodged against him by an authority that would be his future custodian should the detainer be honored\" (citing <em>Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Ct. of Ky.</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11957617\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/484/#p486\">410 U.S. 484</extracted-citation>, 486-87, 488-89, 500-01, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11957617\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/484/#p486\">93 S.Ct. 1123</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11957617\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/484/#p486\">35 L.Ed.2d 443</extracted-citation> (1973) ) ), at least two other potential causes of action are foreclosed, including a petition for a writ of mandamus, <em>see</em> <em>Chatman-Bey v. Thornburgh</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5671738,10532803\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/864/804/\">864 F.2d 804</extracted-citation>, 806 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (\"Because ... habeas is an available and potentially efficacious remedy, it is clear beyond reasonable dispute that mandamus will not appropriately lie.\"), or a claim under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), <em>see</em> <em>Stern v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3417236\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/601/303/#p305\">601 F.Supp.2d 303</extracted-citation>, 305 (D.D.C. 2009) (concluding that the availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 precluded an APA claim because \"the APA does not allow a claim unless 'there is no other adequate remedy in a court' \" (internal quotation marks omitted) ). Therefore, in the absence of any other basis for considering the defendant's request, the Court will construe the defendant's request as a petition for habeas relief pursuant to \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-16\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"116\" href=\"#p116\" id=\"p116\">*116</a>Having construed the defendant's request for removal of the detainer as a request for habeas relief, the Court must determine whether this Court is the proper forum to consider that request. The government is correct that in general, the proper respondent in a prisoner's habeas challenge is a prisoner's immediate custodian, <em>see</em> <em>Rumsfeld v. Padilla</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p434\">542 U.S. 426</extracted-citation>, 434-35, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p434\">124 S.Ct. 2711</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p434\">159 L.Ed.2d 513</extracted-citation> (2004) ; <em>see also</em> <em>Blair-Bey v.

Cir. 1998), and district courts \"may not entertain a habeas petition involving present physical custody unless the respondent custodian is within its territorial jurisdiction,\" <em>Stokes v. U.S. Parole Comm'n</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9240290,3428503\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/1235/\">374 F.3d 1235</extracted-citation>, 1239 (D.C. Cir. 2004). However, the Supreme Court has instructed that \"a habeas petitioner who challenges a form of 'custody' other than present physical confinement may name as [a] respondent the entity or person who exercises legal control with respect to the challenged 'custody.' \" <em>Padilla</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p434\">542 U.S. at 438</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p434\">124 S.Ct. 2711</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-17\">Based on this Court's review of relevant case law, whether a challenge to a detainer constitutes a challenge to present physical custody, as opposed to some other form of custody, depends on the nature of the challenge. Specifically, if a prisoner seeks to attack the \"[e]ffect of a detainer,\" <em>i.e.</em>, \"the adverse impact created by the immediate custodian's imposition of a special 'form of custody' on the prisoner as a result of the filing of the detainer,\" <em>Norris v.

And, because this Court lacks territorial jurisdiction over that custodian, the government is correct that this Court is not the proper forum for this aspect of the defendant's challenge. <em>See</em> <em>Stokes</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9240290,3428503\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/1235/\">374 F.3d at 1239</extracted-citation>.

Construing the <em>pro se</em> defendant's submissions liberally, as the Court must, <em>see</em> <em>Atherton v. D.C. Office of Mayor</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3542139,3650663\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/567/672/\">567 F.3d 672</extracted-citation>, 681 (D.C.

As already explained, the proper respondent as to a prisoner's habeas challenge to the validity of a detainer may be \"the authority that issued the detainer,\" <em>Stewart</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4271705\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/148/38/#p41\">148 F.Supp.3d at 41</extracted-citation>, which, in this case, is the Commission. The government has not argued that the Commission is outside of this Court's territorial jurisdiction, and there is seemingly no reason to conclude that the Commission is beyond this Court's jurisdictional reach. <em>See</em> <em>Stewart</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4271705\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/148/38/#p41\">148 F.Supp.3d at 41</extracted-citation> (concluding that this Court had jurisdiction over a prisoner's challenge to the validity of a detainer issued by the Commission because the Commission is \"located in this [D]istrict, and the [government] d[id] not contest-thus waive[d]-th[e] Court's personal jurisdiction over the Commission concerning the habeas claim\"). Nor has the government argued that this District is an inconvenient or otherwise inappropriate forum for such a challenge. Therefore, the Court cannot conclude at this time on the existing record that it lacks jurisdiction to hear the defendant's habeas challenge to the detainer's validity.</p><p id=\"p-22\">Second, it appears that the defendant's Demand for Speedy Disposition Review, as its title implies, seeks to compel the Commission to conduct a disposition review of the February 21, 2014 detainer, <em>see</em> Def.'s Demand, Ex. 1 (Forrest Aff.) at 1 (asserting as grounds for removal of the detainer the number of days that have passed since the Commission allegedly acknowledged the detainer in its October 12, 2016 letter to the defendant).

CONCLUSION</strong></p><p id=\"p-28\">For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that it lacks jurisdiction to entertain the defendant's habeas challenge to the effect of the February 21, 2014 detainer on his current detention. However, the Court will hold in abeyance the government's motion to transfer pending further briefing from the government as to whether this Court has jurisdiction to hear the defendant's habeas challenge to the validity of the detainer and his request for mandamus relief to compel the Commission to conduct a disposition review.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-32\">In analyzing the issues presented in this memorandum opinion, the Court considered the following submissions: (1) the Letter from Leonard Forrest to the Court (\"Def.'s Resp.\") (Mar. 5, 2018), ECF No. 32; (2) the Defendant's Motion for Clarity Concerning United States' Motion to Transfer Petitioner's Pro Se Post Conviction Relief Pursuant to <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113</extracted-citation> (\"Def.'s Mot. for Clarity\"), ECF No. 33; and (3) the Letter from Leonard Forrest to the Court (\"Def.'s Supp. Resp.\") (Apr. 9, 2018), ECF No. 34.</p><p id=\"p-33\">Neither party has provided the Court with documentation of the February 21, 2014 detainer.</p><p id=\"p-34\">The defendant did not attach to any of his submissions a copy of the letter he alleges he received from the Commission on October 12, 2016, <em>see</em> Def.'s Demand, Ex. 1 (Forrest Aff.) at 1, and therefore, the Court can classify the defendant's representations regarding the letter's contents as only allegations.</p><p id=\"p-35\">Because the defendant's Petition and the documents attached to it were placed on this Court's docket as a single document, the Court cites to the defendant's Petition when citing to its attachments. Furthermore, because the defendant did not insert page numbers on his Petition, the page numbers cited by the Court when referencing the defendant's Petition are the automatically-generated page numbers assigned to the Petition by the Court's ECF system.</p><p id=\"p-36\">The defendant refers to multiple \"warrants\" in his Petition, <em>see</em> Def.'s Pet. at 1, but he has not identified these warrants, and the Court is only aware of the parole violator detainer issued against him on February 21, 2014, <em>see</em> Presentence Investigation Report at 19.</p><p id=\"p-37\">The defendant's Petition also \"ask[s] this [C]ourt for compassionate relief,\" Def.'s Pet. at 1, which the defendant has clarified as a request for modification of his term of imprisonment pursuant to <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582</extracted-citation>(c)(1)(A) (2016), <em>see</em> Def.'s Mot. for Clarity at 2. However, as the government notes, <em>see</em> Gov't's Mot. at 2 n.1, \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A) only permits a court to \"modify a term of imprisonment ... <em>upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons</em>,\" <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582</extracted-citation>(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added). No such motion from the Director having been filed with this Court, the Court lacks authority to modify the defendant's term of imprisonment pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A).</p><p id=\"p-38\">The Court notes that its decision to construe the defendant's request for removal of the detainer as a habeas petition does not conflict with the notice requirement imposed by the District of Columbia Circuit in <em>Chatman-Bey</em>, which requires that \"prior to <em>sua sponte</em> transfer\" of a habeas claim under \u00a7 2241, the Court must \"provide the habeas petitioner with both notice of the [ ] Court's anticipated action and an opportunity to set forth reasons why the case can (and should) properly be heard in this jurisdiction.\" <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5671738,10532803\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/864/804/\">864 F.2d at 814</extracted-citation>. Here, the defendant has had \"ample opportunity to 'set forth reasons why the case can (and should) properly be heard in this jurisdiction' by way of responding to the [government's] motion to transfer,\" and therefore \"no further notice to the [defendant] is required.\" <em>Stern</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3417236\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/601/303/#p305\">601 F.Supp.2d at 307</extracted-citation> (quoting <em>Chatman-Bey</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5671738,10532803\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/864/804/\">864 F.2d at </extracted-citation>814 ). In any event, for the reasons explained in this memorandum opinion, the Court will not transfer the defendant's request at this time, but will require further briefing from the parties, which will provide the defendant with yet another opportunity to oppose the Court's characterization of his claim and any transfer of that claim.</p><p id=\"p-39\">Although \u00a7 4214 has been repealed, the repeal does not become effective until November 1, 2018. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204214\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4214</extracted-citation>. Therefore, this provision remains in effect as of the date of this Order.</p><p id=\"p-40\">To the extent that the defendant also seeks to compel the Commission to hold an adversary parole hearing, <em>see</em> Def.'s Pet. at 20 (purporting to demonstrate that the defendant \"request[ed] a hearing\" on the February 21, 2014 detainer from the Commission), such a claim would fail.
