Plaintiff takes issue specifically with the FBI's decision to neither confirm nor deny the existence of his name on any watch lists. Defendant has moved for summary judgment, contending that it has fulfilled its FOIA obligations. Plaintiff has offered nothing to the contrary. Accordingly, Defendant's motion will be granted for the reasons explained more fully below, and Plaintiff's pending motions to compel, to expedite the proceedings, and to issue an order of protection will be denied as moot.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

He included his personal information and a signed Certification of Identity Form. By letter dated November 30, 2015, the FBI informed Plaintiff that a search of its Central Records System located no responsive records and invited him to provide \"additional [detailed] information ... that you believe was of investigative interest to the Bureau\" that might enable an additional search. Hardy Decl., Ex. B. The FBI added: \"In accordance with standard FBI practice and pursuant to FOIA exemption (b)(7)(E)/Privacy Act exemption (j)(2)..., this response neither confirms nor denies the existence of your subject's name on any watch lists.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Such a response is commonly referred to as a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff appealed the FBI's determination to the Office of Information Policy (\"OIP\") to the extent \"that some or all of my request cannot be provided because it is exempt under the [FOIA].\" Hardy Decl., Ex. C. Plaintiff requested reconsideration \"because: Suspicion of illegal activities by law enforcement personnel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   OIP affirmed the FBI's action in a letter dated January 6, 2016.
