INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs Center for Biological Diversity (\"CBD\") and Pesticide Action Network North America assert that the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") and its administrator Scott Pruitt (collectively, the \"Federal Defendants\") violated duties under the Endangered Species Act (\"ESA\") by failing to initiate or reinitiate consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service (the \"Services\") in the course of registering pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (\"FIFRA\"). Chemical and agricultural business organizations (\"Intervenors,\" or collectively with the Federal Defendants, \"Defendants\") have intervened as additional defendants. After the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part a previous order of this Court dismissing some of Plaintiffs' claims, Plaintiffs filed their operative Third Amended Complaint, and Intervenors and the Federal Defendants each filed a motion to dismiss. The Court heard argument on June 15, 2018. For the reasons discussed below, the motions are GRANTED in part but DENIED in large part. Plaintiffs may file a fourth amended complaint consistent with this order no later than July 20, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Court granted those motions in part, holding that Plaintiffs needed to identify more specifically the agency actions-in particular, reregistrations of particular products-on which they based their failure-to-initiate-consultation claims, but that Plaintiffs did not need to identify particular agency actions related to their failure-to-reinitiate claims.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Nov. 2013 Order (dkt. 192).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 13, 2014, the Court granted in large part Defendants' motions to dismiss\n   Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Aug. 2014 Order (dkt. 222).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court held that claims based on the EPA's issuance of REDs either warranted dismissal based on the statute of limitations or fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of appeals under FIFRA section 16(b), and thus outside the jurisdiction of this Court, because all REDs issued within the limitation period were subject to public notice and comment and thus constituted actions \"following a public hearing\" based on the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of section 16(b).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 15-17 (citing,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United Farm Workers of Am. v.

The Court again held that discretionary control over registered pesticides did not constitute agency action sufficient to require consultation under the ESA,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-19, and also held that the \"completion\" of all product reregistrations for a particular active ingredient was \"a mere fact\" and did not constitute an agency action distinct from the product reregistrations themselves,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.

While Defendants are correct that Plaintiffs must have\n   standing to challenge each action included in their complaint, Plaintiffs' allegations that their members have cognizable interests in species that may be affected by products containing all of the various active ingredients listed in the Third Amended Complaint are sufficient at the pleading stage.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , TAC \u00b6\u00b6 118-23 (allegations regarding Plaintiffs' members' interests in products containing 1,3-dichloropropene).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants argue that by grouping the various products by their active ingredients, Plaintiffs' allegations are inconsistent with their theory-and the Ninth Circuit's recognition,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12191749\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/1075/#p1081\">\n    847 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1093 -that the individual product approvals are separate agency actions based on considerations distinct from the analysis of active ingredients that the EPA conducts in the context of issuing REDs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Fed.

The fact that the products require individualized determinations for approval does not render implausible Plaintiffs' allegations that the EPA's approvals of products within each active ingredient group \"may affect\" (which is all that the ESA requires to trigger consultation) a list of endangered species susceptible to harm from the active ingredient used in each product.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , TAC \u00b6 118 (\"The list of species that may be affected by\n   <em>\n    products containing\n   </em>\n   1,3-dichloropropene is provided in Exhibit A....\" (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122 (\"[P]roducts containing 1,3-dichloropropene may affect the species identified in Exhibit A, as well as their identified critical habitat.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Intervenors argue that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged standing because certain products at issue were approved with conditions that would reduce the likelihood of them affecting certain species at issue. Intervenors focus on the GlyMix MT product, which is not approved for use in Puerto Rico, and contend that it would not affect the Puerto Rican crested toad, which is the species that Plaintiffs focus on as an example of harm that may be caused by products (like GlyMix MT) that contain the active ingredient 2,4-D.

The Federal Defendants similarly argue that Plaintiffs' prayer for nationwide relief is not tied to the specific species that Plaintiffs discuss as examples in their complaint, without addressing the additional species listed in Exhibit A that Plaintiffs allege may be affected by the products at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

After this Court held that original complaint lacked sufficient specificity and that (as the Ninth Circuit affirmed) ongoing discretionary control is not itself an agency action triggering a duty to consult under the ESA, and after the complaint underwent multiple rounds of dismissal and amendment based on those and other pleading defects, Plaintiffs eventually filed their operative Third Amended Complaint, in which the thirty-five failure-to-consult claims focus on the EPA's duties when registering or reregistering scores of pesticide products containing thirty-five of the active ingredients included in the original complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   While Plaintiffs' original claim, as originally pleaded, was not cognizable, \"the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out-or attempted to be set out-in the original pleading\" encompasses the conduct giving rise to Plaintiffs' present failure-to-consult claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B). The questions at issue in both the original complaint and the Third Amended Complaint are the extent to which the products containing the listed pesticide ingredients may affect endangered species, and the extent to which the EPA engaged in ESA consultation regarding those ingredients. Although the original complaint listed and focused primarily on pesticide ingredients rather than pesticide products, its references to \"registered pesticides\" and description of the registration process suggest an imprecise use of the word \"pesticide\" that encompassed both ingredients and products. Regardless, a claim based on the effects and approvals of active ingredients, framed as broadly as it was in the original complaint, would encompass the effects and registrations of products containing those ingredients, because individual pesticide products are the means by which the ingredients are used in practice and thus the means by which they affect (if at all) listed species. If Plaintiffs' original complaint had been allowed to proceed, it therefore would have required the Court to examine what products the EPA approved containing the ingredients at issue, whether those products \"may affect\" endangered species, and what if any consultation the EPA engaged in under the ESA regarding any such risks. All of those issues demonstrate \"a common core of operative facts\" shared by the original complaint and the Third Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ASARCO\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184905,5910604\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/999/\">\n    765 F.3d at 1004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the extent that the current complaint might require consideration of\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   additional evidence beyond what would have been relevant to the original complaint, Ninth Circuit precedent permits at least some variance: the addition of previously-excluded geographic scope to an environmental cleanup contribution claim in\n   <em>\n    ASARCO\n   </em>\n   would presumably have implicated new evidence pertaining to that area, as would the additional period of unpaid wages that the plaintiffs were permitted to\n   add in\n   <em>\n    Rural Fire Protection Co. v.

Here, rather than relying on an earlier complaint that alleged different registration actions, Plaintiffs seek to relate claims of specific registration and reregistration actions to the broader claim in their original complaint that more generally implicated the EPA's control over the pesticide active ingredients at issue, and thus necessarily encompassed the particular actions that Plaintiffs have now identified. Nor is this case like\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Boeing Co.\n   </em>\n   , where the Ninth Circuit held that a class action claim for compensation discrimination did not relate back to claims for promotion discrimination, hostile work environment, and retaliation because the new claim rested on both a different theory and different facts-in particular, statistical evidence of relative levels of compensation, which was not implicated by the earlier claims.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870525\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/517/1120/\">\n    517 F.3d 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1132-34 (9th Cir. 2008). As noted above, the evidence relevant to Plaintiffs' current claims for failure to initiate consultation regarding product registration or reregistration actions would have also been relevant to Plaintiffs' original claim for failure to consult regarding the EPA's broad and ongoing discretionary control of pesticide ingredients, which necessarily encompasses the product-specific actions now at issue, had such a claim been allowed to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court holds that the failure-to-consult claims in the Third Amended Complaint relate back to the original complaint filed on January 20, 2011.

While FIFRA's provision for review of pesticide registration decisions is also relevant here-particularly with respect to claims for review of decisions after a hearing, which the Court held, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of appeals under FIFRA section 16(b)-Plaintiffs cite no authority for the proposition that a claim\n   <em>\n    for violation of the ESA\n   </em>\n   may proceed without the notice required by that statute. It is not clear why both statutes should not apply to Plaintiffs' claims where there is no apparent conflict between their requirements, but even if only one could apply, the Ninth Circuit has \"held that 'when two jurisdictional statutes draw different routes of appeal, the well-established rule is to apply only the more specific legislation.' \"\n   <em>\n    CBD v.

The EPA, knowledgeable of its own procedures, was well aware that the process by which those ingredients were authorized for actual use culminated with registration and reregistration of particular products. It is telling that the Federal Defendants themselves do not join Intervenors' argument that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the product-specific claims fall outside the scope of the 2010 notice letter, instead arguing only that the letter is not effective as to subsequent registration actions. By asserting that the EPA \"failed to satisfy its ESA Section 7 requirements regarding registered pesticides,\" that such \"requirements apply to EPA's registration of pesticides,\" and that \"the consultation obligations of the ESA apply to EPA's registration of pesticides under FIFRA,\" and by asserting that particular active ingredients may affect endangered species, Plaintiffs provided sufficient notice of claims that the EPA was required to engage in consultation before registering or reregistering pesticide products containing those ingredients.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n Ex.

Courts have reached different answers to that question. The Third Circuit, in a CWA case, held that \"as long as a post-complaint discharge violation is of the same type as a violation included in the notice letter (same parameter, same outfall), no new 60-day notice letter is necessary to include these violations in the suit.\"\n   <em>\n    Pub.

The\n   <em>\n    Hercules\n   </em>\n   court based its reasoning in part on the rule that jurisdiction for citizen suits under the CWA requires a continuous or intermittent\n   violation, as opposed to \" 'wholly past violations,' \" and that such suits will therefore often involve conduct that continues or recurs past the date of a notice letter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415545\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/50/1239/#p1250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415545\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/50/1239/#p1250\">\n    at 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v.

If a defendant receives a proper notice letter alleging that it has failed to prepare and implement an adequate plan and, in response, prepares a new plan and begins to implement it before the complaint is filed, is the otherwise proper notice letter defective for failing to identify and discuss the new plan and its implementation? In those circumstances, must a citizen-plaintiff send a new notice letter? We think not. Subject matter jurisdiction is established by providing\n   a notice that is adequate on the date it is given to the defendant.

By sending their notice letter in May of 2010, Plaintiffs established subject matter jurisdiction for their claims that the EPA was required to consult under the ESA in authorizing the use of the pesticide active ingredients at issue. Such notice was sufficient to make the EPA aware of Plaintiffs' position, more clearly articulated in their subsequent amended complaints, that ongoing registration and reregistration of products containing those ingredients implicated the consultation requirement. Building from the holding above that notice was adequate as to product registration actions before the date of the notice letter, the Court holds that subsequent registrations of products containing the same active ingredients are sufficiently similar actions to fall within the jurisdiction established by the notice letter. Defendants' motions to dismiss based on the ESA's pre-suit notice requirement are DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Recognizing that other district courts have disagreed with this Court's conclusion regarding similar claims arising after a notice letter, and that a later determination on appeal that this Court lacked jurisdiction to hear some or all of Plaintiffs' claims would result in significant wasted resources by all parties and the Court in litigating those claims before such determination, the Court will permit Plaintiffs to file a fourth amended complaint subsequent to and referencing their December 19, 2017 supplemental notice letter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' counsel indicated at the hearing that Plaintiffs intend to do so.

The comments that Intervenors cite as purportedly \"recogniz[ing] that EPA was asking for comments on EPA's proposal to reregister individual...products\" in fact address whether products should be\n   <em>\n    eligible\n   </em>\n   for reregistration.

That argument does not appear in Intervenors' briefs and is not persuasive. The exclusive jurisdiction provision at issue appears in FIFRA, not the ESA, and applies to lawsuits challenging agency final actions under FIFRA. The relevant distinction for FIFRA section 16's jurisdictional bifurcation is whether the particular FIFRA action being challenged followed a public hearing. As discussed in this Court's previous order and the Ninth Circuit's opinion, Plaintiffs' now-dismissed claims impermissibly sought to set aside the REDs, which were actions following a public hearing, without complying with section 16(b)'s requirements for setting aside such actions. The fact that Plaintiffs could have commented at that time on the EPA's plan for consultation (or for a lack of consultation, as the case may be) does not transform the subsequent reregistration decisions, which are the separate FIFRA actions implicated by the present claims, into actions taken after a public hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Because Intervenors present no example of a notice and opportunity for comment on an actual reregistration decision, their motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' reregistration claims based on the exclusive jurisdiction provision of FIFRA section 16(b) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Mootness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Intervenors contend that claims related to products containing atrazine, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, methomyl, and simazine are moot because existing settlement agreements in other actions call for consultation regarding those active ingredients, the EPA has publicly committed to initiate consultation, and consultation has now concluded with respect to certain ingredients. Intervenors' Mot. at 14-17. Plaintiffs respond that stipulations filed in settling other cases explicitly disclaim any requirement that the EPA engage in nationwide consultation, and that while consultation has occurred as to some ingredients, the fact that the omission giving rise to the alleged violation has been corrected does not moot Plaintiffs' claims for relief that extend beyond merely initiating consultation, such as the request for injunctive relief vacating the EPA's authorization of the pesticides at issue until the EPA has complied with its obligations under the ESA. Opp'n at 29-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   While Intervenors are correct the Plaintiffs' claims assert that the EPA violated its obligation under the ESA only by failing to initiate or reinitiate consultation when it was required to do so, decisions by the Ninth Circuit support Plaintiffs' position that the appropriate measure of mootness is not whether the EPA has now taken that action, but whether any relief remains available for its alleged failure to do so at an earlier time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Neighbors of Cuddy Mountain v.
