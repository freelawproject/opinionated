This affirmation describes the contents of a telephone conversation he had with Christopher Wirth, a potential witness\n   identified during discovery,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem.) This evidence includes, among other things, sworn affidavits from Robert Leonard (\"Leonard\"), Defendant's Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, and Joseph Marley (\"Marley\"), Defendant's Officer of Purchasing, Mail Services and Security. (Def.'s Mem. 2-4, 9 (citing\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755360\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/51/414/#p418\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2 (\"Leonard Aff.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755360\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/51/414/#p418\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3 (\"Marley Aff.\") ).) Both of these affidavits include inadmissible evidence. Leonard's affidavit parrots Defendant's counterclaims verbatim, as does Defendant's memorandum.

Additionally, Leonard asserts, without identifying the basis of his knowledge, that \"[a]s a result of the conditions at the Premises, Defendant was deprived of its ability to conduct banking operations at the Premises in a continuous manner.\" (Leonard Aff. \u00b6 11.) Such a conclusory assertion is inadmissible in opposition to a summary judgment motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amnesty Am. v. Town of W.

Similarly, Leonard avers that \"it became clear that it would not be possible to remediate the mold infestation of the Premises without an extended closure of the branch,\" but does not explain the factual basis or his personal knowledge of this claim. (Leonard Aff. \u00b6 12.) Moreover, to the extent Defendant is offering Leonard's opinion regarding mold remediation, it is inadmissible lay opinion testimony, because\n   he has not been identified as an expert in this area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 701 (limiting lay opinion testimony); Fed. R. Evid. 702 (listing requirements for expert testimony);\n   <em>\n    Nimely v.

Other statements suffer from different defects. For example, Marley avers that he \"personally notified ... Cohen numerous times of the need for repairs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) However, this statement contradicts his earlier deposition testimony and will not be considered.

United Sewer cleaned the line and submitted an invoice to Defendant that said: \"Suspect line has issues, possible belly in line.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.)

Roto Rooter cleaned the sewer line and submitted an invoice to Defendant stating: \"Line is a good candidate for a liner.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) On March 23, 2016, Defendant again hired Roto Rooter to address an issue with the toilet and the sewer line. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.)

The day after the flood, Cohen called Defendant at the Premises and spoke to a female employee, who told him that everything had been corrected by the plumber. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 48.) Other than the call and the three voicemails, Marley could not recall any other communications with Plaintiffs about the toilet backup or flood. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.)

On December 23, 2016, Envirocheck, a mold assessment company, was hired to perform testing at the premises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) Envirocheck performed an assessment on December 28, 2016 and provided Defendant with a report on January 9, 2017 that included laboratory test results confirming the presence of mold at the Premises and contained a protocol for remediating the mold. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On January 18, 2017, ServPro informed Defendant that mold had been discovered\n   in other areas of the Premises not previously identified. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) On January 31, 2017, Envirocheck prepared a second report confirming the presence of additional mold and containing a protocol for remediating that additional mold. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) To remediate the mold required work to be performed exclusively on the interior of the Premises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) Plaintiffs were not provided with a copy of either of Envirocheck's reports and were not informed of the findings prior to March 31, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) After learning that ServPro discovered additional mold and after receiving Envirocheck's January 31, 2017 report, Defendant directed ServPro to cease all remediation work at the Premises.

Indeed, the second unit on the Property was rented to a deli on December 24, 2016, and the deli owner had experienced no problems with the sanitary sewer system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) On March 2, 2017, Defendant wrote to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\"), a federal agency that oversees savings banks, informing OCC that it had decided to permanently close its retail branch at the Premises due to \"repeated incidents that caused flooding of the interior\" and the \"presence of mold.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.)

(Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 67.) The identified \"hazardous environmental conditions\" are mold and sewage backups. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.) This letter was the first written notice Plaintiffs received from Defendant complaining of a problem at the Premises, and the first notice of any type-oral or written-that mold was discovered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.) Prior to March 31, 2017, Defendant had not complained or claimed that it had been actually evicted or excluded from any portion of the Premises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.) By no later than that date, Defendant had ceased operating its retail bank branch at the Premises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.) Therefore, on April 4, 2017, Plaintiffs notified Defendant that it had defaulted under the Lease.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.) The total amount of unpaid rent due under the Lease, discounted to net present value using a discount rate of 6%, inclusive of interest and late fees through November 15, 2017, is $912, 650.41. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.) This amount was calculated in an unrebutted expert report from Bruce Balsam, a Certified Public Accountant.

Plaintiffs also obtained two estimates to restore the Premises to the condition it was in immediately preceding Defendant's alterations to the Premises, the lesser of which is $36,000.

Second, Defendant cites the testimony of a Roto Rooter plumber, Richard Skjerli,\n   that, based on an unidentified or described \"video,\" the sewer line may have \"a belly or sag\" preventing the water from \"flow[ing] freely.\" (Def.'s Mem. 21 (citing\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 10 (\"Skjerli Dep.\") 48).) Even if this lay testimony describes when or how flooding occurs at the Premises, Defendant does not explain how this testimony shows that the needed repairs were \"necessary exterior or structural repairs,\" which exclude \"plumbing\" and \"sewage facilities.\" (Lease \u00a7 7.01.) That the flooding occurred with weather changes or that the sewer line had a belly does not create a dispute regarding whether the needed\n   <em>\n    repairs\n   </em>\n   were external or structural, rather than ones which could be performed exclusively inside the Premises. For example, although the lateral sewer line indisputably connects both units on the Property to the local sewer system, (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 9), Defendant provided no explanation, let alone evidence creating a dispute of material fact, as to the line's structure or what repairs were necessary to prevent internal flooding and toilet backups-both of which, standing alone, are merely plumbing problems with a fixture inside the Premises that, under the Lease, Defendant must repair, (Def.'s Mem. 14).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, it is undisputed that at least one sewer backup in 2012 was caused by the presence of \"rag and tampons\" in the sewer line, (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 31), before the second unit on the Property-and the only other unit connected to the sewer line-was occupied, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64), suggesting that it was Defendant's conduct, not a structural or external problem with the sewer line, causing the backups. And, after renting the other unit, the deli there experienced no problems with the sanitary sewer system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) Simply put, Defendant provided no context for the evidence it cites such that it could create a material dispute of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Payne v.

(Def.'s Mem. 9-10, 20.) Defendant first cites an e-mail from Wirth, an employee working at the Premises, to Marley, dated December 19, 2016, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   As per follow up with the flood this am.... Plumber here now snaking out pipes. He stated that there is sludge in pipes....

This email says nothing about what efforts were made to notify Plaintiffs, and specifically Cohen, regarding an issue with the pipes, let alone the sludge issue. To the extent Defendant is relying on the phrase \"Landlord is refusing to get it done\" to raise a dispute of fact regarding efforts to notify Cohen about the pipe sludge, this assertion simply lacks enough specific facts or other supporting evidence in the record to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wrobel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3513522\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/22/#p30\">\n    692 F.3d at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring a nonmovant \"to create more than a metaphysical possibility that his allegations were correct\" and instead requiring \"specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial\" (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted) );\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684610\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/255/#p266\">\n    554 F.3d at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring a nonmovant to oppose a motion for summary judgment that \"is properly supported by ... evidentiary materials\" with more than \"allegations\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Rather, it is undisputed that Cohen was informed about a toilet backup on December 18, 2016, and subsequently called a plumber to address the issue. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 45-46;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Marley Dep. 34-35 (describing Cohen's actions as \"responsive\" and \"helpful\" and stating that Cohen in\n   fact contacted a plumber); Def.'s Mem. Ex. 4 (email reply to the email in question from Marley to Wirth, stating that \"Landlord told me he was paying for the plumber\").) After the flood on December 19, 2016-the day the email in question was sent-Marley left Cohen two voicemails, and left another one the next day, \"to get an update\" on the flooding and the plumber. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 49; Marley Dep. 35-36; Marley Aff. \u00b6 6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cohen then called the Premises that next day, December 20, 2016, and spoke to an employee of Defendant, who told him the plumber had corrected everything. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 48.) Cohen was \"never contacted by anyone\" regarding ongoing problems at the premises afterwards, (Cohen Dep. 109;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 59 (same) ), and Marley, the witness designated by Defendant as to testify regarding \"[a]ny and all communications with Plaintiffs about the conditions\" at the Premises, \"including requests ... to ... repair,\" (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 44), is unaware of any other communication between Cohen and someone employed by Defendant regarding such conditions, (Marley Dep. 28-29, 31-32). Thus, the undisputed evidence, even construing the cited email in the light most favorable to Defendant, is that Cohen was contacted about a toilet clog issue, sent a plumber to fix it, and was told that the plumber had resolved all issues the day after the flood. No evidence even\n   <em>\n    suggests\n   </em>\n   he was contacted about a sludge issue requiring total replacement of the pipes or any other ongoing sewage issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The other evidence cited by Defendant is similarly unavailing because it fails to show what Plaintiffs were contacted about and when. For example, Defendant cites three maintenance e-tickets documenting internal complaints from employees regarding water and mold on the Premises. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. Ex. 5.) Although some of the maintenance responses indicate that someone would try to or did try to attempt to contact Cohen, they do not say what was communicated, let alone who was contacted by whom or when any such contact was made. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1 (responding to odor and mildew complaint on December 5, 2016 with \"Landlord has been contacted and cleaners will do what they can Friday night\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (responding to complaint about smell of mildew and water coming in on December 8, 2016 with \"We have called the Landlord.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (responding to complaint on December 19, 2016 about flooding and mold with \"The plumber and cleaner will be going here to take care of the issues at hand ... we'll be trying to further contact the landlord and finally get this issue taken care of so it doesn't happen again.... The plumber is also going to clear your line for the toilet so hopefully that doesn't get backed up again.\").) Indeed, the author of these maintenance responses testified that she did not recall ever communicating directly with Plaintiffs on any subject. (Pls.' Dep. 56.1 \u00b6 43.) Moreover, even assuming these notices create a dispute about whether Cohen was informed of the sewage and mold problems, it is undisputed that Cohen responded by hiring a plumber, and was told that this resolved the issue as of December 20, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-46,\n   48.) Thus, a reasonable trier of fact could not find that Cohen failed to repair the premises or was on notice that the problems continued based solely on these internal maintenance requests.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bostany v.

Under New York Real Property Law \u00a7 227, when a leased building \"is destroyed or so injured by ... any ... cause as to be untenable, and unfit for occupancy,\n   <em>\n    and no express agreement to the contrary has been made in writing\n   </em>\n   , the lessee ... may ... quit and surrender possession of the leasehold premises\" without liability for rent thereafter.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Real%20Prop.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    N.Y. Real Prop. Law \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Here, \u00a7 16.01 of the Lease states that if the Premises are \"rendered wholly untenantable,\" the \"Landlord may either [ (1) ] elect to repair the damage,\" provided it is not interior damage which the Tenant is responsible for repairing under the Lease, or (2) \"may cancel th[e] Lease by notice of cancellation,\" after which the \"Lease shall expire and Tenant shall vacate and surrender\" the Premises. (Lease \u00a7 16.01.) The Lease further provides that \"Tenant's liability for Rent upon the termination of th[e] Lease shall cease\" either the day following the casualty or when \"Tenant ceased to do business at the Demised Premises,\" and that, \"[i]n the event Landlord elects to repair the damage ... any abatement of Rent shall end upon the date\" the repairs are completed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, \"there shall be no abatement of Rent\" if the damage\n   was \"caused by the negligence of Tenant\" or an agent thereof. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And, \"[u]nless t[he] Lease is terminated by Landlord, Tenant shall repair and refixture the interior of the Demised Premises in a manner and to at least condition equal to that existing prior to its destruction or casualty.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Put simply, while the Lease provides Plaintiffs with the right to terminate the Lease in the event of a casualty damaging or destroying the Premises-such as flooding-it does not provide Defendant with a corresponding right to terminate. The only remedy the Lease provides Defendant is the abatement of rent during the period the Premises are untenantable. And, the Lease further indicates that if the Landlord does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   terminate the Lease in the event of such a casualty, Defendant is responsible for repairing the interior.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Mem.) Thus, to the extent that Defendant's counseled brief attempts to raise the argument that Plaintiffs failed to perform their obligations under the Lease, (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Mem. 10, 20), the Court finds it \"not sufficiently argued\" to merit independent discussion outside of the constructive eviction context.\n    <em>\n     Norton v.

While this statement acknowledges the potential necessity of such evidence, it comes too late. Defendant failed to submit a report or affidavit from this purported expert in opposition to the motion for Summary Judgment, and it is entirely unclear whether Defendant even identified this witness in discovery, as required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Similarly, Defendant cites the testimony of Skjerli, that, based on an unidentified \"video,\" the sewer line may have \"a belly or sag\" preventing the water from \"flow[ing] freely,\" (Skjerli Dep. 48), but makes no attempt to qualify this witness as an expert, (Def.'s Mem. 21).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Accordingly, Defendant's counterclaim for the money paid to ServPro for mold remediation also fails.
