Bucklo, United States District Judge\n   In the early morning hours of March 7, 2015, officers Matthew Lyons and Anthony Colon of the Village of Round Lake Park police department responded to a 911 call reporting that a woman had jumped from a window and was lying in the snow. The officers arrived at the scene and found the woman, later identified as Natasha Alexander, unconscious and bleeding. Plaintiff-Natasha's cousin-was in a car parked in the driveway of plaintiff's sister's house, a few doors down from where Natasha lay. Officer Colon spoke briefly with plaintiff, then asked her to get into Officer Lyons's squad car to get out of the cold. Plaintiff got into the car, and Officer Lyons pulled off, leaving Officer Colon at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   As Officer Lyons transported plaintiff to the police station, an argument erupted in the squad car, prompting Officer Lyons to pull over into the parking lot of a nearby restaurant and call for backup. Officer Colon and Officer Brandon Gullifor of the Village of Round Lake Police Department arrived at the scene, and together the officers removed plaintiff from the car and handcuffed her. Later, she pled guilty to domestic battery of Natasha and battery of Officer Lyons. Plaintiff brings this action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , claiming that the officers used excessive force during her arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before me are defendants' motions for summary judgment, which argue that on the undisputed record, the force they used was reasonable under the circumstances; and that even if the force the officers used was excessive, they are entitled to qualified immunity. For the reasons that follow, I conclude that even when all factual disputes are resolved in plaintiff's favor, the record would not allow a reasonable jury to find that defendants violated plaintiff's constitutional rights, and I grant summary judgment on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although the parties present starkly different accounts of the events culminating in the challenged use of force, I assume the facts are as plaintiff recounts them wherever the record reasonably allows.

The video recording begins as officer Gullifor pulls up behind Officer Lyons's parked squad car in the parking lot of The Pizza Place restaurant, where Officer Lyons had pulled over.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exh. D to Round Lake Park Def.'s L.R. 56.1 Stmt.; Pl.'s Dep. at 27. Officer Gulliver then approaches Officer Lyons's vehicle on foot, where one officer can be seen standing off to the side of the vehicle, while another officer not visible on screen can be heard arguing with plaintiff. Plaintiff can be seen and heard screaming obscenities at the unseen officer from within the vehicle. The officer tells her, \"I'm about two seconds away from cuffing you.\" Plaintiff responds, \"cuff me, cuff me motherf* * *er,\" and continues to scream obscenities. The standing officer then opens the rear passenger's side door, and plaintiff yells \"get your motherf* * *ing hands off me.\" An officer tells her, \"you gotta get cuffed,\" and she screams \"don't f* * *ing touch me\" then begins kicking the officer at the rear passenger door while continuing to scream. The officers can be heard to shout \"stop resisting!\" multiple times as plaintiff continues to swear and kick. The audio then cuts out as the video shows the officers pull plaintiff out of the car and onto the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Most of what occurs next is outside the range of the video camera. Still, two of the officers can be seen to struggle with plaintiff on the ground for approximately fifteen seconds. Thereafter, the two officers stand up while the third remains outside the camera's view. Several minutes go by, during which time an ambulance arrives. (The ambulance cannot be seen on the video, but its flashing lights can be seen in reflection off of the squad car). The officers then spend several minutes struggling to get plaintiff back into the squad car as she stands at the open rear passenger door, then sits partially inside, screaming obscenities at the officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the officers get plaintiff into the car and drive away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff was charged with multiple felony offenses based on the events of March\n   7, 2015.

Plaintiff does not dispute that the dash cam footage \"partially depict[s] some of the events in question,\" but she insists that it does not discredit her version of the facts, and that if her version is accepted, a jury could find that the force the officers used was excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   It bears emphasis that plaintiff does not challenge the legality of her arrest (other than the force the officers used), and indeed, she concedes that \"a claim ... for false arrest or malicious prosecution would not lie in this case.\" Pl.'s Resp., DN 62 at 2 n. 1. This is important because \"[a]n officer who has the right to arrest an individual also has the right to use some degree of physical force or threat of force to effectuate the arrest.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

By conceding that the officers had a right to arrest her, plaintiff distills the inquiry down to a single question: was the force the officers used reasonable under the circumstances? To answer that question, I consider several factors, including \"the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether [she] is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059182\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/936/#p944\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Graham v.

The undisputed record shows that the reason the officers took plaintiff into custody was her suspected involvement in a domestic battery-a violent crime. Plaintiff insists that she was not under arrest when she got into Officer Lyons's squad car and emphasizes that the officers neither restrained her nor patted her down at that time. But plaintiff does not explain how her arrest status is relevant to the first\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factor, which focuses on the nature of the suspected crime. At all events, plaintiff was clearly in police custody at least as of the time Officer Lyons refused her request to return to her sister's house,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terry v. Ohio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    392 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 19 n. 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968) (seizure occurs when officer \"has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen\"), and she does not challenge either the lawfulness of her detention or the officers' authority to arrest her and place her in handcuffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Moreover, even assuming that the officers did not know whether plaintiff was the aggressor or the victim in the suspected domestic battery, that ambiguity at\n   most neutralizes the weight of the first\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factor in defendants' favor; it does not tip the balance in plaintiff's direction. Meanwhile, the second and third factors-plaintiff's physical aggression towards the officers and her active resistance to their attempts to restrain her-are firmly in defendants' favor. Indeed, even accepting plaintiff's characterization of her demeanor while riding in Officer Lyons's squad car, the dash cam evidence establishes beyond reasonable dispute that by the time the officers attempted to restrain her, she was screaming and kicking at them and thrashing on the ground as they tried to handcuff her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff correctly observes that the videotape does not show a complete picture of the events. Still, any reasonable factfinder viewing that evidence would have to conclude that plaintiff actively resisted the officers' efforts to gain control over her. The Seventh Circuit acknowledges that an individual who resists arrest can pose \"an immediate threat\" to arresting officers.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059182\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/936/#p944\">\n    809 F.3d at 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming summary judgment of no excessive force where officers pushed plaintiff against his car and handcuffed him after he refused to comply with commands to turn around and put his hands behind his back during a traffic stop). Moreover, when considering the reasonableness of the force used, courts must \"remain cognizant of the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments-in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059182\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/936/#p944\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).

Unlike in these cases, plaintiff does not claim that the officers used a firearm, a Taser, or any other weapon on her, nor does she suggest what lesser force the officers might have used to gain control over her, given the nature of her active resistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   It is true that in\n   <em>\n    Payne v. Pauley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107579\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/767/\">\n    337 F.3d 767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2003), the Seventh Circuit reversed summary judgment for the defendant in view of the plaintiff's testimony that three officers \"grabbed,\" \"jerked,\" \"slammed,\" and \"forced\" her arm and wrist into handcuffs in the course of a half-hour struggle to arrest her, during which time she claimed she did not resist. While the force the plaintiff described in\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   is arguably comparable to the force at issue here, the circumstances of the two cases are different in several key respects. First, there was no videotape in\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   to discredit the plaintiff's claim that she \"volunteered to be arrested\" and did not argue with the defendant officer or resist arrest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107579\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/767/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107579\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/767/\">\n    at 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   court credited the plaintiff's testimony that she did not yell or swear at the officer, did not refuse to obey his orders, and did not engage in other conduct the defendant cited as a basis for probable cause. Second, because the\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   plaintiff challenged the\n   existence of probable cause, and the court concluded that the evidence warranted a trial on that issue, the court could not properly assume that the officers were entitled to use\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   force against the plaintiff. The latter distinction also obtained in\n   <em>\n    Chelios v. Heavener\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702670\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/678/#p689\">\n    520 F.3d 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 689 (7th Cir. 2008) (plaintiff entitled to trial on wrongful arrest claim).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059182\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/936/#p944\">\n    809 F.3d at 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (right to arrest an individual entails the right to use some force to effectuate arrest). Here, as noted above, plaintiff disclaims any argument that the arrest itself was wrongful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the videotape evidence \"blatantly contradict[s]\" plaintiff's testimony that she remained calm and did not yell or kick at the officers as they tried to remove her from Officer Lyons's squad car,\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059182\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/936/#p944\">\n    809 F.3d at 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and establishes that she actively resisted arrest in a manner that a reasonable jury would find justified the force she claims the officers used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Because I conclude based on the foregoing that no constitutional violation occurred, I need not proceed further on the issue of qualified immunity. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    The audio device that captured the beginning of the interaction remains off-line, but some audio can be heard at this point, which I assume was recorded by a device within Officer Gullifor's squad car.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Indeed, a claim for wrongful arrest on the facts here would presumably be barred by\n    <em>\n     Heck v. Humphrey\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n     512 U.S. 477\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n     114 S.Ct. 2364\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n     129 L.Ed.2d 383\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1994). I am not persuaded, however, that her excessive force claim is\n    <em>\n     Heck\n    </em>\n    -barred. A judgment in her favor on this claim is not necessarily incompatible with her guilty pleas, nor does it rest on factual allegations that conflict with her admissions in connection with those pleas.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     McCann v.
