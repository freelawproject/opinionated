VANCE, Chair\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    Before the Panel:\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs in fifteen of the actions listed on Schedule A pending in seven districts move under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to centralize pretrial proceedings in this litigation in the Southern District of Ohio or, alternatively, the Western District of Missouri. Plaintiffs in more than 30 actions support centralization in one or both of these districts. Plaintiffs' motion involves 53 actions pending in 21 districts, as listed on Schedule A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Panel also has been notified of 69 potentially-related actions (\"potential tag-along actions\") pending in 27 districts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Movants take the position that the MDL should not include cases involving the Bard Composix Kugel Hernia Patch (\"CK Patch\"). Defendants C.R. Bard, Inc. and Davol Inc. do not oppose centralization of litigation involving their polypropylene hernia repair products, but only if all such products (including the CK Patch) are included in centralized proceedings. Defendants suggest the District of New Jersey or the Southern District of New York or, alternatively, the Eastern District of New York, the District of Rhode Island, or the Eastern District of Louisiana as transferee district. Plaintiff in one potential tag-along action opposes inclusion of the CK Patch cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In reply, movants argue that the transferee court should determine whether the MDL should include CK Patch cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On the basis of the papers filed and hearing session held, we find that these actions involve common questions of fact, and that centralization in the Southern District of Ohio will serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and promote the just and efficient conduct of this litigation. All of the actions share common factual questions arising out of allegations that defects in defendants' polypropylene hernia mesh products can lead to complications when implanted in patients, including adhesions, damage to organs, inflammatory and allergic responses, foreign body\n   rejection, migration of the mesh, and infections. Centralization will eliminate duplicative discovery; prevent inconsistent pretrial rulings; and conserve the resources of the parties, their counsel, and the judiciary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Whether to include the CK Patch cases in centralized proceedings is a question not currently before the Panel, as none of the cases on the motion involve the CK Patch. We will address this question in due course through the conditional transfer order process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We find that the Southern District of Ohio is an appropriate transferee district. It is centrally located geographically, making it a convenient forum for this nationwide litigation. Eight actions are pending in this district, six of them before Judge Edmund A. Sargus, an experienced transferee judge who will steer these cases on a prudent course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the actions listed on Schedule A and pending outside the Southern District of Ohio are transferred to Southern District of Ohio and, with the consent of that court, assigned to the Honorable Edmund A. Sargus for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    SCHEDULE A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   MDL No. 2846 -\n   <strong>\n    IN RE: DAVOL, INC./C.R.
