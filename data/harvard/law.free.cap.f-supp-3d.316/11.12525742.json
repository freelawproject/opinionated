For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Porzecanski's motion, and the Court will grant in part and deny in part HHS's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2005, Porzecanski was diagnosed with systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS), also known as Clarkson's disease. Administrative Record (AR) 29, 124, Dkt. 22. SCLS is an \"exceedingly rare\" and life-threatening disorder, characterized by debilitating episodes in which blood and proteins shift from blood vessels into nearby body cavities and muscles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 59, 73, 124, 342-45. SCLS can be treated with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG). AR 33, 137. Porzecanski received IVIG treatment on December 16, 2014, but when he submitted a Medicare claim for the treatment, an administrative law judge denied the claim. AR 28-33. Porzecanski now challenges that denial, and he seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent HHS from continuing to deny similar claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Porzecanski sought review by the Medicare Appeals Council,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 7, but the Council did not act within 90 days. Porzecanski requested escalation to federal district court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 2-4, and filed his complaint on October 17, 2016, asserting that the administrative law judge's decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 44-51, Dkt. 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 13-14, Dkt. 15-1.

Relying on a local coverage determination, the initial contractor Novitas Solutions and the qualified independent contractor Maximus Federal Services rejected Porzecanski's claims for IVIG treatments received in November 2015, December 2015, and January 2016. Administrative law judges, however, reversed the contractors in early 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 15-2; Dkt. 15-3; Dkt. 15-4. In addition, Novitas Solutions denied Porzecanski's claim for IVIG treatment received in April 2016, but the qualified independent contractor Maximus Federal Services reversed in early 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 15-5. Also, Novitas Solutions and qualified independent contractor C2C Innovative Solutions rejected Porzecanski's claim for IVIG treatment received in April 2017, but an administrative law judge again reversed the contractors in early 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 23-1. The administrative law judges' decisions highlight the alternating-and oftentimes unclear-reasons given by contractors for denying Porzecanski's monthly claims: (a) Porzecanski lacked documentation to support his diagnosis and treatment; (b) IVIG was not medically necessary; or (c) local coverage determinations did not cover SCLS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notwithstanding\n   the contractors' purported justifications, the administrative law judges deemed Porzecanski entitled to Medicare coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 15-2 at 12; Dkt. 15-3 at 12; Dkt. 15-4 at 15; Dkt. 23-1 at 8.

Porzecanski's IVIG treatment on December 16, 2014 satisfied all requirements for coverage. IVIG is a drug or biological within the meaning of the statute because IVIG is listed in the appropriate compendia.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662544,3542546\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/226/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1395x(t)(1) (defining \"drugs and biologicals\" to include those in the United\n   State Pharmacopoeia); Dkt. 19-1 at 2-3 (listing for immune globulin in the United States Pharmacopoeia). Also, Porzecanski received the IVIG treatment incident to a physician's services as an outpatient at Georgetown University Medical Center. AR 28-29, 383-86, 389-92. And finally, the administrative law judge determined-in a finding that is conclusive on this Court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) -that Porzecanski's IVIG treatment was reasonable and necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 32 (\"The record shows persuasively that IVIG is medically reasonable and necessary for the treatment of the Beneficiary's condition\"); AR 33 (\"The evidence of medical necessity for the use of IVIG for the Beneficiary's condition was compelling and supported by the primary institute for the study and treatment of the condition-an institute of the Department of Health and Human Services.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 33 (\"[T]he denial is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   on the ground that the services were not reasonable and necessary ....\" (emphasis added) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet even though Porzecanski's IVIG treatment met all requirements for coverage, the administrative law judge denied Porzecanski's claim. That was clear error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The administrative law judge's reasoning-and the HHS arguments in this litigation-do not redeem the decision, which goes astray in four ways. First, the administrative law judge's decision relies on the wrong law. The decision imports the\n   <em>\n    Medicaid\n   </em>\n   statute's definition of a \"covered outpatient drug\" as one used for a \"medically accepted indication,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-8(k)(3), meaning \"a use that is approved by the FDA or the use of which is supported by one or more of the statutorily approved drug compendia,\" AR 30. Relying on the Medicaid definition, the decision denies coverage for Porzecanski's IVIG treatment because such a\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   is not listed in the approved compendia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 32. Needless\n   to say, the Medicaid statute does not govern coverage under Medicare Part B, which defines coverage as discussed above.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts Pers. Home Servs., Inc. v. Burwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323453\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/968/#p970\">\n    824 F.3d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 970 (10th Cir. 2016) (\"For surely one thing no agency can do is apply the wrong law to citizens who come before it, especially when the right law would appear to support the citizen and not the agency.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, when the administrative law judge's decision turns to the Medicare statute, the decision points out that Medicare Part B defines anticancer drugs to include drugs used for a \"medically accepted indication,\" but does not define\n   <em>\n    non\n   </em>\n   -anticancer drugs in the same way. AR 30 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(t)(2)(A) ). From that fact, the decision infers that non-anticancer drugs or biologicals (like IVIG treatment) \"must be prescribed for an FDA-approved\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   or the\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   must be supported [by] a listing in one of the specified drug compendia.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323453\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/968/#p970\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The definition of non-anticancer drugs, however, imposes no such requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(t)(1). Rather, the definition requires only that the drug or biological be listed in the appropriate compendia or approved by certain hospital committees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323453\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/968/#p970\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Third, the decision relies on an inapposite statutory provision to suggest that Medicare limits IVIG coverage to patients who, unlike Porzecanski, have an immune deficiency disease and receive treatment in their homes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 31 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(s)(2)(Z), 1395x(zz) ); AR 33 (\"The statute specifically covers IVIG only for the treatment of primary immune deficiency diseases.\"). But the provision cited by the administrative law judge-although it expands coverage to include in-home IVIG treatment-does not apply here. As explained above, different provisions makes clear that certain drugs or biologicals furnished in a hospital incident to a physician's professional service, such as Porzecanski's IVIG treatment at issue here, are covered when they are reasonable and necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395x(s)(2)(A), 1395x(t)(1), 1395y(a)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Fourth, the decision appears to lean on a local coverage determination promulgated by Novitas Solutions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 32 (\"[SCLS] is not one of the listed codes. The LCD instructs that all [such] codes not listed under the codes that support medical necessity will be denied.\"); AR 33 (\"[The local coverage determination] lists the only ICD-9 diagnoses codes that describe a covered primary immune deficiency disease.\"). A local coverage determination, however, is not binding on administrative law judges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.1062\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And although a local coverage determination may direct how contractors process certain billing codes, it cannot obviate the duty of administrative law judges and this Court to determine what the Medicare statute requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Faced with these missteps, HHS now argues that any errors were harmless or non-prejudicial because the administrative law judge ultimately reached the correct result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 19-21; Def.'s Reply at 1-4, Dkt. 21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[D]ue account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error.\"). In particular, HHS argues that Porzecanski's IVIG treatment was not a drug or biological within the meaning of the Medicare statute because the statutory definition of \"drug or biological\" does not include IVIG when used for treating SCLS. Def.'s Reply at 2-4. The statute, however, defines a covered drug or biological based on whether the product itself is listed in various compendia,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   whether certain\n   <em>\n    uses\n   </em>\n   of the product are listed in the compendia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(t)(1) (\"The term 'drugs' and the term 'biologicals' ... include only\n   such drugs ... and biologicals, respectively, as are included (or approved for inclusion) in the United States Pharmacopoeia ....\"). That is, a plain reading of the statute reveals that the definition encompasses listed drugs, not simply listed uses of drugs, which forecloses HHS's argument and HHS's request for\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference on this point. Furthermore, this reading does not-as HHS laments-\"lead to the absurd result that any drug listed in a compendium or approved by the hospital committee must be covered by Medicare for\n   <em>\n    any use whatsoever, even when where it has no utility\n   </em>\n   .\" Def.'s Reply at 2 n.1 (emphasis added). The distinct \"reasonable and necessary\" requirement prevents such absurdity by ensuring that Medicare does not cover pointless drugs or biologicals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(a)(1)(A). And finally, the reading offered by HHS conflicts with HHS's own instructions. The instructions clearly permit Medicare Part B to cover off-label uses of certain drugs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Medicare Benefits Policy Manual, Chapter 15, \u00a7 50.4.2, and the instructions distinguish as separate requirements the definition of drugs or biologicals from the determination of medically necessary uses,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 50 (\"[D]rugs and biologicals are covered only if all of the following requirements are met:\" (1) \"They meet the definition of drugs or biologicals\"; ... (4) \"They are reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the illness or injury for which they are administered according to accepted standards of medical practice ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Due to its errors, the administrative law judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise not in accordance with law. In particular, the decision ignores the Medicare statute and HHS's own rules, the decision is not the product of reasoned decisionmaking, and the decision does not \"articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p52\">\n    463 U.S. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p52\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).
