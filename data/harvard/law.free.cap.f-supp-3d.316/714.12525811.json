Other commenters requested that the regulations clarify that a participant or beneficiary with a mental health condition or substance use disorder have coverage for the full scope of medically appropriate services to treat the condition or disorder if the plan covers the full scope of medically appropriate services to treat medical/surgical conditions, even if some treatments or treatment settings are not otherwise covered by the plan.

The Departments also recognize that MHPAEA prohibits plans and issuers from imposing treatment limitations on mental health and substance use disorder benefits that are more restrictive than those applied to medical/surgical benefits.

Looking to the state law case of\n   <em>\n    Albert J.

In the Julianos' case, to deem the defense of medical necessity to be waived, and thereby allow the Julianos to recover without proving an essential element of their claim under the policy, would improperly expand the coverage of that policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 380-81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   The court concluded that \"Lauder's case does not raise the same concern\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   Waiver here would not create coverage where none would otherwise exist; rather, Lauder's disability is exactly the type contemplated by the policy. In support of her claim, Lauder gave First UNUM evidence in the form of a Physician's Statement and an accompanying doctor's letter. She also submitted a Release of Medical Information so that First UNUM could pursue an investigation of her disability. First UNUM, of course, chose not to do so. Therefore, what First UNUM waived by its conduct was its right to investigate; the underlying disability itself was established. By giving First UNUM all the information she had to prove her case, Lauder met her obligation under the policy. Any complaints First UNUM now has about the sufficiency of such evidence are a direct result of its decision not to investigate Lauder's claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   Because finding waiver in this case would not expand the coverage bargained for by First UNUM when it contracted with Coach, we believe Lauder's claim is distinguishable from the Julianos', and that the distinction set forth in\n   <em>\n    Albert J.

Instead, the waiver principle articulated in\n   <em>\n    AMRO Realty\n   </em>\n   , and recognized in\n   <em>\n    Juliano\n   </em>\n   , seems to us the better fit:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   [A]n insurer is deemed, as a matter of law, to have intended to waive a defense to coverage where other defenses are asserted, and where the insurer possesses sufficient knowledge (actual\n   or constructive) of the circumstances regarding the unasserted defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Amro Realty Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,]\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535282\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/936/1420/#p1431\">\n    936 F.2d at 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First UNUM was not in the position of having to imagine every conceivable basis for denying Lauder's claim; it had all her evidence of her disability before it, and could easily have evaluated that evidence to assert a lack of disability defense. In other words, such a defense was not hypothetical here. Requiring First UNUM to assert the defense would lead to exactly the type of \"meaningful dialogue[ ] between plan administrators and plan members\" that\n   <em>\n    Juliano\n   </em>\n   envisioned.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11244072\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/279/#p287\">\n    221 F.3d at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   In contrast to\n   <em>\n    Juliano\n   </em>\n   , this case raises the concern that plan administrators like First UNUM will try the easiest and least expensive means of denying a claim while holding in reserve another, perhaps stronger, defense should the first one fail. In light of ERISA's remedial purpose of protecting plan beneficiaries, we are unwilling to endorse manipulative strategies that attempt to take advantage of beneficiaries in this manner. Indeed, our point in\n   <em>\n    Juliano\n   </em>\n   was that \"candid\" statements by the insurer should be encouraged.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11244072\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/279/#p287\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   First UNUM here chose to proceed on the questionable-but cheapest-argument of lack of coverage when it could easily have investigated the merits of Lauder's claim.
